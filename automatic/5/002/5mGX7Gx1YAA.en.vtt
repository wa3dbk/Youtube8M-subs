film<00:02:10.019> initially<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:10.979> seeing<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
film initially and then seeing that and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.250 
film initially and then seeing that and
then<00:02:11.910> seeing<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.599> could<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> go<00:02:13.140> at

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
then seeing that we could have a go at

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.080 
then seeing that we could have a go at
that<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.800> was<00:02:13.920> kind<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.370> yeah<00:02:14.550> why<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:14.879> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
that it was kind of like yeah why not a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.540 
that it was kind of like yeah why not a
little<00:02:15.120> bit<00:02:15.360> scary<00:02:15.629> but<00:02:15.930> good<00:02:16.319> yeah<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.190> it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
bring it back the whole idea that it

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.000 
bring it back the whole idea that it
looks<00:02:57.420> as<00:02:57.599> opposed<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.650> looks<00:02:58.829> all<00:02:58.980> right

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
looks as opposed if it looks all right

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.650 
looks as opposed if it looks all right
than<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.340> is<00:03:01.160> yeah<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.190> think<00:03:02.400> that's<00:03:03.120> right<00:03:03.329> it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
than it is yeah I think that's right it

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.970 
than it is yeah I think that's right it
is<00:03:03.780> because<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.200> always<00:03:04.230> talk<00:03:04.650> like

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
is because you always talk like

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.030 
is because you always talk like
everything<00:03:05.489> yeah<00:03:06.329> all<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.750> kind<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.040> tiny

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
everything yeah all the kind of tiny

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.620 
everything yeah all the kind of tiny
details<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:08.850> right<00:03:09.150> but<00:03:09.329> it's<00:03:09.569> not

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
details have to be right but it's not

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.330 
details have to be right but it's not
like<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.019> here<00:03:10.230> yeah<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.100> actually

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
like that here yeah and it actually

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.319 
like that here yeah and it actually
looks<00:03:11.489> better<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:11.970> yeah<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.819> think<00:03:14.880> that's

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
looks better so yeah and I think that's

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.059 
looks better so yeah and I think that's
that's<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.930> for<00:03:16.139> us<00:03:16.170> now<00:03:16.530> we're<00:03:16.739> just<00:03:16.889> gonna

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
that's it for us now we're just gonna

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.830 
that's it for us now we're just gonna
take<00:03:17.609> everything<00:03:18.120> you've<00:03:18.239> learned<00:03:18.420> from<00:03:18.540> this

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
take everything you've learned from this

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.140 
take everything you've learned from this
applying<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.769> style<00:03:19.950> ply<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.310> technique<00:03:20.819> keep

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
applying a style ply to technique keep

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.960 
applying a style ply to technique keep
the<00:03:21.269> tradition<00:03:21.889> but<00:03:22.889> I'd<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.459> put<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.760> in

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
the tradition but I'd like to put it in

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.750 
the tradition but I'd like to put it in
as<00:03:24.329> many<00:03:24.900> different<00:03:25.500> areas<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.950> design<00:03:26.370> I

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
as many different areas of design I

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.259 
as many different areas of design I
thought<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.359> do<00:03:27.540> as<00:03:28.170> possible<00:03:28.829> but<00:03:29.760> make

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
thought I can do as possible but make

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.289 
thought I can do as possible but make
good<00:03:30.510> silence<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.319> think<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.639> important<00:03:33.090> to

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
good silence I think it's important to

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.300 
good silence I think it's important to
get<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.139> drawing<00:03:34.410> board<00:03:34.560> out<00:03:34.709> sometimes<00:03:35.100> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
get the drawing board out sometimes and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.830 
get the drawing board out sometimes and
step<00:03:35.430> away<00:03:35.549> from<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.880> computer<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.480> just

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
step away from the computer and just

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.059 
step away from the computer and just
keep<00:03:37.170> looking<00:03:37.470> reading<00:03:37.680> they've<00:03:37.769> been<00:03:37.889> saying

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
keep looking reading they've been saying

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.039 
keep looking reading they've been saying
I've<00:03:38.760> been<00:03:38.940> saying<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.359> keep<00:03:39.389> researching

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
I've been saying just keep researching

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.349 
I've been saying just keep researching
all<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.650> time<00:03:40.829> just<00:03:41.100> keep<00:03:41.250> files<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:42.060> things

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359
