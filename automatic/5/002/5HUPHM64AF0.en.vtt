but<00:03:06.180> mainly<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.629> think<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.500> most<00:03:07.620> important

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
but mainly I think the most important

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.959 
but mainly I think the most important
thing<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:09.379> just<00:03:10.549> without<00:03:11.549> speaking

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
thing is just without speaking

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.479 
thing is just without speaking
specifically<00:03:12.689> when<00:03:13.469> I<00:03:13.709> would<00:03:13.980> look<00:03:14.099> at<00:03:14.280> other

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
specifically when I would look at other

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.819 
specifically when I would look at other
organizations<00:03:14.669> and<00:03:15.389> they<00:03:15.449> were<00:03:15.509> so<00:03:15.720> close

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
organizations and they were so close

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.309 
organizations and they were so close
you<00:03:17.430> began<00:03:17.759> to<00:03:17.939> think<00:03:17.970> might<00:03:18.569> not<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:19.019> one

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
you began to think might not have one

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.189 
you began to think might not have one
administration<00:03:19.979> and<00:03:20.479> then<00:03:21.479> better<00:03:21.720> utilize

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
administration and then better utilize

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.439 
administration and then better utilize
people<00:03:22.650> who<00:03:22.769> work<00:03:22.979> and<00:03:23.280> there<00:03:23.909> are<00:03:24.000> people<00:03:24.120> who

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
people who work and there are people who

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.379 
people who work and there are people who
need<00:03:24.599> jobs<00:03:24.659> and<00:03:25.379> there<00:03:26.220> are<00:03:26.340> specialists<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.299> a

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
need jobs and there are specialists in a

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.349 
need jobs and there are specialists in a
field<00:03:27.659> so<00:03:28.290> why<00:03:28.439> not<00:03:28.650> utilize<00:03:28.949> them<00:03:29.579> at<00:03:29.759> both

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
field so why not utilize them at both

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.280 
field so why not utilize them at both
facilities<00:03:31.129> for<00:03:32.129> greater<00:03:32.459> benefit<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.479> the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290
