the debate is ongoing about which
fundamental<00:00:04.529> technique<00:00:04.890> in<00:00:05.009> parkour<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
fundamental technique in parkour is the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.880 
fundamental technique in parkour is the
most<00:00:05.819> difficult<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.420> learn<00:00:06.569> from<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.470> convo

most difficult to learn from the convo

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.370 
most difficult to learn from the convo
to<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> role<00:00:08.340> each<00:00:08.870> technique<00:00:09.870> presents<00:00:10.260> its

to the role each technique presents its

to the role each technique presents its
own<00:00:10.500> unique<00:00:10.679> challenge<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.540> want<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.599> add<00:00:12.719> one

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.320 
own unique challenge I want to add one
more<00:00:13.139> technique<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.920> list<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
more technique to that list it's a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.000 
more technique to that list it's a
technique<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.870> feel<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.139> monumentally
