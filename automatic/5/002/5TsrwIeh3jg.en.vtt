like it
ceramic<00:01:29.990> flakes<00:01:30.290> one<00:01:31.040> of<00:01:31.160> them<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.460> chipped<00:01:31.820> at

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
ceramic flakes one of them is chipped at

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.880 
ceramic flakes one of them is chipped at
the<00:01:32.090> cornets<00:01:32.540> which<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.140> why<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.410> don't<00:01:33.620> use<00:01:33.860> it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
the cornets which is why I don't use it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.730 
the cornets which is why I don't use it
on<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.160> regular<00:01:34.610> basis<00:01:35.090> I<00:01:38.140> had<00:01:39.140> already<00:01:39.260> started

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
on a regular basis I had already started

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.520 
on a regular basis I had already started
breaking<00:01:40.700> out<00:01:40.820> sections<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.170> these<00:01:42.350> are

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
breaking out sections so these are

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.010 
breaking out sections so these are
sections<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:43.310> had<00:01:43.580> straightened<00:01:44.240> before

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
sections that I had straightened before

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.440 
sections that I had straightened before
I<00:01:45.050> came<00:01:45.440> from<00:01:45.590> Cameron<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:49.280> they<00:01:50.210> have

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
I came from Cameron and they have

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.120 
I came from Cameron and they have
already<00:01:50.600> started<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:51.200> rigor<00:01:51.620> it<00:01:56.680> I'll<00:01:57.680> just<00:01:57.710> go

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
already started to rigor it I'll just go

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:07.930 
already started to rigor it I'll just go
through<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:07.100> way<00:02:07.220> I've<00:02:07.369> straighten<00:02:07.790> my<00:02:07.910> hair

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
through the way I've straighten my hair

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:16.150 
through the way I've straighten my hair
is<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.240> holding<00:02:08.660> point<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:14.530> take<00:02:15.530> my<00:02:15.709> room<00:02:15.920> left

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
is a holding point I take my room left

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.840 
is a holding point I take my room left
face<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:16.580> perpendicular<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.300> my<00:02:17.540> skull

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
face it's perpendicular to my skull

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.180 
face it's perpendicular to my skull
she's<00:02:19.850> behind<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.330> section<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.810> hair<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.350> guess

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
she's behind the section of hair I guess

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.830 
she's behind the section of hair I guess
it<00:02:22.340> would<00:02:22.490> help<00:02:22.640> if<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.000> helped<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:26.420> based<00:02:26.690> in

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
it would help if I helped it's based in

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:40.700 
it would help if I helped it's based in
the<00:02:26.959> right<00:02:27.170> way

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:03:01.730 

I<00:02:56.000> hold<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.150> to<00:03:00.020> you'll<00:03:01.020> notice<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.530> there's

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
I hold it to you'll notice that there's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.430 
I hold it to you'll notice that there's
a<00:03:01.800> bit<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.010> space<00:03:02.370> over<00:03:02.700> there<00:03:03.260> sometimes<00:03:04.260> I

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
a bit of space over there sometimes I

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.100 
a bit of space over there sometimes I
ignore<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:04.830> sometimes<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.210> place<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
ignore it sometimes like I place the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.320 
ignore it sometimes like I place the
hair<00:03:07.290> right<00:03:07.470> there<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.610> doesn't<00:03:09.120> make

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
hair right there but this doesn't make

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:21.110 
hair right there but this doesn't make
much<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.840> difference<00:03:09.990> really<00:03:19.550> so<00:03:20.550> it's<00:03:20.880> just

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
much of a difference really so it's just

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:33.020 
much of a difference really so it's just
less<00:03:25.250> reporters<00:03:31.130> when<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.160> see<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.640> usually

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
less reporters when I see that I usually

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:43.160 
less reporters when I see that I usually
said<00:03:33.270> my<00:03:33.480> hair<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.600> measure<00:03:42.810> another

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170
