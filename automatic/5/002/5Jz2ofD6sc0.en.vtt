00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.120 

to<00:00:43.810> look<00:00:44.020> at<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.230> technical<00:00:44.680> perspective

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
to look at the technical perspective

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.100 
to look at the technical perspective
what<00:00:45.940> actually<00:00:46.239> happens<00:00:46.630> when<00:00:46.810> we<00:00:46.900> start

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
what actually happens when we start

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.720 
what actually happens when we start
playing<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.530> music<00:00:47.560> is<00:00:48.040> first<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.460> all<00:00:48.520> we

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
playing the music is first of all we

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.110 
playing the music is first of all we
have<00:00:48.880> to<00:00:49.120> capture<00:00:49.630> the<00:00:50.050> music<00:00:50.470> take<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.430> sound

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
have to capture the music take the sound

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.330 
have to capture the music take the sound
waves<00:00:52.390> into<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:52.989> robot<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:53.500> analyze<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.160> and

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
waves into the robot and analyze it and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.520 
waves into the robot and analyze it and
get<00:00:54.640> out<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:54.910> beat<00:00:55.090> from<00:00:55.300> that<00:00:55.450> when<00:00:56.290> we<00:00:56.380> have

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
get out the beat from that when we have

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.850 
get out the beat from that when we have
the<00:00:56.649> beat<00:00:56.829> then<00:00:57.520> we<00:00:57.670> have<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.180> select<00:00:59.140> a<00:00:59.559> move

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
the beat then we have to select a move

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.729 
the beat then we have to select a move
and<00:01:00.100> change<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.329> move<00:01:01.570> accordingly<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.559> the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
and change that move accordingly to the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.009 
and change that move accordingly to the
beats<00:01:02.950> so<00:01:03.370> it's<00:01:03.550> actually<00:01:04.149> going<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.449> move<00:01:04.719> in

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
beats so it's actually going to move in

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:25.129 
beats so it's actually going to move in
sync

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.379 

the<00:01:26.139> counterweight<00:01:26.880> function<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.119> whatever

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389 
the counterweight function to whatever

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:32.279 
the counterweight function to whatever
it's<00:01:28.749> there's<00:01:28.990> like<00:01:29.139> arms<00:01:29.560> like<00:01:29.859> doing<00:01:31.289> them

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
it's there's like arms like doing them

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:51.460 
it's there's like arms like doing them
don't<00:01:32.619> matter<00:01:41.639> seconds

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.990 

yeah

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.810 

Takeo<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.230> by<00:02:01.560> domestic

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
Takeo and by domestic

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:12.809 
Takeo and by domestic
yes<00:02:04.820> thrown

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:30.020 

because<00:02:13.819> he<00:02:13.910> killed

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.390 

it's<00:02:31.030> been<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.330> very<00:02:31.540> iterative<00:02:32.110> process<00:02:32.400> to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
it's been a very iterative process to

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.570 
it's been a very iterative process to
join<00:02:33.790> make<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.150> balanced<00:02:34.569> fairly<00:02:35.349> smoothly<00:02:35.650> so

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
join make it balanced fairly smoothly so

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.420 
join make it balanced fairly smoothly so
that<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.970> still<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.900> challenge<00:02:38.890> because<00:02:39.310> we

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
that is still a challenge because we

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.180 
that is still a challenge because we
haven't<00:02:39.760> put<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.690> arms<00:02:41.019> or<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.319> head<00:02:41.680> on<00:02:42.010> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
haven't put the arms or the head on the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.670 
haven't put the arms or the head on the
robot<00:02:42.519> yet<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.510> balance<00:02:43.870> bill<00:02:44.140> needs<00:02:44.500> to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
robot yet and the balance bill needs to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.400 
robot yet and the balance bill needs to
take<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.700> into<00:02:45.940> consideration<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.959> other

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
take that into consideration and other

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.350 
take that into consideration and other
than<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.739> it's<00:02:48.040> integration<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.060> always

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
than that it's integration it is always

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.240 
than that it's integration it is always
harder<00:02:49.720> try<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.349> make<00:02:50.590> things<00:02:50.799> work<00:02:50.980> together

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
harder try to make things work together

00:02:51.250 --> 00:04:10.170 
harder try to make things work together
than<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.670> think

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.180 

Wow
