00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.600 
especially that I know they're not
really<00:02:00.930> looking<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.560> rating<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
really looking for this rating but the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.840 
really looking for this rating but the
18<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.299> 20<00:02:03.630> something<00:02:04.170> reading<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.430> very

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
18 to 20 something reading is very

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.940 
18 to 20 something reading is very
important<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.390> most<00:02:06.570> networks<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.680> think

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
important for most networks and I think

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.229 
important for most networks and I think
they're<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.849> rating

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
they're going to get more of that rating

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.479 
they're going to get more of that rating
with<00:02:09.689> young<00:02:10.019> justice<00:02:10.439> because<00:02:10.709> more<00:02:11.129> older

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
with young justice because more older

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.540 
with young justice because more older
groups<00:02:11.790> watch<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.800> he<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:14.400> other

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
groups watch it then and he there other

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.090 
groups watch it then and he there other
shows<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.540> they're<00:02:16.530> pretty<00:02:16.770> soon

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
shows so they're pretty soon

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.680

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
show and I just think it's such a stupid

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.730 
show and I just think it's such a stupid
move<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.720> they<00:02:33.840> keep<00:02:34.080> putting<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.470> hiatus

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
move that they keep putting on hiatus

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.710 
move that they keep putting on hiatus
because<00:02:35.430> no<00:02:35.730> one's<00:02:35.910> gonna<00:02:36.060> watch<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.510> was
