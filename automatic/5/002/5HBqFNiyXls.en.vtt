shoots anyways let's demonstrate this to
have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> better<00:01:45.570> idea<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.290> talking<00:01:46.649> about

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
have a better idea for I'm talking about

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.789 
have a better idea for I'm talking about

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
goes or if I get them at all my accuracy

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.680 
goes or if I get them at all my accuracy
is<00:02:10.679> really<00:02:11.009> bad<00:02:11.160> I'm<00:02:11.430> not<00:02:11.550> really<00:02:11.700> too<00:02:11.940> good<00:02:11.970> at

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690
