00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
part-2 okay our next area of interest if

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.879 
part-2 okay our next area of interest if
you<00:00:09.420> want<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.690> call<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.559> type<00:00:10.860> of

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
you want to call it that in this type of

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.629 
you want to call it that in this type of
amplifier<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.150> preamp<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.280> what<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.429> want

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
amplifier is the preamp and what we want

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.740 
amplifier is the preamp and what we want
to<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:15.320> is<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:17.060> look<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.330> guy

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
to do is to look at this guy

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.380 
to do is to look at this guy
this<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.380> first<00:00:19.710> coupling<00:00:20.220> cap<00:00:20.460> between

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this is the first coupling cap between

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.050 
this is the first coupling cap between
the<00:00:22.260> stages<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:24.090> amplifier<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.500> there's<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
the stages of the amplifier so there's a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.570 
the stages of the amplifier so there's a
initial<00:00:27.060> gain<00:00:27.269> stage<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.869> brings<00:00:28.580> brings

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
initial gain stage that brings brings

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
initial gain stage that brings brings
the<00:00:29.789> amp<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.269> line<00:00:30.480> level<00:00:30.720> coming<00:00:31.529> right

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the amp up to line level coming right

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.400 
the amp up to line level coming right
off<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.040> input<00:00:32.369> jack<00:00:32.480> I<00:00:33.480> believe<00:00:34.170> there's<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
off the input jack I believe there's a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.860 
off the input jack I believe there's a
volume<00:00:34.620> control<00:00:34.829> after<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.570> set<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
volume control after that and a set of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.260 
volume control after that and a set of
tone<00:00:37.110> controls<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.850> squirts

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
tone controls and then it squirts

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.540 
tone controls and then it squirts
through<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.750> rather<00:00:40.620> large<00:00:40.980> point<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:41.989> cap

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
through this rather large point one cap

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.650 
through this rather large point one cap
and<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> next<00:00:45.270> stage<00:00:45.620> what<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
and to the next stage what you can do is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.040 
and to the next stage what you can do is
take<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:49.129> different<00:00:50.129> value<00:00:50.340> cap<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.809> cape

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
take a different value cap in this cape

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
take a different value cap in this cape
case<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:53.219> probably<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> look<00:00:53.850> at

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
case I'm probably going to look at

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
case I'm probably going to look at
something<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> point<00:00:54.750> zero<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:56.340> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
something like a point zero one which is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.650 
something like a point zero one which is
a<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.850> smaller<00:00:58.520> value<00:00:59.520> ten<00:01:00.000> times<00:01:00.300> smaller

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
a much smaller value ten times smaller

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.280 
a much smaller value ten times smaller
than<00:01:01.039> what<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.329> originally<00:01:03.329> there<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.719> that's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
than what is originally there and that's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.399 
than what is originally there and that's
going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> roll<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.250> fair<00:01:05.760> amount<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
going to roll out a fair amount of that

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.800 
going to roll out a fair amount of that
base<00:01:07.610> fluffiness<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:09.180> heard<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.250> without

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
base fluffiness we heard and without

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.350 
base fluffiness we heard and without
without<00:01:12.810> necessarily<00:01:13.729> removing<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.119> rich

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
without necessarily removing the rich

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
without necessarily removing the rich
base<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.009> kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.340> cool<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.729> this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
base that that is kind of cool with this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.510 
base that that is kind of cool with this
amp<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.740> that's<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> next<00:01:20.369> thing

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
amp so that's going to be the next thing

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.740 
amp so that's going to be the next thing
we're<00:01:20.640> gonna<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.060> got<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> soldering<00:01:21.630> iron

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
we're gonna do we got the soldering iron

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
we're gonna do we got the soldering iron
warmed<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.979> amps<00:01:23.189> already<00:01:23.490> turned<00:01:23.670> off

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
warmed up the amps already turned off

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.020 
warmed up the amps already turned off
and<00:01:24.119> discharged<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.500> okay<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.820> can

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and discharged and okay so as you can

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
and discharged and okay so as you can
see<00:01:27.210> we've<00:01:27.390> made<00:01:27.420> our<00:01:27.720> change<00:01:28.020> we've<00:01:28.259> removed

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
see we've made our change we've removed

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.830 
see we've made our change we've removed

farad's you can also choose other values
like<00:01:48.810> 0.02<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.530> also<00:01:52.680> go<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.220> way

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
like 0.02 you can also go out your way

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880 
like 0.02 you can also go out your way
to<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.790> fancy<00:01:54.570> mustard<00:01:54.930> caps<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.649> whatever

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
to get fancy mustard caps or whatever

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.389 
to get fancy mustard caps or whatever
you<00:01:55.979> want<00:01:56.689> generally<00:01:57.689> speaking<00:01:58.399> just

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you want generally speaking just

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.850 
you want generally speaking just
changing<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.090> cap<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.719> an<00:02:00.899> amp<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.560> going

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
changing one cap in an amp is not going

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.319 
changing one cap in an amp is not going
to<00:02:01.920> make<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> huge<00:02:02.399> difference<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> tone<00:02:03.299> of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
to make a huge difference to the tone of

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.800 
to make a huge difference to the tone of
it<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.619> don't<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:06.000> too<00:02:06.060> crazy<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it so you don't have to go too crazy you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
it so you don't have to go too crazy you
do<00:02:07.409> want<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.649> make<00:02:07.799> sure<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.340> value<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
do want to make sure the value of the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.430 
do want to make sure the value of the
cap<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> 400<00:02:10.379> volt<00:02:10.619> rating<00:02:11.009> and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.380 

that's<00:02:13.620> about<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.610> we've<00:02:14.760> only<00:02:14.880> changed

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that's about it so we've only changed

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.010 
that's about it so we've only changed
that<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.940> interstage<00:02:17.940> cap<00:02:18.270> between<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
some bottom and over here we have

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.310 
some bottom and over here we have
removed<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:26.000> cap<00:02:27.000> presetting<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.810> presents<00:02:28.200> to
