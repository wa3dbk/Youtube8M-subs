 no problem, everything is child friendly 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.579

 pretty spot 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.480
 then we had another look at the Mediascape 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.810
 and Mediascape lists the summary of music photos and 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.019
 Videos on the x10 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.769
 below and this is a special Mix League Play Now 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.150
 this is not a service from Sony Ericsson where you get the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.909

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:25.679
 would be displayed here and and it could be 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.679
 come for sure 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.879
 then the videos here I have a video now 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.139
 on our opening credits 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.369
 Muniz briefly play Mainz to see how it looks like 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.009
 By the foot nice step further comes from doing something the video can do 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:51.209
 Send the same today that is not a problem here is well solved 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.250
 Of course, video works and Lex plays it 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.569
 Process fast enough 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.909
 And of course you can easily tremp the videos so you can ever 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.469
 more landscape mode 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.469
 Looking at it more beautifully can freak out the whole screen 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.620
 there are the photos 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.620
 I also took a picture of it now 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.229

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.630
 we see here 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.680
 but it would be nice solved you can look at the excellent 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.460
 whoever like me this will be the pictures unlikely m not swept 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.520
 Climbing must be downloaded per tonne new except for you 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.520
 forcing large pepe data traffic can result 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.749
 Just give us a call on the phone application 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.039
 if you want to call somebody 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.490
 this gives the world a number except tours is a bit that 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.060
 Problem that does not appear, we type what contact is meant 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:16.199
 could 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.270
 from other devices, for example, announces that if you are the first 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.490
 Entered Parsifal 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.039
 which then appears compact to feed and yes if then the contact list 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.069
 I can fully access contacts again 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.870
 Although games on Malku the shoe where the foals have already seen 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.920
 and I can not go back to normal of the Circus crown 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.129
 If I just kicked the mobile now I could call him 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:41.770
 "Not on your knees" Mail 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.059
 necessary with a click 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.520
 write vigorously in a new level 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.460

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.960
 yours to new FC St when I'm on 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.520
 an SMS clicks European Office for free 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.450
 that looks a bit different from Atlantis interface that's too bad 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.839
 Here we see the keyboard 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.259
 is not the original 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.349
 and return to do but range from Sony Ericsson 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.569
 Bosses also have gas through gas so for example the x10 may have that 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.949
 Chapeau 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.180
 thereby 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.320
 These almost 2 from Sony Ericsson below fit the walk in the case 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.590
 Input field to jump to the right place and come for example one 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.680
