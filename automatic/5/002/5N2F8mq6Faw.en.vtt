00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.920
 and or the charles bronson here with one more 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.230
 video of the dogma dragon game and in that 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.970
 video I'll show my battle 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:25.570
 against the dragon is the main enemy of 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.419
 this is game is the first part of 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:33.430
 battle that is a rather long battle 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:36.190
 but very cool right now the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.320
 what is happening is the following me 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.350
 I got to the dragon. 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.860
 I 'm talking to the dragon 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.090
 dragon brings a person I had 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.650
 affinity 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.780
 during the game and this old bald man 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.790
 mustache you are seeing was the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.739
 inpc that I helped during the game and such 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.270
 and I have created a certain affinity with it 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.659
 during the dragon game rate he does is 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.450
 this place is kind to his house 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.050
 dragon house and this asks you to 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.930
 make a choice 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.100
 He asks you to stay on the side. 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:22.570
 of humanity or fight against it 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.940
 I chose to face the dragon as you do. 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.630
 You'll be able to see I'll let you take a 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.630
 little of kode5 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:39.010
 angels have my way and now is the time 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.980
 of the decision 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.550
 the graphics very cool dragons very well 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.550
 done 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.570
 and he's nervous so I'm playing 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.670
 platini was the class I liked the most 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.619
 of the great game 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.619
 I found a very good class and I 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.530
 really recommends to anyone who wants a 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.700
 class speakers and ada mystic night 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.700
 great class 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:40.030
 now is the time of choice i can 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.090
 simply save the old person there 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.580
 that I have affinity to finish the game 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.580
 that's where I can face the dragon 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:58.510
 obvious that facing the dragon can stop 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:02.350
 here and can save the old although 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.640
 You may want to walk 10 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.640
 Dragon, how will I do it? 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:17.920
 me and you giving up the dragon 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:25.300
 You start the battle was more battle. 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:33.150
 choose the game or not to play 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:33.150
 start the fight in the indexes urges Israel 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.550
 xavier will start the fight 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.530
 This was the first time I played 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.800
 against him he did not know what to do but I 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.950
 I'll tell you what it takes to be 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.950
 done 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:01.760
 the first thing is you run from him 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.760
 Show 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.030
 begins to destroy everything 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.250
 I thought I should attack but my 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.030
 friends running then you need to run 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.500
 run 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.269
 the scenery will be falling 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.820
 No problem, do not look back. 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.810
 if he's coming after you 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.419
 business is just run come in that hall 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.960
 who's going to come after you want a scene well 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.960
 cool 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.050
 just run from him 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.349
 is in the hallway you have 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:01.789
 chance against attack 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:06.199
 You can hit him in the head. 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:09.830
 I'm doing it but when it solves it. 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.780
 hospi people you better run I did 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.419
 wrong here hitting and I know it's 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.970
 able to defend as an excuse was not 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.490
 well so I lost a lot of light 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:24.969
 I'll show you you need 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:28.009
 do when he was one of the people 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:31.900
 has this track the scene back there 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.900
 you come and hide 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.470
 to hit 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.409
 total charge but it does not happen but it 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.210
 breaks the scene and keeps coming back 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.699
 from you 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.780
 I do not know how he got it right anymore. 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:57.740
 sometimes but it is not a good idea either. 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:02.150
 business is run is not worth hit 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:05.090
 because it is not the hour yet that gives 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.969
 behind it can see the size 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.810
 his is giant 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:16.460
 I already said the business is running is not 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:20.379
 time to fight it opened there in the 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.379
 Front it will fly away now 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.550
 O 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:33.440
 now it came out the idea of â€‹â€‹the cave of 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:38.630
 new domains you need 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:44.000
 chase it and this is it personal 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:45.800
 this is the end of the first part and not 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.030
 it fails to follow the second part of 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.820
 battle that is very cool and that's it 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.720
 until the next video until the next part 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.720
 ii
