what we're doing is we've got the UH the
black<00:04:20.120> buzzer<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.750> we're<00:04:21.230> using<00:04:21.380> indicators

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
black buzzer and we're using indicators

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.880 
black buzzer and we're using indicators
you're<00:04:22.669> not<00:04:22.790> allowed<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.350> fish<00:04:24.350> more<00:04:24.590> than<00:04:24.740> one

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
you're not allowed to fish more than one

you're not allowed to fish more than one
fly<00:04:25.180> any<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.390> these<00:04:26.510> waters<00:04:28.450> otherwise<00:04:29.450> we'd

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
fly any of these waters otherwise we'd

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.330 
fly any of these waters otherwise we'd
have<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.840> dry<00:04:30.020> fly<00:04:30.290> on<00:04:30.530> a<00:04:30.560> dropper<00:04:30.860> as<00:04:31.160> an

have a dry fly on a dropper as an

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.340 
have a dry fly on a dropper as an
indicator<00:04:31.730> and<00:04:32.090> then<00:04:32.650> further<00:04:33.650> down<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:35.350> have

the<00:04:36.470> buzzer<00:04:36.680> hanging<00:04:37.100> underneath<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:37.820> we're

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
the buzzer hanging underneath so we're

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.430 
the buzzer hanging underneath so we're
using<00:04:38.150> indicators<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.990> hold<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.260> flight

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
using indicators to hold the flight

using indicators to hold the flight
state<00:04:39.740> steady<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:40.580> stationary<00:04:41.090> which<00:04:41.690> is<00:04:41.810> the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
state steady and stationary which is the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.340 
state steady and stationary which is the

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
best way to fishing buzzer and about

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.260 
best way to fishing buzzer and about
three<00:04:45.650> feet<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.160> we've<00:04:46.610> just<00:04:46.640> been<00:04:46.970> hauling

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
them in like crazy for some reason

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.730 
them in like crazy for some reason
though<00:04:50.060> only<00:04:50.330> over<00:04:50.810> there<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.200> spot<00:04:51.500> here

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
though only over there this spot here

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.430 
though only over there this spot here
although<00:04:52.190> it's<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.520> nicest<00:04:53.020> swim<00:04:54.020> in<00:04:54.230> terms

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
although it's the nicest swim in terms

although it's the nicest swim in terms
of<00:04:54.590> being<00:04:54.770> pretty<00:04:54.980> for<00:04:55.970> some<00:04:56.120> reason<00:04:56.390> it

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
of being pretty for some reason it

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.020 
of being pretty for some reason it
wasn't<00:04:56.630> producing<00:04:57.200> but<00:04:57.650> down<00:04:57.890> there<00:04:58.130> loads<00:04:58.850> of

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
wasn't producing but down there loads of
