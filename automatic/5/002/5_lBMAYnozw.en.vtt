00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.130 
all the way so I can get away really
quick<00:02:01.969> um<00:02:02.969> that's<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> use<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
quick um that's all I use with that and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.770 
quick um that's all I use with that and
then<00:02:04.579> too<00:02:05.579> many<00:02:05.790> items<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> other<00:02:06.689> thing

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
then too many items is the other thing

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.080 
then too many items is the other thing
that<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.140> use<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.489> don't<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:08.819> use<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
that I use but I don't really use that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.490 
that I use but I don't really use that
during<00:02:09.509> griefing<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.080> most<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
during griefing because most of the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800 
during griefing because most of the
servers<00:02:10.830> block<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.280> unless<00:02:11.520> you're<00:02:11.730> an<00:02:11.790> admin

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
servers block it unless you're an admin

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.440 
servers block it unless you're an admin
so<00:02:13.590> yeah<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.250> guess<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:14.819> all<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> really<00:02:15.300> have

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so yeah I guess that's all I really have

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.280 
so yeah I guess that's all I really have
to<00:02:15.840> show<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.290> um<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.599> can't<00:02:18.599> really<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:18.989> if<00:02:19.170> i

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
to show you um I can't really think if i

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.550 
to show you um I can't really think if i
use<00:02:19.470> any<00:02:19.650> other<00:02:19.800> mods<00:02:20.160> i<00:02:20.870> don't<00:02:21.870> think<00:02:21.930> i<00:02:22.230> do<00:02:22.290> at

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
