00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.300
 In this video we will see how to prepare a cake that does not need an oven 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.480
 and that will carry a crunchy layer of biscuit, 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.260
 chocolate cream and cheese ... 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.020
 and finally a chocolate bath ... 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.020
 that is, an authentic delight 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.040
 We start by melting the chocolate 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.440
 We are going to use milk chocolate and dark chocolate 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.440
 We can melt it in a bain-marie 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.820
 or in the microwave 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.820
 Today we are going to do it in the microwave 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.820
 we will do it in 30 second intervals 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.520
 We will put average power: about 650-700 Watts 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.020
 We give you 30 seconds ... remove 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.060
 we mix ... we give it another 30 seconds 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.360
 and so on until we have it melted 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.840
 Here I would be 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 Now let's melt the butter 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.860
 with 30 seconds is enough, we mix and reserve 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 The next step is to crush the cookies 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.440
 We can do it with high tumbler shredder 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.120
 and but with the traditional system: a bag and a roller 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.820
 We use "digestive" integral crackers 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 If you use the classic cookies Mary 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.900
 we would use double the butter because they are drier 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.840
 Pour the butter over the cookies and mix 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.500
 Now on the mold pour the cookies 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.560
 we press doing a uniform layer 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.480
 we can use baking paper to remove later ... 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 or do it directly on the mold 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 We cover all the pores well 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 and let it cool in the refrigerator 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.480
 Now let's prepare the chocolate cream: 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.640
 we toss in a bowl the cream cheese, 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 the sugar and we mix 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 It is not necessary to mix too much 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.020
 with which sugar is integrated is sufficient 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.140
 We are going to reserve a part of the chocolate for later ... 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 with a quarter is enough 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.640
 And now in the rest of the chocolate that is already tempered 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.820
 we are incorporating cheese cream 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300
 we will do it in portions so that it does not make lumps 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.420
 We will be throwing cheese in the chocolate and mixing 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.480
 until with the two ingredients we get this cream 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.800
 We remove the mold from the fridge, 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.080
 pour the cream and we distribute it 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.660
 we make a uniform layer that is very smooth 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.100
 we clean the edges and if it's hot we reserve it in the fridge 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.140
 Now let's melt the white chocolate 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.140
 It's a more delicate chocolate, so, 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.140
 or we do it in a water bath, 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.620
 or in the microwave at intervals of 10-15 seconds 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.120
 We heat the chocolate that we had reserved with a spoonful of butter 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.240
 until we are all well fused 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.660
 Now we pour it on the cake ... 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.900
 we are turning the mold so that it is distributed ... 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.820
 and with the help of a spoon we can adjust the edges 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.640
 and with some lateral movements we settle the chocolate 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.960
 In a pastry bag with a small mouthpiece or in a bag ... 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.560
 we throw the white chocolate, 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.480
 with him we are going to make some stripes 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.220
 with a separation of about 2-3 centimeters 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.460
 With a toothpick or toothpick 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.080
 we traversed the lines of white chocolate from one side to the other, 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.260
 first in a sense 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.060
 and then in the opposite direction 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.480
 This way we have the cake with a very cool decoration ... 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.180
 We will let cool in the refrigerator 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.520
 two or three hours before delmoldar 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.260
 Once it's cold, we let go carefully 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.720
 and we turn to the side 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.520
 if we see that we are stuck to the edges 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.100
 with a knife dipped in hot water we go over the curb 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.260
 On the base of the mold we have put baking paper 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.980
 this will allow us to release the cake 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.100
 from the base of the mold 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.660
 and place it in another source 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.700
 To do this we carefully raise and place it in the source 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.240
 Next and with care 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.880
 we are pulling the paper back 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.140
 and on the bottom 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.660
 If we do not put baking paper 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.460
 we would serve it directly at the base of the mold 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520
 And so we would stay ... 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.800
 It is an easy and quick cake to make 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.680
 It is ideal for when you have guests 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.500
 since you can leave it ready the day before 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.180
 This has been all 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.520
 I encourage you to try it, it is exquisite 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.740
 If you liked the video, I invite you to share it 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.500
 and hit the "like" 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.160
 A greeting. See you at the next one ;-)
