00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Friday 8 October as equal in points, we hope that the year was successful 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.569
 for the second album the press show is forever with it 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.200
 Universe second we want to go through to plant and I first have that one 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.289
 stands on the podium 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.859
 and I have been a transition for a long time, an inflammation of my voice, otherwise I can 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.039
 you make proposals 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.929
 how it can and may drive in a panic job 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.119
 and have to go out and you can find that christa is natural 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.149
 and it all went very well for me and so I am very happy about it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.970
 it was very difficult to find a title as a successor to the job 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.490
 actually not and we have entries for Polish media it is not in 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.409
 this program made and 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.810
 forever is the 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.000
 actually and something that falls after half an hour 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 years from the moment that I start to sing I am so along with the song 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.740
 I always get this was temporarily identical to all of us before 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.730
 always those are it was a very busy period in recent years flanders 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.439
 music country 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.160
 radio 2 summer hit the flemish 10 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.240
 ment tv really had everything yes i still had about fifty acres of everything 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.690
 done what that an artist 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.640
 and i can do 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.990
 I am also very happy about a train 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.530
 through all those programs that I also gained a lot of experience with an aed 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.760
 learn to handle different techniques 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 yes you hear and look forward to it 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.840
 interest in this album 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.429
 the twelve numbers that exist in the church 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.350
 he twelve needs new numbers and 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.960
 I am also a profit for the consumer to set up a new single this summer 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.240
 because of the number of outstanding shares 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.820
 and and oh well we had no alternative all in all and we put it 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.610
 had the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.790
 the of something solid should offer nothing and that are twelve beautiful ones 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.790
 become numbers 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.349
 perhaps a surprising drummer is with the brand 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.189
 the man who is lovely and thereby there is only one power and while the church 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.609
 not known the downside 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.439
 the internet and a look we are going to incorporate two that law 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.599
 15,000 is really worth getting the cities to target the stick and bram vanity fair 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.209
 but simply because they were, however, a very special voice 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.149
 brewmaster and more boy stand 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.159
 nintendo has 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.839
 more dark heavy standing 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.249
 and wonder above the sky above wonder finds could vote only then also very well 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.080
 together 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.660
 and it is I am very happy that that titulaer has enormous added value 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.979
 yes sir work together for a long time 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.979
 the high Council 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.179
 by a 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.009
 9 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.009
 Mr. 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.669
 one of the cut pieces can be traced by the media and 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.769
 every time i get it now it's time for them 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.620
 m the tibetans i don't know why 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.370
 a young man initially to do that the law says no so we 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.709
 and we see a cloth of steel fibers 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.959
 the property was also so they let the song broadcast in the studio that i was 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 secretly hoped 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.959
 that will make a mistake that I have to send again and again 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.559
 he will shorten that again and 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:31.279
 the set is it is quite an honor disease have more time opening numbers never again 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.770
 the same board a new single 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.539
 and written by mama ja 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.169
 and my mom made is not fair this time part of the team 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.999
 and then one finds state and has not had a story for years, so another one 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.179
 very nice stories 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:48.059
 and yes they were actually I see something else I say but why does he go 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:51.099
 you should not try to make a text sieve that done 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.479
 immediately afterwards focus on being thrown and it is being focused 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:57.290
 de and it is that it is also possible that the two become new single
