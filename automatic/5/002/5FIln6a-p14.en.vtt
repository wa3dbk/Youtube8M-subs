this<00:01:30.040> does<00:01:30.370> have<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:31.260> control<00:01:32.550> out<00:01:33.660> which

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
this does have the control out which

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.550 
this does have the control out which
basically<00:01:35.230> is<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.710> servo<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.080> can<00:01:38.230> make

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
basically is a servo that you can make

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.220 
basically is a servo that you can make
your<00:01:38.710> adjustments<00:01:39.340> here<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:40.600> allows<00:01:40.870> you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
your adjustments here that allows you

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.760 
your adjustments here that allows you
that<00:01:41.530> will<00:01:42.070> engage<00:01:42.400> how<00:01:42.970> quickly<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:44.350> arm

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
that will engage how quickly this arm

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.580 
that will engage how quickly this arm
will<00:01:44.980> come<00:01:45.190> back<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.540> can<00:01:46.870> hear<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.170> servo

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
will come back so you can hear the servo

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.440 
will come back so you can hear the servo
right<00:01:47.620> now<00:01:47.950> if<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.250> pull<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.610> whoops<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:49.390> know

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
right now if I pull it whoops you know

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.500 
right now if I pull it whoops you know
do<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:51.310> can<00:01:51.490> hear<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.700> servo<00:01:52.060> as<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.300> pull

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
do that you can hear the servo as I pull

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.030 
do that you can hear the servo as I pull
it<00:01:52.600> that's<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.050> slow<00:01:53.320> adjustment<00:01:53.890> right

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
it that's the slow adjustment right

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.420 
it that's the slow adjustment right
there<00:01:55.290> okay<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:57.270> B<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.450> faster

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
there okay and B is faster

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.830 
there okay and B is faster
that's<00:02:01.430> assembly<00:02:01.880> servile<00:02:02.330> that's<00:02:02.540> not<00:02:02.720> the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
that's assembly servile that's not the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.010 
that's assembly servile that's not the
sound<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.260> saw<00:02:03.500> blade<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:05.210> C<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:05.990> the

sound of the saw blade and C is the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.430 
sound of the saw blade and C is the
fascist<00:02:07.360> can't<00:02:08.360> pull<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.600> any<00:02:08.720> faster<00:02:09.259> than

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
fascist can't pull it any faster than

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.560 
fascist can't pull it any faster than
then<00:02:09.590> allow<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.150> you<00:02:11.150> could<00:02:11.330> lock<00:02:11.510> the

want and make some cuts you have to
release<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.830> axis<00:02:22.250> here<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
release the axis here this is the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.290 
release the axis here this is the
adjustment<00:02:23.750> for<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.170> axis<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.610> can<00:02:25.820> do<00:02:26.000> this

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
adjustment for the axis you can do this

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.000 
adjustment for the axis you can do this
and<00:02:27.220> swing<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.250> around<00:02:28.959> does<00:02:29.959> lock<00:02:30.230> 90<00:02:30.620> degrees

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
and swing it around does lock 90 degrees

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.540 
and swing it around does lock 90 degrees
gotta<00:02:31.910> lock<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.450> place<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:34.070> then<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.520> can

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
gotta lock it to place and then you can

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.000 
gotta lock it to place and then you can
do<00:02:34.790> rip<00:02:35.030> cutting<00:02:35.390> that's<00:02:36.110> why<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.440> poles<00:02:36.770> are

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
do rip cutting that's why the poles are

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.340 
do rip cutting that's why the poles are
on<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.340> side<00:02:37.610> for<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.120> RIP<00:02:39.489> also<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.959> can<00:02:42.140> do

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
on this side for the RIP also you can do

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.979 
on this side for the RIP also you can do
biters<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.190> I'll<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:44.000> adjust<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.510> back<00:02:44.690> to

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
biters and I'll just adjust it back to

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.390 
biters and I'll just adjust it back to
zero<00:02:45.350> again<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:46.070> for<00:02:47.030> I'm<00:02:47.239> sorry<00:02:47.480> ninety

all the way to 90 I don't know why you

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.300 
all the way to 90 I don't know why you
would<00:03:10.730> do<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:11.030> on<00:03:11.209> this<00:03:11.440> there's<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.920> top<00:03:13.160> of

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
would do that on this there's the top of

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.170 
would do that on this there's the top of
the<00:03:13.400> motor<00:03:13.549> on<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:13.970> side<00:03:14.239> there<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:16.180> reset

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
the motor on this side there is a reset

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.539 
the motor on this side there is a reset
button<00:03:17.209> over<00:03:17.840> here<00:03:18.140> if<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.769> never<00:03:18.920> jams<00:03:19.280> up

button over here if it never jams up

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.100 
button over here if it never jams up
probably<00:03:19.850> won't<00:03:20.090> ever<00:03:20.330> do<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.690> it's<00:03:20.930> about

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
probably won't ever do that it's about

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.810 
probably won't ever do that it's about
two<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.530> half<00:03:21.560> horsepower<00:03:22.070> once<00:03:22.519> it<00:03:22.640> gets

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
two and a half horsepower once it gets

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:30.160 
two and a half horsepower once it gets
going<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:25.209> have<00:03:26.209> your<00:03:28.209> vacuum<00:03:29.209> here<00:03:29.750> two<00:03:29.989> inch

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
going you have your vacuum here two inch

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.210 
going you have your vacuum here two inch
vacuum<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.989> scales<00:03:32.989> up<00:03:33.260> here<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.799> arm<00:03:33.950> does

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
vacuum and scales up here the arm does

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.780 
vacuum and scales up here the arm does
swing<00:03:34.630> obviously<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.310> can<00:03:37.459> swing<00:03:37.670> it

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
swing obviously so you can swing it

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.370 
swing obviously so you can swing it
through<00:03:37.940> whatever<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.450> want<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.780> do<00:03:38.959> up<00:03:39.200> to

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
through whatever you want to do up to

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.630 
through whatever you want to do up to
sixty<00:03:39.829> degrees<00:03:40.840> either<00:03:41.840> way

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.080 

full<00:03:47.640> rotation<00:03:48.650> can't<00:03:49.650> they<00:03:49.830> get<00:03:49.950> back<00:03:50.190> being

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
full rotation can't they get back being

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.809 
full rotation can't they get back being
into<00:03:51.420> something<00:03:51.780> there<00:03:51.959> any<00:03:52.410> half<00:03:52.709> does<00:03:53.520> lock

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
into something there any half does lock

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.540 
into something there any half does lock
again<00:03:54.150> at<00:03:54.270> zero<00:03:54.599> degrees<00:03:55.080> which<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.130> forward

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
again at zero degrees which that forward

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.410 
again at zero degrees which that forward
is<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> locket<00:03:57.239> bitch<00:03:58.170> locks<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.880> action<00:04:00.209> from

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
is a locket bitch locks the action from

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.770 
is a locket bitch locks the action from
going<00:04:00.690> forward<00:04:00.930> backwards<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.940> locks<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
going forward backwards this locks the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.410 
going forward backwards this locks the
biter<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.550> mean<00:04:05.849> you<00:04:05.940> could<00:04:06.060> do<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> lot<00:04:06.390> of

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
biter so I mean you could do a lot of

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.120 
biter so I mean you could do a lot of
compound<00:04:06.930> stuff<00:04:07.230> let's<00:04:07.470> say<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.709> want<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.040> do

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.240 
compound stuff let's say you want to do
a<00:04:08.160> compound<00:04:08.700> miter<00:04:08.910> cut<00:04:10.700> 45<00:04:11.700> degrees<00:04:14.330> and

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
a compound miter cut 45 degrees and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.500 
a compound miter cut 45 degrees and
swing<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.430> arm<00:04:17.609> out<00:04:20.090> we<00:04:21.090> got<00:04:21.269> full

that'll do okay now it's on the rocker
it<00:04:57.600> sets<00:04:57.900> itself<00:05:00.140> we're<00:05:01.140> going<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.350> do<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.440> rip

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
it sets itself we're going to do a rip

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.250 
it sets itself we're going to do a rip
here<00:05:01.740> we<00:05:02.160> got<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.400> figure<00:05:02.610> out<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:04.050> go

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
here we got to figure out to go

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.290 
here we got to figure out to go
obviously<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.280> want<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.550> go<00:05:05.729> just<00:05:05.760> below<00:05:06.180> the

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
obviously you want to go just below the

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.500 
obviously you want to go just below the
