tutorial looking at drawing isometric
cylinders<00:00:05.270> alright<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.629> next<00:00:06.750> of

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
cylinders alright so in the next of

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.360 
cylinders alright so in the next of
these<00:00:07.049> video<00:00:07.350> tutorials<00:00:07.440> we're<00:00:08.130> going<00:00:08.280> to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
these video tutorials we're going to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.980 
these video tutorials we're going to
love<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.639> I'm<00:00:08.820> combining<00:00:09.150> some<00:00:09.599> other<00:00:09.780> things

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
love it I'm combining some other things

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.690 
love it I'm combining some other things
that<00:00:10.170> we've<00:00:10.440> already<00:00:10.620> learned<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.250> we're

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
that we've already learned and we're

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.459 
that we've already learned and we're
going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.969> draw<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.540> cylinder<00:00:13.019> which<00:00:13.440> is

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
going to draw a cylinder which is

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.090 
going to draw a cylinder which is
essentially<00:00:14.330> some<00:00:15.330> circles<00:00:15.780> inside<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
essentially some circles inside of a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.540 
essentially some circles inside of a
cube<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:18.750> then<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.590> initially

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
cube and then so I'm going to initially

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.550 
cube and then so I'm going to initially
draw<00:00:20.820> two<00:00:21.630> circles<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.080> those<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> be

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
draw two circles and those going to be

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.590 
draw two circles and those going to be
the<00:00:22.650> outside<00:00:22.830> edge<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.640> an<00:00:23.789> inside<00:00:24.210> edge<00:00:24.359> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the outside edge and an inside edge of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.750 
the outside edge and an inside edge of
my<00:00:24.750> cylinder<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.189> we're<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> draw

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
my cylinder and then we're going to draw

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.439 
my cylinder and then we're going to draw
a<00:00:27.830> box<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> crate

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
a box and it's going to be the crate

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.060 
a box and it's going to be the crate
around<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> cylinder<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.619> I'll<00:00:31.710> explain

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
around the cylinder and I'll explain

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.370 
around the cylinder and I'll explain
what<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> crepe<00:00:32.550> means<00:00:32.820> when<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.110> stage

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
what a crepe means when I get that stage

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.150 
what a crepe means when I get that stage
so<00:00:34.770> first<00:00:35.550> let's<00:00:35.790> draw<00:00:35.940> our<00:00:36.149> cylinders<00:00:37.160> sorry

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
so first let's draw our cylinders sorry

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.250 
so first let's draw our cylinders sorry
else<00:00:38.340> circles<00:00:38.760> let's<00:00:39.540> assume<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
else circles let's assume that the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.389 
else circles let's assume that the
outside<00:00:41.780> dimensions<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:44.280> bit

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
outside dimensions of a little bit

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.869 
outside dimensions of a little bit
dimensions<00:00:45.000> about<00:00:45.149> outside<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.539> circle<00:00:45.780> are

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
dimensions about outside the circle are

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.310 
dimensions about outside the circle are
18<00:00:47.879> millimeters<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.660> I'm<00:00:48.750> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> start<00:00:49.170> by

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
18 millimeters so I'm going to start by

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.729 
18 millimeters so I'm going to start by
drawing<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.610> remember<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.379> vertical<00:00:52.379> line

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.830 

now<00:00:55.739> notice<00:00:56.039> I'm<00:00:56.160> keeping<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:56.550> lines<00:00:57.510> here

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
now notice I'm keeping my lines here

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840 
now notice I'm keeping my lines here
nice<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.289> life<00:00:58.680> those<00:00:58.949> construction<00:00:59.640> lines

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
nice and life those construction lines

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.090 
nice and life those construction lines
so<00:01:00.539> they're<00:01:00.690> lines<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.050> won't<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.469> see

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
so they're lines we won't actually see

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.950 
so they're lines we won't actually see
in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.399> final<00:01:02.879> drawing<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.329> we'll<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.780> but

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
in the final drawing or we'll see but

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.760 
in the final drawing or we'll see but
only<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:05.090> now<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> measure<00:01:06.390> 80<00:01:07.049> millimeters

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
only really now I measure 80 millimeters

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.050 
only really now I measure 80 millimeters
up<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:09.680> edge<00:01:11.390> 80<00:01:12.390> millimeters<00:01:12.930> from<00:01:13.530> 0<00:01:14.460> it'll

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
up my edge 80 millimeters from 0 it'll

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.679 
up my edge 80 millimeters from 0 it'll
make<00:01:15.210> some<00:01:15.330> marks<00:01:16.970> I'm<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.479> draw<00:01:18.630> some

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
make some marks I'm going to draw some

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.130 
make some marks I'm going to draw some
lines<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:20.210> 50<00:01:21.210> degrees<00:01:21.509> coming<00:01:21.840> back<00:01:21.990> from

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
lines at 50 degrees coming back from

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.420 
lines at 50 degrees coming back from
this<00:01:22.320> edge<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.630> square<00:01:25.430> in

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this edge and this will be the square in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.609 
this edge and this will be the square in
my<00:01:26.640> circle<00:01:27.000> sets<00:01:27.210> end<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.869> you'll<00:01:28.500> remember

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
my circle sets end so you'll remember

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.640 
my circle sets end so you'll remember
from<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> last<00:01:29.220> video<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:30.650> isometric

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
from the last video that isometric

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.679 
from the last video that isometric
circles<00:01:32.070> always<00:01:32.520> sit<00:01:32.759> inside<00:01:33.030> by<00:01:33.420> symmetry

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
circles always sit inside by symmetry

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.380 
circles always sit inside by symmetry
squares<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> again<00:01:36.869> some<00:01:37.110> nice<00:01:37.290> light<00:01:37.590> lines

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
squares so again some nice light lines

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:49.870 
squares so again some nice light lines
make<00:01:39.390> sure<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.930> 80<00:01:40.560> millimeters<00:01:41.070> each

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.340 

now<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.149> draw<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.390> line<00:01:51.600> between<00:01:51.960> those<00:01:52.290> two

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
now if I draw a line between those two

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.109 
now if I draw a line between those two
points<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.890> I've<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.130> made<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.729> should<00:01:54.030> be

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
points that I've just made it should be

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:04.880 
points that I've just made it should be
exactly<00:01:54.829> vertical<00:01:58.100> turns<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.840> now<00:02:03.890> what

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
exactly vertical turns and now what

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.230 
exactly vertical turns and now what
we'll<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.250> we'll<00:02:05.520> draw<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.759> outside

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
we'll do is we'll draw the outside

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.449 
we'll do is we'll draw the outside
circle<00:02:06.600> first<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.619> I'll<00:02:08.220> draw<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
circle first and then I'll draw the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.309 
circle first and then I'll draw the
inside<00:02:08.700> circle<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.289> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
inside circle now it's going to get a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.630 
inside circle now it's going to get a
little<00:02:10.470> bit<00:02:10.649> complex<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.280> missing<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.330> but

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
little bit complex and missing and but

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.100 
little bit complex and missing and but
you'll<00:02:13.940> still<00:02:14.120> be<00:02:14.150> able<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.360> follow<00:02:14.510> along<00:02:14.630> so

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
you'll still be able to follow along so

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.480 
you'll still be able to follow along so
remembering<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:16.370> draw<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> circle<00:02:16.940> we<00:02:18.460> draw<00:02:19.460> a

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
remembering to draw a circle we draw a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.450 
remembering to draw a circle we draw a
line<00:02:19.670> between<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.120> two<00:02:21.190> opposite<00:02:22.190> points

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
line between the two opposite points

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.740 
line between the two opposite points
there<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:24.290> two<00:02:24.440> opposite<00:02:24.830> points<00:02:26.440> here

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
there and the two opposite points here

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.740 
there and the two opposite points here
and<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:30.620> we<00:02:30.740> draw<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.490> line<00:02:32.450> running<00:02:32.570> across

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
and then we draw a line running across

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.270 
and then we draw a line running across
this<00:02:33.020> way<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.560> line<00:02:33.740> running<00:02:33.890> down<00:02:34.160> that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
this way and a line running down that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.950 
this way and a line running down that
way<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.610> they<00:02:35.090> should<00:02:35.120> be<00:02:35.510> announcing<00:02:35.900> the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
way and they should be announcing the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.530 
way and they should be announcing the
point<00:02:36.640> remembering<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.940> half<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.270> between

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
point remembering and half a between

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.600 
point remembering and half a between
these<00:02:38.720> two<00:02:38.990> points<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.680> as<00:02:40.010> with<00:02:40.220> local

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
these two points here as with local

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:48.790 
these two points here as with local
start<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.270> half<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.200> 80<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:43.070> 40<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:47.709> that'll<00:02:48.709> be

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
start so half of 80 is 40 and that'll be

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.760 
start so half of 80 is 40 and that'll be
the<00:02:48.830> Sailor<00:02:49.070> say<00:02:49.370> half<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.510> 80<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.930> 40<00:02:52.360> now<00:02:53.770> you

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
the Sailor say half of 80 is 40 now you

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.870 
the Sailor say half of 80 is 40 now you
might<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.040> noticed<00:02:55.100> on<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.459> last<00:02:55.670> two

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
might have noticed on the last two

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880 
might have noticed on the last two
videos<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.510> these<00:02:57.230> lines<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.680> always

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
videos that these lines of always

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.580 
videos that these lines of always
tempted<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.340> go<00:02:58.459> through<00:02:59.200> the<00:03:00.200> center<00:03:00.440> line

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
tempted to go through the center line

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.110 
tempted to go through the center line
the<00:03:00.770> end<00:03:00.890> that's<00:03:01.310> always<00:03:01.580> going<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:01.910> be<00:03:01.970> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
the end that's always going to be the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.790 
the end that's always going to be the
case<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:02.570> instead<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:02.989> measuring<00:03:03.260> these<00:03:03.560> out

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
case so instead of measuring these out

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.270 
case so instead of measuring these out
every<00:03:04.180> time<00:03:05.260> what<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.320> can<00:03:06.440> just<00:03:06.470> do<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.100> use

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
every time what we can just do is use

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.410 
every time what we can just do is use
our<00:03:07.430> 3066<00:03:08.209> square<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:10.070> plot<00:03:10.850> lines<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.270> run

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
our 3066 square to plot lines and run

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.610 
our 3066 square to plot lines and run
through<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:13.220> center<00:03:14.140> with<00:03:15.140> these<00:03:15.260> two<00:03:15.440> lines

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
through the center with these two lines

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.070 
through the center with these two lines
here<00:03:15.800> cross<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.970> I'm<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:17.480> going<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.660> do<00:03:17.900> that

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
here cross so I'm just going to do that

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.900 
here cross so I'm just going to do that
and<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:20.000> it's<00:03:20.180> my<00:03:20.980> 40<00:03:21.980> millimeter<00:03:22.430> mark<00:03:22.610> quite

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
and if it's my 40 millimeter mark quite

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.310 
and if it's my 40 millimeter mark quite
nicely<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.360> I'll<00:03:23.450> just<00:03:23.600> do<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> line<00:03:23.989> up<00:03:24.140> and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
nicely and I'll just do a line up and

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.699 
nicely and I'll just do a line up and
down<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:26.110> vertical<00:03:27.110> line<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.769> once<00:03:28.250> again<00:03:29.709> it's

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
down a vertical line and once again it's

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.900 
down a vertical line and once again it's
my<00:03:30.830> mark<00:03:31.010> nice<00:03:31.190> thing<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.489> goes<00:03:31.580> through<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
my mark nice thing it goes through the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.640 
my mark nice thing it goes through the
center<00:03:32.860> so<00:03:33.860> using<00:03:34.130> my<00:03:34.160> compass<00:03:34.549> now<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:35.650> was

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
center so using my compass now I was

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.900 
center so using my compass now I was
explaining<00:03:36.980> everything<00:03:37.280> as<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.580> go<00:03:37.760> along

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
explaining everything as I go along

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.080 
explaining everything as I go along
because<00:03:38.239> you<00:03:38.540> will<00:03:38.660> see<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:39.049> in<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.320> earlier

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
because you will see this in the earlier

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.460 
because you will see this in the earlier
tutorial<00:03:41.090> videos<00:03:41.330> I<00:03:44.260> can<00:03:45.260> scribe<00:03:45.530> way<00:03:47.470> outside

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
tutorial videos I can scribe way outside

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:02.050 
tutorial videos I can scribe way outside
arcs

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.000 

and<00:04:03.060> now<00:04:03.510> finding<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.230> center<00:04:04.410> points<00:04:04.770> for

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
and now finding the center points for

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.880 
and now finding the center points for
the<00:04:05.190> smaller<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.940> those<00:04:06.150> items<00:04:06.680> going<00:04:07.680> top<00:04:07.860> to

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
the smaller of those items going top to

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.550 
the smaller of those items going top to
the<00:04:08.070> corner<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.460> draw<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> line<00:04:12.050> Clara<00:04:13.050> processes

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the corner I draw a line Clara processes

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.259 
the corner I draw a line Clara processes
longer<00:04:14.010> axis<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.290> point<00:04:16.730> now<00:04:17.730> draw<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.030> line

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
longer axis to the point now draw a line

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.950 
longer axis to the point now draw a line
for<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.450> bottom<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:19.170> that<00:04:19.200> corner

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:59.110 

let's<00:04:24.960> my<00:04:25.080> center<00:04:25.350> point<00:04:25.470> there

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.580 

so<00:05:00.120> there<00:05:00.300> we<00:05:00.389> have<00:05:01.130> one<00:05:02.130> isometric<00:05:02.669> circle<00:05:03.590> so

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
so there we have one isometric circle so

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.050 
so there we have one isometric circle so
I<00:05:04.620> don't<00:05:04.770> need<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.949> do<00:05:05.039> now<00:05:05.280> let's<00:05:05.759> draw<00:05:06.000> the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
I don't need to do now let's draw the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.570 
I don't need to do now let's draw the
inside<00:05:07.020> circle<00:05:07.289> of<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.740> cylinder<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:08.370> it's

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
inside circle of the cylinder so it's

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.309 
inside circle of the cylinder so it's
gonna<00:05:08.729> be<00:05:08.849> a<00:05:08.880> circle<00:05:09.270> let's<00:05:09.389> start<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.110> same

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
gonna be a circle let's start the same

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.499 
gonna be a circle let's start the same
seem<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.710> point<00:05:10.919> there<00:05:11.270> it's<00:05:12.270> going<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.449> be

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
seem to point there it's going to be

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.839 
seem to point there it's going to be
smaller<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.370> let's<00:05:14.370> make<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.610> have<00:05:14.819> a

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
smaller and let's make it have a

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.730 
smaller and let's make it have a
diameter<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.479> 60<00:05:15.630> millimeters<00:05:16.380> because<00:05:16.590> it's

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
diameter of 60 millimeters because it's

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.070 
diameter of 60 millimeters because it's
easy<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:17.069> work<00:05:17.190> with<00:05:17.250> so<00:05:17.810> what<00:05:18.810> I'm<00:05:18.900> going<00:05:19.020> to

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
easy to work with so what I'm going to

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.610 
easy to work with so what I'm going to
do<00:05:19.229> now<00:05:19.410> is<00:05:19.740> draw<00:05:20.039> a<00:05:20.069> box<00:05:20.370> or<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.120> crate<00:05:22.050> or<00:05:22.289> squid

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
do now is draw a box or a crate or squid

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.670 
do now is draw a box or a crate or squid
and<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.509> inside<00:05:24.990> circle<00:05:25.229> can<00:05:25.500> sit

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
and that the inside circle can sit

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.100 
and that the inside circle can sit
inside<00:05:25.949> so<00:05:26.400> I'm<00:05:26.520> going<00:05:26.669> to<00:05:26.699> measure<00:05:27.110> 30

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
inside so I'm going to measure 30

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.839 
inside so I'm going to measure 30
millimeters<00:05:28.590> on<00:05:28.710> this<00:05:28.919> line<00:05:29.160> that<00:05:29.190> way<00:05:29.580> and

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
millimeters on this line that way and

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.520 
millimeters on this line that way and
sitting<00:05:30.509> with<00:05:30.539> meters<00:05:30.930> along<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.319> line<00:05:31.500> that

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
sitting with meters along the line that

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.180
