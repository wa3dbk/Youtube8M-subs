00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 6 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.850
 a very large pectorals an abdomen 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.190
 well defined arms well 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.949
 bulky is what many people are looking for 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.550
 for my point of view a good shoulders 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.470
 big 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.050
 the dorsal well - built 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.970
 trapezoid communes that is very difficult to you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.530
 makes it look much more imposing more 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.510
 big in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.430
 how to build the arms really big 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.870
 and a well constructed triceps 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.850
 so that you can simply 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.110
 adapt them to your training plan 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.550
 first I want to tell you that I do not 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.399
 he makes the mistake that many commit in the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.820
 gym even I have done it is because 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.829
 what I do this video for simply 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.899
 emphasize some new knowledge 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.790
 that you must apply them already the first 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.710
 mistake that many commit is to kill themselves 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.270
 doing many variations of kurt 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 Pulley use extensions 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.690
 too many variations because if they want 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.290
 that they build a lot more prices 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.700
 big 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.399
 this works well for people who 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.750
 be advanced and simply look for 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.300
 adapt isolation exercise your 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.339
 routine but for those who are starting 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.170
 in this the beginners really do not 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.930
 It is very productive and very useful to adapt 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.369
 hundreds and hundreds of kurt exercises 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.260
 from biceps of trichet to your routine 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.120
 first let's talk about the queer 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.490
 extensions is something with this movement 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.140
 of kurt biceps and extensions ok 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.550
 then first in the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 beginners are needed to 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.350
 build dough in your arms triceps 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.030
 perform compound exercises do not put 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.130
 on your exercise list just from 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 isolation hundred of kurt currency of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.570
 triceps that many do in circuit 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.390
 super series first concentrate 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.010
 build your big figure and then already 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.080
 the details second look very 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.120
 important that many commit is about 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.190
 training your arms remember that 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.750
 every day when you do any 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.350
 deadweight squat exercise 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.640
 dominated you are using your arms you 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.220
 you can not train your biceps and triceps 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.950
 five days a week remember that the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.900
 muscles need to rest to grow 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.000
 third very important aspect boys 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.400
 is to forget to train other parts very 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.770
 important as the legs leave a 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.690
 side the shoulders and pinned the back and 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.130
 dedicated to training only say glass 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.570
 I have met many people who do 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.250
 this and then his appearance will show off a 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.200
 little funny 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.850
 and then it 's going to cost a lot a lot 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.710
 improve the parts the proportions their 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.420
 body how to improve legs and 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.090
 shoulders then before it's 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.250
 too late to enter everything with 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 simply harmony ok fourth aspect 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.930
 very important at least is not to consume 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.780
 enough calories to grow if you 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.140
 you want biceps of 40 centimeters 20 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.670
 588 that you should consume more calories from 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.290
 the ones you burn and talked about this topic in 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.820
 my previous one is videos the same way then 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.890
 on the website and for tv point to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.780
 see articles about gaining mass 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.310
 muscle many wonder daily 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.720
 how can you have such big arms 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.670
 so I stayed with the shirt tight 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.470
 you can kill yourself from gymnastics 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.300
 hundreds and series hundreds of exercises 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.160
 of vision and triceps in a workout 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.630
 but remember if you do not come back anymore 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.520
 strong if you do not talk about loading 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.930
 progressive if you do not eat more they are not going to 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.520
 get anywhere by more than you 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.320
 kill one hundred two hundred different 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.630
 preacher of kurt of vices of a 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.340
 recipe as in hammer horn you do not go 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.200
 to get anywhere if you do not eat more and 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.440
 what you owe in conclusion guys 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.540
 eat more you already know a caloric plus eat 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.610
 more calories than you want according to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.920
 a very important aspect is rest 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.930
 also third very important aspect is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.330
 make you stronger then exercises 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.000
 compound squats dead weight the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.459
 Rowing with bar for back press of 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.860
 shoulders bench press in order if you what 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.910
 you do stronger in those exercises 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.920
 obviously you will have some arms a lot 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.260
 Biggest 7 very important expert me 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.090
 I know many of you do not and 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.610
 he sees it strange to the person who does is 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.580
 record your progress bring your 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.110
 records take photos take numbers 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.390
 how much are you raising 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.519
 When you are making progress, prioritize 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.500
 compound exercises more than courses 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.870
 as I told you, implementing more 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.489
 compound exercises has registered your 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.739
 progress in the deadlift squat 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.620
 to grow your biceps much faster 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.290
 that doing curse every day for heaps 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.420
 of series stronger more food more 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.069
 arm and something that you will be asking 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.600
 this is how you can add 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.430
 all this is telling me I want to 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.680
 my training plan let me tell you 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.640
 what exercises are the best and you such 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.590
 you are doing it 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.780
 for dominated dominated bises 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.400
 inverse oars with rowing bars with 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.229
 dumbbells attacks in the vice of a 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.970
 amazing way for the triceps 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.780
 When you cough press bench press 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.270
 shoulders backgrounds 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.980
 artigas you are working your triceps 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.220
 also especially when you press 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.240
 military justices work in a way 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.980
 surprising then now you know 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.600
 and many people ask me, do not you train 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.880
 Forearm, since I did not train 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.350
 Arm in isolated form the dead weight 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.030
 as I told you in the videos of 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.760
 squat bench press tutorials 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.889
 while you stronger pressures the 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.410
 bar forearms positions go to work 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.600
 much stronger then when doing weight 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.850
 dead avoid for example use if it is 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.530
 necessary as the straps or any 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.060
 help to make your home a lot 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.620
 stronger if you have a place much 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.480
 stronger the forearms will be much 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.090
 stronger therefore another reason why 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.520
 which I want to clarify that your biceps and 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.620
 triceps grow at 60 dissipate his death 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.500
 is that when you press the bar as 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.419
 I told you totally your arms are 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.140
 working indirectly as well as others 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.120
 parts of the body 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.950
 finally train your arms is nothing 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.380
 complicated many believe that the more 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.270
 exercises do much faster you go to 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.190
 grow in the next video I want to 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.040
 share some myths about what 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.419
 people believe that hitting training 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.890
 to your videos from different angles 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.200
 different base positions to be 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.080
 much faster then that's a lie 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.170
 in the next video so many 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.820
 people believe they can change the 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.470
 figure to the shape of your views of that 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.510
 can not be changed can not be changed 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.550
 outline the way your biceps 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.140
 that genetically then those are 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.250
 aspects I will clarify in the next 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.380
 video for them to make videos very 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.240
 long and you can see them the best 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.470
 way are basically many I hope that
