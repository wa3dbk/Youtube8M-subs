and what you're seeing there what would

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.179 
and what you're seeing there what would
have<00:02:44.370> prevented<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.150> train<00:02:45.569> from<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:47.010> can

have prevented the train from if you can
tell<00:02:47.430> us

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
tell us

evening<00:02:59.010> about<00:02:59.129> visibility<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.180> I'm<00:03:00.269> going

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
evening about visibility and I'm going

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.759 
evening about visibility and I'm going
through<00:03:00.750> some<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.019> maps<00:03:01.230> here<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.680> it

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
through some of the maps here and it

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.280 
through some of the maps here and it
does<00:03:01.950> appear<00:03:02.329> that<00:03:03.329> right<00:03:03.810> before<00:03:04.169> this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
does appear that right before this

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.960 
does appear that right before this
collision<00:03:04.500> there<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:04.859> a<00:03:05.010> bit<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.519> bend<00:03:05.760> this

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
collision there is a bit of a bend this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.330 
collision there is a bit of a bend this
was<00:03:06.120> not<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> straightaway<00:03:07.079> if<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.409> will<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:08.099> if

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
was not a straightaway if you will so if

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.190 
was not a straightaway if you will so if
the<00:03:08.459> train<00:03:08.730> was<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:09.000> 60<00:03:09.569> miles<00:03:09.750> per<00:03:09.900> hour

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
the train was going 60 miles per hour

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.629 
the train was going 60 miles per hour
and<00:03:10.470> came<00:03:10.680> around<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:11.010> bend<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.400> then<00:03:11.489> all

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
and came around that bend and then all

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.129 
and came around that bend and then all
of<00:03:11.669> a<00:03:11.819> sudden<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:12.180> vehicle<00:03:12.599> stopped<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.049> the

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
of a sudden the vehicle stopped in the

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.289 
of a sudden the vehicle stopped in the
tracks<00:03:13.379> there<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:14.129> a<00:03:14.189> rate<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.639> 60<00:03:14.939> miles<00:03:15.090> per

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
hour if in fact that was the speed it

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.530 
hour if in fact that was the speed it
was<00:03:16.829> going<00:03:17.099> or<00:03:17.220> something<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.389> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
was going or something like that and the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.300 
was going or something like that and the
engineer<00:03:19.049> would<00:03:19.139> have<00:03:19.290> had<00:03:19.440> only<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.859> minute<00:03:20.190> or

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
engineer would have had only a minute or

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.789 
engineer would have had only a minute or
so<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.519> apply<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.090> brakes<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.229> a<00:03:22.349> train<00:03:22.590> like

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
so to apply the brakes and a train like

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.559 
so to apply the brakes and a train like
this<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.310> would<00:03:23.579> not<00:03:23.849> have<00:03:24.030> stopped<00:03:24.299> on<00:03:24.449> a<00:03:24.479> dime

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
this so would not have stopped on a dime

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.780 
this so would not have stopped on a dime
obviously<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.799> do<00:03:25.949> know<00:03:26.129> that<00:03:26.280> after<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
obviously and we do know that after the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.119 
obviously and we do know that after the
impact<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.659> train<00:03:27.959> did<00:03:28.199> keep<00:03:28.500> moving<00:03:28.979> and

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
impact the train did keep moving and

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.099 
impact the train did keep moving and
that<00:03:29.609> Jeep<00:03:29.879> was<00:03:30.090> essentially<00:03:30.540> dragged<00:03:30.810> about

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
that Jeep was essentially dragged about

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.969 
that Jeep was essentially dragged about
40<00:03:31.979> feet<00:03:32.659> even<00:03:33.659> more<00:03:33.900> underneath<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.739> train

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
40 feet even more underneath the train

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.680 
40 feet even more underneath the train
and<00:03:35.250> that's<00:03:35.579> what<00:03:35.699> caused<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:36.000> explosion<00:03:36.090> and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
and that's what caused the explosion and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.539 
and that's what caused the explosion and
the<00:03:36.750> fire<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:37.379> eventually<00:03:37.949> saw<00:03:38.159> so

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
the fire that you eventually saw so

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.969 
the fire that you eventually saw so
obviously<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.900> engineer<00:03:40.319> did<00:03:40.530> not<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.949> a

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
obviously the engineer did not have a

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.589 
obviously the engineer did not have a
lot<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.280> time<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:41.790> whatever<00:03:41.970> reason<00:03:42.479> and

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
lot of time for whatever reason and

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.080 
lot of time for whatever reason and
could<00:03:43.109> not<00:03:43.199> stop<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.709> time<00:03:43.889> after<00:03:44.819> seeing<00:03:44.909> that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
could not stop in time after seeing that

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.180 
could not stop in time after seeing that
