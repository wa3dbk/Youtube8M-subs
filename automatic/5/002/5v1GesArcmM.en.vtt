00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.920
 let's go to the next things kaching 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.890
 two wireless antennas their antennas without 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:27.289
 raised by sticking to the side of the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:35.270
 good connector and sata cabinet and 2 psb 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:42.690
 It is a mirror that will place a bridge

 logo republic of gamers two boards 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.620
 video and citizen of the next 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.559
 Come on the video card I got the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 my 79 that only some adapters for 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.530
 Do you connect the dc pins that led 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 front power metal button can 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.199
 connect here and then only comes with this 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.640
 directly on the motherboard and already connects 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.340
 all without having to stay there on the motherboard 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.890
 very cool piece with exclusive 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.020
 I'll cable you out of here, I'll show you 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.570
 an adapter you want to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.680
 will send information to this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 cable adapter 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.970
 sl two way to connect two 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.549
 video 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.250
 the USB cable for you to make the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.430
 communication to control the tc 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.479
 overclocking an external notebook or something 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.790
 like this 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.790
 note that the two ends are large 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.660
 the antenna adapter antenna for the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.930
 two antennas of vargas or this here are 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:01.050
 sensors for you to measure the amperage 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.050
 of the exits already come the two alone 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:19.960
 six sata cables 6gb two sata cables 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:29.620
 3Gbps we should mirror and you will 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:33.280
 the fado of the republic and the exit for you 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.160
 pass the cable from the ok connect on the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.160
 motherboard and exits connected to two times 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:47.739
 this is the little plaque that has the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:52.959
 wireless technology bng 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:58.150
 and more bluetooth 4.0 and more are back 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:00.340
 oo oms that is for those who use normal hd 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.220
 do not want to buy a sdd hd or in my 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.150
 if I already bought it it would be as if it were 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.630
 an hd on the motherboard where it would load the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.890
 most used files would load nice 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.519
 mini sd 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.470
 then this normally 32 gigs then 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.450
 to support the performance of systems in 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.000
 My case already uses sd nÃ©. 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.550
 I will not use this connection, I will not 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.269
 use the adapter as the adapter film 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:37.300
 triay to make the sl with three 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:38.860
 video it is hard and 4000 ias guys have 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.180
 have lots of money to use this 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:47.050
 here are four video cards imagine 4 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.870
 680 spectacle that would not be in the case 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.030
 the normal adapter is used 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.100
 two-way league 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.580
 an activity card first in the 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.920
 second plate 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.200
 the second deep plate in the third and more 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.180
 one of the third in the fourth plaque reminding 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.630
 which in the case even comes with the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.070
 video to nvidia i think video cards 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.890
 that it partners with the 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.960
 manufacturers of motherboard to send 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.080
 together to encourage is the customer 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.540
 buy the plates inside 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.230
 the adapter 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.440
 I just know the guys here it goes 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.640
 send to you will connect and out 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.000
 of the video card is a bit 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.540
 great to connect him directly in the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 motherboard I use an adapter that 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.740
 demi displayport to see you and I'll go 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.710
 connect or adapt to what I'm connected to 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.650
 directly on the motherboard what else 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.740
 connector here on the side and behind it here 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.050
 the cabinet is far away from the table 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.570
 so I think it would hurt me a 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.370
 bit but how do i use adapters 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.250
 to turn on the four screens 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.850
 then it's for me it will disturb me not 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.520
 so tac reproached the penalty just know that this 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.960
 here selic connector here enters the 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.840
 mirror and cable between here 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.300
 call the mother at the door then the motherboard 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.210
 will send information to this here and 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.910
 this here he takes the image here and knows 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.430
 that already with the information for your 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.550
 monitor this information in time 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:32.120
 would be the same resources as the 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:33.710
 people with the urban MSF is the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.220
 other programs of the genre will 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.990
 show fps temperature coloques only 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.060
 not only the video card will be the 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.060
 processor and memory motherboard 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.650
 everything on the screen there is a button 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.410
 behind the motherboard to turn on and off 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.410
 this view and you can still connect a 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:55.000
 rabi chino gianpi for you to have a button 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.000
 to do this 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:03.650
 some stickers for you to put on 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:08.720
 your cables and how I use two 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:12.140
 hds of two suits plus one ssd 240 gb 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.240
 the outer hd of a suit and so on 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.850
 You put them in the cables only 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.690
 separate is to identify what it is 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.830
 with thing and this makes it much easier 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.960
 organization that occurs here is 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:30.710
 the drawing 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:33.530
 The manual is almost a true bible I 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:39.440
 I downloaded the manual in pdf has two days 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:42.170
 I'm reading it already and he solemnly 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.710
 your iphone 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:48.470
 I'm reading there and very interesting or 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.650
 power bike stickers republic of 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.650
 gamers 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:07:02.630
 here is here showing what the 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.400
 pci express connections and here seriousness 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.230
 I will never use this here anymore. 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.120
 drives this motherboard 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:14.300
 the site gives rise to newer versions 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:17.150
 for windows 8 and 1 2 ghz and mail only from 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.570
 drives of this motherboard is 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:24.350
 a lot of things both can play until it's dvds 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:30.680
 and about two and a half games here too 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:35.120
 normal black and white manual and has 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.729
 reading that is only checked here is 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.050
 all in English is neither manual in 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:42.530
 multiple languages 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:45.200
 so the first videos are there between 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:48.440
 the portal brx dot get our channel 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:53.180
 if possible a young man had listed 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.490
 with great care and then to ride 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:59.200
 the board or make new videos a great
