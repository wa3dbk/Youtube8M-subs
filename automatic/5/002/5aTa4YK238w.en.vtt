00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello it is by isa for m6 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.779
 so my paul single and we have 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.890
 actually it's my producer actually who 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.990
 had made me listen to music 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 at the beginning there was just the instru 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.619
 I had really hooked the instrument and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480
 then he started doing some 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.949
 melodies I really hooked so I 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.210
 could it be this one it's this title 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.710
 there that I want at the level of the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.540
 clip making it's my producer 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 who had his idea of ​​amazon want 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.140
 absolutely do that so even before 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.309
 I leave for the issue of the markets on 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.879
 already had the idea to go shoot in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 Thailand 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.080
 and that's how it came 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.510
 the costumes we really did everything there 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.270
 down we created the costumes we have 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 searched the places we really have 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 gone to the fore on the head to search 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.879
 for the clip here is the shoot he went 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.649
 very very well it was not easy 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.329
 because it was very hot in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.979
 the more I was in the jungle so there 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.720
 I had mosquitoes 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.250
 I remember that there was a plan where 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.020
 I had a playback I made myself 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 attack 50 times by a mosquito 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.440
 finally several mosquitoes in my opinion and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.640
 I was filled I could not I was 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.190
 not concentrated so it's true that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.720
 it was not easy then with the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.869
 extras who had it got very very 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.310
 well spent he did not speak French but 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.869
 I speak English so it's okay and then 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.849
 go Marseilles is always good 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.709
 atmosphere with them so it was really 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.060
 fun on the set it's true 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.080
 that today the image plays a lot 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.270
 in music 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.459
 we can have a good title but if 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 the picture is not behind it's not 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.020
 obvious either and it's true that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.330
 music accompanied by a clip it's so 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.679
 beautiful finally it always attracts 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.539
 people's attention I think that 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.800
 I would have dressed a clip 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.800
 normally would not be done the same 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.170
 I have two titles where I sing in English 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.470
 I also have a little crazy singing in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.950
 Spanish but actually according to the music 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.080
 in celebration 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 sometimes it sounds a lot better in 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.160
 english so when i go m in french 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.140
 it's more like that so everything depends on it 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.410
 mixed a little bit the two french friends 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.410
 English 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:42.629
 there i went to los angeles so i 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.400
 does a featuring with an American so 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.790
 I signed with an American label 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.629
 on this title there and so he will go out 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.030
 for september 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.769
 we have already shot the clip there superb 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.939
 frankly the images are 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.590
 beautiful and ben I can say that 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.959
 was waiting for September and see my new 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.500
 title my new clip in any case he 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.150
 worth the detour 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 I would like to make a message to all my 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.120
 fans to all who follow me it's 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.159
 true that the clip he came out at the same 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.200
 not three days it was hard we were at 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.520
 more than 150000 already seen 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.080
 I wanted to thank them and jump on 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.280
 the thinness of the messages to make 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.440
 pictures even though I do not have time to 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.200
 meet everyone 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.580
 I still bind what happens and I 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.470
 wanted to thank them because without 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.470
 them I would not be here today actually
