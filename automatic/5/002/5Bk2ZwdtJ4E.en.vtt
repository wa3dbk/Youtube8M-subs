00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:22.576
 The bright moonlight is approaching to wake me up 

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:23.761
 (LIGHT BORN) 

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:33.521
 The light born with force will shine eternally upon me 

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:51.775
 A moon crystal that opens a door in the night sky 

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:58.506
 I was too scared to explore the moon, 

00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:03.761
 well I know the darkness well. I lived hidden 

00:01:04.246 --> 00:01:12.036
 The wind that blew disturbed my agitated heart 

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:17.646
 Catch it to my lonely heart 

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:23.067
 The bright moonlight is approaching to wake me up 

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:24.366
 (LIGHT BORN) 

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:29.716
 I have seen sinners flourish in the darkness of the night 

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:34.646
 The moon judged them at a distance 

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:35.896
 (LIGHT BORN) 

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:42.146
 The bright moonlight is approaching to wake me up 

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:44.836
 (Moonlight, Moonlight, wake me up 

00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:47.727
 Receiving you, awake from the darkness 

00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:50.736
 Disoriented, Disoriented, while I take your hand 

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.756
 the night approaches to torment us) 

00:01:54.136 --> 00:02:03.636
 Countless times I try to touch the moonlight reflected on the surface of the water 

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:16.236
 A life burned continuously without being completely consumed, now I understand eternity 

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:23.786
 Light enters my mind, like a parasite of my fragile heart 

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:30.096
 My dark night will judge sinners 

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:35.256
 The moonlight is transformed into madness 

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:36.626
 (LIGHT BORN) 

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:41.776
 The light was transformed into a sword that 

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:46.896
 it crosses my being to withstand the pain 

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:48.180
 (LIGHT BORN) 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:55.120
 Eternally judging everyone with its radiance, rising light 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:30.870
 I was always drowned in a sleepy voice and that soft light 

00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:42.340
 Even if everything disappears from this world, I will never forget my life, my heart 

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.875
 My lonely heart 

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:51.945
 The bright moonlight is approaching to wake me up 

00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:53.236
 (LIGHT BORN) 

00:03:53.236 --> 00:03:58.456
 I have seen sinners flourish in the darkness of the night 

00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:03.575
 The moon judged them at a distance 

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:04.826
 (LIGHT BORN) 

00:04:04.826 --> 00:04:11.094
 Live eternally shining brightly, light rising 

00:04:11.094 --> 00:04:13.664
 (Moonlight, moonlight, is judging me 

00:04:13.664 --> 00:04:16.535
 A light that nobody is looking for 

00:04:16.535 --> 00:04:19.445
 Disconcerted, Disconcerted, in this black night 

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:26.885
 lies a perpetual misfortune)
