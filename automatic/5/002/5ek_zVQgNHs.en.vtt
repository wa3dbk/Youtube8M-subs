sectors<00:01:45.010> which<00:01:45.400> we<00:01:45.580> now<00:01:45.760> represent<00:01:46.300> have<00:01:47.080> a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
sectors which we now represent have a

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.040 
sectors which we now represent have a
natural<00:01:47.760> linkage<00:01:48.760> anyway<00:01:49.120> for<00:01:49.450> example<00:01:49.900> a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
natural linkage anyway for example a

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.840 
natural linkage anyway for example a
strong<00:01:50.710> tourist<00:01:51.070> industry<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.610> very

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
strong tourist industry is very

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.540 
strong tourist industry is very
important<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.450> underpin<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.710> services<00:01:54.370> which

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
important to underpin the services which

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.800 
important to underpin the services which
are<00:01:54.700> provided<00:01:54.850> for<00:01:55.240> financial<00:01:55.660> services

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
are provided for financial services

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.200 
are provided for financial services
financial<00:01:56.530> services<00:01:57.100> need<00:01:57.310> good<00:01:57.520> hotels<00:01:57.880> good

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
financial services need good hotels good

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.110 
financial services need good hotels good
restaurants<00:01:59.080> good<00:02:00.070> air<00:02:00.250> links<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.790> island

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
restaurants good air links to the island

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.580 
restaurants good air links to the island
so<00:02:01.390> one<00:02:01.660> supports<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.680> other<00:02:04.590> inclusive

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
so one supports the other inclusive

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.200 
so one supports the other inclusive
efficiencies<00:02:06.160> for<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.400> department<00:02:06.940> we're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
efficiencies for the department we're

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.639 
efficiencies for the department we're
now<00:02:07.420> going<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.780> be<00:02:07.870> able<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.080> work<00:02:08.200> much<00:02:08.440> more

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
now going to be able to work much more

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.830 
now going to be able to work much more
closely<00:02:08.920> together<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.820> identify<00:02:10.330> synergies

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
of cross-sectoral work which we need to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.259

start encouraging more of so again part
of<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.450> rationale<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.260> get<00:03:11.410> people
