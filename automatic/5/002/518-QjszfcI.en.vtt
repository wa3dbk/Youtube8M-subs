00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.630
 since I was little I've always wanted 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.309
 be able to teach others and you can see 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.259
 little one put my dolls today 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.490
 I repeated a bit what I suppose 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.830
 is what all children do 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.660
 When you get home you repeat what you 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.900
 have you seen at school not 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.970
 I love my job 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.180
 because you are helping the children to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.490
 learn not only content but 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.980
 to learn how to look for those things 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.760
 that they will not need when when 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.460
 be children but always not 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.699
 I do plastic classes with lines of 11 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.129
 or 12 years old I always think a bit like I do 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.989
 when they enter the door as they leave 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.719
 to find the class so that either 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.789
 the first motivation sign then 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.079
 a few days he took down the tables and I put them 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.019
 four by four other times the 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.059
 I put in eleven tables in a row other times 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.979
 I put a screen that I have cartons and 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.269
 covered what what they are going to have to 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.760
 draw what they are going to have to do 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.530
 I try that the activities can 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.860
 do all and that the results are 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.020
 different each one has to be able 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.360
 find and must be able to get the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.950
 solution that goes with it there are always the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.350
 fears that each one has and 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.360
 beliefs that we have of if I'm going to 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.100
 know how to do is that I know I do not know 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.319
 draw is that this is not going to 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.569
 going out then breaking up with that sometimes is 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.860
 very complicated then it's another 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.270
 learning have to go making 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.610
 force in which you are explaining to them that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.530
 making mistakes is a common thing and what we 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.420
 happens to everyone and that we have made mistakes 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.860
 to learn then what do you do a drawing 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.209
 and it does not work out well because we take another 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.740
 paper nothing happens that we keep it 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.869
 because the process is fundamental 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.190
 then one day I was probably drawing a 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.480
 eye and it has not gone well but jolin 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.290
 What good has come when you 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.290
 the second time not 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.020
 and chase we're all creative what 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.470
 It happens that when one is small you do not have 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.120
 fear you have not yet entered those that are 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.710
 supposes that he is creative in what he does not 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.600
 which is nice in what is not and then you 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.720
 you let it go as we get 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.300
 older begin the embarrassments you start 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.010
 to be more afraid of what they will say and 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.500
 then all this is hanging a little 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.789
 creativity but creativity I 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.490
 I think we have it all and what 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.530
 important is to try it and see how one 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.850
 feel and that's what I think we 've 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.850
 to transmit to children
