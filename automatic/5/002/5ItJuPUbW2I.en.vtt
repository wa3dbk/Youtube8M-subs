 you have a little power that air in a 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.000
 different taste to the situation 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.760

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.840
 inner 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.120
 I have to learn I put another 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.700
 little bit of water because it will have between those 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.130
 globe gets to take it here it would take 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.710
 for everything passes but as my friend 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.140
 maximum light goes I brought it 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.630
 because only the color will go to work 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.630
 with the blender and a half 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.300
 damages cellar 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:31.110
 instead some wonder the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:34.629
 good stuff never ends and deep 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.170
 made a nice but we're going to put it 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.799
 inside 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.470
 and help us even a little and this 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:47.829
 as long as there is a voice inside the water it is 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.650
 known the pope plans unearthed the ship 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.430
 the soul has been adding some 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.040
 salt and this will be easy for about 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.769
 quarter of an hour twenty minutes that retreats 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.060
 slightly and you have found a lot c 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.409
 in the mail 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.420
 we are here with our soup of 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.799
 beans try to breed that foam 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.930
 tina here instead of seeing 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:12.459
 some brings so many recipes 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.019
 here they are, but our window is ready 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.680
 ten minutes passed quarter of an hour 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.139
 boiled slightly admired now there are 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.289
 the thing to do is throw the rare part 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.560
 making mass hunger simone central but the 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.210
 throws the dough famous Bombolotti here 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.900
 in the bean soup 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.090
 I'm going to throw now wait around 10 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.570
 minutes that they know things and then 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.930
 will be ready to be eaten by 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.270
 see you when we're almost there 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.650
 come bush to the end must 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.930
 be too liquid 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.270
 our pasta and beans are ready 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.610
 just the square but I recommend when 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.730
 Cook the pasta but boil it 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.610
 really strong because otherwise you will 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.960
 attacks and is not good turned in place 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.140
 try cook over medium-low heat 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.930
 let's take a nice little bowl 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.160
 I recommend a code for a while 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:18.030
 look at those five beautiful elements 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.480
 pasta should not be too stiff in the 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:26.960
 body nyanza a gadget look at us 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:33.380
 beauty thing to do in a manner 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:38.330
 massive dynamite theodonium 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:41.880
 then some would like to see it badly 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:45.540
 but you have the finesse there, however 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.210
 all in here is not there and then 105 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.090
 rate for a plate of one in the same way 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.880
 delicacy of a flavor and a mixture 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.050
 that best remembered by a sniper 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.770
 thousands not calculable but of a taste 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:05.569
 beyond those games with this recipe 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:09.909
 I also greet a family 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.909
 Greek is the blink of an eye
