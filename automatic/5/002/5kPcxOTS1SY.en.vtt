in<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> beginning<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.230> start<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.710> had

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
in the beginning in the start we had

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.980 
in the beginning in the start we had
some<00:00:28.980> problems<00:00:29.429> playing<00:00:29.730> away<00:00:29.970> which<00:00:30.810> we

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
some problems playing away which we

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.410 
some problems playing away which we
repaired<00:00:31.349> afterwards<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.730> still<00:00:33.000> stay<00:00:33.390> on

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
repaired afterwards and we still stay on

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.060 
repaired afterwards and we still stay on
a<00:00:33.570> very<00:00:33.840> successful<00:00:34.260> series<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> now<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
a very successful series up to now so

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.069 
a very successful series up to now so
increasing<00:00:38.070> performances<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.450> bones

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
increasing performances and and bones

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.600 
increasing performances and and bones
are<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.340> expect<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.989> only<00:00:43.230> thing

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
are all you can expect the only thing

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.060 
are all you can expect the only thing
negative<00:00:44.610> point<00:00:44.879> i<00:00:45.809> would<00:00:46.289> say<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.710> should<00:00:46.739> try

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
negative point i would say we should try

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.250 
negative point i would say we should try
to<00:00:47.100> work<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.539> difficult<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.050> work

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to work on but it's so difficult to work

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.069 
to work on but it's so difficult to work
on<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:50.489> trying<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.239> more<00:00:51.480> constant

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
on that's trying to be more constant

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.880 
on that's trying to be more constant
over<00:00:52.649> several<00:00:52.920> games<00:00:53.719> first<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
over several games first of all and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.819 
over several games first of all and
secondly<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> same<00:00:57.420> game<00:00:57.829> being

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
secondly in one on the same game being

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.920 
secondly in one on the same game being
more<00:00:59.100> constant<00:00:59.609> we<00:01:00.120> had<00:01:00.239> too<00:01:00.390> many<00:01:00.539> games

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
more constant we had too many games

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.709 
more constant we had too many games
whether<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:02.039> lost<00:01:02.280> points<00:01:02.520> whether<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.149> even

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
whether we lost points whether we even

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.679 
whether we lost points whether we even
want<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:05.670> played<00:01:05.880> well<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.119> one<00:01:06.479> hole

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
want that we played well for one hole

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.109 
want that we played well for one hole
and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.229> suddenly<00:01:07.619> nothing<00:01:07.740> anymore<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.970> had

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
and then suddenly nothing anymore we had

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.380 
and then suddenly nothing anymore we had
a<00:01:09.150> bad<00:01:09.360> start<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.900> only<00:01:10.560> after<00:01:10.770> 20<00:01:11.520> 40<00:01:12.090> minutes

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
a bad start and only after 20 40 minutes

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
a bad start and only after 20 40 minutes
we<00:01:12.570> came<00:01:12.780> into<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> game<00:01:13.369> what<00:01:14.369> are<00:01:14.490> your

you're<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.310> situation<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:42.180> think<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you're in this situation I think that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
you're in this situation I think that
when<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.890> points<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> deserve

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
when you have these points you deserve

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.840 
when you have these points you deserve
them<00:01:44.939> first<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.979> should<00:01:47.369> translate

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
them first of all this should translate

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.249 
them first of all this should translate
our<00:01:48.810> real<00:01:49.640> status<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.970> position<00:01:51.090> towards<00:01:51.780> our

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
our real status and position towards our

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.850 
our real status and position towards our
closest<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.250> tell<00:01:53.549> competitors<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.829> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
closest to tell competitors but what I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.969 
closest to tell competitors but what I
didn't<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.030> won't<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.479> after

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
didn't do up to now I won't do it after

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.139 
didn't do up to now I won't do it after
the<00:01:58.979> break

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.510 

because<00:02:03.149> at<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.600> moment<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.310> lose

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
because at that moment you you you lose

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.779 
because at that moment you you you lose
focus<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:07.320> clothes<00:02:07.560> reality<00:02:08.160> being<00:02:08.580> your

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
focus on the clothes reality being your

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.240 
focus on the clothes reality being your
next<00:02:09.090> your<00:02:09.599> next<00:02:09.660> game<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.319> think<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.039> being

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
next your next game I think as being

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.670 
next your next game I think as being
Copenhagen<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:12.989> what<00:02:13.230> your<00:02:13.440> final

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
Copenhagen you know what your final

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800 
Copenhagen you know what your final
target<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.730> that's<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.000> far<00:02:15.090> away<00:02:15.360> that's

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
target is but that's so far away that's

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.070 
target is but that's so far away that's
end<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.200> may<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.730> between<00:02:18.090> targets<00:02:18.599> should

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
end of may the in between targets should
