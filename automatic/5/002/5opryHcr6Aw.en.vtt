pigmented<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.920> problem<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.430> i<00:02:18.490> have<00:02:18.520> with

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
pigmented the problem that i have with

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.420 
pigmented the problem that i have with
it<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:20.850> then<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.000> looks<00:02:22.420> really<00:02:23.350> chalky<00:02:23.950> i

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
it is then it looks really chalky i

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.220 
it is then it looks really chalky i
think<00:02:24.940> because<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.540> really<00:02:25.959> thick

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
think because of the really thick

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.410 
think because of the really thick
consistency<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.400> product<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.030> then

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
consistency of the product and then

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.530 
consistency of the product and then
because<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.170> pigmented<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.340> i<00:02:30.760> try<00:02:31.510> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
because it's so pigmented so i try and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.030 
because it's so pigmented so i try and
wipe<00:02:31.720> as<00:02:31.870> much<00:02:32.050> off<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.590> tip<00:02:32.800> applicator

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
wipe as much off of the tip applicator

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.360 
wipe as much off of the tip applicator
as<00:02:33.550> i<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.970> draw<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:35.170> as<00:02:35.380> sheer<00:02:35.709> as<00:02:35.920> i<00:02:36.070> can

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
as i can draw it on as sheer as i can

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.930 
as i can draw it on as sheer as i can
and<00:02:36.760> then<00:02:36.820> um<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:38.170> looks<00:02:38.200> more<00:02:39.070> natural<00:02:39.130> that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
and then um it looks more natural that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.030 
and then um it looks more natural that
way<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:40.780> still<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.170> don't<00:02:41.380> like<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.770> way<00:02:41.800> that

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
way but still I don't like the way that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.180 
way but still I don't like the way that
it<00:02:42.160> finishes<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:43.300> kind<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.690> has<00:02:43.870> them<00:02:44.170> like<00:02:45.100> a
