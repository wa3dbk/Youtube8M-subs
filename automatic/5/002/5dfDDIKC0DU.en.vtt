00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
artichoke you begin by cutting off the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.220 
artichoke you begin by cutting off the
tough<00:00:50.460> stem<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> always

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
tough stem just like this but I always

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
tough stem just like this but I always
leave<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:52.620> bit<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.309> kind<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.579> grab<00:00:53.879> hold

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.900 
leave a little bit to kind of grab hold
of<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:54.600> you're<00:00:54.750> cooking<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.399> also<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.789> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
here so that you kind of expose the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.329 
here so that you kind of expose the
inner<00:01:01.500> leaves<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.860> chop<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.100> off

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
inner leaves so just chop that off

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.660 
inner leaves so just chop that off
perfect<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> very<00:01:07.770> very<00:01:08.070> last<00:01:08.369> step

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
perfect and then the very very last step

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.060 
perfect and then the very very last step
is<00:01:08.970> using<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.840> pair<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.110> kitchen<00:01:10.320> shears<00:01:10.530> is

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
is using a pair of kitchen shears is

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.789 
is using a pair of kitchen shears is
just<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.640> snip<00:01:12.000> off<00:01:12.180> these<00:01:13.080> sharp<00:01:13.470> little

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
just to snip off these sharp little

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
just to snip off these sharp little
pointy<00:01:14.189> edges<00:01:15.020> which<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:17.119> impale<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
pointy edges which will impale you

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
pointy edges which will impale you
otherwise<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.799> we're<00:01:20.070> gonna<00:01:20.159> keep<00:01:20.369> going

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
otherwise and we're gonna keep going

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.050 
otherwise and we're gonna keep going
until<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.390> all<00:01:21.570> nice<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> simple<00:01:22.619> okay<00:01:23.060> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
until it's all nice and simple okay so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
until it's all nice and simple okay so
now<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.299> these<00:01:24.509> edges<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.140> snipped<00:01:25.650> off

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
now that these edges are all snipped off

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.969 
now that these edges are all snipped off
the<00:01:26.580> key<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.780> rub<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.650> lemon

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the key is to just rub it with the lemon

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
the key is to just rub it with the lemon
on<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.430> cut<00:01:29.640> part<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.299> oxidizes<00:01:30.960> really

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
on the cut part this oxidizes really

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.469 
on the cut part this oxidizes really
really<00:01:31.590> fast<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.250> by<00:01:32.640> putting<00:01:32.970> some<00:01:33.180> lemon

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
really fast so by putting some lemon

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.700 
really fast so by putting some lemon
juice<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.020> we're<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.229> stop<00:01:34.530> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
juice on it we're gonna stop that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.590 
juice on it we're gonna stop that
process<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.670> while<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.000> prepare<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.479> other

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
process so while we prepare the other

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630 
process so while we prepare the other
ones<00:01:36.900> we're<00:01:37.740> gonna<00:01:37.829> let<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.100> kind<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.400> soak

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
ones we're gonna let this kind of soak

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
ones we're gonna let this kind of soak
in<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> lemon<00:01:39.060> juice<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.509> let's<00:01:39.630> keep<00:01:39.810> going

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
in the lemon juice and let's keep going

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780 
in the lemon juice and let's keep going
until<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.770> our<00:01:40.979> artichokes<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.579> nice

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
until all of our artichokes are nice

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.510 
until all of our artichokes are nice
snipped<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.479> clean<00:01:42.829> okay<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.009> our<00:01:44.100> artichokes

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
snipped and clean okay so our artichokes

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.069 
snipped and clean okay so our artichokes
are<00:01:44.670> all<00:01:44.820> prepared<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:45.750> start<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
are all prepared and they start to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.380 
are all prepared and they start to
oxidize<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.619> fastly<00:01:47.009> I've<00:01:47.189> been<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.880> crazy

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
oxidize so fastly I've been like a crazy

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.999 
oxidize so fastly I've been like a crazy
