00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.400
 hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.260
 the online pet channel today is that 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.869
 patricia here that know of 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.910
 have seen it in the video of the waves 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.980
 with the iron link and good today we're going 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.310
 to teach this hairstyle that good as 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.710
 You see, they're pretty open waves because 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.030
 she has very long hair and they are 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.190
 made with the same conical tendency in 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 the video you will see the use in the 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.550
 information box you have a link 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.780
 direct to the product as always and I'll 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.910
 show you a little about how the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.010
 hairstyle and how I'm going to modify it 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.620
 little opening the curl as you see has 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.570
 a fairly open wave remained 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.280
 in the face after doing all the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.229
 waves and good to open a little more 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.229
 we would throw a bit of the tip 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.920
 and we would give volume to the root 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.690
 we can open a little bit with the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.490
 fingers but good I prefer to throw for 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.040
 Do not miss that nice curl that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.340
 has stayed and simply give volume with 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.320
 the fingers 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.969
 if you see that it looks more open 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.490
 while this side follows more more 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.079
 defined and it would be then those two ways 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.850
 a little more what we like the most 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.109
 that I really prefer to ruffle 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.319
 the one bit so you do not notice it so much 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:32.570
 so much that it is a hairstyle done let's say 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.729
 It seems more natural 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.260
 and in this way we give you more more 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.260
 movement to the curls 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.970
 so it would be then we are giving more 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.790
 more volume and the hours left a 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.080
 Gorgeous hairstyle we leave with him with 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.080
 step by step and we hope you like it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.760
 yes 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:12.780
 from me 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.640
 look 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.380
 how 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.489
 look no 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.630
 I do not 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.890
 t 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.910
 mine 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.680
 and now that 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.680
 of course 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.240
 a language 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.410
 Wow nice 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.030
 and 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.030
 The tyrant 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
 m 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.539
 Amen
