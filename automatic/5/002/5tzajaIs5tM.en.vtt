00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.100 

but<00:04:17.280> it's<00:04:17.370> not<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.640> easiest<00:04:18.030> thing<00:04:18.360> ever<00:04:18.510> so

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
but it's not the easiest thing ever so

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.890 
but it's not the easiest thing ever so
it's<00:04:19.260> about<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:20.250> middle

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
it's about the middle

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.940 
it's about the middle
how<00:04:22.530> many<00:04:22.740> pieces<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.400> has<00:04:24.290> good<00:04:25.290> question<00:04:25.830> I

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
how many pieces it has good question I

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.780 
how many pieces it has good question I
did<00:04:26.220> use<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> lot<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:26.880> one<00:04:27.180> by<00:04:27.360> ones<00:04:29.900> or<00:04:31.790> let's

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
did use a lot of one by ones or let's

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.920 
did use a lot of one by ones or let's
just<00:04:32.970> make<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> rough<00:04:33.720> estimation<00:04:34.260> about<00:04:35.930> 800

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
just make a rough estimation about 800

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:45.610 
just make a rough estimation about 800
pieces<00:04:37.170> a<00:04:40.820> few<00:04:41.820> less<00:04:42.030> than<00:04:42.330> my<00:04:42.540> lego<00:04:42.840> mansion

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.470 

because<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.980> has<00:04:47.160> lots<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.730> lots<00:04:48.030> of<00:04:48.210> tiny

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
because it has lots and lots of tiny

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.550 
because it has lots and lots of tiny
pieces<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.850> that<00:04:50.880> concludes<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.870> video<00:04:52.170> and

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
pieces so that concludes the video and

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.010 
pieces so that concludes the video and
I'll<00:04:52.770> see<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.100> later<00:04:53.130> bye
