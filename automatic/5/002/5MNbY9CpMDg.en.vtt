00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
it's almost like by looking away a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.970 
it's almost like by looking away a
little<00:02:28.990> bit<00:02:29.110> you're<00:02:29.230> softening<00:02:29.800> you're

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
little bit you're softening you're

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.440 
little bit you're softening you're
taking<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> pressure<00:02:30.610> off<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.060> know<00:02:31.180> horses

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
taking the pressure off you know horses

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.540 
taking the pressure off you know horses
feel<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.870> pressure<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.410> they<00:02:32.530> they<00:02:33.160> then

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
feel the pressure and they they then

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.010 
feel the pressure and they they then
they<00:02:33.670> feel<00:02:33.850> when<00:02:34.000> there's<00:02:34.180> less<00:02:34.390> pressure<00:02:34.630> so

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
they feel when there's less pressure so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.910 
they feel when there's less pressure so
that's<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.320> good<00:02:35.440> point

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
that's a good point

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.260 
that's a good point
but<00:02:36.280> another<00:02:36.490> thing<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.880> when<00:02:37.060> you're<00:02:37.180> working
