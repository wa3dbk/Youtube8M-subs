 the entry point and a system of 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.300
 decalcification can help you 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.540
 prevent the formation of deposits in 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.540
 Places such as the water heater

 configurations and they are usually 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.390
 designed to provide drinking water 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.610
 the best water filter at the point of 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.310
 use may depend on the amount of 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.620
 water that you need every day a filter

 provide a convenient source of 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.450
 cold water and are very easy to use
