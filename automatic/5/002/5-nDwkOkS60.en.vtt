00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:11.750
 and good the ones that you are as you are well 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.420
 For behold I am here today to show you 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:20.300
 to prepare stewed potatoes with 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:23.630
 veal we're going to need potatoes that 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.779
 As you can see, I have them here, chopped and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.089
 prepared I usually do what I do 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.369
 is to measure by plate the dish that 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.070
 let's have a deep house where 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.460
 let's use a little dish for each 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.500
 person here that there are four people who 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.390
 there are five then a little dish for each one 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.359
 and so we have left 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.840
 we also have here chopped an onion 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:51.019
 big four carrots and five or six 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.839
 garlic depends on whether the onion is 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.720
 smaller ones put one or two yo 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:00.380
 is that it was very large chopped just one 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.200
 we have here also tomato fried i them 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.840
 I can take this one because the truth is that 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 I really like what I buy and have a 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.120
 Very rich flavor and of course here 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.610
 we have our half pound of beef the 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.190
 that we will buy will be the one that is special 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 for stews because it's more tender 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.630
 Well, let's start 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.450
 here we have our pot and we're going to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.770
 throw olive oil 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.770
 let's go tantito 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.220
 so that after sofrito is done well 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.220
 OK 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.850
 and we are going to proceed to take what is the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:59.150
 Garlic onion and carrot all to the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:02:01.640
 Once she said to be good while you 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.160
 we believed the vegetable 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.110
 let's go cutting the fillets 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.110
 veal in smaller pieces worth 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 ah 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.170
 ah 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.370
 Well, we have our challenge here now 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.269
 we are going to throw 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.269
 tomato 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.060
 I want to take three good spoonful if not 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.240
 you have this kind of tomato because 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:45.020
 you know two good success tomatoes that are 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.860
 well-colored the picas well minced 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.860
 Oh 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.860
 ah 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:00.260
 well let's let it boil a 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:02.360
 little so I will be good mix 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.080
 I'm going to teach now a trick that I do 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.150
 me because as I have a small child 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.069
 Well, you know what it is 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.040
 the carrot here that is 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.790
 a piece of onion then I for 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.130
 that I eat everything I do is what 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.980
 next when I have the rehash 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.650
 done as you see, what I do is 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.650
 grind it let's remove 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:38.310
 Well, with your arm, let's take 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.310
 let's move our successes well 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.740
 good gay we have it here well ground 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.210
 so our children can not find anything 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.120
 and I told him what it is but he has 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.110
 a lot of vitamin and now let's take 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.110
 our veal 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.840
 to our veal we're going to 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.960
 Take a little salt and pepper 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.960
 milled 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.189
 ah 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.560
 ah 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.200
 ah 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.470
 good and now we're going to pour wine 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.470
 white a good jet 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:45.750
 and we will let our meat and he go a 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.750
 little bit so he's doing 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:57.740
 we are going to give them another little bit of good 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.410

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.180

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.610

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.070
 potatoes and let's close the pot the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.830
 meat is going to be super tender but 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.110
