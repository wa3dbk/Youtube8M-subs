00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
properties as you can see if you check

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.510 
properties as you can see if you check
it<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.660> NTFS<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.430> you

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it out right here it is NTFS now if you

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.250 
it out right here it is NTFS now if you
try<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.030> format<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.840> way<00:00:46.050> I've

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
try and just format it this way I've

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.799 
try and just format it this way I've
already<00:00:46.530> written<00:00:46.770> zeros<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> drive<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
already written zeros to the drive so it

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
already written zeros to the drive so it
should<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.410> go<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.670> see

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
should be good to go but as you can see

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.840 
should be good to go but as you can see
there's<00:00:51.149> only<00:00:51.300> NTFS<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.199> expat<00:00:52.890> now<00:00:53.280> exFAT

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
there's only NTFS and expat now exFAT

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.740 
there's only NTFS and expat now exFAT
does<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.360> work<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.930> either<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.440> ps3<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.250> 360

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
does not work on either the ps3 or 360

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.150 
does not work on either the ps3 or 360
so<00:00:57.750> you're<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.559> need<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> figure<00:00:58.949> out

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
so you're going to need to figure out

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.369 
so you're going to need to figure out
how<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> format<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.910> fat32<00:01:00.329> somehow<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
how to format it to fat32 somehow and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.450 
how to format it to fat32 somehow and
there<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> way<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.250> through

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
there is a way you can do through

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.310 
there is a way you can do through
command<00:01:02.789> prompt<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.719> show<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.290> easy

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
command prompt to show you a really easy

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.770 
command prompt to show you a really easy
way<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> through<00:01:05.159> GUI<00:01:05.460> format<00:01:06.030> so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
way to do it through GUI format so

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
way to do it through GUI format so
anyways<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> make<00:01:08.130> sure

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you have any data you have on that drive

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.740 
you have any data you have on that drive
that's<00:01:10.560> important<00:01:11.010> backed<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.540> come

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that's important backed up and then come

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.710 
that's important backed up and then come
over<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.560> our<00:01:13.590> format<00:01:14.340> tool<00:01:14.580> select<00:01:15.479> what

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
over here to our format tool select what

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.020 
over here to our format tool select what
drive<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.290> want<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.950> very<00:01:17.189> careful<00:01:17.369> as

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
drive you want now be very careful as

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.820 
drive you want now be very careful as
you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.570> shows<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.350> drive<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you can see it shows here what drive it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
you can see it shows here what drive it
is<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> make<00:01:21.570> sure<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:21.990> not

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
is but you want to make sure you're not

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
is but you want to make sure you're not
formatting<00:01:22.740> another<00:01:23.040> Drive<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.610> your

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
formatting another Drive in your

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.060 
formatting another Drive in your
computer<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.450> example<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.259> formatted<00:01:25.950> my

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
computer for example if I formatted my

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.830 
computer for example if I formatted my
one<00:01:26.340> terabyte<00:01:26.850> hard<00:01:27.000> drive<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.390> all<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:27.630> data

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
one terabyte hard drive with all my data

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.719 
one terabyte hard drive with all my data
that'd<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> bit<00:01:28.770> detrimental<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:29.520> now

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that'd be a bit detrimental right now

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.399 
that'd be a bit detrimental right now
but<00:01:30.329> anyways<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.869> you're<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.290> is

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
but anyways what you're going to do is

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.350 
but anyways what you're going to do is
