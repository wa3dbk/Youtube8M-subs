mama<00:03:52.980> taught<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.430> probably<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.880> process

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
mama taught this probably is a process

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.150

of<00:03:54.480> bronzer<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.109> people<00:03:55.410> probably<00:03:55.859> lighter

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
of bronzer to people probably lighter

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.250 
of bronzer to people probably lighter
than<00:03:56.459> me<00:03:56.579> but<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.750> best<00:03:57.930> face

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
than me but this is like the best face

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.009 
than me but this is like the best face
color<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.799> use<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.340> think<00:03:59.760> because<00:04:00.329> number<00:04:00.870> one

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
color in use I think because number one

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.840 
color in use I think because number one
I<00:04:01.139> pick<00:04:01.410> two<00:04:01.530> reasons<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.160> more<00:04:02.489> than<00:04:02.609> one

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
I pick two reasons it's more than one

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.530 
I pick two reasons it's more than one
color<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.239> it's<00:04:03.569> not<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:03.780> enough<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:08.540> mosque

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
color so it's not just enough a mosque

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.809 
color so it's not just enough a mosque
of<00:04:09.780> ugly<00:04:10.109> your<00:04:10.260> face<00:04:10.620> it's<00:04:11.370> got<00:04:11.519> some<00:04:11.670> light
