in<00:01:32.820> half<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.220> then<00:01:35.220> each<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> these<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.850> going

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
in half and then each of these is going

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.190 
in half and then each of these is going
to<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.120> a<00:01:36.150> shoe<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.720> great<00:01:36.960> thing<00:01:36.990> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
to be a shoe now the great thing is

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
to be a shoe now the great thing is
because<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:38.010> cut<00:01:38.160> it<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.310> half<00:01:38.370> I<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
because I just cut it in half I have a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
because I just cut it in half I have a
flat<00:01:39.300> spot<00:01:39.600> already<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.010> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
flat spot already so all I want to do is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.430 
flat spot already so all I want to do is
kind<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.370> use<00:01:41.550> that<00:01:41.580> as<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:42.030> shoe<00:01:42.630> sole<00:01:43.080> and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
kind of use that as my shoe sole and

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.310 
kind of use that as my shoe sole and
then<00:01:43.920> turn<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.280> over<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.700> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.090> push<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
then turn it over and kind of push the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.280 
then turn it over and kind of push the
top<00:01:46.560> over<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.190> one<00:01:47.400> side<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:48.510> now<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:49.050> more

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
top over to one side so now I have more

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.680 
top over to one side so now I have more
of<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.500> flat<00:01:49.770> spot<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> top<00:01:50.730> of<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:51.030> shoe<00:01:51.390> and

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
of a flat spot on the top of my shoe and

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.740 
of a flat spot on the top of my shoe and
a<00:01:52.440> place<00:01:52.740> where<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.160> foot<00:01:53.580> would<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.180> now

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
a place where the foot would go in now

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.450 
a place where the foot would go in now
to<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:55.080> that<00:01:55.290> hole<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.620> little<00:01:55.920> bit<00:01:56.310> more

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
to make that hole a little bit more

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.940 
to make that hole a little bit more
obvious<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.180> mean<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.870> called<00:01:58.620> a<00:01:58.680> bulb

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
obvious I mean this is a called a bulb

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.280 
obvious I mean this is a called a bulb
euless<00:01:59.190> ball<00:01:59.400> tool<00:01:59.630> I'm<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:00.960> stick

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
euless ball tool I'm just going to stick

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.690 
euless ball tool I'm just going to stick
this<00:02:01.410> down<00:02:01.590> into<00:02:01.800> here<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.040> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.310> twist

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this down into here and kind of twist

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
this down into here and kind of twist
and<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.510> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.690> give<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.870> spot<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.590> my

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and this is going to give a spot for my

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.200 
and this is going to give a spot for my
pretzel<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.190> go<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> second

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
pretzel to go in and in just a second

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.059 
pretzel to go in and in just a second
now<00:02:06.870> what<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.050> want<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.260> do<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.650> finish<00:02:07.830> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
now what I want to do is to finish the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.290 
now what I want to do is to finish the
shoe<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.459> other<00:02:08.550> side<00:02:08.819> I'm<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.060> too

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
shoe on the other side I'm not too

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.150 
shoe on the other side I'm not too
concerned<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:10.019> how<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.410> looks<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> top

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
concerned on how this looks on the top

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.619 
concerned on how this looks on the top
you<00:02:11.190> could<00:02:11.489> shake<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.879> up<00:02:11.910> if<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.300> want<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
you could shake that up if you want to

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.540 
you could shake that up if you want to
but<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.379> be<00:02:13.470> upside<00:02:13.860> down<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.310> this

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
but it's going to be upside down so this

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.949 
but it's going to be upside down so this
is<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.849> side<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.330> really<00:02:15.629> want<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> pay

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
is the side that you really want to pay

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.569 
is the side that you really want to pay
attention<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.499> I'm<00:02:17.069> just<00:02:17.219> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.430> take<00:02:17.519> a

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
attention to I'm just going to take a

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.400 
attention to I'm just going to take a
little<00:02:17.879> cut<00:02:18.269> here

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
little cut here

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.070 
little cut here
and<00:02:19.530> then<00:02:19.740> push<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.790> indent<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.840> kind<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and then push to indent and that kind of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.680 
and then push to indent and that kind of
gives<00:02:22.290> almost<00:02:23.010> an<00:02:23.280> exact<00:02:23.700> replica<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
gives almost an exact replica of the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.180 
gives almost an exact replica of the
bottom<00:02:24.960> of<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.140> boot<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.860> I'm<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.010> going<00:02:26.130> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
bottom of a boot so I'm just going to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.770 
bottom of a boot so I'm just going to
set<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.490> down<00:02:26.790> make<00:02:27.060> sure<00:02:27.090> my<00:02:27.330> holes<00:02:27.570> looking

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
set that down make sure my holes looking

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.140 
set that down make sure my holes looking
good<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.230> my<00:02:28.320> pretzel<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.820> it's<00:02:29.940> going<00:02:30.060> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
good for my pretzel so it's going to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.670 
good for my pretzel so it's going to
take<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.300> pretzel<00:02:30.540> rod<00:02:30.840> know<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.320> these<00:02:31.440> too

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
take a pretzel rod know what these too

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.130 
take a pretzel rod know what these too
long<00:02:31.890> especially<00:02:32.580> because<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.050> go

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
long especially because it's going to go

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.840 
long especially because it's going to go
in<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.350> container<00:02:34.740> but<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.430> have<00:02:35.640> them

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
in the container but if you have them

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.310 
in the container but if you have them
really<00:02:36.390> really<00:02:36.600> long<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.960> looks<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.200> it's

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
really really long it looks like it's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.540 
really really long it looks like it's
not<00:02:37.410> really<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> leg<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.010> doesn't<00:02:38.190> belong<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.520> a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
not really a leg it doesn't belong to a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.700 
not really a leg it doesn't belong to a
Santa<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.600> I'm<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:39.840> going<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.050> cut<00:02:40.260> them<00:02:40.500> in

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
Santa so I'm just going to cut them in

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.550 
Santa so I'm just going to cut them in
pieces<00:02:41.030> about<00:02:42.030> two<00:02:42.600> inches<00:02:42.840> long<00:02:43.050> or<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.350> and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
pieces about two inches long or so and

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.150 
pieces about two inches long or so and
then<00:02:43.620> what<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.370> need<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.550> do<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:46.140> wrap<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.710> in<00:02:46.860> red

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
then what I need to do is wrap it in red

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.490 
then what I need to do is wrap it in red
so<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.150> certainly<00:02:48.480> coat<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.260> red

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
so you can certainly coat this in a red

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.030 
so you can certainly coat this in a red
candy<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.640> you're<00:02:50.850> not<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.300> fondant<00:02:52.020> user<00:02:52.200> but

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
candy if you're not a fondant user but

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.350 
candy if you're not a fondant user but
it's<00:02:53.220> really<00:02:53.400> easy<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.150> think<00:02:54.210> it

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
it's really easy to do this I think it

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.690 
it's really easy to do this I think it
has<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.480> really<00:02:54.780> nice<00:02:55.020> effect<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:56.280> roll<00:02:56.550> this

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
has a really nice effect just roll this

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.480 
has a really nice effect just roll this
out<00:02:57.200> nice<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.440> thin<00:02:58.650> I<00:03:00.950> always<00:03:01.950> keep<00:03:02.100> moving

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
out nice and thin I always keep moving

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.890 
out nice and thin I always keep moving
it<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.180> doesn't<00:03:03.420> stick<00:03:03.510> even

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
it like that so it doesn't stick even

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.850 
it like that so it doesn't stick even
though<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.020> have<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> little<00:03:04.380> bit<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.530> powdered

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
though I have a little bit of powdered

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.190 
though I have a little bit of powdered
sure<00:03:05.070> down<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:06.390> no<00:03:06.480> make<00:03:06.600> sure<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.020> not

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
sure down so no make sure it's not

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.320 
sure down so no make sure it's not
sticking<00:03:07.530> all<00:03:07.740> you're<00:03:07.950> rolling<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.700> out<00:03:08.760> okay

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
sticking all you're rolling it out okay

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.920 
sticking all you're rolling it out okay
so<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:09.960> have<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.850> thickness<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.390> want<00:03:12.600> i'm<00:03:12.780> going

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
so I have the thickness I want i'm going

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.590 
so I have the thickness I want i'm going
to<00:03:12.990> take<00:03:13.140> my<00:03:13.320> two<00:03:13.830> sided<00:03:14.100> wheel<00:03:14.610> cutter<00:03:14.910> and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
to take my two sided wheel cutter and

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.300 
to take my two sided wheel cutter and
i'm<00:03:15.690> going<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.960> cut<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.320> flat<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.040> side<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
i'm going to cut it flat on one side and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.980 
i'm going to cut it flat on one side and
then<00:03:20.310> i<00:03:20.370> want<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.670> make<00:03:20.760> sure<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.690> i<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.960> a

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
then i want to make sure that i have a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.080 
then i want to make sure that i have a
little<00:03:22.410> bit<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.710> pretzel<00:03:23.130> exposed<00:03:23.700> at<00:03:23.940> one

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
little bit of the pretzel exposed at one

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.030 
little bit of the pretzel exposed at one
end<00:03:24.300> because<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.590> going<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.770> be<00:03:25.890> where

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
end because this is going to be where

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.260 
end because this is going to be where
i'm<00:03:26.160> going<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.370> put<00:03:26.520> it<00:03:26.610> into<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.910> boot<00:03:27.120> and

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
i'm going to put it into the boot and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.310 
i'm going to put it into the boot and
have<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.480> little<00:03:27.630> bit<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.780> white<00:03:28.020> around<00:03:28.200> the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
have a little bit of white around the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.230 
have a little bit of white around the
edge<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.490> I'm<00:03:29.550> going<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.700> do<00:03:29.820> next<00:03:29.970> is

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
edge so what I'm going to do next is

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.240 
edge so what I'm going to do next is
just<00:03:30.630> make<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> nice<00:03:31.050> straight<00:03:31.680> line<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:32.130> this

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
just make a nice straight line on this

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.610 
just make a nice straight line on this
side<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.820> then<00:03:33.540> I'm<00:03:33.690> going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.050> remove<00:03:34.560> that

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
side and then I'm going to remove that

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.110 
side and then I'm going to remove that
and<00:03:34.830> put<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.160> little<00:03:35.220> bit<00:03:35.580> of<00:03:35.640> my<00:03:35.790> piping<00:03:36.150> gel<00:03:36.290> on

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
and put a little bit of my piping gel on

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.810 
and put a little bit of my piping gel on
the<00:03:39.140> red<00:03:40.140> fondant<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.770> just<00:03:41.250> kinda<00:03:41.459> want<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.610> dot

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
the red fondant I just kinda want to dot

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.290 
the red fondant I just kinda want to dot
it<00:03:41.940> all<00:03:42.060> over<00:03:43.040> nothing<00:03:44.040> too<00:03:44.220> thick<00:03:44.520> but<00:03:45.120> then

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
it all over nothing too thick but then

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.580 
it all over nothing too thick but then
again<00:03:45.420> leaving<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.050> little<00:03:46.170> bit<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
again leaving a little bit of the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.470 
again leaving a little bit of the
pretzel<00:03:46.920> exposed<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:48.030> can<00:03:48.209> pretty<00:03:48.390> much

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
pretzel exposed and you can pretty much

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.190 
pretzel exposed and you can pretty much
just<00:03:48.750> roll<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:50.630> make<00:03:51.630> sure<00:03:51.660> it's<00:03:51.930> sticking

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
just roll it and make sure it's sticking

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.600 
just roll it and make sure it's sticking
as<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.530> goes<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:52.920> then<00:03:53.040> you'll<00:03:53.130> cut<00:03:53.370> off<00:03:53.459> the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
as it goes and then you'll cut off the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.250 
as it goes and then you'll cut off the
excess<00:03:53.940> once<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.300> gets<00:03:54.510> around<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.989> where<00:03:55.140> it

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
excess once it gets around to where it

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.060 
excess once it gets around to where it
started<00:03:55.700> just<00:03:56.700> like<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.590> then<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.650> can<00:03:58.709> cut

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
started just like that then you can cut

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.590 
started just like that then you can cut
off<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.250> pinch<00:03:59.550> off<00:03:59.700> any<00:03:59.850> excess<00:04:00.180> down<00:04:00.390> there

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
off a pinch off any excess down there

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.360 
off a pinch off any excess down there
too<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.290> now<00:04:01.410> we've<00:04:01.560> got<00:04:01.709> basically<00:04:02.130> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
too so now we've got basically the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.840 
too so now we've got basically the
fabric<00:04:02.850> that's<00:04:02.970> wrapped<00:04:03.270> around<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.750> leg<00:04:03.989> and

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
fabric that's wrapped around the leg and

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.030 
fabric that's wrapped around the leg and
what<00:04:05.850> I'm<00:04:05.940> going<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.090> do<00:04:06.209> at<00:04:06.300> this<00:04:06.450> point<00:04:06.540> is

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
what I'm going to do at this point is

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.290 
what I'm going to do at this point is
again<00:04:08.040> with<00:04:08.190> my<00:04:08.280> piping<00:04:08.640> gel<00:04:08.700> it's<00:04:09.030> just<00:04:09.150> kind

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
again with my piping gel it's just kind

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.930 
again with my piping gel it's just kind
of<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.450> general<00:04:09.480> great<00:04:10.350> glue<00:04:11.280> for<00:04:11.580> everything

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
of a general great glue for everything

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.870 
of a general great glue for everything
one<00:04:12.150> little<00:04:12.360> dot<00:04:12.570> down<00:04:12.900> on<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.200> boot<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
one little dot down on the boot and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.300 
one little dot down on the boot and
while<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.000> boot<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.450> facing<00:04:16.080> down<00:04:16.310> that's

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
while the boot is facing down that's

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.470 
while the boot is facing down that's
where<00:04:17.580> I'm<00:04:17.669> going<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:18.000> just<00:04:18.150> don't<00:04:18.270> want<00:04:18.390> to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
where I'm going I just don't want to

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.690 
where I'm going I just don't want to
miss<00:04:19.260> form<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.709> from<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.010> bottom<00:04:20.280> side<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:20.669> I

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
miss form it from the bottom side so I

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.099 
miss form it from the bottom side so I
want<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.910> make<00:04:21.000> sure<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.270> stays<00:04:21.660> on<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.870> flat

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
want to make sure it stays on a flat

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.240 
want to make sure it stays on a flat
surface<00:04:22.140> I'm<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.800> going<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:22.980> push<00:04:23.220> down

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
surface I'm just going to push down

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.770 
surface I'm just going to push down
there<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.350> make<00:04:25.350> sure<00:04:25.380> it's<00:04:25.650> inserted<00:04:26.010> and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
there and make sure it's inserted and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.650 
there and make sure it's inserted and
then<00:04:27.780> if<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.320> do<00:04:28.380> push<00:04:28.860> out<00:04:29.100> any<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.180> my<00:04:30.330> shape

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
then if I do push out any of my shape

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.519 
then if I do push out any of my shape
you<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.080> always<00:04:31.320> go<00:04:31.620> back

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
you can always go back

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.949 
you can always go back
and<00:04:32.619> give<00:04:33.339> it<00:04:33.369> a<00:04:33.489> little<00:04:33.639> bit<00:04:33.819> more<00:04:34.029> shape<00:04:34.719> like

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:34.959 
and give it a little bit more shape like

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:37.019 
and give it a little bit more shape like
that<00:04:35.169> now<00:04:35.739> for<00:04:35.979> the<00:04:36.069> white<00:04:36.309> what<00:04:36.519> I<00:04:36.549> like<00:04:36.759> to<00:04:36.879> do

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:37.029 
that now for the white what I like to do
