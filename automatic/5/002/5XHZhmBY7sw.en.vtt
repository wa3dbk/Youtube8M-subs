00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.469
 Hello dear friends for you again 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.350
 accommodates liebert us after week 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.170
 rest on the sea losing all your skill 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.800
 I decided to fly on them bahnu so to speak 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.150
 for warming up and I liked it so much 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.900
 I decided to review one of them 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:32.730
 Meet the unique aircraft of the US Air Force f6 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 f hellkat make a reservation right off the plane 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.739
 so simple and I decided to review 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.670
 simpler and faster so let's start f6 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.579
 hellcat 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.960
 second rank fighter hits 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.179
 against ninth yak frederick of zero 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 occasionally opponents cannonballs 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:57.269
 seagulls and donkeys but this is not serious 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.329
 not afraid of any of these enemies 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:04.140
 against everyone it is easy to find your tactics 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.030
 games now talk about the merits and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.640
 the disadvantages of this unit 1 plus 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.860
 slaughter weapons on board we have 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.700
 six heavy machine guns 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.100
 Browning 2 seconds volley and any very 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.120
 high skill Paz 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.390
 goes to the hangar in my opinion cool 2 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.670
 plus excellent maneuverability 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.870
 Hellkat twist 80 percent of its 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.970
 enemies except slaughter of each aek 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.210
 connecting their huge flaps which 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.670
 look more like air brake turns 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.360
 we will do even spitfire therefore 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.930
 I repeat 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.640
 swearing battle on this plane flies 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.700
 with a bang 3 + good speed 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.030
 characteristics our american can 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.460
 easy to dive off scoops from 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.220
 Japanese, he comes off even in a straight line 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.510
 Well, with the Germans, his speed is actually 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.039
 do not need to do the withdrawal of the plane in moderation 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:13.250
 dynamic Well Now let's deal with 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.430
 disadvantages 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.489
 firstly hellcat is very very bad 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.720
 coming out of a dive this words no 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.660
 convey the feeling that after 450 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.110
 kilometers per hour pilot's hands dry up 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.950
 and he can't pull the handle 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.709
 so boom zoom 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.410
 or attack on verticals help these 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.220
 almost impossible except 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.799
 the enemy went into fact and secondly 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.739
 the plane loses much speed at 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.230
 using flaps affects them 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.900
 large area so let them out 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.940
 follows briefly though in battle 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.959
 there are different situations here all 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.650
 depends on you on this with flaws 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.110
 everything 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.480
 I would like to briefly talk about 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.700
 features of this unit which 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.209
 must be taken into account for 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.049
 productive playability on 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.260
 speeds 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:16.230
 the higher the speed of the aircraft 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.870
 making a turn and for myself I brought 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.260
 approximate regularity rate below 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.010
 400 aircraft perfectly maneuvers any 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.549
 duel won by default 450 and higher 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.250
 need to be careful when the gate is not 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.950
 go under the enemy and do not try to start the war 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.310
 spiral as this is tantamount to 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.040
 suicide as i understood on this 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.889
 the plane with the speed better say goodbye 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.209
 that is, dumping it so as not to merge 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.310
 however paradoxical it may sound 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.120
 tying up a fight with the enemy, I immediately adjust 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.680
 traction and go out on the optimal 350 400 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.810
 kilometers per hour I advise you too 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.889
 exception game against Japan where necessary 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.500
 hang the enemy and leave in a straight line 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.319
 if you remember these features 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.389
 aircraft then the game will turn for you into 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:18.000
 fun and easy bend on this with 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.390
 the theoretical part let's all go to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.690
 analysis of tactics based on all that 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.250
 I said earlier it is not difficult to guess that I 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.400
 build my fights 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.670
 through the turn the first act 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.830
 set of 3 maximum 4 kilometers of this 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.550
 enough but you can and more 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.690
 if you are not confident in your abilities further 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.880
 We are looking for enemy tying cornering fight 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.120
 remember for heavier and not as a rudder 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.250
 only you go for optimal speed 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.250
 tightening the shoot get frag 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.770
 go ahead look back 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.650
 if you need to dodge the enemy do not 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.100
 I advise you to walk exactly under it better 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.410
 go aside changes the trajectory if 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.630
 you miss the enemy shoot 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.970
 the opponent wanted after the attack on faith 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:21.930
 live take the fight all very simple these 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:27.630
 actions are repeated all the time attacking 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:30.360
 watch your speed do frag if 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.720
 did you get up against japan then climb 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.510
 above but without fanaticism and play from 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.020
 speed try to post the enemy 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.850
 go head-on break in dump playing 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.350
 on the aisles 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.960
 can be on turns tes spirit motor 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:51.510
 fighters and ki 61 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:55.460
 but not the clearance tactic is simple and 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:59.700
 effective go to the recommendations 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:03.180
 the first one I choose land tape as 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:06.200
 she breaks the wings and kills the pilots and by 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:10.070
 Dotam can work in which case. 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:15.300
 the second is correct traction 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.470
 I repeat it for the last time 3 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.710
 difficult opponent 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.380
 zero not often hellcat falls to the Japanese 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.440
 but take your plane 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.640
 attention is the case of what is zero 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.310
 number one goal four 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:37.550
 using flaps watch speed 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:41.670
 although you can do without them conclusion 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:45.030
 f6 hellcat simple plane with its 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:48.360
 features of the citizens of the battle to him almost 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.360
 no equal and against the whole armada of enemies 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.170
 he can oppose his turn or 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.590
 speed 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.960
 I consider this a kraft fight as for 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.960
 his level he possesses too 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.120
 good performance and if you 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.770
 newbie and want to learn how to work 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.630
 flap 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:11.370
 not really straining this plane for you 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.380
 the rest of the pilot, I recommend this 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.570
 apparatus for calm 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:20.190
 the night bend on this i have everything 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:23.030
