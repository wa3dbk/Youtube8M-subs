00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.229 
sure there's some easier ways to stuff
them<00:03:44.920> in<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.280> feet<00:03:45.520> are<00:03:45.550> kind<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.970> tricky

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
them in and the feet are kind of tricky

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.840 
them in and the feet are kind of tricky
too<00:03:46.540> but<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.830> good<00:03:48.010> side<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.280> means<00:03:48.640> they're

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
too but the good side that means they're

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.430 
too but the good side that means they're
not<00:03:48.880> going<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.209> fall<00:03:49.420> out<00:03:49.480> so<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:49.959> like<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.410> a

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
not going to fall out so I like that a

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.440 
not going to fall out so I like that a
lot<00:03:50.650> these<00:03:51.070> goggles<00:03:51.400> though<00:03:51.790> are<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> little

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
lot these goggles though are a little

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.530 
lot these goggles though are a little
loose<00:03:52.630> at<00:03:52.900> times<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.500> can<00:03:53.770> be<00:03:53.950> knocked<00:03:54.220> off

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
loose at times and can be knocked off

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.150 
loose at times and can be knocked off
but<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.750> would<00:03:55.840> take<00:03:55.870> some<00:03:56.320> significant

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
but it would take some significant

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.600 
but it would take some significant
knocking<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.820> do<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.890> overall<00:03:59.890> a<00:04:00.040> really<00:04:00.130> fun

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
knocking to do that overall a really fun

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.820 
knocking to do that overall a really fun
