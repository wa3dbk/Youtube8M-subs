nor<00:00:00.539> would<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:00.750> imagine<00:00:01.050> you're<00:00:01.170> wondering

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
nor would I imagine you're wondering

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.899 
nor would I imagine you're wondering
just<00:00:01.680> like<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.890> lot<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.190> us<00:00:02.310> have<00:00:02.520> science

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
just like a lot of us have science

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.720 
just like a lot of us have science
almost<00:00:03.210> like<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.830> difficult<00:00:04.830> difficult<00:00:05.279> to

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
almost like a difficult difficult to

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.339 
almost like a difficult difficult to
understand<00:00:06.980> that<00:00:07.980> will<00:00:08.220> lost<00:00:08.460> today<00:00:09.349> because

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
understand that will lost today because

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.190 
understand that will lost today because
I<00:00:10.769> think<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:12.059> play<00:00:12.269> well<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.809> play<00:00:13.019> good

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I think we play well we play good

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.870 
I think we play well we play good
football<00:00:14.030> by<00:00:15.030> far<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:16.379> better<00:00:16.590> team<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.130> it's

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
football by far the better team but it's

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.050 
football by far the better team but it's
difficult<00:00:18.150> because<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:20.250> way<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:20.789> play

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
difficult because the way how they play

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.700 
difficult because the way how they play
with<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> lot<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.660> physical<00:00:22.430> long<00:00:23.430> balls

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
with a lot of physical long balls

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.620 
with a lot of physical long balls
dangerous<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.890> set<00:00:26.099> pieces<00:00:26.539> then<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
dangerous in set pieces then the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.359 
dangerous in set pieces then the
possibility<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.349> always<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:29.010> they<00:00:29.160> can

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
possibility is always that they can

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.269 
possibility is always that they can
score<00:00:30.470> different<00:00:31.470> way<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> playing<00:00:31.980> football

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
score different way of playing football

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.260 
score different way of playing football
but<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:33.530> sometimes<00:00:34.530> difficult<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.700> defending

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
but but sometimes difficult to defending

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.440 
but but sometimes difficult to defending
and<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> good<00:00:38.550> result<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:39.329> we

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and and to get a good result what we

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.810 
and and to get a good result what we
deserve<00:00:39.870> today<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.440> that's<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.579> always

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
deserve today but that's not always

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.610 
deserve today but that's not always
football<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.840> sat<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.230> talking<00:00:43.410> about

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
football to be sat in here talking about

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.770 
football to be sat in here talking about
to<00:00:43.950> wonderf<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.370> after<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> first<00:00:45.270> half<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> that

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to wonderf a after a first half of that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.119 
to wonderf a after a first half of that
quality<00:00:46.200> must<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.440> quite<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> surprise<00:00:46.980> really

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
quality must be quite a surprise really

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.680 
quality must be quite a surprise really
because<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.460> first<00:00:47.730> half<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.210> probably

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
because that first half was probably

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
because that first half was probably
among<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> best<00:00:49.320> you've<00:00:49.469> had<00:00:49.559> from

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
among one of the best you've had from

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.290 
among one of the best you've had from
your<00:00:49.800> side<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> season<00:00:50.460> yes<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.059> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
your side this season yes I think so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
your side this season yes I think so
it's<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.469> know<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> difficult<00:00:53.039> place<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it's we know it's a difficult place to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's we know it's a difficult place to
come<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.890> took<00:00:55.890> controlling<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.969> what

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
come and took controlling like that what

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
come and took controlling like that what
we<00:00:57.360> did<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> first<00:00:58.020> 45<00:00:58.739> minutes<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.550> good

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
we did in the first 45 minutes with good

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.139 
we did in the first 45 minutes with good
ball<00:00:59.940> position<00:01:00.680> good<00:01:01.680> movement<00:01:01.920> good<00:01:02.609> chances

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
ball position good movement good chances

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
ball position good movement good chances
and<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.799> maybe<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.339> changed<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and and maybe the one one changed a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700 
and and maybe the one one changed a
little<00:01:05.880> bit<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:06.930> after<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> one

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
little bit that but but after the one

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
little bit that but but after the one
one<00:01:07.890> still<00:01:09.260> Southampton<00:01:10.260> was<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> better

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
one still Southampton was the better

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.450 
one still Southampton was the better
team<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:12.119> more<00:01:12.360> chances<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:14.220> don't

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
team but with more chances but you don't

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.310 
team but with more chances but you don't
get<00:01:14.700> points<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.270> four<00:01:15.600> chances<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
get points for four chances you have to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280 
get points for four chances you have to
score<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.670> scored<00:01:17.970> twice<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:19.020> only

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
score and they scored twice and we only

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.080 
score and they scored twice and we only
want<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.979> perhaps<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.700> point<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
want you perhaps not at this point to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.109 
want you perhaps not at this point to
only<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.659> goal<00:01:21.840> ahead<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.259> halftime<00:01:23.119> yeah

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
only be one goal ahead at halftime yeah

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.960 
only be one goal ahead at halftime yeah
but<00:01:24.450> maybe<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.140> had<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> score<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.460> second<00:01:26.820> one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
but maybe we had to score the second one

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
but maybe we had to score the second one
in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> second<00:01:27.509> half<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:28.140> course<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.950> had<00:01:29.070> some

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
in the second half of course we had some

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.069 
in the second half of course we had some
good<00:01:29.430> movements<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.060> had<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.360> good

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
good movements we had some good

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.260 
good movements we had some good
counter-attacks<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.070> maybe<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.700> final<00:01:33.060> pass

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
counter-attacks and maybe the final pass

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.810 
counter-attacks and maybe the final pass
was<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.720> always<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> best<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
was not always the best one but the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.420 
was not always the best one but the
organization<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.570> good<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.079> team<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.430> okay

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
organization was good in a team and okay

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.660 
organization was good in a team and okay
it's<00:01:38.960> it's<00:01:39.960> painful<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.530> lose<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.400> but

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it's it's painful to lose like this but

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.080 
it's it's painful to lose like this but
we<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.630> accept<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.890> keep

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
we have to accept it and if we keep

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.179 
we have to accept it and if we keep
playing<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:46.140> game<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> date<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
playing like the game as to date and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.520 
playing like the game as to date and
then<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:48.899> finish<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> high

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
then I think we will finish in a high

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
then I think we will finish in a high
position<00:01:49.710> there's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.549> good<00:01:50.939> chance<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
position there's a good chance for the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
position there's a good chance for the
intelligent<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.229> old<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.530> well<00:01:52.710> how<00:01:52.860> crucial

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
intelligent one old as well how crucial

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.260 
intelligent one old as well how crucial
a<00:01:53.310> moment<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.729> when<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> ball<00:01:54.210> was

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
a moment was that when the ball was

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
a moment was that when the ball was
