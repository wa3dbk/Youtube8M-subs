 Hello everyone, guys and welcome new ones 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.470
 by lek members then we are in my second 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.519
 tutorial where in this tutorial we will go 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.830
 to see with download santis pirate 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.800
 two days ago everything in Italian and more 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.090
 also the dlc of the story pack story mode 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.920
 what kind of thing 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.810
 anyway now we're going to see everything 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.660
 what they need 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.490
 it's just two things damon to write 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.520
 that I leave the link in the description 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.219
 a program would be a program for 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.120
 mount the iso image because otherwise not 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.480
 can work 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.370
 the second one is the link instead 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 where we go to write one piece 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
 so guys if the link all when 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.399
 it works I recommend left of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.739
 thumb up and now let's go to the video 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.670
 then guys here we are in ours 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.230
 desktop 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.239
 this here is damon light trousse for 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.100
 download this link here and there 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.730
 I'll leave it left in the description 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.149
 obviously instead to download one 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.570
 piece 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.479
 the link is this here look at more stories 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.150
 pack dlc to eco dl cp but not even wanted 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:18.439
 the word however is this here is here 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.030
 also what the system requires we say 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.770
 the minimum required, etc. all 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.210
 things like that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.350
 you see minimum is therefore recommended for 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.259
 download 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.880
 here we go the discharge from toro e 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.950
 I was going to even go for example on 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.619
 media fire that the package rare and so on 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 I have torrent download so vi 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.259
 I also leave in the torrent indication 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.630
 for whom downloading with a torrent is one 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:51.360
 once downloaded we would have this thing like that 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.390
 we will have this folder and we will 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.969
 it only affects this file here iso e 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.780
 then what to do 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:07.380
 we take demont light from us open and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.520
 just drag this iso file here 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.420
 here because at windows 8 that was 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.630
 mounted an image etc. then there 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.570
 click or go directly here 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:29.820
 go to this compressed folder here 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:38.520

 already installed so I don't know what 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.760

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.880

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.670

 bank and stall is already installed 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.400
 once installed you will have this thing 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:11.630
 this thing and we do what we do 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.630
 let's take these files here 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.450
 take the codex henley copy all 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.430
 how many do you copy and put them here 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.420
 inside 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.130
 go where you saved one piece 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.560
 go here and do it has retraced files 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.260
 directly or from the file location 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.640

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.430
 change the Italian language 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.570
 what we must do as sometimes 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.040
 It runs rough 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.739
 if you want local directly from here 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.739
 because it doesn't make me save you then it 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.380
 bring it in or out here 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.850

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.239

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:59.580

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.709
