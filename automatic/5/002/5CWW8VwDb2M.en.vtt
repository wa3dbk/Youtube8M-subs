to get much it was Billie involved in it
a<00:00:30.230> little<00:00:30.650> slit<00:00:30.980> I<00:00:31.010> just<00:00:31.280> got<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:31.460> while<00:00:31.760> go

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
a little slit I just got a while go

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.570 
a little slit I just got a while go
about<00:00:32.720> half<00:00:32.900> way<00:00:32.930> through<00:00:33.440> from<00:00:34.070> about<00:00:34.400> the

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
about half way through from about the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.120 
about half way through from about the
backbone<00:00:36.040> into<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:38.329> ribcage<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.890> then<00:00:40.040> I

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
backbone into the ribcage and then I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.950 
backbone into the ribcage and then I
take<00:00:40.310> a<00:00:40.340> little<00:00:40.400> slit<00:00:40.820> we'll<00:00:41.510> stay<00:00:41.720> right<00:00:41.750> here

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
take a little slit we'll stay right here

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.440 
take a little slit we'll stay right here
toward<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.290> tail<00:00:42.730> I'll<00:00:43.730> do<00:00:43.880> the<00:00:44.000> white<00:00:44.180> side

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
toward the tail I'll do the white side

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.330 
toward the tail I'll do the white side
first<00:00:44.780> because<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.680> white<00:00:45.860> sides<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
first because the white sides the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.400 
first because the white sides the
thinner<00:00:46.579> side<00:00:46.700> is<00:00:47.270> easier<00:00:47.810> to<00:00:47.840> get<00:00:48.050> into<00:00:48.320> the

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
thinner side is easier to get into the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.170 
thinner side is easier to get into the
white<00:00:48.590> side<00:00:48.829> before<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.340> do<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.579> dark<00:00:49.910> side

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
white side before you do the dark side

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.600 
white side before you do the dark side
take<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> little<00:00:51.530> slit<00:00:51.829> down<00:00:51.980> here<00:00:52.220> I<00:00:52.250> take<00:00:52.489> my

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
take a little slit down here I take my

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.729 
take a little slit down here I take my
