is 90 levels i've got a couple locked
ones<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.640> we're<00:00:17.760> going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> just

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
ones over here but we're going to just

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.179 
ones over here but we're going to just
go<00:00:18.240> into<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:18.900> set<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.260> levels<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:20.039> got

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
go into the first set of levels it's got

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160 
go into the first set of levels it's got
that<00:00:20.340> little<00:00:20.400> angry<00:00:21.210> birds<00:00:21.420> tide<00:00:21.689> feeling

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
that little angry birds tide feeling

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.779 
that little angry birds tide feeling
with<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> Stars<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.400> everything<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:25.789> let's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
with the Stars and everything and let's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.730 
with the Stars and everything and let's
go<00:00:27.060> ahead<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.510> go<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.630> level<00:00:28.080> 10<00:00:28.320> i<00:00:28.349> guess<00:00:28.439> i

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
go ahead and go with level 10 i guess i

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.820 
go ahead and go with level 10 i guess i
didn't<00:00:28.949> even<00:00:29.099> try<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.429> click<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.830> let's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
didn't even try and click it but let's

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.400 
didn't even try and click it but let's
go<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.219> level<00:00:32.489> 10<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:33.809> levels<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.230> get

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
go at level 10 the levels do get

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.720 
go at level 10 the levels do get
progressively<00:00:34.920> harder<00:00:35.190> you've<00:00:35.489> got

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
progressively harder you've got

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.170 
progressively harder you've got
obstacles<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:36.809> here<00:00:36.960> you've<00:00:37.170> got<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.410> TNT

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
obstacles right here you've got a TNT

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.400 
obstacles right here you've got a TNT
but<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> way<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.420> play<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.200> move

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
but the way you play this is you move

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.920 
but the way you play this is you move
the<00:00:40.680> platform<00:00:41.340> around<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.120> get<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.629> perfect

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the platform around and get the perfect

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.700 
the platform around and get the perfect
angle<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:44.219> then<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> golf<00:00:45.780> ball<00:00:46.020> into<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
angle to then get the golf ball into the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.670 
angle to then get the golf ball into the
hole<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.329> more<00:00:48.450> points<00:00:48.690> by<00:00:48.930> using<00:00:49.110> by

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
hole you can get more points by using by

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.500 
hole you can get more points by using by
getting<00:00:49.920> hole<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.250> ones<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.390> going

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
getting hole in ones and I'm just going

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.170 
getting hole in ones and I'm just going
to<00:00:51.539> explode<00:00:51.750> them<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:53.039> TNT<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.879> go

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to explode them the TNT so that I can go

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.290 
to explode them the TNT so that I can go
and<00:00:55.190> get<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> golf<00:00:56.520> ball<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.000> now<00:00:57.149> we've

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and get the golf ball here and now we've

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.510 
and get the golf ball here and now we've
got<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.539> obstacle<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.770> I'm

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
got an obstacle right there so I'm

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.130 
got an obstacle right there so I'm
probably<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.820> gonna<00:00:59.969> try<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:00.690> above

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
probably just gonna try and go above

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.460 
probably just gonna try and go above
that<00:01:01.609> didn't<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:02.699> work<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.470> actually

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that didn't really work out but actually

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.340 
that didn't really work out but actually
it<00:01:04.559> did<00:01:04.710> nope<00:01:05.450> what<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.140> shows

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it did nope what I like is that it shows

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.200 
it did nope what I like is that it shows
where<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.890> used<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.340> last<00:01:08.490> time<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
where you used it last time so that you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.020 
where you used it last time so that you
can<00:01:09.470> project<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.860> let's<00:01:11.040> say<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.340> lower<00:01:11.670> just

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
can project it let's say now lower just

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.390 
can project it let's say now lower just
because<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.810> off<00:01:13.189> that<00:01:14.189> didn't

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
because it was a little off that didn't

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.050 
because it was a little off that didn't
work<00:01:15.409> I'm<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> best<00:01:16.979> I'm<00:01:17.430> getting<00:01:17.909> better

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
work I'm not the best I'm getting better

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.929 
work I'm not the best I'm getting better
though<00:01:18.560> we're<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.830> ahead<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.340> go

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
though we're going to go ahead and go

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.480 
though we're going to go ahead and go
into<00:01:21.119> another<00:01:21.479> level<00:01:22.189> something<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.369> bit

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
into another level something a bit

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.420 
into another level something a bit
easier<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.420> actually<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.780> that

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
easier so that you can actually see that

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.179 
easier so that you can actually see that
I'm<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.000> terrible<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.740> app<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I'm not that terrible so this app is a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.069 
I'm not that terrible so this app is a
dollar<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.939> app<00:01:30.119> store<00:01:30.150> though<00:01:30.659> if

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
dollar in the app store though if

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
dollar in the app store though if
there's<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.950> dislike<00:01:32.189> about<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
there's one thing I dislike about this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
there's one thing I dislike about this
app<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.630> sometimes<00:01:33.930> does<00:01:34.409> lag<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
app is that it sometimes does lag and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
app is that it sometimes does lag and
glitch<00:01:35.189> there's<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.790> point<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> did<00:01:36.390> have

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
glitch there's a point that I did have

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
glitch there's a point that I did have
to<00:01:36.570> restart<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> phone<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.979> did<00:01:38.100> lag

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
to restart the phone because it did lag

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.240 
to restart the phone because it did lag
out<00:01:38.960> but<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> most<00:01:40.320> part<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.740> developers

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
out but for the most part the developers

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.620 
out but for the most part the developers
