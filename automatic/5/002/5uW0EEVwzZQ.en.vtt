up<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:13.040> protein<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> right<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.820> 55

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
up the protein here so right here is 55

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.649 
up the protein here so right here is 55
grams<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.780> protein<00:01:22.759> with<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> mix<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.360> quattro

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
grams of protein with the mix of quattro

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
grams of protein with the mix of quattro
and<00:01:25.080> egg<00:01:25.200> whites<00:01:25.439> left<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> measure<00:01:26.400> our<00:01:26.580> way

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and egg whites left to measure our way

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.530 
and egg whites left to measure our way
out<00:01:27.090> about<00:01:27.240> 31<00:01:27.750> grams<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.549> oats<00:01:29.549> that'll<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.240> 20

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
out about 31 grams of oats that'll be 20

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:39.130 
out about 31 grams of oats that'll be 20
grams<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.930> carbs

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.810 

before<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.189> i<00:01:44.580> have<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> shred<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.689> down

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
before so now i have to shred this down

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
before so now i have to shred this down
so<00:01:47.820> i<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.090> use<00:01:48.360> my<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.810> hamilton<00:01:49.439> beach

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
so i just use my little hamilton beach
