00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.200 

obviously<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.230> they<00:00:37.590> got<00:00:37.770> the

year the eight years instead of a 70 and
no<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.210> curse<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:50.700> far<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.420> force

no more curse so as far as the force
feedback<00:00:52.199> goes<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.129> also<00:00:53.670> slightly<00:00:54.629> changed

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
feedback goes that also slightly changed

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.970 
feedback goes that also slightly changed
seems<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.050> seems<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.109> 2014<00:00:58.770> this

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
seems like it's seems like 2014 this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
seems like it's seems like 2014 this
year<00:00:59.160> around<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.719> little

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
year around is a little more a little

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.439 
year around is a little more a little
more<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.289> simulation<00:01:01.890> side<00:01:02.449> obviously

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
more on the simulation side obviously

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.590 
more on the simulation side obviously
it's<00:01:03.600> still<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.559> leo

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
it's still not leo

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.830 
it's still not leo
it's<00:01:05.990> in<00:01:06.140> full<00:01:06.290> simulation<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.330> hardcore

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
it's in full simulation so the hardcore

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.840 
it's in full simulation so the hardcore
are<00:01:09.049> still<00:01:09.320> going<00:01:09.470> on<00:01:09.530> still<00:01:10.189> gonna<00:01:10.340> be<00:01:10.460> mad<00:01:10.670> at

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
are still going on still gonna be mad at

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.520 
are still going on still gonna be mad at
it<00:01:11.290> but<00:01:12.290> yeah<00:01:13.159> you<00:01:13.220> can<00:01:13.369> definitely<00:01:13.930> if<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.110> if

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
it but yeah you can definitely if you if

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.840 
it but yeah you can definitely if you if
they<00:01:15.680> have<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.860> be<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.040> little<00:01:16.250> more<00:01:16.460> careful

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
they have to be a little more careful

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.990 
they have to be a little more careful
with<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.030> gas<00:01:17.240> on<00:01:17.540> corners<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.850> lose<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
with the gas on corners you can lose the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.760 
with the gas on corners you can lose the
back<00:01:20.180> end<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.509> lot<00:01:20.659> easier<00:01:20.869> or<00:01:21.290> spin<00:01:21.649> your

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
back end a lot easier or spin your

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.570 
back end a lot easier or spin your
wheels<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.729> I<00:01:24.159> personally<00:01:25.159> like<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.549> a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
wheels so I personally like that a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.010 
wheels so I personally like that a
little<00:01:25.789> more<00:01:26.060> like<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.720> challenge<00:01:28.899> yeah<00:01:29.899> this

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
little more like the challenge yeah this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.170 
little more like the challenge yeah this
is<00:01:30.229> this<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.680> my<00:01:30.710> friends<00:01:31.220> lab<00:01:31.399> we<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:32.060> only

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
is this is my friends lab we we only

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.399 
is this is my friends lab we we only
threw<00:01:32.479> down<00:01:32.690> probably<00:01:33.229> about<00:01:33.789> 10<00:01:34.899> 15<00:01:35.899> laps

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
threw down probably about 10 15 laps

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.490 
threw down probably about 10 15 laps
maybe<00:01:37.539> so<00:01:38.539> we<00:01:38.780> were<00:01:38.869> just<00:01:38.929> getting<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.350> hang

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
maybe so we were just getting the hang

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.740 
maybe so we were just getting the hang
of<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.679> not<00:01:39.890> really<00:01:40.130> setting<00:01:40.460> any<00:01:40.670> not<00:01:41.569> really

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
of it not really setting any not really

of it not really setting any not really
said<00:01:41.929> any<00:01:42.850> speed<00:01:43.850> records<00:01:43.880> or<00:01:44.450> anything<00:01:44.750> like

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
said any speed records or anything like

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.200 
said any speed records or anything like
that<00:01:44.929> and<00:01:45.319> the<00:01:45.740> he<00:01:46.190> was<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:46.610> beginning<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:47.090> my

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.340 
really like it I've always been a fan
another<00:01:56.899> codemasters<00:01:57.740> hater

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
another codemasters hater

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.760 
another codemasters hater
but<00:01:59.710> yeah<00:01:59.920> as<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.280> can<00:02:00.340> see<00:02:00.580> i<00:02:00.610> see<00:02:01.390> us<00:02:02.200> back<00:02:02.560> in

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
but yeah as you can see i see us back in

but yeah that i think i'll be interested
in<00:02:11.800> maybe<00:02:11.950> picking<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.430> up<00:02:12.580> or<00:02:12.760> ps3<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
in maybe picking this up or ps3 this is

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.010 
in maybe picking this up or ps3 this is
on<00:02:14.830> my<00:02:14.950> buddies<00:02:15.250> pc<00:02:15.880> i<00:02:16.150> don't<00:02:16.420> have<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.930> don't

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
on my buddies pc i don't have I don't

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.490 
on my buddies pc i don't have I don't
have<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.319> pc<00:02:17.530> yet<00:02:18.480> yeah<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.690> looks<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.319> lot

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
have a pc yet yeah this looks a lot

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.860 
have a pc yet yeah this looks a lot
prettier<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.250> lot<00:02:21.400> more<00:02:21.580> reflections<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.690> lot

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
prettier a lot more reflections a lot

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.780 
prettier a lot more reflections a lot
more<00:02:23.140> frames<00:02:23.500> per<00:02:23.739> second<00:02:24.130> on<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.310> pc<00:02:25.590> so
