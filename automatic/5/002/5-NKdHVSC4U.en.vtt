00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone how about here 360 talking 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.600
 a little bit of fifa 13 well as you already know 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.099
 Most of them had the chance to try the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.440
 game at the electronic arts offices 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.179
 e Spain is a version that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.620
 is far from being the definitive one so 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.820
 there are still many tweaks to be done 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.830
 what when we talk about certain 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.270
 details or minimum failures you have to have 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.710
 note that we are talking about a beta that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.820
 still has room for improvement but in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.020
 general the basis that we 're going to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.939
 find is going to be pretty much the same 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.859
 good first to thank 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.230
 electronic Spain and all 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.880
 attendees including the champion of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.619
 world of fifa 12 alfonso ramos or al 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.270
 webmaster of physics would be is jose 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.620
 navarrete the truth that was one day 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.969
 fantastic one a very great 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.559
 experience at the time that if you have the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.690
 occasion to go to sometime I do not know what 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.640
 you think but well we are going to what you are 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.649
 waiting for what fifa 13 offers 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.989
 well in this video I'm going to talk about 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.090
 intelligent control attack to the first 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.309
 touch of the freedom of the new ball 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.559
 system of defense and defense dribbles 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.420
 the impact engine improvements tomorrow 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.770
 I will upload another video talking about passes of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.930
 shots of the qualities of the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.079
 change fatigue players 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.730
 player goalkeepers and so on so 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.290
 that we could play fifa 13 it seems 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.159
 surely as the biggest evolution of the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.899
 deficit 08 in this saga 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.289
 he will not go unnoticed because 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.100
 visually the differences are minimal 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.509
 unfortunately we also have to 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.009
 talk about a couple of novelties that 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.329
 apparently they are going to be nothing 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.310
 such as the new system 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.990
 dribbling but if there is a novelty that in 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.819
 firmat lc has raised that expectation 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.109
 is the new intelligent attack the 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.630
 of the uncheck system so that we 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.709
 we understand well they have taken but when 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.630
 They have been able to have 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.039
 first players now seek 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.929
 continuously open spaces to the 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.000
 time to attack they are determined to place 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.619
 they want to search are very fast to the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.030
 time to change direction and know 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.770
 cover very well in offside with 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.479
 Curved careers not to bring 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.009
 legal positions we have to forget 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.840
 forever those attacks 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.340
 static that have starred in the saga 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.929
 so far to make the player 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.000
 which is in front of us is unmarked 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.709
 we can still press the l1 and lb buttons 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.840
 but let's see what it would really be like 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.369
 these movements are required 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.590
 performs the cpu without depending on which 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.969
 we press a button apply to 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.439
 all the players of the field that is that 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.479
 is unmarked in several continuously not 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.280
 just one and also anticipate the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.200
 possible play even if they have no option 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.179
 of receiving the pass at that moment I want to 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.310
 say although they will not receive the ball 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.690
 they immediately read the possible play 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.060
 if in the future they can be helpful 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.310
 can support a partner 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.349
 In addition to pure unchecks we see how 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.060
 especially near the area the players 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.709
 they look for spaces between the defenders and they 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.660
 move away from them to offer us passes 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.190
 more francs we forget too 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.530
 then of those forwards who do not know 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.989
 take off your marker now see the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.519
 free spaces within the area 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.380
 it is usual to see also as the lateral 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.030
 is appearing on the other band in a 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.950
 attack and unlike what was happening 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.930
 with signature robotic demarches 12 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.269
 now they will do it only if they really have 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.620
 a space to surprise against 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.510
 At that time, the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.580
 props the props in short passes 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.650
 we see continuous unchecks but we miss 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.660
 in absence there is a partner who 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.220
 offer them close to us when 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.750
 we try to build the play in 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.130
 special in counterattacks is 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.600
 too habitual to see as if by 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.790
 example we have the three players 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.230
 in front of the ball the three are 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.569
 run leaving a huge space between 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.620
 the pin and the next player 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.910
 let's hope that the final version that 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.590
 space also know how to take advantage 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.989
 offering to receive one more pass 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.099
 easy the walls have also been all 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.840
 of intelligence are no longer always 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.910
 straight races but they are also 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.010
 able to vary the career of the Balearics 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.900
 the address if they see that the return 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.579
 of the pass seems impossible and in 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.330
 special we see as if we do not return the 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.010
 wall 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.180
 the race can take directions 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.650
 unpredictable things that they can give us 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.020
 options that we would not have 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.000
 imagined not only we see also 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.680
 unmarking in large spaces also 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.050
 in static attacks we observe how 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.520
 especially the front centers usually 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.810
 look for a race from the front of the 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.250
 area to the penalty point to 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.310
 look for a possible auction a possible 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.690
 headshot is really a 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.970
 authentic wonder a true 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.050
 revolution that I fear that only the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.850
 that they play more high than they will know 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.620
 appreciate it but I have to say in addition 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.660
 that for those of us who play in manual goes to 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.760
 be and forgive me the vulgarity is going to be 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.470
 I will use this topic in a 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.850
 new video when you upload it you will have the 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.590
 link in the description and in the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.090
 annotations in this same video touches 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.770
 talk about control at first touch os 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.360
 I comment a little bit above there were two 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.670
 different websites two different versions 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.410
 the console one that was something older and 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.390
 the species that was the most modern was 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.860
 very unfortunately the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.350
 differences between both in that aspect 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.510
 they are huge in the first the console 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.950
 is the oldest we see reflected those 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.980
 promises of trailer where we asked 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.180
 long controls difficult controls 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.070
 but the last one has almost disappeared 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.690
 version was unanimous the truth the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.490
 thought of all present was 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.840
 much better the older version 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.460
 the consoles in the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.080
 more previous you had to think very 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.120
 well at the time of passing the defense or the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.470
 porter about everything was noticeable because 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.090
 above all you noticed that tension of 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.790
 have to think about it so as not to risk 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.410
 that pass because the controls I say 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.260
 they were quite varied enough 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.940
 realistic pretty complicated without the 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.350
 absurd I demanded fifa12 where he controls 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.600
 just perfectly regardless of the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.190
 player or the situation in the volva 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.960
 new is all excessively similar to 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.550
 this fifa12 commented it shows the 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.979
 difference I do not say no but I do not 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.360
 sufficient and it seems to be the 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.910
 definitive version in that aspect in 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.680
 particular but there is a surprise that no 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.450
 we were waiting for nobody and it is curious that 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.520
 have not said anything about the 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.500
 freedom of the ball well those of us who went 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.440
 pro evolution soccer or win players 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.850
 eleven in america we know that one of the 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.440
 few points where and figures have not 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.150
 improved to the best time of the game of 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.130
 economy is in that freedom of value in 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.950
 you reject it is randomness that fifa 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.450
 never got to the surprise of 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.889
 all present from the first 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.870
 moment we see how the ball looks like 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.400
 have a life of their own that attraction of 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.560
 spherical the players seem to have 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.419
 we gone as usual to 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.460
 the ball rubs against the players when passing or 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.020
 shoot and now you reject them are not going to 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.470
 automatically a football player almost by 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.360
 d 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.410
 and also used to link it with 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.600
 other topics with which it is related 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.490
 now neither the goalkeepers nor the defenders 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.560
 are able to read the address of the 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.180
 shots and passes to point and this 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.340
 It helps a lot to make it look like 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.990
 ball has a life of its own to move 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.660
 freely in the field to which it reacts 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.010
 to each impact with total randomness 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.540
 when a player tried to cover a ball 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.330
 he does it by placing himself in the position that 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.580
 he considers more likely he is not capable of 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.890
 react in a time that is impossible 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.850
 for a human being and to stand 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.280
 exactly in the middle of the 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.230
 trajectory this of course favors 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.910
 that values ​​instead of deviating 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.380
 always 180 degrees as it happens almost 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.200
 always filtered, you can do it 5 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.090
 degrees 50 degrees 80 degrees is something that 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.680
 You really have to see it to understand it 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.420
 but I assure you that it really contributes 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.800
 a lot of variety and realism to the game is the 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.570
 greatest surprise of all without a doubt 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.010
 going back to the negative part the 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.870
 complete trip link or system 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.400
 full gift that was one of the 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.140
 five pillars of the game with respect to 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.520
 good news is a complete fiasco 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.020
 but also that it happens a little bit 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.690
 above but really does not deserve more 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.340
 Comment may seem fine 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.280
 at the beginning but the truth is that it is 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.720
 a capital equality equal against 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.040
 someone who does not know how to defend as it happens 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.750
 with the famous is killers 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.580
 serve something but really against that 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.570
 have any kind of foundation 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.940
 defensive you will see what it is 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.830
 completely useless and clear does not help 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.990
 much that the defense remains so 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.090
 automatic as always the buttons of 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.590
 containment work as always 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.270
 to defend in that automatic way 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.340
 instead of moving the player freely 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.260
 now they can also fix the player not 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.630
 only in front of the ball but also 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.490
 can move it laterally so 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.410
 the CPU continues to steal too many 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.850
 balls automatically putting the 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.830
 leg follows exactly the same as 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.510
 now even if you throw yourself is to reach 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.820
 soil seems that we have more variety of 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.470
 movements and possibilities and 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.180
 entries by organ hits clear blows 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.800
 between players and those hits the truth 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.080
 that looks better than ever thanks to the 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.940
 Impact motor improvements the only 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.530
 but it may be that situations where 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.990
 front players collide or be 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.700
 from chest to chest continues without 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.110
 work quite well otherwise the 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.970
 it's really cool we do not see any 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.860
 famous snag between two players at 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.870
 falling to the ground the relationships are more 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.250
 natural and less exaggerated and we see a 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.560
 bestial evolution especially in the subject 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.790
 of grabs everything looks really good 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.920
 truth is that he has done a great job 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.630
 in that aspect and well this has been all 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.430
 so far tomorrow Saturday I will hang 

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.090
 another video dealing with the rest of the topics 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.889
 with special 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.350
 to the theme of passes and shots 

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:52.720
 where there are interesting news and you 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.729
 advanced that you are not going to see half of 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.710
 the goals of the game that are center 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:58.570
 from the band header see 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.729
 that has taken good note of it what 

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.350
 arranged pretty well and on Sunday 

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:03.940
 will turn the turn to the questions that I 

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.280
 you have sent value throughout the 

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.050
 week and well this is all thanks to
