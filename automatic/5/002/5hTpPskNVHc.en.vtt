 Forest village in Yangpyong, Gyeonggi-do 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.580
 Lying in a small detached house is fast enough for chewing lettuce. 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.940
 I love you. 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:26.010
 It looks like a child in October, but in social circles 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:32.099
 It is a new family of new cars that have just begun to live at the time of the power week 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.500
 The reason for giving up the bloodiness of the apartment before moving is because of the education of the child. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.970
 The biggest thing is that I'm here . 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.630

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:43.950
 Once you live in Seoul, you can not get out of private tutoring . 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.030
 The most important thing for a child is to present the memories in nature when he was a child. 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.640
 I thought it would be best . 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:58.090
 Coming moved to a Seoul stairs weak finishing equipment printing company is also unfinished 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:03.340
 However, daily life combined with nature gives little pleasure. 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:06.250
 Beans think eggs would be nice to sleep listening to the natural sounds jalttae the insects at night 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.430
 Get up in the morning and break the birds 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:15.160
 Well those things are good 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:18.370
 Building area is only 41 meters, but in fact increase 123 built of three layers, 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.270
 Single-family house with more taxes 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:26.580
 The appearance is nice, but I looked inside. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 Comfortable living room and sophisticated main class 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 Let's go upstairs to the second floor and have a baby room and the intention to live without it 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:44.369
 Now it's home and dreams are so small that it's done in the pocket but when you're at the end 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:49.409
 When you open the door, you have the rank and the Han to the end . So, 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.840
 On the third floor, there is a large window in the attic , 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.710
 I removed it. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:00.659
 The storage space seems to be more spacious. 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.550
 House with Phillips type house tools to participate directly in the interior design 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.150
 Satisfaction is much higher 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:13.340
 In the middle of the cross, what is the family space? 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:18.170
 It is a two-story road cone , 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.950
 It is eco-friendly by using wood and is twice as thick as existing apartments. 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.860
 I also reduced the cost of the living expenses to the site of insulation . 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.410
 How much did you hear 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:35.720
 That's very tricky. It's about 120 pyeong here . 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.420
 The land of approximately even going home to eat a sigongbi 100,005,500 company's own building 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.610
 It became understand about the car and eat 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:49.270
 Architecture Some wives are 3.3 square meters and the land price is 800,000 won. 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.270
 The cost of building a house is reduced as a single-family housing complex enters the market 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:03:00.120
 1 hour and 30 minutes Seoul There is a lot of trouble to get rich in the distance 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:04.890
 Living in communion with neighbors is also a pleasure in the wooded houses. 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.299
 I came to find me when visiting each other, then there was probably saving 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.860
 Come here 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.540
 Something that feels like a personal space 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.209
 5 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.390
 Another would have may not have been so pleasant 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:24.910
 I do not think this is a correction anymore. 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.200
 As the desire to escape from the avatel grows , it is rapidly spreading around the metropolitan area. 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:33.590
 Detached housing complex 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:38.330
 Especially, it is very popular among 3040 households who set up my house with 300 million won. 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.050
 By selecting only the community is forming a lot of that risk 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.860
 Itguyo is able to recognize prevent another town so naturally How's form 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.690
 I see 4 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.280
 Not surprisingly, there is another merit of rising real estate prices . 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.930
 The same 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.989
 The concept of a single-family house, which is recognized as the representative residence culture of the existing retirees , 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.019
 The volume of housing transactions is increasing. 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.019
 Demand is rising and prices are rising. 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.750
 In the end , land prices are on the rise with real estate. 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:17.239
 Apartments party tried joggers as equity is not much 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:22.370
 When I was three years old , I would put a single house in that land. 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:26.740
 The price increases as the organs are held or occupied. 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.740
 This new guilty is guilty of everyday guilt.
