slapped<00:05:38.510> on<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.780> George<00:05:38.960> Foreman<00:05:39.200> for<00:05:39.470> a

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
slapped on the George Foreman for a

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.879 
slapped on the George Foreman for a
little<00:05:39.650> bit

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
little bit

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.080 
little bit
so<00:05:39.979> you<00:05:40.070> can<00:05:40.160> probably<00:05:40.280> see<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.610> lines<00:05:40.789> in<00:05:40.970> it

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
so you can probably see the lines in it

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.670 
so you can probably see the lines in it
just<00:05:41.240> about<00:05:41.450> but<00:05:41.960> some<00:05:42.080> olive<00:05:42.289> oil<00:05:42.380> on<00:05:42.530> it<00:05:42.650> and

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
just about but some olive oil on it and

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.230 
just about but some olive oil on it and
some<00:05:43.010> other<00:05:43.130> mint<00:05:43.370> leaves<00:05:43.520> add<00:05:43.760> hanging<00:05:44.060> about

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
some other mint leaves add hanging about

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.240 
some other mint leaves add hanging about
so<00:05:44.539> that<00:05:44.720> will<00:05:44.810> go<00:05:44.990> quite<00:05:45.650> nicely<00:05:45.860> with<00:05:46.039> the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
so that will go quite nicely with the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.430 
so that will go quite nicely with the
mill<00:05:46.400> once<00:05:46.610> it's<00:05:46.789> done<00:05:47.050> teeny<00:05:48.050> look<00:05:48.289> it

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
mill once it's done teeny look it

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.689 
mill once it's done teeny look it
doesn't<00:05:48.560> look<00:05:48.650> like<00:05:48.830> Emma<00:05:49.010> cool<00:05:49.250> -<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.520> book

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
doesn't look like Emma cool - the book

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.550 
doesn't look like Emma cool - the book
I'm<00:05:50.270> fortunate<00:05:50.479> I<00:05:50.630> think<00:05:50.660> I<00:05:50.810> put<00:05:51.169> too<00:05:51.349> much

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
I'm fortunate I think I put too much

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.080 
I'm fortunate I think I put too much
cream<00:05:51.919> or<00:05:52.070> maybe<00:05:52.190> wine<00:05:52.430> it's<00:05:52.820> a<00:05:52.849> bit<00:05:52.970> more

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
cream or maybe wine it's a bit more

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.180 
cream or maybe wine it's a bit more
watery<00:05:53.449> but<00:05:54.020> it<00:05:54.080> smells<00:05:54.320> great<00:05:54.530> so<00:05:54.770> hopefully

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
watery but it smells great so hopefully

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.400 
watery but it smells great so hopefully
by<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.580> way<00:05:55.789> still<00:05:56.419> be<00:05:56.479> a<00:05:56.539> good<00:05:56.660> meal<00:05:56.840> so<00:05:57.110> we'll

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
by the way still be a good meal so we'll

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.830 
by the way still be a good meal so we'll
