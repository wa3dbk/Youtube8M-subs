 with blues they are small they are beautiful but most of all became very cheap in 2008 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.940
 no less than 15 million of them were sold and for 2009 the contempt is one 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.309
 quite tense 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.089
 I already seems not interested in a report 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.990
 nice and fast they recognize en masse with 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.990
 to put a place like that 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.759
 we are curious how simple it is and whether this is against the law 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.019
 and here we are in Amsterdam to pee tea 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.859
 in front of 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.859
 a 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.430
 having purchased a full-blown employer first of all became one 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.830
 warning shot 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.690
 about 2 or 5 euros and there is the cheapest solution and the most popular 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.260
 after all, almelo and livia did not become standard 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.510
 in addition, we also have the dell mini 9, which is expensive and four or five euros 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.840
 about but for that is quite a few of all netbooks 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.590
 and that can perform the tests with this second chamber 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.729
 There are two sailors to be aware of your work 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.189
 and the first the usual and is the wind and there you need a DVD drive 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.929
 buy pippo separately and costs around 50 euros and you have a few modified versions 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.670
 need a separate and I again free and safe from the internet 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.250
 Space with a few drawbacks because you need to learn afterwards to it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.660
 number of things to get talking among which four points the sound 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.200
 audio in an old and the law I can notice that at all not on the incident 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.970
 what is of course objectionable to this method is that you avest in your body 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.370
 keep an eye on order and with that you naturally give on slippery ice 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.140
 and once again look to what extent illegal being engaged in it was raced 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.500
 pavlovic asked cucumber time 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.479
 If you buy laptop that laptop with this year's ownership 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.789
 Only get the software you buy initiative that doesn't cheer Dolby 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.649
 you only got those licenses that is called simac you use as in it 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.330
 license contract is therefore when you go out with a booklet 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.460
 merkel is z10 would like to install 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.630
 Then you look at the terms of the bid that the device 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 what you see very often is the kind of companies that meet the conditions behind 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.090
 put the stamps or in a box 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.960
 and if there is when you get angry about it break the seal 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.690
 are you bound to the conditions legally that is not legally valid that must be 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.860
 present conditions to people before they buy it 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.930
 or when they buy it and that means you 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.610
 must be able to say to the employee in the eu post I would like to hear from you 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.479
 see the conditions of what I will buy 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:30.649
 otherwise they are not crazy 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.579
 well to save our souls a little, fortunately there is a second method and that 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.699
 have applied to the mini 9 pill 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.139
 because if you need a day so no light to the fact that he just 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.259
 in the store 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.850
 during a bit of internet there 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.740
 which increases normal installation leaked barrel half an hour later had in one 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.089
 fully working 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:53.969
 and encourages lecturers on but with that, sound characterizes who 4 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.429
 but the big brother question remains natural 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.759
 may this be 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.799
 Berlin's software is that almost all software producers have that provision about it 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.350
 ignore general conditions 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.800
 They just say tonight these are the conditions you have to hold all who 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.879
 is not in power there or we are not using it 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.879
 and whether that is valid or not that does not interest us at all 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.760
 you can say well dutch law is above those types of constructions and 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.769
 they are unlucky 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.029
 so why do you have to look into the law what can I do with the law with software that I provide them 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.609
 got a bought one 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.659
 So look at what can I do with those legal rights then it says in the 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.309
 Use the powers software for intended purpose 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.309
 and make a copy for that and install the software 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.289
 basically install software on every computer you have 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:39.279
 that has to be 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.119
 fit within the purpose for which you purchased the softe 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:46.029
 and then I come into the discussion what he meant but you it 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.789
 park has been made available 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:49.499
 and that is a very difficult question 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:53.319
 I think that the intention of against van der pol can play a very important role in this 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.069
 play 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.659
 hey everyone did the tolga exclusivity 0 law for the products so me 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.509
 think it is very hard to say i want that on one 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:05.289
 ugly code to install rather than beautiful and comfort 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.299
 at least what he could be the lawyers will be 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.189
 but apart from the and legal difficulties it is converting into 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.709
 converted netbook finally a fact percent 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.479
 completely with the second method where you remain physically limited 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.529
 what do you have 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.739
 leave place and compact 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.779
 the book with a discount on 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.340
 and because they are super-fast per processor 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.389
 amersfoort the all but one of the victims 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.050
 and only for a while got away in cash after which both of them were against the plan first 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.050
 the small keyboard that I got the small print 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:41.669
 I have that you can not export windows and this edition of 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.669
 the canvas is so low that even photos are not posted 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.649
 all in all you still have a nice one and the city council was up for a few 

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:51.949
 one hundred euros for vacation on for the bank 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.809
 and it is certainly worth considering 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:56.759
 but the big question remains 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.620
 what the church fears as a consumer is what we want 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.620
 as a consumer there is little to fear in practice, I can imagine 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.390
 as a lawyer for sure people just come into the attic and see what you 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.529
 are doing 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:11.900
 I was allowed to come to the suspects in any way, for example because it was 

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:13.229
 to see a podcast 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.580
 then you may have one 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.630
 the problem because then his theory might say that makes me 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.400
 an example case of 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.600
 Of course I don't know how important the report is for Kate to the Netherlands 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.960
 like as a country 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.770
 in theory that is possible 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.020
 ma as private individuals I would not wake up at all 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.210
 in business situations I can perform the honor for both that temple 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.380
 is not someone who goes two centimeters out of license in his attic room 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.759
 is nobody who does exactly what I also want to prevent namely her 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.490
 Software ends up on hardware that it does not have gold oil very 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.669
 hey as a private person or I think you don't have to worry as much as I can 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:50.680
 difficult for them always 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.819
 lol the police could raid you 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.060
 if you went to work commercially with apples or two in the sense of boring 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.689
 start a cap a few times well behind the ears and look for 4s 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:01.779
 price of insurance 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.389
 Motorhomes and the book are a sensitive subject Heerenveen 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.669
 so far, of course, we cannot and cannot be on a ghost 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.520
 but now that it turns out to be a vandal with the pelican that time is not too bad 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.749
 maybe time to adjust our rules 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:17.059
 but I necessarily invent that 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:19.210
 if you discussed it for one 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.639
 Then I'd say years in theory is more likely than ever to be with it 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.129
 can live but to say hey what we see here 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.240
 we will go after that 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.340
 but also then 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.230
 those people have nothing better to do there than just for you 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.470
 don't read that I would say that it is not nice of course for a read 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.319
 but 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.780
 for the 300 euros per hour the immense costs I do not know if they will do that 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.979
 in short it would therefore not be conclusively fixed for installing 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.319
 it is about children's books in the cadence 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.589
 therefore providing this subject on the municipality of wormer peat 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:51.589
 just possible from today 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.669
 but frankly we wonder if that would even want it at all because it 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.060
 Concert S shows that working with a netbook with pitch coaching is not that nice 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.680
 is when one comes 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.680
 and then we say catch of peat netbooks alongside 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.110
 the 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:14.129
 the 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.419
 k
