the Falcons I still think that they have
tremendous<00:01:24.299> value<00:01:24.960> are<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> go

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
undefeated no they're not because they

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140 
undefeated no they're not because they
don't<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.170> enough<00:01:28.500> depth<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.579> defensive

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
don't have enough depth on the defensive

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.999 
don't have enough depth on the defensive
side<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> ball<00:01:30.659> they're<00:01:31.290> gonna<00:01:31.409> wear<00:01:31.710> down

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
side of the ball they're gonna wear down

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.440 
side of the ball they're gonna wear down
a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.790> they're<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.210> get

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a little bit and they're gonna get

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.390 
a little bit and they're gonna get
trapped<00:01:33.810> somewhere<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.100> that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
trapped somewhere I don't think that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800 
trapped somewhere I don't think that
this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.820> week<00:01:36.000> I've<00:01:36.270> been<00:01:36.540> riding

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
this is the week I've been riding

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.140 
this is the week I've been riding
Atlanta<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> entire<00:01:37.950> season<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.729> there's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
Atlanta the entire season and there's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.999 
Atlanta the entire season and there's
just<00:01:39.420> nothing<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
just nothing not to like about the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
just nothing not to like about the
talent<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.460> they<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> way

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
talent that they have and about the way

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.330 
talent that they have and about the way
that<00:01:42.990> they've<00:01:43.140> been<00:01:43.320> playing<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.130> think

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that they've been playing and I think

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.980 
that they've been playing and I think
that<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.729> fantastic<00:01:45.030> spot<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that this is a fantastic spot for the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
that this is a fantastic spot for the
Falcons<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.740> thought<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> number<00:01:47.430> was

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
Falcons here I thought this number was

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.270 
Falcons here I thought this number was
short<00:01:48.060> i<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:48.990> short<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:49.920> New

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
short i think it was short because New

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.179 
short i think it was short because New
Orleans<00:01:50.640> had<00:01:50.820> such<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.200> dominating<00:01:52.200> win<00:01:52.439> over

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Orleans had such a dominating win over

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.530 
Orleans had such a dominating win over
Philadelphia<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.000> Monday<00:01:54.299> Night<00:01:54.450> Football

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
Philadelphia on Monday Night Football

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
Philadelphia on Monday Night Football
winning<00:01:55.200> by<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> couple<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.770> touchdowns<00:01:56.009> but

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
winning by a couple of touchdowns but

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.950 
winning by a couple of touchdowns but
anybody<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.030> watched<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.719> game

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
anybody that watched that game

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
anybody that watched that game
objectively<00:01:58.619> knows<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> game<00:02:00.030> actually

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
objectively knows that the game actually

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
objectively knows that the game actually
was<00:02:00.960> much<00:02:01.229> closer<00:02:01.560> than<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.159> final<00:02:02.549> score

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
was much closer than the final score

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.819 
was much closer than the final score
indicated<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.930> fact<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
indicated and in fact it was one that I

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.590 
indicated and in fact it was one that I
don't<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.460> New<00:02:05.610> Orleans<00:02:05.969> necessarily

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
don't think that New Orleans necessarily

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.199 
don't think that New Orleans necessarily
should<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.049> won<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.009> still<00:02:08.789> love<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
should have won so I still love the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.940 
should have won so I still love the
value<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> Falcons<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
value with the Falcons I'm not going to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.770 
value with the Falcons I'm not going to
overthink<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.489> one<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.000> definitely<00:02:12.450> think

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
overthink this one I definitely think

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.580 
overthink this one I definitely think
that<00:02:12.900> they're<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> side

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that they're the side

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.350 
that they're the side

bit more impressed with them but the
thing<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.079> Saints<00:03:25.530> defense<00:03:25.920> is

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
thing is is that the Saints defense is

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.580 
thing is is that the Saints defense is
still<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> train<00:03:27.030> wreck<00:03:27.209> like<00:03:27.690> they<00:03:27.870> can't<00:03:28.200> stop

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
still a train wreck like they can't stop

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.309 
still a train wreck like they can't stop
anyone<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.579> Atlanta<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.389> just<00:03:30.660> really<00:03:31.109> hot

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
anyone in Atlanta is just really hot

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.020 
anyone in Atlanta is just really hot
right<00:03:31.590> now<00:03:31.769> they've<00:03:31.980> been<00:03:32.099> hot<00:03:32.310> all<00:03:32.340> season

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
right now they've been hot all season

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.120 
right now they've been hot all season
they've<00:03:33.480> really<00:03:33.989> taken<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.410> dirt<00:03:34.709> cutters

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
they've really taken to dirt cutters

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.420 
they've really taken to dirt cutters
aggressive<00:03:36.060> offensive<00:03:36.840> scheme<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:38.099> think

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
aggressive offensive scheme and I think

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.349 
aggressive offensive scheme and I think
that<00:03:38.519> they're<00:03:38.639> going<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.790> keep<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.150> going

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
that they're going to keep that going

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.449 
that they're going to keep that going
also<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.590> last<00:03:40.739> time<00:03:41.069> these<00:03:41.220> two<00:03:41.310> teams

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
also the last time these two teams

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.520 
also the last time these two teams
played<00:03:41.970> was<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.359> day<00:03:42.540> after<00:03:42.750> Christmas<00:03:43.349> last

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
played was the day after Christmas last

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.970 
played was the day after Christmas last
year<00:03:43.769> New<00:03:44.340> Orleans<00:03:44.730> one<00:03:44.970> at<00:03:45.090> home<00:03:45.269> 45<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.410> 16

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
year New Orleans one at home 45 to 16

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.550 
year New Orleans one at home 45 to 16
and<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.970> Falcons<00:03:48.389> were<00:03:48.510> really<00:03:48.810> salty<00:03:49.109> after

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
and the Falcons were really salty after

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.690 
and the Falcons were really salty after
that<00:03:49.709> game<00:03:49.889> because<00:03:50.099> they<00:03:50.220> felt<00:03:50.400> like<00:03:50.579> the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
that game because they felt like the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.430 
that game because they felt like the
saints<00:03:50.970> ran<00:03:51.269> up<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.630> score<00:03:51.720> against<00:03:52.290> them

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
saints ran up the score against them

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.440 
saints ran up the score against them
because<00:03:52.799> Drew<00:03:53.250> Brees<00:03:53.400> was<00:03:53.819> still<00:03:54.060> trying<00:03:54.209> to

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
because Drew Brees was still trying to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.289 
because Drew Brees was still trying to
get<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.930> NFL<00:03:55.349> passing<00:03:55.889> records<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.760> that's

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
get the NFL passing records so that's

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.449 
get the NFL passing records so that's
still<00:03:57.660> in<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.109> back<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.319> Atlanta's<00:03:58.829> mine<00:03:59.040> and

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
still in the back of Atlanta's mine and

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.059 
still in the back of Atlanta's mine and
I<00:03:59.639> have<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.819> feeling<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.239> if<00:04:00.450> they<00:04:00.599> get<00:04:00.989> up<00:04:01.260> you

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
I have a feeling that if they get up you

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.009 
I have a feeling that if they get up you
know<00:04:02.160> double<00:04:02.760> digits<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.329> scores<00:04:03.660> like<00:04:03.900> I

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
know double digits to scores like I

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.539 
know double digits to scores like I
expect<00:04:04.410> them<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.799> against<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.190> saints

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
expect them to be against the saints

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.949 
expect them to be against the saints
they're<00:04:05.880> not<00:04:06.150> going<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.419> take<00:04:06.569> their<00:04:06.720> foot<00:04:06.900> off
