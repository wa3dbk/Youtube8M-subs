webworm<00:01:16.760> so<00:01:17.510> what<00:01:17.630> we're<00:01:17.780> going<00:01:17.869> to<00:01:17.930> do<00:01:18.050> is

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
webworm so what we're going to do is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.890 
webworm so what we're going to do is
look<00:01:18.260> a<00:01:18.380> little<00:01:18.530> bit<00:01:18.710> closer<00:01:18.979> into<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.520> thatch

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
look a little bit closer into the thatch

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.010 
look a little bit closer into the thatch
area<00:01:20.920> maybe<00:01:21.920> even<00:01:22.250> use<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.400> soap<00:01:22.790> drench<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.840> see

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
area maybe even use a soap drench to see

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.350 
area maybe even use a soap drench to see
what<00:01:24.200> we<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.530> get<00:01:24.650> to<00:01:24.890> pop<00:01:25.430> out<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:26.090> thatch

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
what we can get to pop out of the thatch

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.990 
what we can get to pop out of the thatch
and<00:01:26.780> then<00:01:27.440> we<00:01:27.560> can<00:01:27.740> decide<00:01:28.220> what<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.580> use<00:01:28.610> to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
and then we can decide what to use to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.359 
and then we can decide what to use to
treat<00:01:29.300> it<00:01:29.479> whether<00:01:29.720> it's<00:01:29.900> sod<00:01:30.680> web<00:01:30.950> worm<00:01:31.190> or

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
treat it whether it's sod web worm or

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.219 
treat it whether it's sod web worm or
chinch<00:01:31.610> bugs<00:01:31.910> all<00:01:32.660> right<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:32.990> we<00:01:33.110> went

practices which means looking at your

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.510 
practices which means looking at your
fertilizer<00:05:08.140> rates<00:05:08.560> how<00:05:09.040> much<00:05:09.220> is<00:05:09.370> being

applied too much soluble nitrogen can
lead<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.580> too<00:05:13.120> many<00:05:13.270> caterpillars<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:14.740> don't

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
lead to too many caterpillars you don't

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.190 
lead to too many caterpillars you don't
wanna<00:05:15.160> track<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:15.760> to<00:05:15.880> your<00:05:16.030> lush<00:05:16.270> green<00:05:16.660> carpet

wanna track it to your lush green carpet

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.050 
wanna track it to your lush green carpet
and<00:05:17.410> that's<00:05:17.830> where<00:05:18.100> they<00:05:18.190> put<00:05:18.220> their<00:05:18.550> eggs

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
and that's where they put their eggs

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.360 
and that's where they put their eggs
the<00:05:19.660> other<00:05:19.780> consideration<00:05:20.170> is<00:05:20.830> are<00:05:21.130> you

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
the other consideration is are you

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.030 
the other consideration is are you
applying<00:05:21.640> pesticides<00:05:22.200> willy-nilly<00:05:23.200> without

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
applying pesticides willy-nilly without

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.280 
applying pesticides willy-nilly without
any<00:05:24.220> pest<00:05:24.460> being<00:05:24.730> present<00:05:25.240> if<00:05:26.080> you're

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
any pest being present if you're

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.570 
any pest being present if you're
applying<00:05:26.440> pesticides

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
applying pesticides

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.970 
applying pesticides
you're<00:05:28.420> also<00:05:28.600> suppressing<00:05:29.350> the<00:05:29.440> good<00:05:29.650> bugs

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
you're also suppressing the good bugs

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.220 
you're also suppressing the good bugs
what<00:05:30.610> I<00:05:30.640> call<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.060> attack<00:05:31.390> bugs<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:32.050> help

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
what I call the attack bugs that help

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.850 
what I call the attack bugs that help
keep<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.920> bad<00:05:33.130> bugs<00:05:33.490> at<00:05:33.730> bay<00:05:33.760> and<00:05:34.270> in<00:05:34.660> check<00:05:34.990> so

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
keep the bad bugs at bay and in check so

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.680 
keep the bad bugs at bay and in check so
if<00:05:35.890> you're<00:05:36.250> applying<00:05:36.400> pesticides<00:05:36.610> too<00:05:37.210> often

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
if you're applying pesticides too often

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.140 
if you're applying pesticides too often
you<00:05:38.230> may<00:05:38.410> also<00:05:38.680> induce<00:05:39.220> a<00:05:39.490> caterpillar

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
you may also induce a caterpillar

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.120 
you may also induce a caterpillar
outbreak<00:05:40.690> so<00:05:40.990> we've<00:05:41.170> determined<00:05:41.530> we've<00:05:41.950> got

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
outbreak so we've determined we've got

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.730 
outbreak so we've determined we've got
too<00:05:42.400> many<00:05:42.520> caterpillars<00:05:43.380> what<00:05:44.380> do<00:05:44.440> we<00:05:44.560> do

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
too many caterpillars what do we do

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.070 
too many caterpillars what do we do
about<00:05:44.860> it<00:05:45.010> now<00:05:45.340> there's<00:05:46.120> several<00:05:46.480> approaches

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
about it now there's several approaches

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.890 
about it now there's several approaches
one<00:05:47.920> is<00:05:48.070> use<00:05:48.280> a<00:05:48.310> broad-spectrum<00:05:48.900> insecticide

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
one is use a broad-spectrum insecticide

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.380 
one is use a broad-spectrum insecticide
that<00:05:49.930> nukes<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:51.130> good<00:05:51.370> bugs<00:05:51.610> along<00:05:52.060> with<00:05:52.270> the

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
that nukes the good bugs along with the

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.020 
that nukes the good bugs along with the
bad<00:05:52.600> bugs<00:05:52.930> some<00:05:53.440> broad-spectrum

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
bad bugs some broad-spectrum

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.290

approach<00:06:10.660> with<00:06:10.990> chemical<00:06:11.830> pesticides<00:06:12.520> is<00:06:12.880> to

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
approach with chemical pesticides is to

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.800 
approach with chemical pesticides is to
use<00:06:13.270> a<00:06:13.600> bio<00:06:14.320> rationale<00:06:15.010> and<00:06:15.190> this<00:06:16.180> means<00:06:16.480> it's

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
use a bio rationale and this means it's

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.710 
use a bio rationale and this means it's
got<00:06:17.260> us<00:06:17.920> a<00:06:17.980> narrow<00:06:18.400> spectrum<00:06:19.060> in<00:06:19.240> other<00:06:19.480> words

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
got us a narrow spectrum in other words

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.950 
got us a narrow spectrum in other words
there's<00:06:20.500> product<00:06:20.950> called<00:06:21.190> spinosa<00:06:22.000> which<00:06:22.750> is

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
there's product called spinosa which is

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.380 
there's product called spinosa which is
good<00:06:23.200> for<00:06:23.380> caterpillars<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.430> it<00:06:25.030> doesn't

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
good for caterpillars and it doesn't

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.620 
good for caterpillars and it doesn't
take<00:06:25.540> out<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:26.320> good<00:06:26.560> bugs<00:06:26.820> so<00:06:27.820> it's<00:06:28.450> only

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
take out the good bugs so it's only

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.120 
take out the good bugs so it's only
going<00:06:28.840> to<00:06:28.900> take<00:06:28.990> out<00:06:29.230> the<00:06:29.410> bad<00:06:29.650> bugs<00:06:29.950> that<00:06:30.070> are

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
going to take out the bad bugs that are

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.310 
going to take out the bad bugs that are
affecting<00:06:30.700> your<00:06:31.000> crop<00:06:31.330> in<00:06:31.600> other<00:06:31.750> words<00:06:31.990> your
