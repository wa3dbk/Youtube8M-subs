automation okay all right so I'll just
tell<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.750> does<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> work<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.159> an

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
tell you how does it work this is an

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
tell you how does it work this is an
emergency<00:01:08.700> switch<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.630> case<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.439> can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
emergency switch in case like we can

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.550 
emergency switch in case like we can
switch<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.610> on/off<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.810> whole<00:01:12.990> circuit

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
switch it on/off and the whole circuit

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.140 
switch it on/off and the whole circuit
all<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.159> pressure<00:01:14.369> inside<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> circuit

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
all the pressure inside the circuit

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.870 
all the pressure inside the circuit
stops<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.659> once<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.340> free<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
stops at once and they do get it free I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.399 
stops at once and they do get it free I
can<00:01:18.330> open<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> okay<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.619> I'll<00:01:19.740> tell<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.040> how<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
can open it okay so I'll tell you how to

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.170 
can open it okay so I'll tell you how to
pressing<00:01:22.409> them<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> automation

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
pressing them this one is the automation

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.960 
pressing them this one is the automation
switch<00:01:24.740> advances<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.159> legit<00:01:26.580> front

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
switch advances all this legit front

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.560 
switch advances all this legit front
right

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
right

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.050 
right
this<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:28.990> time<00:01:29.260> delay<00:01:29.560> which<00:01:30.160> is<00:01:30.340> said<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.580> like

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
this is time delay which is said to like

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.310 
this is time delay which is said to like
I<00:01:31.380> guess<00:01:32.380> 8<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.890> 10<00:01:33.130> seconds<00:01:33.580> which<00:01:34.420> will<00:01:34.990> bring

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
I guess 8 to 10 seconds which will bring

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.230 
I guess 8 to 10 seconds which will bring
back<00:01:35.710> all<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.160> cylinders<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.880> completion

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
back all the cylinders to completion

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.620 
back all the cylinders to completion
issue<00:01:37.900> position<00:01:38.560> after<00:01:39.430> all<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.180> also<00:01:40.360> a

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
issue position after all we can also a

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.260 
issue position after all we can also a
system<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.380> individually<00:01:42.220> these<00:01:42.970> are<00:01:43.120> all

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
system of individually these are all

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.540 
system of individually these are all
switches<00:01:43.660> switches<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.830> can<00:01:44.860> close<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.220> I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
switches switches you can close it I

00:01:45.550 --> 00:02:04.510 
switches switches you can close it I
will<00:01:46.120> show<00:01:46.300> you<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.480> demonstration

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:37.220 

open<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:14.209> okay<00:02:18.319> yep<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:36.600> freshness<00:02:36.930> stops

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
open it okay yep the freshness stops

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.650 
open it okay yep the freshness stops
inside<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.769> circuit<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.209> doors<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.630> think

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
inside the circuit and the doors I think

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.900 
inside the circuit and the doors I think
the<00:02:40.440> doors<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.830> free<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.160> people<00:02:41.489> can<00:02:41.640> get<00:02:41.760> in

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the doors are free so people can get in

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.170 
the doors are free so people can get in
