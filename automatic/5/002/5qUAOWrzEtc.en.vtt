00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
as it's grown up and we're continuing to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.770 
as it's grown up and we're continuing to
eat<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.520> hasn't<00:01:38.700> gotten<00:01:39.000> bitter<00:01:39.270> yet<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
eat it it hasn't gotten bitter yet this

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.810 
eat it it hasn't gotten bitter yet this
is<00:01:39.930> also<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.710> great<00:01:40.890> thing<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> try<00:01:41.579> in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
is also a really great thing to try in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.580 
is also a really great thing to try in
containers<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> stuff<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.079> just

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
containers and stuff like this just

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.960 
containers and stuff like this just
because<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> root<00:01:44.130> system<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.640> pretty

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
because the root system is pretty

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.600 
because the root system is pretty
shallow<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.710> good<00:01:46.829> option<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
shallow it's a really good option and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.389 
shallow it's a really good option and
cilantro<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:49.140> gotten<00:01:49.470> quite<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> bit<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
cilantro I have gotten quite a bit of it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
cilantro I have gotten quite a bit of it
went<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> seed<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.509> we're<00:01:51.659> cutting<00:01:51.960> it

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
went to seed and so we're cutting it

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.630 
went to seed and so we're cutting it
down<00:01:52.079> again<00:01:52.560> hoping<00:01:53.250> we're<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> get

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
down again hoping we're going to get

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.219 
down again hoping we're going to get
some<00:01:53.850> regrowth<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.049> should

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
some regrowth because really this should

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.959 
some regrowth because really this should
last<00:01:55.409> into<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.860> season<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.820> should

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
last into this season but we should

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
last into this season but we should
always<00:01:57.180> had<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.570> such<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> difficult<00:01:58.290> time

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
always had just such a difficult time

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.109 
always had just such a difficult time
growing<00:01:58.680> cilantro<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.640> guys<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.939> any

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
growing cilantro if you guys have any

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
growing cilantro if you guys have any
tips<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.450> me<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.719> would<00:02:00.990> love<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.380> hear<00:02:01.530> them

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
tips for me I would love to hear them

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.100 
tips for me I would love to hear them
and<00:02:02.159> our<00:02:02.640> tomato<00:02:02.850> plants<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.630> went<00:02:03.780> ahead<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and our tomato plants we went ahead and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
and our tomato plants we went ahead and
put<00:02:04.290> some<00:02:04.320> leaves<00:02:04.770> down<00:02:05.100> below<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.790> help

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
put some leaves down below just to help

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.670 
put some leaves down below just to help
retain<00:02:06.329> moisture<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.079> soil<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
retain moisture in the soil and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.650 
retain moisture in the soil and
something<00:02:08.429> else<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.300> with<00:02:09.509> these

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
something else that we do with these

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.589 
something else that we do with these
guys<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:11.190> want<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.489> trim<00:02:11.819> back<00:02:12.060> some<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
guys is you want to trim back some of

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.770 
guys is you want to trim back some of
the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.510 
the
access<00:02:13.110> branches<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> main

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
access branches so you have the main

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.699 
access branches so you have the main
stock<00:02:15.000> that's<00:02:15.600> going<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.930> really<00:02:16.110> allow<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.470> lot

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
stock that's going to really allow a lot

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.650 
stock that's going to really allow a lot
more<00:02:16.740> energy<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.400> go<00:02:17.580> toward<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.180> fruit<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
more energy to go toward the fruit and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.059 
more energy to go toward the fruit and
stuff<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.530> we've<00:02:19.680> always<00:02:19.830> had

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
stuff like that so we've always had

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.160 
stuff like that so we've always had
really<00:02:20.220> good<00:02:20.340> luck<00:02:20.670> doing<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.000> over<00:02:21.750> here<00:02:22.110> we

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
really good luck doing that over here we

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.410 
really good luck doing that over here we
have<00:02:22.709> our<00:02:22.950> peppers<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:24.090> thing<00:02:24.270> we're

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
have our peppers and one thing we're

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.790 
have our peppers and one thing we're
doing<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:24.990> that's<00:02:25.200> totally<00:02:25.680> different

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
doing this here that's totally different

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.170 
doing this here that's totally different
than<00:02:26.040> what<00:02:26.220> we've<00:02:26.340> done<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.490> previous<00:02:26.940> years

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
than what we've done in previous years

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.690 
than what we've done in previous years
is<00:02:27.420> we're<00:02:28.020> putting<00:02:28.200> compost<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.400> fresh

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is we're putting compost on this fresh

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.760 
is we're putting compost on this fresh
compost<00:02:30.000> every<00:02:30.450> three<00:02:31.020> weeks<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.440> we're<00:02:31.620> just

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
compost every three weeks and we're just

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.500 
compost every three weeks and we're just
already<00:02:32.489> can<00:02:32.670> tell<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.880> difference<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
already can tell a difference in the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.910 
already can tell a difference in the
plants<00:02:33.870> just<00:02:33.930> from<00:02:34.230> doing<00:02:34.319> that<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.620> then

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
plants just from doing that and then

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.660 
plants just from doing that and then
here<00:02:35.459> we<00:02:35.819> have<00:02:35.850> some<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:37.230> our<00:02:37.380> smaller<00:02:38.130> tomato

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
here we have some of our smaller tomato

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.880 
here we have some of our smaller tomato
varieties<00:02:39.239> growing<00:02:39.630> over<00:02:39.840> here<00:02:40.170> again<00:02:40.739> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
varieties growing over here again the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.559 
varieties growing over here again the
same<00:02:41.130> thing<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.730> trim<00:02:41.940> back<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.180> stock

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
same thing we just trim back the stock

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.270 
same thing we just trim back the stock
just<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.050> could<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.350> more<00:02:43.860> energy<00:02:44.040> to

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
just so it could have more energy to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.610 
just so it could have more energy to
gain<00:02:44.520> height<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.150> go<00:02:45.600> towards<00:02:46.110> producing

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
gain height and go towards producing

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.380 
gain height and go towards producing
fruit<00:02:46.920> these<00:02:47.489> are<00:02:47.700> all<00:02:47.820> our<00:02:47.910> green<00:02:48.150> beans

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
fruit these are all our green beans

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.780 
fruit these are all our green beans
these<00:02:48.720> guys<00:02:48.930> came<00:02:49.290> from<00:02:49.620> seed<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.400> planted

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
these guys came from seed and we planted

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.940 
these guys came from seed and we planted
them<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.209> staggered<00:02:51.690> way<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.650> ones<00:02:52.800> on

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
them in a staggered way so the ones on

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.350 
them in a staggered way so the ones on
this<00:02:53.100> side<00:02:53.310> are<00:02:53.430> older<00:02:53.790> than<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> ones<00:02:54.209> on

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
this side are older than the ones on

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.400 
this side are older than the ones on
this<00:02:54.510> side<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.230> then<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.850> our

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
this side and then in here we have our

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.020 
this side and then in here we have our
cucumbers<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.680> I'm<00:02:59.130> not<00:02:59.340> really<00:02:59.550> sure<00:02:59.670> how

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
cucumbers and I'm not really sure how

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.670 
cucumbers and I'm not really sure how
these<00:03:00.209> guys<00:03:00.420> are<00:03:00.630> doing<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.080> one<00:03:01.290> looks<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
these guys are doing this one looks a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.440 
these guys are doing this one looks a
little<00:03:01.709> bit<00:03:01.950> small<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.640> me<00:03:02.760> I'm<00:03:02.910> not<00:03:03.060> really<00:03:03.300> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
little bit small to me I'm not really a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.540 
little bit small to me I'm not really a
hundred<00:03:03.780> percent<00:03:04.080> certain<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:04.470> we'll<00:03:05.190> see<00:03:05.430> as
