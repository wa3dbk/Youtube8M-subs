00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
a point here he is compared to g1 blur

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.090 
a point here he is compared to g1 blur
which<00:02:25.690> isn't<00:02:26.080> complete<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.680> he's<00:02:26.830> missing

better poses with it really really sick

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.690 
better poses with it really really sick
so<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.440> definitely<00:03:29.709> recommend<00:03:30.040> picking<00:03:30.459> up

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
so I definitely recommend picking up

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.390 
so I definitely recommend picking up
blur<00:03:30.940> for<00:03:31.209> sure<00:03:31.540> he's<00:03:32.440> really<00:03:32.709> cheap<00:03:33.160> he's

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
blur for sure he's really cheap he's

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.099 
blur for sure he's really cheap he's
probably<00:03:33.609> anywhere<00:03:33.940> from<00:03:34.000> like<00:03:34.120> 999<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.959> like

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
probably anywhere from like 999 to like

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.660 
probably anywhere from like 999 to like
1499

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
1499

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.580 
1499
and<00:03:37.670> even<00:03:38.510> if<00:03:38.569> you<00:03:38.659> have<00:03:38.870> drift<00:03:39.230> already<00:03:39.500> you

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
and even if you have drift already you

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.839 
and even if you have drift already you
should<00:03:39.709> definitely<00:03:39.920> get<00:03:40.189> blurred<00:03:40.430> because<00:03:40.610> I

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
should definitely get blurred because I
