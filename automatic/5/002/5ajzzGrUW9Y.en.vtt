00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.920 

the<00:00:18.680> one<00:00:18.920> quick<00:00:19.250> tiny<00:00:19.730> piece<00:00:20.180> of<00:00:20.390> news<00:00:20.570> today

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
the one quick tiny piece of news today

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.050 
the one quick tiny piece of news today
is<00:00:20.960> that<00:00:21.200> Capisce<00:00:21.800> has<00:00:22.100> tweeted<00:00:22.369> up<00:00:22.700> a<00:00:22.820> picture

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
is that Capisce has tweeted up a picture

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.510 
is that Capisce has tweeted up a picture
of<00:00:23.480> what<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:24.110> crafting<00:00:24.770> system<00:00:24.830> in<00:00:25.400> the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
of what the crafting system in the

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.810 
of what the crafting system in the
pocket<00:00:25.939> edition<00:00:26.090> is<00:00:26.920> probably<00:00:27.920> going<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.490> look

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
pocket edition is probably going to look

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.929 
pocket edition is probably going to look
like<00:00:28.850> so<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:29.689> isn't<00:00:30.380> definite<00:00:30.950> final<00:00:31.700> but

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
like so this isn't definite final but

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.570 
like so this isn't definite final but
it's<00:00:32.150> almost<00:00:32.530> final<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:33.860> shouldn't<00:00:34.220> be<00:00:34.309> too

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
it's almost final so it shouldn't be too

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.880 
it's almost final so it shouldn't be too
much<00:00:34.760> different<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.809> this<00:00:36.020> picture<00:00:36.379> here

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
much different to this picture here

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.979 
much different to this picture here
which<00:00:37.129> is<00:00:37.309> very<00:00:37.550> interesting<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:38.660> I'll<00:00:38.750> put<00:00:38.930> a

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
which is very interesting so I'll put a

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.630 
which is very interesting so I'll put a
link<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.290> that<00:00:39.410> in<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.739> description<00:00:39.860> if<00:00:40.610> you

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
link to that in the description if you

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.619 
link to that in the description if you
want<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.030> go<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.330> look<00:00:41.420> at<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.780> yourself<00:00:43.629> so

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
want to go and look at it yourself so

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.570 
want to go and look at it yourself so

three by three sliding puzzle game this

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.860 
three by three sliding puzzle game this
might<00:00:52.040> seem<00:00:52.309> relatively<00:00:52.790> simple<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.660> build

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
might seem relatively simple to build

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.770 
might seem relatively simple to build
until<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:54.800> realize<00:00:55.340> that<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.059> redstone<00:00:56.570> can

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
until you realize that the redstone can

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.220 
until you realize that the redstone can
actually<00:00:57.290> detect<00:00:57.680> when<00:00:58.399> you've<00:00:58.700> solved<00:00:59.480> it<00:00:59.690> so

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
actually detect when you've solved it so

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.930 
actually detect when you've solved it so
it's<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.440> very<00:01:00.469> clever<00:01:00.890> idea<00:01:01.399> go<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:01.790> check

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
it's a very clever idea go and check

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.999 
it's a very clever idea go and check

the<00:01:19.399> ladder<00:01:19.610> behavior<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:20.720> that's<00:01:20.930> definitely

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
the ladder behavior so that's definitely

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.070 
the ladder behavior so that's definitely
worth<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:22.100> watch<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.729> final<00:01:23.450> video<00:01:23.600> today's
