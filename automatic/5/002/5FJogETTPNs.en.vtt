00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it could be anywhere so I'm really

advertising<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.149> people<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.809> probably

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
advertising it to people that probably

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.190 
advertising it to people that probably
don't<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.399> GTA<00:00:42.090> 5<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.719> much<00:00:42.930> or

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
don't know about GTA 5 all that much or

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.529 
don't know about GTA 5 all that much or
maybe<00:00:44.100> you're<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.399> familiar<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> idea

of<00:00:45.570> GTA<00:00:46.020> 5<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.440> think<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.710> would<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.070> kind

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
of GTA 5 I think it would be really kind

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
of GTA 5 I think it would be really kind
of<00:00:47.579> new<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.660> hopefully<00:00:48.870> we'll<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.289> some

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
of new way and hopefully we'll get some

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
of new way and hopefully we'll get some
new<00:00:49.620> information<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.370> some<00:00:50.489> new<00:00:50.700> little

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
new information and some new little

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
new information and some new little
looks<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:52.110> GTA<00:00:52.469> 5<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:52.980> haven't<00:00:53.190> seen

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
looks at GTA 5 that we haven't seen

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
all they might be a mega breakdown it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.550 
all they might be a mega breakdown it
depends<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.270> kind<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> video<00:01:40.200> I'd

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
depends what kind of is in the video I'd

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.100 
depends what kind of is in the video I'd
like<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> mega<00:01:41.340> breakdown<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.869> it's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
like to do a mega breakdown but if it's

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.830 
like to do a mega breakdown but if it's
only<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.590> five<00:01:43.920> seconds<00:01:44.399> long<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
only like five seconds long I think I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.380 
only like five seconds long I think I
might<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.229> pushing<00:01:46.700> mega<00:01:47.700> break<00:01:48.060> down<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
might be pushing mega break down a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.289 
might be pushing mega break down a
little<00:01:48.840> too<00:01:49.290> far<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.070> I'm<00:01:50.250> nonetheless<00:01:50.909> i'll

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
little too far but I'm nonetheless i'll

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.929
