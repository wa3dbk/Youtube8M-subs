does<00:03:22.390> there<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.720> no<00:03:23.080> active<00:03:23.560> suspension<00:03:23.770> or

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
does there is no active suspension or

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.820 
does there is no active suspension or
engine<00:03:25.360> mapping<00:03:25.600> or<00:03:25.990> anything<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.470> think<00:03:26.710> it

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
engine mapping or anything I think it

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.520 
engine mapping or anything I think it
just<00:03:27.100> basically<00:03:27.460> takes<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:28.480> little<00:03:29.140> longer<00:03:29.350> for
