00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
a lot of dedication and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.440 
a lot of dedication and
that's<00:01:35.710> pretty<00:01:35.920> cool<00:01:36.070> though<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:37.119> garrison

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
that's pretty cool though this garrison

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.120 
that's pretty cool though this garrison
is<00:01:37.689> very<00:01:37.900> blast<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.619> we<00:01:38.770> have<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:38.920> very

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
is very blast and that we have a very

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.950 
is very blast and that we have a very
good<00:01:39.250> relationship<00:01:39.400> I<00:01:39.970> think<00:01:40.000> with<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.630> the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
good relationship I think with the the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.300 
good relationship I think with the the
City<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.290> Edmonton<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.860> surrounding

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
City of Edmonton and the surrounding

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.370 
City of Edmonton and the surrounding
communities<00:01:42.729> we're<00:01:43.420> constantly<00:01:43.720> sending<00:01:44.259> our

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
communities we're constantly sending our

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.170 
communities we're constantly sending our
troops<00:01:44.860> out<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.130> door<00:01:45.280> overseas<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:45.940> we<00:01:46.060> have

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
troops out the door overseas so we have

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.789 
troops out the door overseas so we have
a<00:01:46.210> good<00:01:46.540> level<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.900> support<00:01:47.259> I<00:01:47.320> think<00:01:47.350> from<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
a good level of support I think from the

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.530 
a good level of support I think from the
community<00:01:48.250> but<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.640> think<00:01:48.729> as<00:01:49.030> much<00:01:49.210> as<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
community but I think as much as the

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.760 
community but I think as much as the
community<00:01:49.840> supports<00:01:50.229> us<00:01:50.320> they<00:01:50.439> don't<00:01:50.530> really

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
community supports us they don't really

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.430 
community supports us they don't really
know<00:01:50.920> what<00:01:51.130> we<00:01:51.250> do<00:01:51.460> they<00:01:52.360> come<00:01:52.540> out<00:01:52.659> here<00:01:52.869> and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
know what we do they come out here and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200 
know what we do they come out here and
they<00:01:53.560> get<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.950> chance<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.250> experience<00:01:54.759> what<00:01:55.180> a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
they get a chance to experience what a

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.600 
they get a chance to experience what a
soldier<00:01:55.570> would<00:01:55.720> go<00:01:55.960> through<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:57.280> harder

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
soldier would go through it's harder

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.230 
soldier would go through it's harder
than<00:01:57.759> it<00:01:57.880> looks

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
than it looks

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.289 
than it looks
I<00:01:58.390> think<00:01:59.700> especially<00:02:00.700> with<00:02:00.789> everything<00:02:00.880> that

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
I think especially with everything that

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.060 
I think especially with everything that
you<00:02:01.990> guys<00:02:02.170> are<00:02:02.320> doing<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.590> Canadian<00:02:02.950> Forces

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.010 
you guys are doing the Canadian Forces
doing<00:02:03.520> over<00:02:03.729> in<00:02:03.820> Afghanistan<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.720> gives<00:02:04.869> you<00:02:04.990> a

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
doing over in Afghanistan it gives you a

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.080 
doing over in Afghanistan it gives you a
different<00:02:05.320> perspective<00:02:05.799> of<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.580> especially

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
different perspective of it especially

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.449 
different perspective of it especially
for<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.690> live-fire<00:02:08.289> simulation<00:02:09.009> that<00:02:09.130> we<00:02:09.280> did

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
for the live-fire simulation that we did

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.190 
for the live-fire simulation that we did
I<00:02:09.759> can't<00:02:10.060> imagine<00:02:10.149> what<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.690> guys<00:02:10.840> have<00:02:11.080> to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
deal with over there it it really

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.840 
deal with over there it it really
changes<00:02:13.510> your<00:02:13.690> perspective<00:02:14.019> on<00:02:14.410> things<00:02:14.850> seen

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
changes your perspective on things seen

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.580 
changes your perspective on things seen

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the kind of things soldiers do has given

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.690
