00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hello and always welcome to 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.270
 There is a new video from today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:17.220
 an unboxing also samsung ue 46 11 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:18.990
 610 smart tv I have twice 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.760
 packaging has the last week already 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.680
 once an unboxing also lg tv 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.090
 made because unfortunately I had to steal the wm 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.500
 I have to give it back then 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.150
 decided for this model 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.130
 So that's why I have the times is enough 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.050
 also not a good unboxing 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 samsung has found again here 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.590
 a small picture I have here now 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.489
 the white variant therefore 6510 city 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.520
 6500 smardtv full hd and 3d we wlan 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.410
 have 400 hertz for example and there 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.510
 over there again a dual cores i 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.309
 was practically directly on the already 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 delivered by hermes that was something 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.180
 better with the others there, find it 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.920
 a bit longer because you have to do this twice 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.690
 service then we have now as 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.489
 First of all, two times the 3d 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.079
 eyeglasses with the work 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 with it batteries and are not just anymore 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.180
 the polarization glasses then we have 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.710
 I already have the pack of accessories 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.810
 times the one connection with it also one 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.610
 second with it power cable and too 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.380
 things again samsung defies you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.880
 later an extra point to the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.320
 then next is the little one 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.400
 parts of the stand that we then 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.479
 probably later in the back 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.470
 screwed I say then as well 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.750
 here again the stand in 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.009
 white below and here above beautiful silver 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.990
 everything wrapped up nicely 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.280
 Not scratching whole does not have then 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.350
 TV already here too 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.869
 again tackled the grad times 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.070
 short out where I have it already can 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.900
 Of course they are done wrong 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.180
 advantage to read the manual 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.079
 First, we have to plate this wise 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.670
 screw on here 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.590
 you just put it around 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.450
 needs and then look the screws 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.950
 from the top here as well next 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.439
 internet just the screwed 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.790
 Part has said here and put it 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.979
 then there are such small ones 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.420
 Strengthen where is that so stuck ask 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.590
 You can just do that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.450
 the remaining four screws in there 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.369
 then screw here now the short 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.310
 Connections we now have three times here 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.460
 usb then we have 3 x hdmi then 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.690
 a quarter hdmi in the infrared 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.490
 plug there is again in 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.869
 the accessory package for a small part but 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.560
 that's mine for the second 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.330
 remote Control 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.460
 you can easily put that in there 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.880
 then we have a jack plug for 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.590
 headphones the event port a skateboard 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.420
 and here for various audio plugs 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.370
 and here is the optical audio 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.990
 input then have one more here now 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.550
 small control to the whole 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.600
 Turn on loud or read the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.860
 next station if you have the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.270
 Remote control is broken or something 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.440
 then probably we have animal then 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.510
 the slot for the included 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.160
 Power cable which is also white 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.390
 you can easily plug in and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.130
 then on the other side in the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.750
 socket to show a short two times 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.030
 what was there we show this 3d 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.000
 then take a look at this infrared 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.610
 receiver for the remote control, the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.200
 white power cables then such here 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.190
 small plug that will be 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.630
 probably for the wall bracket 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.080
 of course I would have to be myself 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.730
 then inform a small additional module 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.500
 I do not know why that works yet 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.170
 is meant and of course the two 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.480
 remotes once this touch 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.190
 remote control and also the normal 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.050
 remote control with the white and batteries 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.430
 were also there if still 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.750
 Any questions about that 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.800
 TV could be quite easy in me 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.300
 to write the comments 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.320
 if you want to see him again 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.300

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.780
 up and subscribe to our channel and up 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.780
