00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
fan speed down all I have to do is hit

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.509 
fan speed down all I have to do is hit
the<00:02:48.420> fan<00:02:48.600> down<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.620> turns<00:02:49.799> a<00:02:49.920> fan<00:02:50.100> down<00:02:50.280> or

right<00:03:22.380> now<00:03:22.560> we're<00:03:22.890> sitting<00:03:23.070> at<00:03:23.310> 600<00:03:24.000> rpms

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
right now we're sitting at 600 rpms

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.000 
right now we're sitting at 600 rpms
which<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> normal<00:03:24.959> idle<00:03:25.380> speed<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.800> if<00:03:25.890> we

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
which is a normal idle speed and if we

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.770 
which is a normal idle speed and if we
can<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> gas<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> little<00:03:26.790> bit<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.630> saw

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
can have the gas a little bit you saw
