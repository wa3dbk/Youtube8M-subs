beginning they were really strong so I'm
trying<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.350> I'm<00:02:13.350> just<00:02:13.650> filling

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890

the most easiest things to recreate

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.160 
the most easiest things to recreate
because<00:02:23.340> they<00:02:23.550> didn't<00:02:23.850> use<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.210> much<00:02:24.540> color<00:02:24.960> as

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
