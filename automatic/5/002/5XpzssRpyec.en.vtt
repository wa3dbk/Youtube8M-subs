this<00:00:08.940> time<00:00:09.150> we're<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.450> take<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.690> look<00:00:09.870> at

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
this time we're going to take a look at

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.330 
this time we're going to take a look at
a<00:00:10.050> system<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.620> not<00:00:10.650> actually<00:00:10.920> mine

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
a system that is not actually mine

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.280 
a system that is not actually mine
because<00:00:11.849> I'm<00:00:12.030> not<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.570> home<00:00:12.750> or<00:00:12.929> at<00:00:13.049> my<00:00:13.110> dad's

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
because I'm not at home or at my dad's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.720 
because I'm not at home or at my dad's
place<00:00:13.349> or<00:00:13.559> anything<00:00:13.740> my<00:00:14.099> girlfriend's<00:00:14.580> house

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
at the moment and this is her 2006 mech

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
Mac Pro here on the front we have

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.990 
Mac Pro here on the front we have
nothing<00:00:24.900> very<00:00:25.109> amazing<00:00:25.519> is<00:00:26.519> basically<00:00:26.880> just

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
nothing very amazing is basically just

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.210 
nothing very amazing is basically just

of<00:00:32.309> course<00:00:32.520> there's<00:00:32.730> nice<00:00:32.880> mesh<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.860> they

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
of course there's nice mesh that they

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.319 
of course there's nice mesh that they
pretty<00:00:35.040> much<00:00:35.219> kept<00:00:35.520> from<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> design<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
Power Mac g5 I used to own one I sold it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.250 
Power Mac g5 I used to own one I sold it
but<00:00:40.200> anyway<00:00:41.210> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.570> back<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.020> quite<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
but anyway on the back here is quite a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.369 
but anyway on the back here is quite a
bit<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.770> terms<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> peripherals<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:46.140> have

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
bit more in terms of peripherals we have

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.660 
bit more in terms of peripherals we have
the<00:00:47.390> power<00:00:48.390> supply<00:00:48.690> that's<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:49.670> just

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the power supply that's up here now just

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.450 
the power supply that's up here now just
beyond<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> bottom<00:00:51.210> onto<00:00:51.510> g5s<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:53.160> anyway

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
beyond the bottom onto g5s but anyway

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310

is the memory it runs at about 75
degrees<00:01:50.869> Celsius<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.979> funny
