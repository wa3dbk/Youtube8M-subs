00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
just an alternative method in a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.019 
just an alternative method in a
different<00:00:16.619> spot<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.039> map<00:00:17.220> now<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
different spot of the map now the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.090 
different spot of the map now the
original<00:00:18.180> method<00:00:18.750> does<00:00:19.170> still<00:00:19.560> work<00:00:19.830> I'll

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
original method does still work I'll

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.890

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.820 
just crouch your GoPro you can just
crawl

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
crawl

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.830 
crawl
under<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.100> or<00:02:13.220> walk<00:02:13.490> under<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:13.940> make<00:02:14.540> sure<00:02:14.570> you

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
otherwise you'll fall off the map and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.290 
otherwise you'll fall off the map and
die<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:19.070> if<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.310> stay<00:02:19.550> down<00:02:19.700> here<00:02:19.760> you'll<00:02:20.210> be

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
standing then you're going to ping on

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.770 
standing then you're going to ping on
the<00:02:24.980> radar<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.370> course<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.420> they're<00:02:26.570> going<00:02:26.690> to

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the radar of course so they're going to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.360 
the radar of course so they're going to
know<00:02:26.930> where<00:02:27.140> you're<00:02:27.320> at<00:02:27.500> but<00:02:28.070> if<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.250> get
