Katie<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.890> even<00:02:10.160> in<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:10.369> game<00:02:10.580> he<00:02:10.610> has<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.789> 3.5

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
Katie and even in this game he has a 3.5

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.260 
Katie and even in this game he has a 3.5
so<00:02:12.040> as<00:02:13.040> well<00:02:13.280> as<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.459> fact<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.819> he's<00:02:14.000> always

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270

so as well as the fact that he's always
have<00:02:14.420> quite<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> decent<00:02:14.959> hum<00:02:15.319> when<00:02:15.770> lost<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.220> go

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
have quite a decent hum when lost to go

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.700 
have quite a decent hum when lost to go
with<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:16.849> he<00:02:17.030> wins<00:02:17.270> /

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
with it so he wins /

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.610 
with it so he wins /
most<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.160> his<00:02:18.280> games<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.850> most<00:02:19.030> part<00:02:19.620> so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
most of his games for the most part so

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.000 
most of his games for the most part so
that's<00:02:20.890> pretty<00:02:21.130> much<00:02:21.220> how<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:23.650> know<00:02:23.740> know

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
that's pretty much how I you know know

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.280 
that's pretty much how I you know know
this<00:02:24.220> guy<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.700> why<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.360> think<00:02:25.480> he's<00:02:25.900> one<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
this guy and why I think he's one of the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.220 
this guy and why I think he's one of the
best<00:02:26.410> players<00:02:26.680> I've<00:02:26.830> ever<00:02:26.860> met<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:29.110> know

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
best players I've ever met and you know

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.320 
best players I've ever met and you know
just<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.830> few<00:02:29.950> if<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:30.490> against<00:02:30.910> him<00:02:31.090> I'm

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
just a few if you go against him I'm

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.360 
just a few if you go against him I'm
sure<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.720> must<00:02:31.780> not<00:02:32.110> be<00:02:32.290> fun<00:02:32.470> because<00:02:32.770> pretty

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
sure it must not be fun because pretty

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.720 
sure it must not be fun because pretty
much<00:02:33.460> every<00:02:34.270> game<00:02:34.510> he<00:02:34.900> puts<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.500> work<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.130> he

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
much every game he puts in work and he

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.730 
much every game he puts in work and he
doesn't<00:02:37.360> always<00:02:37.660> use<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.870> most<00:02:38.020> overpowered

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
doesn't always use the most overpowered

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.140 
doesn't always use the most overpowered
things<00:02:39.100> like<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.460> guys<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.730> see<00:02:39.760> right<00:02:40.000> here

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.600 
do the best as you possibly can I'd
recommend<00:03:03.850> more<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.180> like<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.500> PDW<00:03:05.500> or<00:03:05.920> an<00:03:05.980> MSMC

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
recommend more of like a PDW or an MSMC

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.030 
recommend more of like a PDW or an MSMC
but<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.870> know<00:03:07.960> he<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:08.260> kinda<00:03:08.560> uses<00:03:08.740> stuff

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
but you know he just kinda uses stuff

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.640 
but you know he just kinda uses stuff
like<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.370> still<00:03:09.700> manages<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.440> do<00:03:11.440> good

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
like this and still manages to do good

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.820 
like this and still manages to do good
with<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.990> something<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.230> think<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.710> was

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
with it and something I think that was

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.010 
with it and something I think that was
very<00:03:14.970> intriguing<00:03:15.970> about<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.660> I've

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
very intriguing about this is that I've

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.540 
very intriguing about this is that I've
never<00:03:17.200> seen<00:03:17.350> this<00:03:17.410> guy<00:03:17.620> go<00:03:17.770> negative<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.340> used

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
never seen this guy go negative I used

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.730 
never seen this guy go negative I used
to<00:03:18.580> play<00:03:18.730> with<00:03:18.880> them<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.060> lot<00:03:19.440> not<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.590> much

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
to play with them a lot not so much

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.980 
to play with them a lot not so much
anymore<00:03:21.360> hopefully<00:03:22.360> soon<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.780> because<00:03:22.930> I

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
anymore hopefully soon just because I

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.380 
anymore hopefully soon just because I
don't<00:03:23.050> play<00:03:23.290> black<00:03:23.560> ops<00:03:24.000> very<00:03:25.000> much<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.330> the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.070 
know was like one of a a really good
gameplay<00:04:36.610> from<00:04:36.669> him<00:04:36.970> but<00:04:37.180> from<00:04:37.840> what<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:37.990> could

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
gameplay from him but from what I could

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.020 
gameplay from him but from what I could
tell<00:04:38.229> this<00:04:38.590> right<00:04:38.949> here<00:04:39.190> was<00:04:39.280> pretty<00:04:39.639> much<00:04:39.819> on

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
tell this right here was pretty much on

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.909 
tell this right here was pretty much on
average<00:04:40.569> what<00:04:40.810> he<00:04:40.960> seemed<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.199> be<00:04:41.319> inflicting

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.110 
average what he seemed to be inflicting
on<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.099> enemies<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.520> believe<00:04:42.699> this<00:04:42.819> was<00:04:43.000> like<00:04:43.090> a

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
on the enemies I believe this was like a

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.370 
on the enemies I believe this was like a
37<00:04:43.780> or<00:04:43.930> two<00:04:44.080> game<00:04:44.349> and<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:46.060> don't<00:04:46.960> know<00:04:47.020> guys<00:04:47.199> I
