00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
players really from an offseason aspect

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.010

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
think there may be ready to turn that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.910 
think there may be ready to turn that
corner<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.600> make<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.870> progression<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.500> think

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
corner and make that progression I think

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.490 
corner and make that progression I think
they've<00:04:12.070> been<00:04:12.310> working<00:04:12.490> very<00:04:13.120> hard<00:04:13.390> from<00:04:13.990> in

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
they've been working very hard from in

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.680 
they've been working very hard from in
the<00:04:14.650> last<00:04:14.860> season<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.490> now<00:04:15.730> i<00:04:16.000> think<00:04:16.030> that

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
the last season so now i think that

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.180 
the last season so now i think that
there's<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.989> few<00:04:17.350> more<00:04:17.470> weeks<00:04:17.620> left<00:04:17.770> out<00:04:18.040> there

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
there's a few more weeks left out there

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.920 
there's a few more weeks left out there
before<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.549> snap<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.880> first<00:04:19.120> off<00:04:19.359> ball<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.780> the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
before we snap the first off ball in the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.780 
before we snap the first off ball in the
first<00:04:20.080> ballgame

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
first ballgame

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.850 
first ballgame
think<00:04:21.000> they<00:04:21.120> always<00:04:21.420> made<00:04:21.690> huge<00:04:22.380> jumps<00:04:22.770> I

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
think they always made huge jumps I

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.740 
think they always made huge jumps I
think<00:04:23.100> we<00:04:23.220> need<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.460> take<00:04:23.580> care<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.060> little

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
think we need to take care of the little

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.630 
think we need to take care of the little
bit<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.020> time<00:04:25.110> we<00:04:25.260> got<00:04:25.440> left<00:04:25.590> between<00:04:26.040> now<00:04:26.430> and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
bit of time we got left between now and

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.040 
bit of time we got left between now and
