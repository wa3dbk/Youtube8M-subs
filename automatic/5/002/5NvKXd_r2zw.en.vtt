tone<00:00:44.280> decay<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> last<00:00:45.840> 14<00:00:46.500> days<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.870> may

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
tone decay in the last 14 days so it may

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.139 
tone decay in the last 14 days so it may
not<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.680> considerable<00:00:50.430> different

players<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.719> example<00:00:52.489> bail<00:00:53.489> someone<00:00:54.000> like

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
players for example bail someone like

players for example bail someone like
that<00:00:54.230> may<00:00:55.230> only<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.800> dropping<00:00:56.579> by<00:00:56.610> about<00:00:57.030> 5<00:00:57.449> K

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
that may only be dropping by about 5 K

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.459 
that may only be dropping by about 5 K
however<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.670> you're<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.020> sell<00:01:01.289> your

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
however if you're going to sell your

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.740 
however if you're going to sell your
team<00:01:01.910> probably<00:01:02.910> sell<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> haven't

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
team probably sell it now if you haven't

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.520 
team probably sell it now if you haven't
done<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.019> already<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.530> just

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
done it already and then when we just

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.500 
done it already and then when we just
before<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.040> team<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> season<00:01:08.939> comes<00:01:09.240> out

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
before the team of season comes out

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.620 
before the team of season comes out
which<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> few<00:01:11.610> days<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.880> think<00:01:12.090> for

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
which will be in a few days I think for

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.950 
which will be in a few days I think for
10<00:01:12.990> days<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.680> maybe<00:01:14.280> whenever<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.509> seasons

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
10 days and maybe whenever the seasons

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
10 days and maybe whenever the seasons
finishing<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> whatever<00:01:17.670> country's<00:01:18.150> all

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
finishing the whatever country's all

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.700 
finishing the whatever country's all
about<00:01:19.159> then<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> recommend<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.299> buy<00:01:21.710> your

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
about then I recommend but you buy your

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
about then I recommend but you buy your
team<00:01:22.979> again<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.670> because<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> price<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
team again and because the price is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.300 
team again and because the price is
locked<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.259> probably<00:01:25.710> buy<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> team

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
locked you can probably buy the team

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.870 
locked you can probably buy the team
twice<00:01:26.930> when<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> team<00:01:28.290> Rises<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.310> be
