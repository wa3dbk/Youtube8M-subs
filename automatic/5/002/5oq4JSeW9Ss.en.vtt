to my food preparation area when I'm

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.219 
to my food preparation area when I'm
making<00:06:14.310> your<00:06:14.640> baking<00:06:15.000> things<00:06:15.270> this<00:06:15.960> is<00:06:16.200> a

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
making your baking things this is a

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.650 
making your baking things this is a
little<00:06:16.620> bit<00:06:16.740> closer<00:06:16.979> area<00:06:17.490> for<00:06:17.760> me<00:06:17.880> so<00:06:18.150> that's

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
little bit closer area for me so that's

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.240 
little bit closer area for me so that's
why<00:06:18.900> I<00:06:18.930> store<00:06:19.320> them<00:06:19.500> in<00:06:19.740> there

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
why I store them in there

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.159 
why I store them in there
and<00:06:20.340> then<00:06:21.090> I<00:06:21.690> am<00:06:22.500> going<00:06:22.770> to<00:06:23.040> go<00:06:23.940> ahead<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:24.479> cut

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
and then I am going to go ahead and cut
