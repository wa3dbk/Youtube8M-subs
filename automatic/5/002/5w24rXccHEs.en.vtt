a<00:00:26.550> Chapman<00:00:27.090> base<00:00:27.510> project<00:00:28.410> which<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.920> am<00:00:29.070> really

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
a Chapman base project which I am really

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.999 
a Chapman base project which I am really
excited<00:00:29.910> about<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> once<00:00:31.380> again<00:00:31.590> we're

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
excited about and once again we're

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
excited about and once again we're
approaching<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.610> design<00:00:33.000> process<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.870> little

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
approaching the design process a little

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.410 
approaching the design process a little
differently<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.309> fact<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.239> may<00:00:36.390> have

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
differently in fact I think it may have

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
differently in fact I think it may have
confused<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.500> few<00:00:37.710> people<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.280> I've<00:00:38.370> made<00:00:38.550> this

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
confused a few people so I've made this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.400 
confused a few people so I've made this
quick<00:00:39.000> video<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.719> clarify<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
quick video just to clarify the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.040 
quick video just to clarify the
situation<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.450> explain<00:00:42.450> why<00:00:42.840> I've<00:00:43.020> chosen

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
situation and explain why I've chosen

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.709 
situation and explain why I've chosen
this<00:00:43.590> approach<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.340> guess<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> first<00:00:45.300> thing<00:00:45.480> is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
this approach I guess the first thing is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.440 
this approach I guess the first thing is
I'm<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> paste<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.370> mean<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:48.000> slap<00:00:48.270> out

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
I'm not a paste I mean I can slap out

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
I'm not a paste I mean I can slap out
some<00:00:48.719> low-end<00:00:48.870> love<00:00:49.340> you<00:00:50.340> know<00:00:50.460> tickle<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> few

some low-end love you know tickle a few

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.689 
some low-end love you know tickle a few
reps<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.690> Billy<00:00:52.140> Sheehan<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.489> my

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
reps but not Billy Sheehan so in my

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.490 
reps but not Billy Sheehan so in my
infinite<00:00:54.180> wisdom<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.750> decided<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.350> put

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
infinite wisdom I decided to put
