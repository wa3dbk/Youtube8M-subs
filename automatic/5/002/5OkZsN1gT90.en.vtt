00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.610
 So two days of the reconstruction phase we start 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.610
 are just about to sound the discs 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.730
 maybe problematic because of it 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.289
 damn high so a 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.300
 trecker has construction height 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.710
 that is new for the guys everything works out 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.510
 well written so far so far 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.840
 We're in the dark because it looks cool 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.840
 the thing 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.280
 I've promised me that we the 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.049
 direct intake directly out 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.179
 from the trek and the fresh rhythm 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.789
 pure we must stop I tell you 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.560
 that's why we have four inches up here 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.149
 placed and straight out of the trecker 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.220
 normal he sucks over here above 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.890
 on huge air filtering system, the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.659
 we do not need it, we need it 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.759
 we do this thing once on it for 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:36.009
 say and that's pretty chic too 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:42.369
 or believe me then everyone dreams 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.880
 Treckerfahrer front fits wiggles and 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:54.789
 has air 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:56.200
 on we go as you can see you need 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.060
 a little bit bigger tool and 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.259
 motionless must also 600 newton meters 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.909
 tighten per screw 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.380
 we did something like that and we show you 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.209
 that makes me pretty funny and 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.099
 exciting 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.630
 we have almost the whole axis 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.920
 doubled with such a pot of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.530
 we let the front laser 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:19.299
 the front ball bearings because they are the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:21.940
 very very corpse turns and then have 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.109
 we send here dishes that come too 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.519
 the rim on it one must also show 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:28.930
 what you have a real 400 ps roads 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.340
 Only then do people know what 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 Come on, say something about the brook 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.060
 namely as follows through the ball bearing 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.800
 the stock is basically spinning with us 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.489
 down weights mounted so that 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:53.220
 This disc always remains horizontal 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:54.600
 I think that's pretty cool, I'm yes 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.370
 usually cofely 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.709
 widening to screw in the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.720
 Fall here in the curves widening 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.769
 unscrewed 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.560
 why do we say that with you ? 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.300
 see more of the monza moderate tires 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.280
 but no q5 at all 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.080
 drive but we drove 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.910
 they found here they are 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.430
 a bit narrower and show that 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.430
 potential of the beast is 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.710
 that usually looks very clear and clear 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.330
 is this much now I walk to 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.910
 so see if that's the car 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.980
 would be a dream but not only 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.980
 See a trek that too 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.690
 Turns you around What is always more monster 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.690
 I told myself it has to be fed
