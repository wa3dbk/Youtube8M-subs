00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
small fish trap with it and we're going

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.110 
small fish trap with it and we're going
to<00:01:11.650> accomplish<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.460> by<00:01:13.270> cutting<00:01:13.720> this

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
to accomplish that by cutting this

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.910 
to accomplish that by cutting this
section<00:01:16.120> right<00:01:16.360> here<00:01:16.420> off<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.140> bottle<00:01:17.560> about

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
section right here off the bottle about

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.990 
section right here off the bottle about
four<00:01:18.280> inches<00:01:18.670> from<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.420> cap<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.490> once<00:01:21.490> we<00:01:21.729> get

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
four inches from the cap and once we get

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.540 
four inches from the cap and once we get
that<00:01:22.270> piece<00:01:22.720> cut<00:01:23.350> off<00:01:23.560> we're<00:01:23.890> going<00:01:24.010> to<00:01:24.130> invert

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
that piece cut off we're going to invert

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.360 
that piece cut off we're going to invert
it<00:01:24.750> into<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.870> main<00:01:26.050> body<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.740> therefore

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
it into the main body and therefore

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.310 
it into the main body and therefore
we're<00:01:28.000> going<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.210> create<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.479> funnel<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.290> that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
we're going to create a funnel so that

00:01:29.320 --> 00:02:00.780 
we're going to create a funnel so that
the<00:01:29.560> fish<00:01:29.830> can<00:01:30.040> come<00:01:30.310> in

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.580 

I'm<00:02:01.790> carefully<00:02:02.330> using<00:02:02.510> my<00:02:02.750> multi-tool<00:02:03.140> to

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
I'm carefully using my multi-tool to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.830 
I'm carefully using my multi-tool to
punch<00:02:03.860> holes<00:02:04.100> at<00:02:04.640> about<00:02:04.940> 1<00:02:05.210> inch<00:02:05.450> intervals

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
punch holes at about 1 inch intervals

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.380 
punch holes at about 1 inch intervals
through<00:02:06.740> both<00:02:06.950> pieces<00:02:07.370> of<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.760> bottle<00:02:10.390> now

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
through both pieces of the bottle now

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.020 
through both pieces of the bottle now
you<00:02:12.140> will<00:02:12.320> need<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.530> securely<00:02:13.130> join<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.850> two

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
you will need to securely join the two

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.840 
you will need to securely join the two
parts<00:02:14.360> together<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.959> do<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.860> using<00:02:16.160> paracord

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
parts together I do this using paracord

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:25.690 
parts together I do this using paracord
but<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.510> can<00:02:17.660> also<00:02:17.810> use<00:02:18.080> jungle<00:02:18.530> vines

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.880 

now<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.540> our<00:02:26.629> trap<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.110> finish<00:02:27.440> I'm<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:27.830> to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
now that our trap is finish I'm going to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.089 
now that our trap is finish I'm going to
set<00:02:28.129> it<00:02:28.160> right<00:02:28.280> here<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.030> pool<00:02:29.349> I<00:02:30.349> can<00:02:30.920> see

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
set it right here at this pool I can see

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.320 
set it right here at this pool I can see
that<00:02:31.220> there's<00:02:31.370> plenty<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.730> fish<00:02:32.000> over<00:02:32.269> there

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
that there's plenty of fish over there

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.470 
that there's plenty of fish over there
now<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.260> idea<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.550> finish<00:02:34.879> may<00:02:35.090> swim

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
now the idea is that the finish may swim

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.199 
now the idea is that the finish may swim
in<00:02:35.840> through<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.379> funnel<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.610> fish<00:02:37.879> won't

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
in through the funnel and the fish won't

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.470 
in through the funnel and the fish won't
be<00:02:38.360> able<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.690> get<00:02:38.840> out<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.980> trap<00:02:40.879> obviously

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
be able to get out this trap obviously

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.570 
be able to get out this trap obviously
is<00:02:41.599> more<00:02:41.810> effective<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.620> use<00:02:42.800> some<00:02:43.010> bait<00:02:43.220> I

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
is more effective if you use some bait I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.780 
is more effective if you use some bait I
have<00:02:44.300> some<00:02:45.019> pieces<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.470> bits<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:46.099> beef<00:02:46.340> here

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
have some pieces of bits of beef here

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.210 
have some pieces of bits of beef here
and<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.540> also<00:02:47.720> have<00:02:47.930> some<00:02:48.170> air<00:02:48.530> forms<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
and I also have some air forms that I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.140 
and I also have some air forms that I
dog<00:02:49.430> out<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:51.190> I'm<00:02:52.190> going<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.400> put<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.640> trap

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
dog out so I'm going to put this trap

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.270 
dog out so I'm going to put this trap
right<00:02:53.450> over<00:02:53.720> there<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.349> I'm<00:02:54.500> secured<00:02:55.129> in

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
right over there and I'm secured in

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280 
right over there and I'm secured in
securing<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.120> trap<00:02:56.390> with<00:02:56.569> some<00:02:56.720> paracord

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
securing this trap with some paracord

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.800 
securing this trap with some paracord
and<00:02:57.530> sticks<00:02:58.190> like<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.549> stick<00:02:58.819> it<00:02:58.940> on<00:02:59.060> day<00:02:59.239> on

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
and sticks like you stick it on day on

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.530 
and sticks like you stick it on day on
the<00:03:00.170> ground<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.799> stone<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.640> also<00:03:02.000> useful<00:03:02.209> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
the ground a stone is also useful to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.140 
the ground a stone is also useful to
setting<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:03.530> trap<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.610> we're<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:04.819> going<00:03:05.090> to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
setting this trap so we're just going to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.610 
setting this trap so we're just going to
go<00:03:05.329> ahead<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.630> send<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.170> we'll<00:03:06.230> check<00:03:06.500> it

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
go ahead and send it and we'll check it

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:15.880 
go ahead and send it and we'll check it
out<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.920> mornings<00:03:07.310> here<00:03:07.489> we<00:03:07.610> got<00:03:07.819> it<00:03:14.890> after

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
out in the mornings here we got it after

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.979 
out in the mornings here we got it after
setting<00:03:16.190> my<00:03:16.280> trap<00:03:16.610> I<00:03:16.849> decided<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.690> scout

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
setting my trap I decided to scout

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.740
