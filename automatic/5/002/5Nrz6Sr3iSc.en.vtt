something<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.329> never<00:00:42.390> planned<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
something I never planned to do and I I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.840 
something I never planned to do and I I
not<00:00:44.820> only<00:00:45.079> became<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:47.309> not<00:00:47.489> only<00:00:47.640> an

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
not only became I was not only an

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.610 
not only became I was not only an
employee<00:00:48.210> than<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> Anderson<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.260> became

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
employee than the Anderson but I became

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.130 
employee than the Anderson but I became
a<00:00:49.680> patient<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.090> realized<00:00:54.570> very

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
a patient here and so it I realized very

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.290 
a patient here and so it I realized very
quickly<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.770> things<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.670> different<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
quickly that things are different on the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
quickly that things are different on the
other<00:00:57.480> side<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.070> must<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> cool

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
other side I think that must be a cool

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.319 
other side I think that must be a cool
feeling<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.500> there<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.090> draw<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> line

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
feeling to get up there and draw a line

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.140 
feeling to get up there and draw a line
through<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.719> disease<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:05.010> I'm<00:01:05.489> just

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
through your disease but I'm just

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.460 
through your disease but I'm just
exactly<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.740> year<00:01:08.280> out<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.479> don't<00:01:10.049> think

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
exactly on a year out and I don't think

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.940 
exactly on a year out and I don't think
I<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.830> cross<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.189> red<00:01:11.670> line<00:01:11.880> yet<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.229> still

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
I can cross that red line yet I still

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
I can cross that red line yet I still
take<00:01:14.939> medication<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.810> still<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> doctor<00:01:16.950> i
