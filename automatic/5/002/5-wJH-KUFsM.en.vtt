cylinders five six seven eight that

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.299 
cylinders five six seven eight that
cylinder<00:00:43.020> number<00:00:43.320> four<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.070> misfiring

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
cylinder number four which is misfiring

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.369 
cylinder number four which is misfiring
actually<00:00:44.940> comes<00:00:45.180> across<00:00:45.480> over<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
actually comes across over here and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.100 
actually comes across over here and
aspired<00:00:47.100> off<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.670> coil<00:00:48.110> they're

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
aspired off of this coil they're

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.049 
aspired off of this coil they're
numbered<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> should<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.520> able<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.760> find

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
numbered so you should be able to find

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119 
numbered so you should be able to find
them<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.420> they're<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:51.989> numbered<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.590> find

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
them if they're not numbered just find

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
them if they're not numbered just find
the<00:00:53.250> number<00:00:53.550> four<00:00:53.820> cylinder<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.480> follow<00:00:54.690> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the number four cylinder and follow it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.319 
the number four cylinder and follow it
back<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.469> coil<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.699> number<00:00:56.969> four<00:00:57.210> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
back to the right coil so number four is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.580 
back to the right coil so number four is
right<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.260> we're<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
right here that's the one we're going to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
right here that's the one we're going to
test<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.820> we're<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> check<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
test so we're going to check for this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
test so we're going to check for this
coil<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.530> we're<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> take<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> small

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
coil is we're going to take a small

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it over the end and then stick it down

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:25.300 
it over the end and then stick it down
inside<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:17.119> now<00:01:18.119> we'll<00:01:18.330> start<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> engine

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.960 

take<00:01:25.909> a<00:01:25.940> test<00:01:26.330> flight<00:01:27.040> Brown<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.310> flip<00:01:28.580> end<00:01:28.790> of

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
take a test flight Brown the flip end of

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.179 
take a test flight Brown the flip end of
it

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.420 

back<00:01:31.729> in<00:01:31.969> sulfur

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.070 

now<00:01:39.430> was<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.820> good<00:01:40.060> or<00:01:40.210> was<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.479> bad

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
now was that good or was that bad

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.050 
now was that good or was that bad
there's<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.650> good<00:01:41.830> way<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.040> test<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.460> we'll

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
there's a good way to test that we'll

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.280 
there's a good way to test that we'll
just<00:01:43.270> take<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.600> off<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:44.020> here<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.170> put

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
just take this off of here and put

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.770 
just take this off of here and put
number<00:01:44.619> four<00:01:44.830> back<00:01:45.009> on<00:01:45.280> there<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.670> we'll<00:01:46.659> go

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
number four back on there and we'll go

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.109 
number four back on there and we'll go
to<00:01:46.840> another<00:01:47.080> one<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:48.210> we'll<00:01:49.210> put<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:51.119> number

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
to another one and we'll put the number

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.749 
to another one and we'll put the number
eight<00:01:52.270> we'll<00:01:53.080> put<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.409> vacuum<00:01:54.190> hose<00:01:54.369> on<00:01:54.580> there

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
eight we'll put the vacuum hose on there

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.200 
eight we'll put the vacuum hose on there
and<00:01:54.880> stick<00:01:55.119> that<00:01:55.270> down<00:01:55.330> there<00:01:56.970> now<00:01:57.970> we'll

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
and stick that down there now we'll

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:08.230 
and stick that down there now we'll
start<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.630> one

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.470 

take<00:02:08.510> the<00:02:08.630> same<00:02:08.840> test<00:02:09.140> line<00:02:09.380> arrangement

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.540 

as<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:16.800> there's<00:02:17.010> quite<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> bit<00:02:17.520> of

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
as you can see there's quite a bit of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.850 
as you can see there's quite a bit of
difference<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.450> now<00:02:19.319> we've<00:02:19.530> got<00:02:19.680> some

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
difference there so now we've got some

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.800 
difference there so now we've got some
evidence<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.640> number<00:02:20.910> four<00:02:21.180> coil<00:02:21.540> is

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
evidence that the number four coil is

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.570 
evidence that the number four coil is
not<00:02:22.019> firing<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:26.040> we're<00:02:26.190> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.370> need<00:02:26.550> a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
not firing so we're going to need a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:37.080 
not firing so we're going to need a
number<00:02:27.060> four<00:02:27.360> coil

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.150 

you
