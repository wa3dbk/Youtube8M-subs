00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Before starting this video, I would like to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.649
 recommend a very cool texture 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.099
 it goes on minecraft version 010 4 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.719
 alpha 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.980
 on the block launcher version 181 pro 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.529
 surely the texture is very cool 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 link to it will be in the descriptions of bugs she 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.470

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.570
 little finger today we will continue 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.380

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 name bridge 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:09.150
 This feature allows you to do this. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:16.430

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.070

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.750
 and let's write that is every hour 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:05.780
 will appear something we will write 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:08.900
 message let's say hi mitt 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.900

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:17.580

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.410
 only this second all 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.910

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.130
 functions 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:47.390
