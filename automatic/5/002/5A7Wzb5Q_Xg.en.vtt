00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
everything and it's pretty close to what

everything and it's pretty close to what
the<00:00:27.810> advertiser<00:00:28.310> only<00:00:29.310> difference<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the advertiser only difference is it's a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.049 
the advertiser only difference is it's a
lot<00:00:30.300> smaller<00:00:30.630> than<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.669> 2424<00:00:32.669> scale

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
lot smaller than what I want 2424 scale

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.830 
lot smaller than what I want 2424 scale
would<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:35.059> but<00:00:36.059> nonetheless<00:00:36.420> is

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
would actually be but nonetheless is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.479

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
the monster truck that I built for him

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.650 
the monster truck that I built for him
what<00:00:57.809> big<00:00:58.620> cordless<00:00:59.550> montt<00:00:59.850> motor<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.420> there

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
what big cordless montt motor in there

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.550 
what big cordless montt motor in there
and<00:01:02.899> crazy<00:01:04.010> tires<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.689> link<00:01:06.689> suspension<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and crazy tires and link suspension and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.600 
and crazy tires and link suspension and
all<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.830> stuff<00:01:09.560> when<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> built<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.189> there

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
all that stuff when I built this there

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.359 
all that stuff when I built this there
really<00:01:11.790> wasn't<00:01:12.060> anything<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:12.780> there<00:01:13.310> out<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
really wasn't anything out there out of

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.969 
really wasn't anything out there out of
the<00:01:14.520> box<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.689> could<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.860> do

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the box that could do what this will do

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.770 
the box that could do what this will do
you<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.430> being<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> monster<00:01:18.180> truck<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.570> half

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you know being a monster truck and half

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.340 
you know being a monster truck and half
you<00:01:19.439> know<00:01:19.560> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.420> scaly<00:01:21.420> looking

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you know kind of scaly looking

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.100 
you know kind of scaly looking
suspension<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> thought

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
suspension and all that so I thought

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.950 
suspension and all that so I thought
this<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.560> cool<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.979> built<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.369> but

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
this was really cool when I built it but

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.679 
this was really cool when I built it but
now<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.500> other<00:01:28.770> guy<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> could

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
now we have this other guy so you could

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
now we have this other guy so you could
tell<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.189> small<00:01:33.710> even<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:35.189> is

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
tell it's really small even this one is

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.850 
tell it's really small even this one is
kind<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.479> small<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.350> actually<00:01:37.500> be

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
kind of small for it to actually be

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.490 
kind of small for it to actually be
considered<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.460> 1:24<00:01:39.240> scale<00:01:39.270> boy<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.170> lot

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
considered a 1:24 scale boy it's a lot

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.569 
considered a 1:24 scale boy it's a lot
closer<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.270> what<00:01:42.270> 124th<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.579> this

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
closer to what 124th really is this

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.929 
closer to what 124th really is this
looks<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.720> smaller<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.350> me<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.790> not

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
looks way smaller to me but that's not

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.499 
looks way smaller to me but that's not
the<00:01:48.180> problem<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> problem

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
the problem it's not really a problem

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.920 
the problem it's not really a problem
the<00:01:51.509> cool<00:01:51.720> thing<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
the cool thing actually about this

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.899 
the cool thing actually about this
different<00:01:54.930> from<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
different from what we have here is and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.609 
different from what we have here is and
this<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:57.360> instead<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.049> seeing<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
this one instead of a little seeing a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.990 
this one instead of a little seeing a
lossy<00:01:59.430> transmission<00:02:00.860> which<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.890> well<00:02:02.399> micro

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
lossy transmission which is well micro

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.749 
lossy transmission which is well micro
crawler<00:02:03.240> guy<00:02:03.479> did<00:02:03.780> um<00:02:03.990> which<00:02:04.829> was<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> smart

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
crawler guy did um which was a smart

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.589 
crawler guy did um which was a smart
idea<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:07.049> transmission<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.710> much<00:02:08.039> better

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
idea that transmission is much better

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.069 
idea that transmission is much better
taking<00:02:08.929> high<00:02:09.049> speed<00:02:09.439> and<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.780> decimal

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
taking high speed and the decimal

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.080 
taking high speed and the decimal
transmission<00:02:12.799> and<00:02:13.549> transfer<00:02:14.299> case<00:02:14.659> but

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
transmission and transfer case but

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.690 
transmission and transfer case but
anyway<00:02:17.090> instead<00:02:17.389> of<00:02:17.629> using<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.459> these<00:02:19.459> guys

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
anyway instead of using that these guys

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.679 
anyway instead of using that these guys
opted<00:02:20.359> to<00:02:20.389> making<00:02:20.780> their<00:02:20.930> own<00:02:20.989> transmission

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
opted to making their own transmission

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.800 
opted to making their own transmission
which<00:02:23.689> is<00:02:23.959> really<00:02:24.769> tiny<00:02:25.510> considering<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.659> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
which is really tiny considering that it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.759 
which is really tiny considering that it
has<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> 130<00:02:27.769> size<00:02:28.129> motor<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:29.260> yes<00:02:30.260> that

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
has a 130 size motor in it yes that

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.119 
has a 130 size motor in it yes that
right<00:02:31.159> there<00:02:31.430> that's<00:02:31.969> a<00:02:32.180> 130<00:02:32.629> size<00:02:33.129> canned

motor this powering this tiny little
thing<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.980> use<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> motor<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.329> size<00:02:42.549> with

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
thing you can use a motor this size with

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.750 
thing you can use a motor this size with
the<00:02:43.730> low<00:02:43.879> lossy<00:02:44.480> transmission<00:02:44.829> for<00:02:45.829> that<00:02:46.549> if

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
the low lossy transmission for that if

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.869 
the low lossy transmission for that if
you<00:02:46.879> decide<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.269> do<00:02:47.419> that<00:02:48.519> there's<00:02:49.519> some<00:02:49.669> guys

which<00:03:02.150> made<00:03:02.389> for<00:03:02.599> an<00:03:02.689> extremely<00:03:03.469> powerful

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
which made for an extremely powerful

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.629 
which made for an extremely powerful

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
motor a lot of torque took away some of

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.110 
motor a lot of torque took away some of
the<00:03:07.760> speed<00:03:08.000> but<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.299> had<00:03:08.419> a<00:03:08.449> lot<00:03:08.659> of<00:03:08.719> torque<00:03:10.120> now

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the speed but it had a lot of torque now

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.789 
the speed but it had a lot of torque now
I<00:03:11.150> think<00:03:11.329> he's<00:03:11.659> only<00:03:11.840> selling<00:03:12.169> the<00:03:12.260> 180<00:03:12.620> which

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
I think he's only selling the 180 which

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.740 
I think he's only selling the 180 which
is<00:03:12.979> longer<00:03:13.280> than<00:03:13.549> this<00:03:13.669> one<00:03:13.729> but<00:03:14.449> same

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
is longer than this one but same

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.960 
is longer than this one but same
diameter<00:03:14.989> which<00:03:15.439> is<00:03:15.470> ridiculous<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.430> think<00:03:16.699> for

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
diameter which is ridiculous I think for

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.619 
diameter which is ridiculous I think for
micro<00:03:17.449> crawler<00:03:17.720> does<00:03:17.959> just<00:03:18.349> the<00:03:18.530> Beast

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
micro crawler does just the Beast

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.479 
micro crawler does just the Beast
anyways<00:03:20.629> this<00:03:21.500> comes<00:03:21.799> out<00:03:21.949> of<00:03:22.009> the<00:03:22.099> box<00:03:22.280> with

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
anyways this comes out of the box with

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.939 
anyways this comes out of the box with
that<00:03:22.609> motor<00:03:22.819> which<00:03:23.659> I<00:03:23.810> wish<00:03:24.019> is<00:03:24.199> water<00:03:24.439> would

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
that motor which I wish is water would

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.360 
that motor which I wish is water would
have<00:03:25.009> put<00:03:25.220> on<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.879> one<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:26.989> built<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:28.310> I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
have put on the one that I built that I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.830 
have put on the one that I built that I
had<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:28.819> option<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.150> used<00:03:29.419> a<00:03:29.509> lossy

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
had the option to used a lossy

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.629 
had the option to used a lossy
transmission<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.709> mean<00:03:31.069> I<00:03:31.159> had<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.489> but<00:03:31.609> I

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
transmission I mean I had it but I

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.520 
transmission I mean I had it but I
didn't<00:03:31.909> wanna<00:03:32.919> just<00:03:33.919> comes<00:03:34.129> factory<00:03:34.519> now

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
didn't wanna just comes factory now

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.649 
didn't wanna just comes factory now
comes<00:03:36.530> was<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.859> was<00:03:37.099> its<00:03:37.280> own<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:37.909> know<00:03:38.030> three

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
comes was it was its own you know three

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:44.080 
comes was it was its own you know three
volt<00:03:38.840> battery<00:03:39.229> in<00:03:39.379> there<00:03:41.229> 3.7<00:03:42.229> actually<00:03:43.090> hmm

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
volt battery in there 3.7 actually hmm

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.009 
volt battery in there 3.7 actually hmm
and<00:03:44.359> I<00:03:44.720> think<00:03:45.139> it's<00:03:46.359> 600<00:03:47.359> million<00:03:47.750> power

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
and I think it's 600 million power

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.179 
and I think it's 600 million power
battery<00:03:49.750> which<00:03:50.750> that's<00:03:51.019> a<00:03:51.229> long<00:03:51.469> time<00:03:51.919> on<00:03:52.099> this

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
battery which that's a long time on this

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.499 
battery which that's a long time on this
little<00:03:52.489> motor<00:03:53.439> transmission<00:03:55.329> kind<00:03:56.329> of

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:56.509 
little motor transmission kind of

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.420 
little motor transmission kind of
resembles<00:03:57.139> a<00:03:57.439> little<00:03:57.859> bit<00:03:58.009> the<00:03:58.129> low<00:03:58.250> C

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
resembles a little bit the low C

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.110 
resembles a little bit the low C
transmission<00:03:59.090> but<00:03:59.889> you<00:04:00.889> know<00:04:01.009> it's<00:04:01.400> already

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
transmission but you know it's already

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.330 
transmission but you know it's already
built<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.709> house<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.669> big<00:04:04.849> motor<00:04:05.090> in<00:04:05.269> there

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
built to house that big motor in there

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.289 
built to house that big motor in there
so<00:04:07.719> as<00:04:08.719> far<00:04:08.930> as<00:04:08.989> size<00:04:09.289> goes<00:04:09.319> is<00:04:09.939> how<00:04:10.939> it<00:04:11.150> is

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
so as far as size goes is how it is

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.920 
so as far as size goes is how it is
biggest<00:04:11.659> in<00:04:11.959> lossy<00:04:12.289> transmission<00:04:13.599> but<00:04:14.599> the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
biggest in lossy transmission but the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.689 
biggest in lossy transmission but the
only<00:04:15.139> difference<00:04:15.349> being<00:04:15.799> that<00:04:15.979> it<00:04:16.310> has<00:04:16.459> these

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
only difference being that it has these

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.310 
only difference being that it has these
metal

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.150 

when<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> saw<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:20.610> on<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.170> on<00:04:22.170> the<00:04:22.530> ad<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.740> thought

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
when I saw it on the on the ad I thought

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.010 
when I saw it on the on the ad I thought
well<00:04:23.340> that's<00:04:23.550> awesome<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:24.330> won't<00:04:24.540> be<00:04:24.660> breaking

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
well that's awesome it won't be breaking

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.100 
well that's awesome it won't be breaking
any<00:04:25.110> more<00:04:25.320> dresses<00:04:26.000> but<00:04:27.000> there<00:04:27.420> is<00:04:27.540> a<00:04:27.570> problem

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
any more dresses but there is a problem

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.240 
any more dresses but there is a problem
because<00:04:29.010> these<00:04:29.610> are<00:04:30.470> these<00:04:31.470> are<00:04:31.680> metal<00:04:32.040> and

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
because these are these are metal and

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.870 
because these are these are metal and
the<00:04:32.700> end<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:33.720> dog<00:04:34.230> bone<00:04:34.530> style<00:04:34.920> they

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
the end of it is dog bone style they

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.180 
the end of it is dog bone style they
can't<00:04:36.420> really<00:04:36.720> be<00:04:36.840> extended<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.950> know<00:04:38.040> they

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
can't really be extended you know they

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.010 
can't really be extended you know they
don't<00:04:38.310> have<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.700> uh<00:04:40.370> telescoping<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.820> know

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
don't have that uh telescoping you know

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.940 
don't have that uh telescoping you know
thing<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.260> will<00:04:43.410> get<00:04:43.560> with<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.800> other

motor with no problem so that's kind of
cool<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:23.450> suspension<00:05:24.450> is<00:05:24.540> kind<00:05:24.750> of<00:05:24.780> sucky<00:05:25.170> but

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
cool and suspension is kind of sucky but
