00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
twists to the ingredients but really to

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.389

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.679 

high-quality<00:01:21.399> food<00:01:21.790> needs<00:01:22.149> very<00:01:22.360> little<00:01:22.390> done

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
high-quality food needs very little done

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.149 
high-quality food needs very little done
to<00:01:22.899> it<00:01:23.049> as<00:01:23.350> long<00:01:23.500> as<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.680> don't<00:01:23.829> get<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.039> its

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
to it as long as you don't get in its

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.249 
to it as long as you don't get in its
way<00:01:24.219> oftentimes<00:01:24.939> it<00:01:25.149> performs<00:01:25.539> great<00:01:25.719> and<00:01:26.020> I

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
way oftentimes it performs great and I

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.510 
way oftentimes it performs great and I
think<00:01:26.289> a<00:01:26.530> lot<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.680> home<00:01:27.100> cooks<00:01:27.340> don't

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
think a lot of home cooks don't

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.920 
think a lot of home cooks don't
necessarily<00:01:28.000> know<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.270> they<00:01:28.479> want<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.720> over

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
necessarily know that they want to over

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.200 
necessarily know that they want to over
complicate<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.880> hopefully<00:01:30.880> we<00:01:30.970> show<00:01:31.090> them

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
complicate it hopefully we show them

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.719 
complicate it hopefully we show them
today<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.600> is<00:01:31.810> not<00:01:31.840> necessary<00:01:32.729> on

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
today that that is not necessary on

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.370
