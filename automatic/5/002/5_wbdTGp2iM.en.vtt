00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.279
 Hello everyone I'm very happy 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.259
 today to offer you this video 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.230
 presentation of my dan framework kit 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.449
 choi fm 0.98 i ordered this frame in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.520
 finish had black matte single version 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.259
 stock for me version a baby 30 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.529
 for the bottom bracket so I had to 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.230
 as shimano 105 g11 crankset 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.760
 show a bsa adapter on it which 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.530
 weighs a little bit on the bike but 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.000
 it does not really pose a problem there 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 found of course the cable is there 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.379
 integrated compatible two mechanical 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.309
 in my case I'm in mechanics with 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.309
 and squirting camjac 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.870
 on the balance side the frame more 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.500
 adapter plus his salt rage and weigh 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.230
 at 1231 g the fork cut me off 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.119
 found at a weight of 3,193 g and 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.500
 side of salt attic it weighed 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.610
 at 220 g 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.370
 despite a 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.560
 pretty light my bike is not either 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.370
 the lightest that exists there is 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.480
 currently weighed at 7.8 kg then 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.660
 afterwards you have to know that the wheels are 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.250
 really heavy and that it is far 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.860
 to be optimized I did not buy at all 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.410
 lightweight devices for the bike 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.000
 either of absolute lightness so 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.540
 currently I have a shimano group 105 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.390
 with brakes is doing that I have a 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.960
 chinese hanger so generic a saddle 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.979
 generic 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.540
 I have the levers 105 which weighs down a 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.930
 little the bike to the advanced I have a 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.020
 extension s ram for the counter and 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.420
 is that a camera support to 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.190
 the future I think reduce a little the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.190
 weight of this bike to reach 7 kilos 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.330
 it will go through a wheel change 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.600
 and two pedals but we'll see that 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.479
 in our next video 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.700
 this video is exclusively made for 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.480
 show you the bike design I 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.459
 will do a video again to tell you about 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.590
 my feeling on it because for the moment 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.019
 I only made two exits with so 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.850
 I can not really tell you what 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.650
 I feel on it even though I already have my 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.080
 small opinion if you have questions 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.690
 on how I managed to get this bike 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.500
 him the way it happened where 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.160
 I was going to buy 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.260
 at what price et cetera do not hesitate to me 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.959
 ask questions in comments or 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.160
 in mp I will gladly answer a 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.660
 little blue thumb if you liked 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.580
 this video would really make me 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.459
 pleasure and we find ourselves very quickly to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.120
 a new video on this bike 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.120
 see you soon
