00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.770
 we are very well with the captain 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.960
 scorer important figure of this 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.490
 fight match the dreamed debut 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.190
 ideal also win against South Africa 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.349
 if the truth that I had not 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.360
 imagined a result like this so 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.370
 we are very happy 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.930
 anxiety in the game prior to 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.270
 play it was we were all very 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.620
 nervous but but good is logical 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.440
 we are playing 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.270
 olympic and the nerves are going to be but 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.250
 good if we had a very objective 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.290
 important that it was to stay calm and 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.570
 the tranquility if the goals did not arrive 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.340
 and I think it was the key to the team in the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.860
 first stage easy not our first 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.870
 minutes many situations of shorts 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.129
 for you that maybe the surprised 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.360
 He also gave them freedom to 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.250
 a little too loose and 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.660
 we go in a little nervous and 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.280
 we knew that the first ball was not going 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.930
 to bounce or we were not going to stop 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.760
 South Africa was also nervous and I 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.040
 I think that's why we also had so many 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.050
 arrivals to the area but good we had two 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.110
 horns came in and luckily we 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.850
 we hope and we continue to maintain 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.530
 control of the game until the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.750
 goals and well they were entering the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.580
 goals so it's a pleasure the key 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.500
 is going to be that not every match of this 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.420
 area not to be trusted beyond 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.130
 tougher rivals seem to be in 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.660
 the other group already raffled some 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.210
 friendly they met us but that's the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.430
 key not to be concentrated if any 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.460
 you have to trust yourself because they are teams that 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.070
 they do not have 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.560
 maybe they do not have the responsibility that 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.830
 we have ourselves on the court 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.480
 then they are making attack by 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.300
 attack without caring what you can 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.130
 get to happen and that complicates you look 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.650
 that maybe the counterattacks they had 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.700
 they made a goal for us and then they entered 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.440
 sometimes then we are going to send you 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.810
 to the people 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.810
 I want to encourage the truth some geniuses 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.500
 or the fight wanted only to sustain a 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.690
 delay - listen half afternoon 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.140
 I just want to tell you 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.880
 He made us very happy to see you enter 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.590
 the stadium with the flag and that the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.640
 You truly deserve it and thank you for 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.170
 the party and we enjoyed it 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.170
 very much little piece here in the transmission 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.510
 good if you are the one who enjoyed it 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.180
 because you saw us born so we're 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.560
 really very happy 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.580
 and the truth that a result 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.500
 unimaginable but good 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.520
 in mind those types of results is a 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.560
 Olympic game any of the team 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.030
 You can be very nervous by luck 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.010
 We maintained the tranquility of calm 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.170
 to play that is important and 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.870
 then it opened and they went 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.090
 entering the hours so happy fight 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.740
 they're calling you have to go tenÃ©s 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.270
 to go to rest I send you a kiss 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.770
 We love you very much and we hope 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.770
 see you tomorrow morning to shine again 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:02.340
 to the fight people printers of 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.810
 people who also stop for more with 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.069
 low when you want you can come to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.250
 work instead of being there with the 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.250
 pibes
