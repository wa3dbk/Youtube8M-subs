obstacles<00:01:31.649> for<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> darkness<00:01:32.729> before<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
obstacles for the darkness before it

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.300 
obstacles for the darkness before it
gets<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.719> you<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> doors<00:01:34.679> are<00:01:34.950> shutting

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you're trying to go in them and it kind

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.260 
you're trying to go in them and it kind
of<00:01:37.320> leads<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.770> through<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.130> path<00:01:38.429> so<00:01:39.000> all

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
of leads you through this path so all

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.359 
of leads you through this path so all
while<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.509> darkness<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> chasing<00:01:40.649> you<00:01:40.799> your

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
vision is kind of blurry you can't see

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.630 
vision is kind of blurry you can't see
straight<00:01:43.320> there's<00:01:43.619> loud<00:01:43.829> noises<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.429> on

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
straight there's loud noises going on

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
straight there's loud noises going on
it's<00:01:44.939> crazy<00:01:45.359> and<00:01:45.630> eventually<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.409> make<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it's crazy and eventually you make it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
it's crazy and eventually you make it
outside<00:01:47.130> where<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.179> course<00:01:48.359> there<00:01:48.600> are<00:01:48.689> people

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
outside where of course there are people

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.749 
outside where of course there are people
waiting<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.350> kill<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.679> that<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.399> pretty<00:01:50.579> much

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
waiting to kill you that was pretty much

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.669 
waiting to kill you that was pretty much
the<00:01:50.820> end<00:01:50.969> of<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.270> demo<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.020> said<00:01:52.079> still<00:01:52.590> in

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
the end of the demo like I said still in

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.560 
the end of the demo like I said still in
alpha<00:01:52.829> phase<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:53.579> don't<00:01:53.729> guarantee<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
alpha phase so they don't guarantee that
