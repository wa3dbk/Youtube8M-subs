which is how you're supposed to start
out<00:00:10.200> using<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.769> your<00:00:10.920> skin<00:00:11.070> can<00:00:11.309> get

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
out using it so your skin can get

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.950 
out using it so your skin can get
adjusted<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.210> instead<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.630> using<00:00:12.900> it

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960

are a few little red patches around here
but<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.119> was<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.290> doing<00:01:10.799> some

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
but that was because I was doing some

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.609 
but that was because I was doing some
blackhead<00:01:11.490> extractions<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.689> didn't<00:01:13.350> prep<00:01:13.500> my

blackhead extractions and didn't prep my
skin<00:01:13.650> properly<00:01:14.189> beforehand<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.299> my

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
skin properly beforehand so that was my

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
skin properly beforehand so that was my
bad<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.990> overall<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.650> forehead<00:01:17.009> isn't<00:01:17.189> really

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
again this was a lot of leftover

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200 
again this was a lot of leftover
hyperpigmentation<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:29.280> other<00:01:29.820> breakouts

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
hyperpigmentation from other breakouts

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.060 
hyperpigmentation from other breakouts
that<00:01:30.329> I've<00:01:30.450> had<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.890> that's

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
underneath my chin that's a really

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.850 
underneath my chin that's a really

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
the positive points that I've noticed

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.330 
the positive points that I've noticed
after<00:02:41.750> using<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.260> on<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.829> days<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.280> do

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
after using this on the days that I do

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.610 
after using this on the days that I do
use<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.819> my<00:02:43.940> skin<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.360> incredibly<00:02:45.049> soft<00:02:45.349> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
use it my skin is incredibly soft and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.229 
use it my skin is incredibly soft and
that<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.129> because<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.610> little<00:02:46.790> bristles<00:02:46.940> here

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
that is because the little bristles here

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.000 
that is because the little bristles here
provide<00:02:47.599> some<00:02:47.780> extra<00:02:48.140> exfoliation<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:48.890> my

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
provide some extra exfoliation to my

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.369 
provide some extra exfoliation to my
skin<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.299> kind<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.510> slips<00:02:50.780> off<00:02:50.930> any<00:02:51.140> rough

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
skin so it kind of slips off any rough

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.869 
skin so it kind of slips off any rough
or<00:02:51.530> dead<00:02:51.709> spots<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:52.579> that's<00:02:52.730> really

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
or dead spots and I think that's really

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.610 
or dead spots and I think that's really
nice<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.390> just<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.930> know<00:02:54.049> it<00:02:54.260> makes<00:02:54.410> me<00:02:54.530> feel

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
nice and just you know it makes me feel

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.490 
nice and just you know it makes me feel
a<00:02:54.769> lot<00:02:55.099> more<00:02:55.430> youthful<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.629> beautiful<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
a lot more youthful and beautiful and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.350 
a lot more youthful and beautiful and
I've<00:02:58.489> noticed<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.090> does<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.269> really

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
I've noticed that it does a really

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.830 
I've noticed that it does a really
really<00:02:59.840> good<00:02:59.989> job<00:03:00.019> of<00:03:00.319> cleaning<00:03:00.500> as<00:03:00.950> well<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.430> am
