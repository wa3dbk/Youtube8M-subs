00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
be called the drop zone not the drop-off

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
zone it's not a drop-off zone it's a

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.299 
zone it's not a drop-off zone it's a
drop<00:00:51.489> zone<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.660> when<00:00:53.530> you<00:00:53.620> have<00:00:53.649> more<00:00:53.980> players

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
drop zone and when you have more players

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.759 
drop zone and when you have more players
in<00:00:54.579> that<00:00:54.730> zone<00:00:54.969> apparently<00:00:55.809> you'll<00:00:56.050> get<00:00:56.499> care

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
in that zone apparently you'll get care

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.869 
in that zone apparently you'll get care
packages<00:00:57.339> like<00:00:57.730> every<00:00:58.030> 15<00:00:58.149> seconds<00:00:59.100> and<00:01:00.100> the

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
packages like every 15 seconds and the

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.029 
packages like every 15 seconds and the
only<00:01:01.059> way<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.420> achieve<00:01:01.690> point<00:01:02.109> streaks<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.679> by

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
only way to achieve point streaks is by

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.160 
only way to achieve point streaks is by
earning<00:01:03.489> those<00:01:03.609> care<00:01:03.879> packages<00:01:03.909> so<00:01:04.629> we'll

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
earning those care packages so we'll

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.420 
earning those care packages so we'll
have<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.440> try<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:05.680> we'll<00:01:06.040> have<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.250> try<00:01:06.400> it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
have to try that we'll have to try it

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.740 
have to try that we'll have to try it
out<00:01:06.550> maybe<00:01:06.700> we'll<00:01:06.850> get<00:01:06.940> some<00:01:07.150> games<00:01:07.450> record

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
out maybe we'll get some games record

playlist<00:01:15.700> section<00:01:16.259> which<00:01:17.259> is<00:01:17.290> includes<00:01:18.189> this

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
playlist section which is includes this

drop<00:01:18.820> zone<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.479> there<00:01:20.380> may<00:01:20.560> be<00:01:20.590> other<00:01:21.100> popular

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
drop zone so there may be other popular

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.889 
drop zone so there may be other popular
and<00:01:22.000> unique<00:01:22.710> privates<00:01:23.710> modes<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:25.810> be

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
and unique privates modes that will be

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.330 
and unique privates modes that will be
available<00:01:26.140> there<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.680> have<00:01:26.860> actually<00:01:27.009> been

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
available there that have actually been

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.010 
available there that have actually been
created<00:01:27.790> by<00:01:27.909> users<00:01:28.180> so<00:01:28.479> maybe<00:01:28.659> you'll<00:01:28.840> see

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
created by users so maybe you'll see

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.990 
created by users so maybe you'll see
like<00:01:29.530> in<00:01:29.680> fact<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.159> or<00:01:30.280> something<00:01:30.820> like<00:01:30.909> that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
like in fact it or something like that

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.550 
like in fact it or something like that
like<00:01:31.119> I<00:01:31.360> think<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.110> pretty<00:01:32.259> interesting

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
like I think it's pretty interesting

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.310 
like I think it's pretty interesting
that<00:01:33.460> they'll<00:01:33.969> be<00:01:34.060> adding<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.509> these<00:01:34.750> these

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
that they'll be adding in these these

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.440 
that they'll be adding in these these
game<00:01:36.159> modes<00:01:36.430> in<00:01:36.640> here<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:36.790> think<00:01:37.030> they<00:01:37.149> actually

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
game modes in here I think they actually

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.730 
game modes in here I think they actually
did<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.840> with<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:41.229> hell<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.619> wasn't

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
did that with what the hell it wasn't

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.510 
did that with what the hell it wasn't

which<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:05.140> know<00:02:05.229> i<00:02:05.259> can<00:02:05.500> understand<00:02:05.920> because

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
which you know i can understand because

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.410 
which you know i can understand because
there's<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:06.460> lot<00:02:06.579> of<00:02:06.609> team<00:02:06.820> killing<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.270> goes

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
there's a lot of team killing that goes

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.410 
there's a lot of team killing that goes
on<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.630> hardcore<00:02:08.110> but<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.679> same<00:02:08.890> time<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
on in hardcore but the same time you

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.660 
on in hardcore but the same time you
know<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.899> want<00:02:11.170> friendly<00:02:11.620> fire<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.520> you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
know you want friendly fire so if you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.340 
know you want friendly fire so if you
accidentally<00:02:13.210> kill<00:02:13.390> somebody<00:02:13.630> but<00:02:13.900> i<00:02:13.960> guess

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
accidentally kill somebody but i guess

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.380 
accidentally kill somebody but i guess
it's<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.620> balance<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.250> i<00:02:15.370> think<00:02:15.640> for<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.240> most

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
it's a balance and i think for the most

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.260 
it's a balance and i think for the most
part<00:02:16.510> there's<00:02:16.990> there's<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:17.590> team<00:02:17.800> killing

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
part there's there's more team killing

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.880 
part there's there's more team killing
so<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.630> know<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:19.870> appropriate<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.500> have<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
so you know it's appropriate to have the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.960 
so you know it's appropriate to have the
the<00:02:21.250> Ricochet<00:02:21.670> variants<00:02:22.210> in<00:02:22.360> there

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the Ricochet variants in there

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.650 
the Ricochet variants in there
then<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.200> last<00:02:24.470> thing<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:25.340> they're<00:02:26.060> looking

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
then the last thing that they're looking

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.570 
then the last thing that they're looking
at<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.650> don't<00:02:27.830> know<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:27.950> guess<00:02:28.190> we'll<00:02:28.490> have

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
at and I don't know I guess we'll have

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.440
