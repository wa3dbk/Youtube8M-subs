but<00:01:12.960> not<00:01:13.080> least<00:01:13.320> you'll<00:01:13.650> save<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.100> toner<00:01:14.400> in

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.120 
but not least you'll save on toner in
the<00:01:14.640> long<00:01:14.880> run<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.240> toner<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.680> couple

the long run because toner with a couple

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.460 
the long run because toner with a couple
of<00:01:17.250> very<00:01:17.790> few<00:01:18.060> exceptions<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.720> cheaper<00:01:19.439> than

of very few exceptions is cheaper than

of very few exceptions is cheaper than
ink<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.220> refills<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.270> boils<00:01:21.390> down<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.750> this
