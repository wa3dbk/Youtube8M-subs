00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
it's like worst case scenario is it for

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.030 
it's like worst case scenario is it for
you<00:00:55.180> getting<00:00:56.180> adjusting<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.680> two

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
you getting adjusting to the two

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.380 
you getting adjusting to the two
European<00:00:58.640> style<00:00:59.150> of<00:00:59.870> starcraft<00:01:00.650> 2<00:01:00.800> I<00:01:01.790> wouldn't

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
European style of starcraft 2 I wouldn't

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.479 
European style of starcraft 2 I wouldn't
blame<00:01:02.479> it<00:01:02.720> on<00:01:02.809> that<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:03.379> think<00:01:03.890> I'm<00:01:04.010> just<00:01:04.040> in<00:01:04.430> a

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
blame it on that I think I'm just in a

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.420 
blame it on that I think I'm just in a
very<00:01:04.670> bad<00:01:04.879> shape<00:01:04.940> right<00:01:05.210> now<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.659> general<00:01:05.870> but

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
very bad shape right now in general but

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.280 
very bad shape right now in general but
maybe<00:01:07.430> it's<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.479> little<00:01:08.600> factor<00:01:09.049> because

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
maybe it's a little factor because

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.660 
maybe it's a little factor because
everybody's<00:01:09.740> playing<00:01:09.920> very<00:01:10.130> different<00:01:10.520> here

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
everybody's playing very different here

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.620 
everybody's playing very different here
but<00:01:10.940> I<00:01:11.150> mostly<00:01:11.630> just<00:01:11.720> made<00:01:12.080> that<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.670> why<00:01:14.570> is

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
but I mostly just made that and why is

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.200 
but I mostly just made that and why is
your<00:01:14.870> shape<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:15.380> what<00:01:15.560> why<00:01:16.370> is<00:01:16.820> there<00:01:17.060> any

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
your shape but what why is there any

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.000 
your shape but what why is there any
cause<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.930> because<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.320> had<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.470> small

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
cause of it because you had a small

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.890 
cause of it because you had a small
injury<00:01:19.220> well<00:01:19.790> everyone<00:01:20.150> seen<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.479> interview

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
but it was really bad luck for them

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.729 
but it was really bad luck for them
and<00:02:24.099> but<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:25.000> mean<00:02:25.420> Tim<00:02:25.720> liquid<00:02:26.019> OGS<00:02:26.440> are<00:02:26.560> still

so maybe he will make it to the to the
finals<00:02:32.200> yeah<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.879> really<00:02:33.879> want<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.120> see<00:02:34.180> top<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
finals yeah I really want to see top and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.479 
finals yeah I really want to see top and
the<00:02:34.750> finals<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.170> would<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.349> nice<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.250> are

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
the finals it would be nice and are

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.850 
the finals it would be nice and are
there<00:02:36.580> any<00:02:36.730> other<00:02:37.090> upsets<00:02:37.599> results<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.739> you

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
there any other upsets results that you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.710 
there any other upsets results that you
wouldn't<00:02:39.190> have<00:02:39.340> expected<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> bracket<00:02:40.510> oh

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
wouldn't have expected in the bracket oh

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.350 
wouldn't have expected in the bracket oh
no<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> think<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:41.860> maybe<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.910> show<00:02:43.120> lost

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
no I think it's maybe that show lost

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.699 
no I think it's maybe that show lost
earlier<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.930> think<00:02:43.989> he's<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> really<00:02:44.410> good

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
earlier I think he's a really good

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.589 
earlier I think he's a really good
player<00:02:44.830> but<00:02:44.950> he<00:02:45.790> didn't<00:02:46.060> make<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.180> through

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
player but he didn't make it through

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.839 
player but he didn't make it through
crusade<00:02:47.260> either<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:48.069> with<00:02:48.310> tournaments<00:02:48.640> like

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
crusade either but with tournaments like

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.580 
crusade either but with tournaments like
that<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:49.569> many<00:02:49.690> good<00:02:49.870> players<00:02:50.079> that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
that you have so many good players that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.589 
that you have so many good players that
really<00:02:51.069> anything<00:02:51.280> can<00:02:51.519> happen<00:02:51.640> how<00:02:52.450> do<00:02:52.510> you

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
really anything can happen how do you

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.470 
really anything can happen how do you
like<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.989> European<00:02:53.500> level<00:02:53.530> at<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.459> moment<00:02:54.819> if

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
like the European level at the moment if

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.330 
like the European level at the moment if
you<00:02:55.659> compare<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.200> bed<00:02:56.349> student<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.010> Korean

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
you compare the bed student the Korean

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.530 
you compare the bed student the Korean
level<00:02:57.610> is<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:58.180> still<00:02:58.920> worldwide's<00:02:59.920> apart<00:03:00.540> I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
level is it still worldwide's apart I

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.559 
level is it still worldwide's apart I
would<00:03:02.049> say<00:03:02.200> it's<00:03:02.319> real<00:03:02.620> support<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.239> atop<00:03:04.239> a

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
would say it's real support but atop a

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.869 
would say it's real support but atop a
top<00:03:04.870> level<00:03:05.049> it's<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.709> pretty<00:03:06.190> small<00:03:06.400> small

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
top level it's a pretty small small

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.880 
top level it's a pretty small small
difference<00:03:07.209> in<00:03:07.299> my<00:03:07.420> opinion<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.680> let

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
difference in my opinion but if you let

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.619 
difference in my opinion but if you let
our<00:03:09.069> you<00:03:09.250> notice<00:03:09.879> a<00:03:09.970> huge<00:03:10.090> difference<00:03:10.180> because

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
our you notice a huge difference because

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.869 
our you notice a huge difference because
in<00:03:11.079> Korea<00:03:11.410> if<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.739> letter<00:03:11.950> almost<00:03:12.489> every<00:03:12.849> game

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
in Korea if you letter almost every game

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.509 
in Korea if you letter almost every game
is<00:03:13.209> good<00:03:13.480> while<00:03:14.049> on<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.799> European<00:03:15.190> letters

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
is good while on the European letters

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.309 
is good while on the European letters
there's<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.849> lot<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.000> weird<00:03:16.750> random<00:03:16.930> stuff

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
there's a lot of weird random stuff

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.430 
there's a lot of weird random stuff
going<00:03:17.590> on<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:18.280> can't<00:03:18.489> believe<00:03:18.609> in<00:03:18.849> nature

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
going on that I can't believe in nature

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.750 
going on that I can't believe in nature
that's<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.829> course<00:03:21.040> use<00:03:21.340> even<00:03:21.640> the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
that's of course use even the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.210 
that's of course use even the
communities<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.420> course<00:03:23.019> way<00:03:23.319> bigger<00:03:23.650> in

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
communities of course way bigger in

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.699 
communities of course way bigger in
Korea<00:03:24.609> I<00:03:24.730> guess<00:03:24.970> how<00:03:25.299> is<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.690> living<00:03:26.079> becomes

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
Korea I guess how is it living becomes

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.650 
Korea I guess how is it living becomes
darker<00:03:27.040> one<00:03:27.280> it's<00:03:27.519> it's<00:03:27.790> been<00:03:28.060> there<00:03:28.239> like<00:03:28.419> for

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
darker one it's it's been there like for

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.830 
darker one it's it's been there like for
10<00:03:29.290> years<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:29.859> must<00:03:30.130> be<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:31.180> must<00:03:31.480> be<00:03:31.599> so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
10 years it's must be it must be so

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.490 
10 years it's must be it must be so
settled<00:03:32.380> in<00:03:33.060> Indian<00:03:34.060> lifestyle<00:03:34.599> of<00:03:34.930> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
settled in Indian lifestyle of the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.710 
settled in Indian lifestyle of the
Koreans<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.099> in<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.370> community<00:03:36.549> how<00:03:37.299> is

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
Koreans and in the community how is

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.979 
Koreans and in the community how is
starcraft<00:03:38.139> 2<00:03:38.380> moving<00:03:38.889> in<00:03:39.040> there<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.489> think<00:03:40.120> it's

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
starcraft 2 moving in there I think it's

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.920 
starcraft 2 moving in there I think it's
just<00:03:41.280> adapting<00:03:42.280> everybody<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:43.389> taking<00:03:43.630> over

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
just adapting everybody is taking over

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.099 
just adapting everybody is taking over
the<00:03:44.380> stock<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.769> one<00:03:44.919> tradition<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:46.079> become<00:03:47.079> a

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
the stock of one tradition it's become a

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.110 
the stock of one tradition it's become a
little<00:03:47.410> bit<00:03:47.470> more<00:03:48.099> relaxed<00:03:48.310> because<00:03:48.700> cast

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
little bit more relaxed because cast

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.759 
little bit more relaxed because cast
spells<00:03:49.359> not<00:03:49.630> controlling<00:03:50.530> everything

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
spells not controlling everything

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.039 
spells not controlling everything
anymore<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:52.120> becoming<00:03:52.419> better<00:03:52.690> for<00:03:52.959> the

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
anymore so it's becoming better for the

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.339 
anymore so it's becoming better for the
players<00:03:53.310> say<00:03:54.510> they<00:03:55.510> are<00:03:55.540> having<00:03:55.840> more<00:03:56.079> rights

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
players say they are having more rights
