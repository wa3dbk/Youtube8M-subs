00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 I'll tell you in three parts 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.589
 main info about knitting and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.559
 to everything you need in part 3 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.440
 it's about keeping a good one 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.240
 book and the ultimate strictly tips 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.359
 I wish you much fun then to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.220
 piece now I even like to use 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.470
 such a tub not to come in 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.359
 I work every time I do 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.980
 knit is my friedman because through 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.050
 the apartment and then distributed in 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.070
 whole floor or at the desk and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 pushes something around 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.129
 At some point I will have this product 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.780
 taken on a bang and if 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.610
 I can not touch him anymore 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 disappear is really only there for it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.120
 I do not have a practical one right now 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.219
 Solution found there are solutions for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.770
 want to put that on it and then shoot 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.660
 but that costs but of course and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 I do not want that because of that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.170
 cheapest solution i take his plastic 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.050
 straight and one one sometimes does too 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.280
 a plastic bag the last one to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.840
 conclusion the built 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.340
 I have my whole knitting needle here 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.799
 Just accept our little one 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.020
 technology could in fact find everything 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.799
 possible take main thing as I should 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.580
 I go in my long woods 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.659
 in his box here was originally 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.960
 knife in there now behind my one 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.729
 thicker needles over the long ones too 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.159
 however, needles will be with long needles 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.560
 just want to work on it 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.680
 all needles could not break and 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.060
 do not splinter cologne in good hands 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.540
 or it does not have to bend 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.720
 no case at the end of the wool itself 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.850
 I store very unspectacular in one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.070
 huge ikea title 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.799
 I have the single wool in separate 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.780
 demand types are most title 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.119
 transparent so I can see what 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.520
 I can satire in it 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.869
 material this is all build now 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.850
 wool or won in the ring 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.179
 Elsewhere is the thicker front where 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.009
 everything is the acrylic wool and so on 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.869
 I'll give you a big new tip if you like 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.840
 Do materials like cotton or 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.550
 merino wool stores a bag 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.050
 a red bag of moths love 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.610
 natural material especially if you 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.720
 somehow dark and complete 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.380
 maybe not used for longer 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.540
 become 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.880
 Tottenham somehow costs five euros 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.530
 three pieces do it and you can sure 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.100
 Being with a material will be nothing 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.780
 happen 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.670
 I have to knit myself 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.870
 many videos also looked at the one 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.580
 or other book bought and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.360
 read through with most areas 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.030
 satisfied 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.500
 i found most have information 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.380
 and know badly mediated the found 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.360
 Most projects have the old-fashioned 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.709
 looked 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.970
 and it was not fun to do 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.180
 I did not learn much 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.000
 the only book that really gives me something 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.120
 this book was the book 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.280
 knitting of just under 20 euros 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.269
 I think I 'll take it in 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.250
 the infobox 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.989
 every time I work on something but 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.840
 what I want to know, I leaf through here 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.310
 and that reminded her of this 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.299
 For example , I often have it too 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.530
 to take people 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.840
 Here, for example, we are in there 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.010
 you pass the cuts for blogger 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.959
 or a jacket you make yourself the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.639
 cuts out in this book out there 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.140
 there are no projects that are described 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.610
 none 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.170
 hats no jackets can do the bags 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.890
 That's why I think the book is synonymous 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.560
 especially good 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.120
 this is a pure knowledge book where you can 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.459
 can look up how to which 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.650
 steps which materials which 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.959
 used tools power exercises 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.450
 uses 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.520
 very useful not more do you need to 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.950
 Knitting simply start with the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:38.140
 absolute basics to the knitting needles 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.209
 Wanted to load here and nothing else 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.900
 online works first and looks 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.370
 while the work is missing something 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.989
 Annoy something again or think 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.420
 you the world a little 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.010
 tools I really like that 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.560
 me to buy things like not on 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.239
 beginning with a complete existence 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.860
 put the only one where a set 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.780
 really worth it and make sense are not 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.090
 mentioned at the beginning the knitting needles 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.510
 otherwise you work piece by piece 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.739
 Do not buy too much , he starts with little 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.260
 otherwise there is nothing to the next 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.390
 actually what i learned through 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.120
 knit and it is not one for them 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.170
 enrichment is patience and is 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.850
 not bad if you are one 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.979
 Project always starts I have 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.650
 my first time and mine 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.360
 seen mother thing and laugh like that 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.040
 at the beginning my god is so many 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.300
 Meshes are wrong all are so many 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.270
 mistake in it and I have already determined 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.040
 Knitted so much and I did 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.669
 It does not know six hours or so 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.130
 Eternal to me forever back then and she has 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.770
 So my mother said if you are now 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.290
 find everything again on finding everything 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.210
 I'm very glad I do not care for six 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.520
 For hours on this scarf I worked 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.830
 I can not open it alone 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.870
 yes all lost all the work and 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.980
 she has the architect if you have so much 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.320
 time on the Rhine then you want 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.330
 His work looks great too and you 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.880
 you'll be starring at little things and 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.990
 she had come right after he left 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.650
 got home the damage 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.390
 watched 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.370
 yes okay and have the complete 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.330
 opened again and the first time it has 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.420
 still hurt 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.570
 These hours of work are easy 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.710
 do not let it evaporate 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.270
 I did but then stored quickly 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.950
 if you always new projects 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.020
 starts again and again I believe mine 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.600
 very first jokes I have knitted 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.180
 I have a total of eight times 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.130
 opened up again dissolved 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.170
 only that and then I have for myself 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.990
 many jokes to the end knitted but me 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.400
 I found that so ugly that the 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.580
 have done completely again because 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.140
 otherwise the vale's lost so 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.280
 this process with the you can 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.010
 I think it 's one 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.920
 enrichment for life that one patience 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.650
 I'll get a big lesson 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.210
 In the beginning, I had that 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.550
 Picture of my grandmother in memory of the in 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.630
 a structural change quickly and strictly 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.150
 I wanted that as fast as possible 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.070
 possible as soon as I'm on it 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.640
 he tempo me trying to get big 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.760
 error 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.190
 every time I tried to 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.790
 speed I have 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.350
 made mistakes in concentration and have 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.180
 The pattern messed up I had to rhine 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.880
 dissolve again or the thing completely 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.320
 dissolve and have in the end so more 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.410
 time lost than won 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.120
 So take your time making any sense 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.260
 especially if you have a pattern then 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.390
 that you must hold each other with care 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.250
 Concentrate, you do it slowly 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.470
 slowly as it has for you pleasant it 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.120
 enjoy the time i am doing very much 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.220
 like and with a lot of love with a lot 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.750
 a lot of joy and every time I am 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.180
 I'm finished if I only agree with hair 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.820
 knitted or three hours and that 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.700
 I am pleased about the product 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.780
 me scary and that an absolute 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.420
 profit for my life 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.370
 so be joy and video in the next 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.110
 I'll show you what you need to know 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.520
 finally to start knitting 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.330
 the right stitches threw the left ones 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.069
 the stop stitches 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.810
 even if I say everything it is not 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:58.349
 hard you are just a few small tips 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:07:00.090
 and trick certain always looks 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:02.370
 another stretch basics videos 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.500
 if you want to know what things 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.020
 you really need what mistakes you make 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.250
 but should definitely avoid media on 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.250
 fastest learns
