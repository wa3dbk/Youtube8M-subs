on what happened to this planet and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.710 
on what happened to this planet and
something<00:01:41.790> apparently<00:01:41.970> happened<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.630> those

who were trying to figure that out at
first<00:01:44.700> glance<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> map<00:01:45.479> appears<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.930> be

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
first glance is the map appears to be

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
first glance is the map appears to be
large<00:01:46.259> too<00:01:46.500> stretched<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.219> really<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
large too stretched out but really it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
large too stretched out but really it
isn't<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.119> imagine<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.750> map<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:48.960> around

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
isn't I imagine that this map is around

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.319 
isn't I imagine that this map is around
the<00:01:49.409> size<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.799> isolation<00:01:50.340> from<00:01:50.430> Halo<00:01:50.700> 3<00:01:50.729> though

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the size of isolation from Halo 3 though

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.090 
the size of isolation from Halo 3 though
I<00:01:51.360> may<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.719> completely<00:01:52.200> wrong<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.680> fact<00:01:52.920> I'm

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
I may be completely wrong in fact I'm

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.709 
I may be completely wrong in fact I'm
pretty<00:01:53.130> sure<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.579> am<00:01:53.820> though<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.509> meant

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
pretty sure I am though this meant

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.300 
pretty sure I am though this meant
reminds<00:01:55.110> me<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.350> halo<00:01:55.530> 3<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.799> guarding<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> be

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
reminds me of halo 3 is guarding to be

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
reminds me of halo 3 is guarding to be
honest<00:01:56.610> as<00:01:56.820> well<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.240> fact<00:01:57.509> I'm<00:01:57.719> sure<00:01:57.750> if

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
honest as well and in fact I'm sure if

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.480 
honest as well and in fact I'm sure if
you<00:01:58.140> look<00:01:58.409> very<00:01:58.590> hard<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:59.070> into<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> open

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
you look very hard out into the open

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.359 
you look very hard out into the open
you'll<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.360> halo<00:02:00.600> 3's<00:02:00.899> Guardian<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:02.009> joking

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
you'll see halo 3's Guardian I'm joking

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.950 
you'll see halo 3's Guardian I'm joking
by<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> way<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.000> map<00:02:03.180> obviously<00:02:03.659> has<00:02:03.780> been

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
by the way the map obviously has been

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.779 
by the way the map obviously has been
inspired<00:02:04.259> by<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> plan<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.860> takes<00:02:05.100> place<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
inspired by the plan a takes place on so

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.310 
inspired by the plan a takes place on so
I'm<00:02:05.909> assuming<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.810> these<00:02:06.960> trees<00:02:07.289> are

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
I'm assuming that these trees are

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.230 
I'm assuming that these trees are
letting<00:02:07.649> up<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.100> naturally<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> got

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
letting up you know naturally but I got

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.420 
letting up you know naturally but I got
to<00:02:09.270> say<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> map<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.050> has<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.620> very<00:02:10.980> creepy

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
to say that the map is has a very creepy

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.950 
to say that the map is has a very creepy
appearance<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.000> I'm<00:02:12.060> sure<00:02:12.570> most<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
appearance and I'm sure most of you

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.790 
appearance and I'm sure most of you
would

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
would

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.980 
would
with<00:02:14.040> me<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> map<00:02:14.460> also<00:02:14.700> features<00:02:15.180> small<00:02:15.780> dust

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
with me the map also features small dust

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.540 
with me the map also features small dust
piles<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.620> sure<00:02:16.800> why<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.980> got<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> point<00:02:17.430> this

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
piles not sure why I got to point this

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
piles not sure why I got to point this
out<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.390> there's<00:02:18.630> many<00:02:18.780> ways<00:02:18.930> for
