anything else yes firing electric
electric<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.609> have<00:01:00.600> quite<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> big<00:01:01.050> kiln<00:01:01.730> which

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
electric I have quite a big kiln which

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
electric I have quite a big kiln which
I'll<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.090> myself

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I'll do it myself

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.190 
I'll do it myself
and<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:05.000> just<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> pop<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.900> ever

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and it's just I can get a pop just ever

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.590 
and it's just I can get a pop just ever
metre<00:01:07.560> long<00:01:07.920> inside<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:10.250> 6570<00:01:11.250> wide<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
metre long inside and about 6570 wide so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.560 
metre long inside and about 6570 wide so
what's<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> cubic<00:01:13.320> needs<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> kiln

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
what's the cubic needs to be at the kiln

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.859 
what's the cubic needs to be at the kiln
good<00:01:15.570> question<00:01:18.080> okay<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:20.310> probably

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.080 

but<00:01:23.320> I<00:01:23.409> think<00:01:23.469> there's<00:01:23.740> many<00:01:23.950> bigger<00:01:24.609> ones<00:01:24.880> in

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
but I think there's many bigger ones in

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.440 
but I think there's many bigger ones in
Europe<00:01:26.460> we've<00:01:27.460> actually<00:01:27.609> got<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.030> couple<00:01:28.299> of

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
Europe we've actually got a couple of

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.359

know<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.930> move<00:02:53.680> some<00:02:53.950> holes<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.340> box<00:02:54.489> yeah

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
know and move some holes in the box yeah

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.180 
know and move some holes in the box yeah
and<00:02:54.970> then<00:02:55.510> they<00:02:55.720> started<00:02:56.380> commissioning<00:02:56.980> them

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and then they started commissioning them

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.620 
and then they started commissioning them
because<00:02:57.400> they<00:02:57.549> like<00:02:57.790> that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
because they like that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.140 
because they like that
there's<00:02:58.960> a<00:02:59.050> very<00:02:59.290> rough<00:02:59.620> character<00:03:00.310> yeah<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
there's a very rough character yeah and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.900 
there's a very rough character yeah and
it<00:03:01.270> suits<00:03:01.600> what<00:03:01.990> they<00:03:02.170> call<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:03.550> literati

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
it suits what they call the literati

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.140 
it suits what they call the literati
trades<00:03:04.630> which<00:03:04.990> were<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.380> trees<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.640> mate<00:03:06.880> by

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
trades which were the trees in a mate by

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.410 
trades which were the trees in a mate by
the<00:03:07.830> litter<00:03:08.830> are<00:03:09.070> by<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.340> intellectuals<00:03:10.180> near

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the litter are by the intellectuals near

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.000 
the litter are by the intellectuals near
select<00:03:10.780> tools<00:03:10.990> yes<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.500> course

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
select tools yes of course

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.880 
select tools yes of course
and<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:12.700> went<00:03:12.910> with<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:14.350> know<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.650> whole

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
and it went with the you know this whole

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.310 
and it went with the you know this whole
concept<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.490> came<00:03:15.790> through<00:03:16.540> from<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.020> Song

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
concept that came through from the Song

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.560 
concept that came through from the Song
Dynasty<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:18.250> they<00:03:18.400> little<00:03:18.730> brush<00:03:18.970> paintings

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
Dynasty that they little brush paintings

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.830 
Dynasty that they little brush paintings
and<00:03:19.810> landscape<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.340> honestly<00:03:21.970> we<00:03:22.630> look<00:03:22.750> at

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
and landscape so honestly we look at

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.300 
and landscape so honestly we look at
this<00:03:22.930> but<00:03:23.110> what<00:03:23.320> would<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:23.650> envisage<00:03:23.920> what

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
this but what would you envisage what

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.140 
this but what would you envisage what
tree<00:03:24.730> would<00:03:24.940> fit<00:03:25.900> well<00:03:26.110> with<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:26.470> pond<00:03:27.150> well

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
tree would fit well with this pond well

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.930 
tree would fit well with this pond well
it's<00:03:28.540> obviously<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.960> deeper<00:03:29.530> one<00:03:29.710> than<00:03:29.950> we

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
it's obviously a deeper one than we

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.540 
it's obviously a deeper one than we
usually<00:03:31.330> use<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.950> know<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.070> would<00:03:33.280> look<00:03:33.400> at

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
usually use so you know I would look at

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.220 
usually use so you know I would look at
using<00:03:34.030> something<00:03:34.270> like<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.570> flowering

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
using something like a flowering

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.820 
using something like a flowering
fruiting<00:03:35.500> tree<00:03:35.980> right<00:03:36.610> something<00:03:37.830> something

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
fruiting tree right something something

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.280 
fruiting tree right something something
old<00:03:39.100> something<00:03:39.820> with<00:03:40.210> living<00:03:40.780> nice<00:03:40.960> old

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
old something with living nice old

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.230 
old something with living nice old
character<00:03:42.160> bark<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:42.730> course<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:43.180> know

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
character bark and it of course you know

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:51.560 
character bark and it of course you know
you<00:03:44.080> know<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.440> could<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.870> could<00:03:46.900> be<00:03:47.550> slow

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.850 

really<00:03:52.570> nice<00:03:54.930> but<00:03:55.930> we<00:03:56.200> we're<00:03:56.560> looking<00:03:56.740> at

really nice but we we're looking at

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.900 
really nice but we we're looking at
something<00:03:57.040> that's<00:03:57.220> been<00:03:57.430> this<00:03:57.730> has<00:03:57.880> been

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
it's actually probably three coils this

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.410 
it's actually probably three coils this
one<00:04:05.050> really<00:04:05.620> yeah<00:04:06.160> all<00:04:06.610> right<00:04:06.850> what<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.120> do<00:04:07.210> is

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
probably a meter long and then I'll

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.680 
probably a meter long and then I'll
flatten<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.990> yeah<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.340> had<00:04:15.460> it<00:04:15.490> to<00:04:15.790> cut<00:04:16.239> out<00:04:16.420> base

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
flatten it yeah I had it to cut out base

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.879 
flatten it yeah I had it to cut out base
and

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
and

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.849 
and
another<00:04:18.459> one<00:04:18.759> okay<00:04:19.299> no<00:04:19.659> I'll<00:04:20.229> work<00:04:20.469> into<00:04:20.829> it

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
another one okay no I'll work into it

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.670 
another one okay no I'll work into it
you<00:04:21.430> know<00:04:21.549> this<00:04:21.699> is<00:04:21.879> just<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.270> free<00:04:22.569> and<00:04:22.840> you

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
you know this is just so free and you

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.809 
you know this is just so free and you
don't<00:04:23.860> think<00:04:24.129> France<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.680> then<00:04:26.889> this<00:04:27.550> one<00:04:27.789> I

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
don't think France and then this one I

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.249 
don't think France and then this one I
probably<00:04:28.240> added<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.990> smaller<00:04:29.909> rim<00:04:30.909> on<00:04:31.840> top<00:04:32.139> of

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
probably added a smaller rim on top of

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.950 
probably added a smaller rim on top of
that<00:04:32.379> and<00:04:32.710> then<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.460> know<00:04:33.550> just<00:04:33.840> rounded<00:04:34.840> it

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
that and then you know just rounded it

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.070 
that and then you know just rounded it
off<00:04:34.990> by<00:04:35.259> hand<00:04:35.580> smooth<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.819> off<00:04:36.969> but<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:37.900> know

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
off by hand smooth it off but you know

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.019 
off by hand smooth it off but you know
there's<00:04:38.860> definitely<00:04:39.009> moved<00:04:39.550> towards<00:04:39.969> this

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:40.029 
there's definitely moved towards this

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.529 
there's definitely moved towards this
more<00:04:40.270> rustic<00:04:41.520> powerful<00:04:42.520> pots<00:04:42.849> yeah

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
more rustic powerful pots yeah

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.249 
more rustic powerful pots yeah
which<00:04:44.379> which<00:04:45.009> certainly<00:04:45.460> your<00:04:46.150> range<00:04:46.389> here<00:04:46.900> it

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
which which certainly your range here it

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.559 
which which certainly your range here it
is<00:04:47.650> definitely<00:04:48.039> display<00:04:48.430> around<00:04:48.699> your<00:04:49.389> show

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
is definitely display around your show

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.749 
is definitely display around your show
yeah<00:04:49.779> I<00:04:50.020> really<00:04:50.319> like<00:04:50.620> making<00:04:51.009> these<00:04:51.340> because

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
yeah I really like making these because

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.649 
yeah I really like making these because
I<00:04:52.029> mean<00:04:52.539> even<00:04:52.779> though<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.229> seems<00:04:53.590> kind<00:04:54.400> of

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
I mean even though the it seems kind of

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.899 
I mean even though the it seems kind of
bit<00:04:55.659> off<00:04:55.689> the<00:04:56.020> wall<00:04:56.219> they're<00:04:57.219> not<00:04:57.430> at<00:04:57.699> all<00:04:57.849> easy

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909 
bit off the wall they're not at all easy

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.320 
bit off the wall they're not at all easy
to<00:04:58.389> make<00:04:58.569> them<00:04:59.169> successfully<00:05:00.210> because<00:05:01.210> they

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
to make them successfully because they

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.760 
to make them successfully because they
could<00:05:01.479> have<00:05:01.659> the<00:05:01.779> right<00:05:01.960> kind<00:05:02.259> of<00:05:02.379> right

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
could have the right kind of right

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.709 
could have the right kind of right
amount<00:05:03.099> of<00:05:03.159> control<00:05:03.550> in<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:03.819> right<00:05:03.969> way<00:05:04.539> of

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 
amount of control in the right way of

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:05.249 
amount of control in the right way of
letting<00:05:05.020> go

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
letting go

they are you know the more formal pots
these<00:05:22.750> kind<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.110> shapes<00:05:23.789> it<00:05:24.789> is<00:05:25.029> you<00:05:25.449> know<00:05:25.629> it's
