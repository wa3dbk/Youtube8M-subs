you<00:04:02.650> know<00:04:02.680> cosplay<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.370> think<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:04.060> difference

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
you know cosplay I think the difference

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.240 
you know cosplay I think the difference
between<00:04:04.450> costume<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:04.989> cosplay<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:05.410> costume

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
between costume in cosplay is costume

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.400 
between costume in cosplay is costume
you're<00:04:06.550> wearing<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:07.269> costume<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.260> don't

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
you're wearing a costume you don't

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.170 
you're wearing a costume you don't
technically<00:04:08.769> have<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.010> like<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.790> character

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
technically have to like the character

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.370 
technically have to like the character
you<00:04:10.300> don't<00:04:10.330> have<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.690> want<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.110> be<00:04:11.230> the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
you don't have to want to be the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.360 
you don't have to want to be the
character<00:04:11.739> but<00:04:11.890> you're<00:04:12.010> wearing<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.220> costume

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
character but you're wearing a costume

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.490 
character but you're wearing a costume
as<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.300> for<00:04:13.510> life<00:04:13.690> theater<00:04:13.959> you're<00:04:14.350> in<00:04:14.470> a

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
as in for life theater you're in a

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.440 
as in for life theater you're in a
costume<00:04:14.769> because<00:04:15.160> you<00:04:15.310> are<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.489> character<00:04:16.150> what

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
costume because you are a character what

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.270 
costume because you are a character what
but<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.989> feel<00:04:17.200> like<00:04:17.350> cosplay<00:04:17.859> is<00:04:17.919> different

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
but I feel like cosplay is different

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.520 
but I feel like cosplay is different
because<00:04:18.400> since<00:04:18.700> its<00:04:18.820> cost<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.120> play<00:04:19.390> it's<00:04:20.079> you

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
because since its cost you play it's you

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.930 
because since its cost you play it's you
are<00:04:20.680> making<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:21.040> costume<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.519> become<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
are making a costume to become the

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.400 
are making a costume to become the
character<00:04:22.240> but<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.419> are<00:04:22.630> also<00:04:22.990> kind<00:04:23.290> of

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
character but you are also kind of

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.650 
character but you are also kind of
playing<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.550> character<00:04:24.940> because<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:25.390> love

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
playing the character because you love

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.210 
playing the character because you love
that<00:04:25.930> usually<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.440> cosplay<00:04:26.650> characters<00:04:26.890> you

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
that usually you cosplay characters you

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.280 
that usually you cosplay characters you
love<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.669> much<00:04:27.729> rather<00:04:28.090> aesthetically<00:04:29.080> or

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
love so much rather aesthetically or

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.230 
love so much rather aesthetically or
characteristically<00:04:30.160> you<00:04:30.610> just<00:04:30.820> really

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
characteristically you just really

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.460 
characteristically you just really
really<00:04:31.270> like<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.780> character<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.229> much<00:04:32.290> you

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
really like the character so much you

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.780 
really like the character so much you
want<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.710> become<00:04:33.010> that<00:04:33.280> character<00:04:33.490> at<00:04:33.729> least

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
want to become that character at least

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.760 
want to become that character at least
for<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.060> day<00:04:34.150> or<00:04:34.540> something<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.440> think<00:04:35.530> that's

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
for a day or something so I think that's

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.469 
for a day or something so I think that's
the<00:04:35.919> major<00:04:36.280> difference<00:04:36.430> between<00:04:36.850> just

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
the major difference between just

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.450 
the major difference between just
costume<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.140> cosplay<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:38.830> did<00:04:39.100> not<00:04:39.280> know<00:04:39.430> that

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
costume and cosplay I did not know that

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.690 
costume and cosplay I did not know that
so<00:04:40.090> um<00:04:40.660> I'm<00:04:41.650> sure<00:04:41.710> basic<00:04:42.280> questions<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.610> a

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700
