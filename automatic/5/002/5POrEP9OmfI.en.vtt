00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello, how are we going to talk about the video and what are people? 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.509
 sensitivity of the speakers and the power we need 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.619
 for illicit activity a rather long process that is a data 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.120
 necessary many times to know 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.580
 then the province of ecuador to mark in each part 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.660
 a fact is fundamental is who knows the manufacturer from the beginning 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.470
 of the balance 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.480
 the sensitivity the Japanese manufacturer what manages their pressure levels 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.369
 sound 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.920
 and of course it's leaving all the data 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.480
 compare give us to us the approximate power range that requires a 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.300
 day that the general manufacturer says duarte speaker for 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.359
 204 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.329
 It is true 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.329
 a rough power says good a peak power 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.820
 of them 104 a power program 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.870
 poverty program should be the continuous power that is banking 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.420
 the mood and talent 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 and well for a hundred down there would be no problem 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.100
 the sound pressure level that is measured dv 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 the manufacturer then 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.160
 oaxaca the power formula 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.450
 which is equal to the return of the square on resistance 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.370
 this percent 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.370
 the to acquire a power glove 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.980
 the manufacturer administers two points the type of funds squared 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.880
 about leisure and this builds up your power 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.190
 this value 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.890
 Christ points and three bonuses this current that go poster located the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.000
 speaker for 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.560
 they would be handled 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.650
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.140
 and then success 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.790
 it is handled with a range of sensitivities the range of sensitivity 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.790
 of the total unemployed of more than 86 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.439
 92 dv 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.400
 maybe from cybele 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.860
 this range 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.300
 needs to 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.890
 of different powers to be administered 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.670
 below 86 should be considered 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.260
 pa'lante with little sensitivity 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.009
 i above 29 ocean 23 and up 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.800
 they are conserved of very good sensitivity 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.609
 and of course with the power goes hand in hand with this 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.180
 the range in which we move between the sensitivities do not go well differently 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.599
 resulting power 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.899
 yes we have a 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:19.109
 a speaker 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.409
 with saenz punch 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.399
 d 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.830
 from that day the passage of the state 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.289
 Power of 10 100 more 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.819
 let's go here a 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.769
 Volume English 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.489
 now every three since we go sensitivity we will need 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.209
 the power visit because the volume 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.189
 then a speaker of 89 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.089
 us with only 50 hours 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.679
 We will have the same volume as before 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:49.939
 this volume 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.369
 the criminals 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.059
 that bread pretends to follow 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.929
 what if 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.640
 we also go up 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.269
 3 the most famous 92 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.360
 only 25 years old 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.239
 We will have the same volume as before 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.099
 is hypocritical like 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.859
 the power value 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.689
 it was decreasing we welcomed then the speaker 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.349
 the issue of death what arises first time the question is good let's make oxfam 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.340
 burned your purchase touches keep 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.020
 steers from bel air onwards the theme is that the block segares and silvia 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.359
 lose fidelity 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.420
 a speaker of high sensitivity testing much more inaccurate 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.370
 the first of them plunged from the range 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.949
 of sound that can play 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.509
 nole frequency but there is fidelity the compact costs something more 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:40.729
 rudimentary 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:46.819
 the speakers leaving the deceased obbio room com that you lower sensibilities 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.609
 By the way, you have a much richer sound 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.639
 i wolf 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.309
 eye that only the blackboard destined to musical aciÃ³n to recitales 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.819
 edilicia this I write things that I need is very high 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.279
 to be able to administer 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.059
 the 100 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:04.709
 the power 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.059
 so 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.919
 let's suppose that we have 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.439
 summarizing be this we do 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.679
 a parenthesis what we can do is that we're going to see the other 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:18.309
 I ovidio the subject him although 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.719
 the amplifier delivers nothing deep 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.110
 vicente recalled that women present 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.889
 a speaker 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.569
 we always exist 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.090
 better that we have more support will be that 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.590
 request the speaker 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.809
 Per hundred if we want 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.729
 a couple of the lakes region 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.169
 she making sound with 25 if we can fight 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.949
 double the power better is to say that if we can have a slump 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.150
 that the manufacturer tells us that there are 304 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.699
 if we can put it to a power that is 604 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:59.349
 better because the fall in demand raise the province will be much 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:00.279
 more stable 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.279
 that an example of 200 is forced 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.180
 200 guards 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.250
 is a power that will impact required we will telecable a lot of volume 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.110
 savastano with level of these are important then the speaker 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.960
 percent and it will be done from the mobile to a poor signal and that yes what 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.809
 can burn 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:20.990
 a high power 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.550
 you'll take care of him speaking new ambition oath and maggiolo place accuse but 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.039
 burning assured that it will not be called silva 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.479
 somehow 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.639
 to move many more but it will not be 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.080
 if you run the risk of burning an equal or lower power 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.330
 we always need at least 40 percent more power what we 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.490
 indicates the manufacturer if the manufacturer says that he hit 300 bullets not 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.379
 we have a power of 100 or 200 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.059
 not even little of 300 minimum more love for the power of 500 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:57.900
 up cited cold province handle one power per hundred 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.900
 five more months receives a signal 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.770
 percent 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.260
 so the cured with nothing condal 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.650
 without cutting without it requiring some alarte 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.949
 by another video 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.099
 what are the causes when an amplifier cuts the wave that 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.710
 surely it was used 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.350
 harmonic distortion like luke strap has the front the same as I felt 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.969
 the light difficult to know it is also important that we have all seen 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.050
 ever 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.190
 but the next video
