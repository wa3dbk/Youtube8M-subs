up<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.510> whole<00:05:01.780> area<00:05:02.500> turns<00:05:02.830> into<00:05:03.070> like

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
up and this whole area turns into like

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.570 
up and this whole area turns into like
fucking<00:05:03.670> lava<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:04.330> it's<00:05:04.450> crazy<00:05:04.900> shit<00:05:05.500> so<00:05:06.220> it's

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
fucking lava and it's crazy shit so it's

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.070 
fucking lava and it's crazy shit so it's
really<00:05:06.820> really<00:05:07.180> cool<00:05:07.360> but<00:05:07.510> it's<00:05:07.660> super

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
really really cool but it's super

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.300 
really really cool but it's super
important<00:05:08.440> because<00:05:08.470> when<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:08.890> get<00:05:08.980> the<00:05:09.130> fire

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
important because when you get the fire

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.580 
important because when you get the fire
giant<00:05:09.990> obviously<00:05:10.990> you<00:05:11.080> get<00:05:11.200> that<00:05:11.350> initial

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
giant obviously you get that initial

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.070 
giant obviously you get that initial
buff<00:05:11.920> but<00:05:12.160> on<00:05:12.280> top<00:05:12.670> of<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.570> actually<00:05:13.750> do

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
buff but on top of that you actually do

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.350 
buff but on top of that you actually do
more<00:05:14.320> damage<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:15.070> towers<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.790> everything

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
more damage to towers and everything

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.960 
more damage to towers and everything
else<00:05:16.540> so<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:17.170> can<00:05:17.620> really<00:05:18.190> start<00:05:18.640> to<00:05:18.760> see<00:05:18.940> a

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
else so you can really start to see a

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.760 
else so you can really start to see a
team<00:05:19.240> control<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.840> game<00:05:20.020> just<00:05:20.200> by<00:05:20.350> acquiring

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
team control the game just by acquiring

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.160 
team control the game just by acquiring
the<00:05:21.100> fire<00:05:21.340> giant<00:05:21.820> so<00:05:21.970> it's<00:05:22.360> really<00:05:22.660> really<00:05:22.990> big

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
the fire giant so it's really really big

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.770 
the fire giant so it's really really big
now<00:05:23.380> at<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.520> most<00:05:24.730> simplistic<00:05:25.330> level

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780

every turret and you take down the
Phoenix's<00:06:22.270> he's<00:06:22.600> a<00:06:22.630> lot<00:06:22.870> easier<00:06:23.170> to<00:06:23.470> kill<00:06:23.770> now

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
Phoenix's he's a lot easier to kill now

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.770

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
other than that we're going to go ahead

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.020 
other than that we're going to go ahead
and<00:06:25.990> just<00:06:26.590> watch<00:06:26.830> a<00:06:26.950> little<00:06:27.220> bit<00:06:27.460> of<00:06:27.580> game<00:06:27.760> play

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
and just watch a little bit of game play

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.400 
and just watch a little bit of game play
here<00:06:28.360> as<00:06:29.880> we<00:06:30.880> can<00:06:31.330> basically<00:06:31.570> get<00:06:31.870> a<00:06:31.900> feel<00:06:32.140> for

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
here as we can basically get a feel for

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.380 
here as we can basically get a feel for
it<00:06:32.440> so<00:06:32.620> Thor<00:06:33.250> like<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.640> said<00:06:33.850> one<00:06:34.000> of<00:06:34.030> the<00:06:34.150> first

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
it so Thor like I said one of the first

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.940
