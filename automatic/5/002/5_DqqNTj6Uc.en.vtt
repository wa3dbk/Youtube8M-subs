00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
children with learning differences we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.700 
children with learning differences we
started<00:01:14.340> building<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.759> school<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:16.409> sure

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
started building a school to make sure

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.600 
kids who aren't motivated to go to
college<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:22.170> when<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.890> start<00:01:22.950> with

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
college and I think when you start with

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990 
college and I think when you start with
an<00:01:23.789> idea<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.009> then<00:01:26.009> everything<00:01:26.520> lead

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
an idea like that then everything lead

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
an idea like that then everything lead
you<00:01:27.149> in<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.420> direction<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:32.159> know

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
you in that direction and then you know

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.469 
you in that direction and then you know
that<00:01:32.700> first<00:01:32.970> class<00:01:33.179> graduated<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.259> was

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
that first class graduated and that was

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.309 
that first class graduated and that was
unbelievable<00:01:37.909> these<00:01:38.909> were<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.299> kids<00:01:39.630> who

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
unbelievable these were all kids who

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.949 
unbelievable these were all kids who
came<00:01:40.619> from<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.640> difficult<00:01:41.970> family

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
came from very difficult family

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.039 
came from very difficult family
situations<00:01:43.890> who<00:01:44.310> had<00:01:44.729> no<00:01:45.000> thought<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.869> going

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
situations who had no thought of going

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.199 
situations who had no thought of going
to<00:01:46.229> college<00:01:46.440> when<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.429> came<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.759> high<00:01:47.880> school

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
to college when they came to high school

00:01:48.209 --> 00:02:00.770 
to college when they came to high school
and<00:01:48.479> they<00:01:49.170> were<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.709> to<00:01:49.799> college

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.460 

one<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.049> false<00:02:02.320> dichotomies<00:02:03.250> in

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
one of the false dichotomies in

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.010 
one of the false dichotomies in
education<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:06.509> between<00:02:07.509> equity<00:02:07.900> and

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
education is between equity and

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.070 
education is between equity and
excellence<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:09.330> some<00:02:10.330> people<00:02:10.630> think<00:02:10.929> you

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
excellence and some people think you

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.120 
excellence and some people think you
can't<00:02:11.319> have<00:02:11.560> both

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
can't have both

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.620 
can't have both
I<00:02:13.290> think<00:02:14.290> places<00:02:14.709> like<00:02:14.890> Gateway<00:02:15.630> demonstrate

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
I think places like Gateway demonstrate

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.530 
I think places like Gateway demonstrate
that<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.290> actually<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.950> have<00:02:18.220> both

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.819
