reaching for the okay uh brown sugar it
looks<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:25.340> yes<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.700> since<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
looks like yes and since this is a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.569 
looks like yes and since this is a
reduced<00:01:28.259> portion<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.340> pure

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
to go to light on the sugar for sure but

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.420 
to go to light on the sugar for sure but
of<00:01:39.360> course<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.900> is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
of course this is

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.640 
of course this is
as<00:01:41.730> well<00:01:42.030> an<00:01:42.360> estimate<00:01:42.900> but<00:01:43.080> just<00:01:43.320> kind<00:01:43.590> of

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
as well an estimate but just kind of

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.290 
as well an estimate but just kind of
going<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:44.010> is<00:01:44.160> 50<00:01:44.460> years<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.760> research<00:01:45.060> here

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
going this is 50 years of research here

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.300 
going this is 50 years of research here
it's<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:46.290> eat<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:46.770> seems<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.190> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it's not it's eat what seems to the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.500 
it's not it's eat what seems to the
uninitiated<00:01:47.700> well<00:01:48.480> we<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.110> emptied<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> out

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
liquid here I guess it would be a mill
