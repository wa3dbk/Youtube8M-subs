00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello today we will you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.250
 propose to caramel liquid 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.370
 how to make a liquid caramel then 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.000
 for these we need three things 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.529
 firstly 125 g of sugar 10 grams 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.990
 of water and 70 g of lemon juice 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.619
 so I'll first put my sugar 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.240
 in a pot 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.380
 here I add the water you see there 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.750
 really has very little compared 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.620
 at sugar so here I am going to do 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.070
 caramelize 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.440
 this mixture of sugar and water so we go 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.510
 do not blush too much either because 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760
 that after he is going to have bitterness and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.010
 once this caramel is going to be blond we 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.960
 will add our lemon juice and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.329
 the advantage that the acidity of the juice of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.079
 lemon will be able to leave the caramel 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.000
 liquid 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.550
 he's not going thick syria is not going 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 harden by cooling so there we go 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.399
 put our sugar to caramelize 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.710
 you see there the sugar started to 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.270
 blondir a little bit a thing that is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.610
 very important when you make a caramel 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 like that we do not put any 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.720
 metallic materials in the pan 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.240
 because otherwise the sugar will harden it goes 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.920
 what is called mass and therefore we stir 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.090
 just the pan like these 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.570
 have but no external element to the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.330
 pan to prevent that from being like 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.759
 these one leaves colored so there we see 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.460
 that those on that side started well 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.820
 golden then we mix it here in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.299
 turning the pan like that with the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.040
 hand so we'll let them color 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.240
 still a little bit because there is 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.920
 a little bit clear still to my 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.520
 taste it's good it's perfect 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.119
 so what are we going to do now we have 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.140
 our caramel is the right color and 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.140
 we will pour the lemon juice 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.670
 we can put a little whip now 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.500
 it does not affect well for 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.570
 Mix everything is left to melt their 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.820
 the small pieces of caramel that are 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.320
 on the wind of the pan 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.480
 so you see this caramel and well well 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.460
 liquid and so can after now 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.010
 use it either to put those of 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.320
 games with snow or decoration on 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.000
 desserts for a plate then you 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.710
 put to keep it in a pot at 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.710
 fridge and it keeps very very well
