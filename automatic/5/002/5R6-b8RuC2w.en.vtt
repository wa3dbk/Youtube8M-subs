I've<00:01:30.690> worked<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.080> clients<00:01:31.380> before<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
I've worked with my clients before so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.940 
I've worked with my clients before so
they<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:33.090> me<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.480> trust<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:33.990> 110<00:01:34.560> percent

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
they know me they trust me 110 percent

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.890 
they know me they trust me 110 percent
but<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.730> very<00:01:35.910> hard<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.300> them<00:01:36.660> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
but it was very very hard for them to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200 
but it was very very hard for them to
just<00:01:37.080> visualize<00:01:37.430> how<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.640> finished<00:01:39.000> space

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
just visualize how this finished space

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.660 
just visualize how this finished space
was<00:01:39.690> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.110> look<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.560> wasn't<00:01:40.890> until<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
was going to look it wasn't until the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.640 
was going to look it wasn't until the
space<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.180> farmed<00:01:42.810> where<00:01:43.260> I<00:01:43.290> think

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
space was actually farmed where I think

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.440 
space was actually farmed where I think
they<00:01:43.770> both<00:01:43.950> took<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.610> big<00:01:44.970> science<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
they both took like a big science that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
they both took like a big science that
went<00:01:45.720> okay<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> mrs.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
went okay you're right this is mrs.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.040 
went okay you're right this is mrs.
fibrous<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.150> that's<00:01:48.420> actually<00:01:48.570> turned<00:01:48.900> out

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
fibrous and that's actually turned out

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.960 
fibrous and that's actually turned out
to<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.260> bigger<00:01:49.620> than<00:01:49.830> they<00:01:49.950> expected<00:01:50.460> there's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
to be bigger than they expected there's

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.220 
to be bigger than they expected there's
something<00:01:51.180> quite<00:01:51.360> magical<00:01:51.510> about<00:01:51.990> third

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
something quite magical about third

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.560 
something quite magical about third
floors<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:53.100> almost<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> tree<00:01:54.000> house<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
floors it's almost like a tree house and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.480 
floors it's almost like a tree house and
the<00:01:54.630> fact<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.230> predominantly<00:01:55.500> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the fact that this is predominantly you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.230 
the fact that this is predominantly you
know<00:01:56.550> child<00:01:56.910> space<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.720> great
