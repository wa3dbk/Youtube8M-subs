00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.429
 Hello and welcome today 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.940
 at 40 and I'll show you 1 40 now 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.680
 trees of us and this 40 exist 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.240
 the aphids have some illness 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.160
 varieties are very sensitive to and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 this particular is here or small 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.550
 Fruity last year was also good 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.830
 Now the question is what can we do 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.179
 On the other hand, it makes this disease 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.009
 not completely over the whole tree 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.559
 house prepares so remove all 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 leaves happy now those dreams 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.760
 have disease and discard the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.309
 Of course, in the garbage so come 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.700
 Now do not garden again then in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.399
 the garbage 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.539
 that's what the tree is all about 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.190
 as I said, not too much 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.079
 Brighton is usually so in the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.250
 Run the year the tree recovers 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.199
 he also did last year and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.969
 we have to watch that one now 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.160
 regularly thin and not too moist 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.230
 So do not hold completely stand there 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.699
 constantly as did not notice and 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.469
 what we can do we can use 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.229
 leaf fertilizer she stays younger the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.540
 provide the leaves directly and thereby 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.670
 When the plants take care of the leaves 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.350
 much less sensitive to these 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.820
 illness and that makes me too 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.689
 regularly a year so we have now 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.390
 another phenomenon here and that here 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.650
 that 's a little tree and me 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.210
 Last year when I had the fruits 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.310
 Of course, they also have harvested 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.500
 I have eaten the change egger 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.970
 just completely complete the way he was in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.220
 just put the ground 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.740
 for the sake of interest, to see if it is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.530
 what will we see you again 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.030
 the 40-child actually grew up so 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.799
 That surprised me then 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.210
 now there was a mild winter was 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.560
 not very cold when in between times 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.240
 minus ten degrees but only for one 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.439
 day or so and otherwise it was 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.329
 actually right with these winter ones 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.470
 So that's what we think 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.470
 maybe every year but work 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.470
 Definitely worth a try 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.290
 So by the way, the new must from 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.590
 location 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.720
 We had a replacement recently 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.280
 taken from the four here and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.470
 have then made a new replacement 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.420
 make us this 40 bit further 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.520
 can multiply and wait there of course 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.350
 now until autumn and look like that 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.580
 whole looks and then only in advance 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.080
 Spring again decreased like the one 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.640
 the one we had taken off now 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.980
 also is a wintering off 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.200
 stayed and the plant also stood 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.940
 outside so for info 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.770
 she was not protected in it somehow 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.110
 and the city really sunny outside 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.080
 Of course, but otherwise stop outside 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.340
 and it worked in saxony 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.810
 Now almost forgot this little one 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.490
 little trees here they want a lot 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.260
 Of course you can leave that in your head 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.570
 next year to spring and in the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.160
 spring before planting the plantlet 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.110
 then get out and then he gets one 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.940
 Of course, your own pot will also be 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.830
 This year again like in the ground 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.160
 stuck when we harvested the Frisian 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.270
 're so many banks now from 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.220
 not very fancy though 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.180
 Nevertheless, neither recover in the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.590
 Run the summer show up 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.820
 in between times and how 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.140
 we're going to take care of that now 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.150
 leaf also with nutrients is whole 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.220
 important and there are preparations 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.440
 silica and silicic acid 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.970
 strengthens the cells of the plants so will 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.830
 You have to look again if you look 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.200
 namely products worried if there too 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.700
 Silicic acid in it says strengthens the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.980
 cells of the plants, in particular 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.270
 the leaves and that's how we do it 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.580
 a whole bit of support 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.660
 We get this disease completely away 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.130
 not that is just as said at 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.320
 Some varieties of one are provided 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.940
 very sensitive but as I said 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.709
 this is recovering during the summer 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.180
 whole usually and then we can 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.340
 even the fruit crops have last 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.060
 year at least not very good things 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.890
 that it will be this year again 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.300
 works so we now one 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.769
 small clip I hope you have the 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.269
 Small movie fell and see you 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.530
 least of all movies again in the 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.530
 this year detlef roman
