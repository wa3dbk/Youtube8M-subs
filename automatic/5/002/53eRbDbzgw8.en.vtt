00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
can do better this year I remember last

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.960 
can do better this year I remember last
year<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.500> know<00:01:27.530> money<00:01:27.799> was<00:01:28.340> no<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.850> year

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
year you know money was no the year

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.370 
year you know money was no the year
before<00:01:29.090> Sarah<00:01:29.479> money<00:01:29.659> with<00:01:29.900> his<00:01:30.020> breakaway

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
before Sarah money with his breakaway

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.660 
before Sarah money with his breakaway
try<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:32.780> was<00:01:32.900> big<00:01:33.110> for<00:01:33.290> us<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.280> know<00:01:34.310> we

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
try that was big for us and you know we

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.010 
try that was big for us and you know we
don't<00:01:34.820> he<00:01:34.939> just<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.240> come<00:01:35.450> together<00:01:35.689> as<00:01:35.990> a

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
don't he just to come together as a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.170 
don't he just to come together as a
squad<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.619> think<00:01:36.860> that<00:01:37.400> was<00:01:37.490> maybe<00:01:38.060> a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
squad and I think that was maybe a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.850 
squad and I think that was maybe a
couple<00:01:38.420> games<00:01:38.659> in<00:01:38.900> Stewart<00:01:39.320> had<00:01:39.409> taken<00:01:39.740> over

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
couple games in Stewart had taken over

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.789 
couple games in Stewart had taken over
