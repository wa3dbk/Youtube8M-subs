 of the Dutch national team 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.770
 of course a bit unexpected 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.380
 was just a long time ago 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.010
 from past weeks that I think I'm fine 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.809

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.890
 Tuesday from the reserve bank 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.989

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.739

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.719
 Maya is where already said to each other that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.960
 between god and dordrecht those who 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 yes so far we have it in everyone 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.860
 so hoping for those six points 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.810
 that it will be 9 tomorrow 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.400

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.580

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.080
 a special honor today 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.880
 Saturday namely the captain's armband 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.329
 more against dordrecht weather i have too 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 have no idea your trainer should ask 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.490
 i have i am not tea 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.710
 We have not yet heard so 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 longer off but I do not go out and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.080
 if it is so beautiful and if not then 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.150
 I'm just going to play like 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.860
 like I really wanted to come up 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.970
 titles succeeded for boilers 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.130
 maybe not the entire game 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.830
 but there was under his command 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.660
 a strong first half hour played with 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.220
 ippies last week against go it was to 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.930
 put pressure quickly 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.700
 she fasted fast to make that goal 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.200
 and build on that 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.090
 must we can copy one to one to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.670
 tomorrow I think or not 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.390
 very happy in your case the first 25 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.060
 minutes or so I thought we were whole 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.830
 sharp started a strong stuff and had 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.780
 actually two or three more goals 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.640
 have to make and then the rest was done 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.739
 walked and that's just we want 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.080
 would like to show so definitely at home 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.730
 that nothing here is to get the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.340
 stomp the for and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.190
 and that we get the match as soon as possible 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.750
 yes kilos as they say and then it becomes 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.430
 it makes it a little easier for that 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.739
 yourself and then you can do a bit 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.269
 play your position game more calmly and 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.860
 wait for the opponent then to 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.320
 must come forward then you still get 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.720
 more spaces in between like that tomorrow 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.580
 then that is very beautiful but it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.630
 needs 90 minutes then another 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.209
 match animals that must be won 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.709
 and yes we indeed want one 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.380
 good start and 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.940
 well to certainly also in its own bbc arena 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.239
 required to win a took of from 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.239
 dordrecht
