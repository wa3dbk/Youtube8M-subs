you<00:00:00.359> can<00:00:00.480> see<00:00:00.659> here<00:00:00.900> we<00:00:01.050> come<00:00:01.260> up<00:00:01.469> we<00:00:02.100> run<00:00:02.280> it

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
you can see here we come up we run it

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.820 
you can see here we come up we run it
out<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.700> split<00:00:03.060> it<00:00:03.210> so<00:00:03.899> that<00:00:04.080> distributes<00:00:04.740> a

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
out we split it so that distributes a

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.440 
out we split it so that distributes a
little<00:00:05.009> bit<00:00:05.130> more<00:00:05.279> evenly<00:00:05.609> there<00:00:06.180> are<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> lot

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
little bit more evenly there are a lot

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.760 
little bit more evenly there are a lot
of<00:00:06.480> different<00:00:06.810> ways<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:06.960> can<00:00:07.200> configure<00:00:07.529> your

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
of different ways you can configure your

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.820 
of different ways you can configure your
towers<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:09.000> advocate<00:00:09.510> an<00:00:09.690> inground<00:00:10.380> sub

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
towers and we advocate an inground sub

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.140 
towers and we advocate an inground sub
tank<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.340> your<00:00:11.519> towers<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.059> at

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
tank so that your towers can be at

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.610 
tank so that your towers can be at
ground<00:00:12.389> level<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.960> don't<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.440> hang

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
ground level and you don't have to hang

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.039 
ground level and you don't have to hang
them<00:00:13.860> directly<00:00:14.280> over<00:00:14.580> your<00:00:14.700> tanks

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
them directly over your tanks

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.779 
them directly over your tanks
it<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.710> makes<00:00:16.859> working<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.400> them<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> lot

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
it just makes working on them a lot

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.340 
it just makes working on them a lot
easier<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.210> works<00:00:18.359> deal<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.930> makes<00:00:19.080> dealing

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
easier it works deal it makes dealing

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.170 
easier it works deal it makes dealing
with<00:00:19.619> them<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:19.980> easier<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.520> makes<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
with them a lot easier and makes it a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.050 
with them a lot easier and makes it a
lot<00:00:21.330> simpler<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.890> to<00:00:22.890> remove<00:00:23.460> them<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.910> put

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
lot simpler to to remove them and put

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450 
lot simpler to to remove them and put
them<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.840> also<00:00:24.990> makes<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.859> easier<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> put

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
them in it also makes it easier to put

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.019 
them in it also makes it easier to put
together<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.970> drainage<00:00:27.390> system<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:29.029> makes

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
together your drainage system and makes

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
together your drainage system and makes
it<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.300> inexpensive<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.230> so

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
it really inexpensive to do so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.160 
it really inexpensive to do so
so<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> racks<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.630> typically

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
so the racks that we use are typically

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.889 
so the racks that we use are typically
made<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.710> two<00:00:35.370> by<00:00:35.550> fours<00:00:35.850> when<00:00:36.149> we're<00:00:36.329> when

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
made out of two by fours when we're when

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.069 
made out of two by fours when we're when
we're<00:00:37.050> operating<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.680> ground<00:00:37.980> level<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
we're operating on ground level and

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.780 
we're operating on ground level and
we've<00:00:40.079> got<00:00:40.260> basically<00:00:40.710> two<00:00:41.040> two<00:00:41.340> by<00:00:41.489> fours

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
we've got basically two two by fours

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.010 
we've got basically two two by fours
running<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> length<00:00:42.300> these<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.809> five

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
running the length these are five

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.479 
running the length these are five
footers<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.860> take<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> ten-foot

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
footers so you just take a ten-foot

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.600 
footers so you just take a ten-foot
two-by-four<00:00:45.030> hack<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.989> half<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.610> we

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
two-by-four hack it in half and we

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
two-by-four hack it in half and we
usually<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> two<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> half<00:00:48.629> foot<00:00:48.930> span

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
usually have a two and a half foot span

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.130 
usually have a two and a half foot span
here<00:00:50.039> cut<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> screw<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> riser

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
here cut and screw it in to the riser

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
here cut and screw it in to the riser
the<00:00:52.860> riser<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.309> about<00:00:53.550> five<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> half<00:00:54.090> feet

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the riser is about five and a half feet

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
the riser is about five and a half feet
tall<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> very<00:00:55.500> top<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:56.039> drill<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.520> hole

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
tall and at the very top we drill a hole

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
tall and at the very top we drill a hole
and<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.149> pound<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.570> one-inch<00:00:58.020> electrical

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
and we pound a one-inch electrical

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.850 
and we pound a one-inch electrical
conduit<00:01:00.680> tube<00:01:01.680> through<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.609> essentially<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
conduit tube through it essentially and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.130 
conduit tube through it essentially and
so<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.979> use<00:01:05.159> full<00:01:05.580> ten<00:01:05.850> foot<00:01:06.090> lengths<00:01:06.479> conduit

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
so we use full ten foot lengths conduit

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
so we use full ten foot lengths conduit
one<00:01:07.470> inch<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.850> section<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:09.720> we'll

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
one inch on one section and then we'll

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
one inch on one section and then we'll
slide<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> three-quarter<00:01:10.860> inch<00:01:10.909> section<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
slide a three-quarter inch section of

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
slide a three-quarter inch section of
conduit<00:01:12.390> into<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> end<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
conduit into the end of it and do the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.399 
conduit into the end of it and do the
next<00:01:13.770> rack<00:01:14.010> three-quarter<00:01:14.580> inch<00:01:14.700> conduit<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
next rack three-quarter inch conduit and

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.510 
next rack three-quarter inch conduit and
we'll<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> rack<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.400> bit

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
we'll just do that rack a little bit

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
we'll just do that rack a little bit
shorter<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.630> links<00:01:18.900> everything

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
shorter and it kind of links everything

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.420 
shorter and it kind of links everything
together<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.799> locks<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.250> together

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
together and locks it all together

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
together and locks it all together
nicely<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.659> still<00:01:21.840> something<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.409> know

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
nicely but it's still something you know

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.920 
nicely but it's still something you know
that<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.950> remove<00:01:23.220> when<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:25.700> the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
that we can remove when we have to the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.880 
that we can remove when we have to the
bars<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.799> towers<00:01:29.340> hang<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.820> then

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
bars that the towers hang from then

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.249 
bars that the towers hang from then
basically<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.009> rest<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.610> top<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
basically just rest on top of that

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.670 
basically just rest on top of that
conduit<00:01:34.259> pipe<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.380> run<00:01:37.530> our

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
conduit pipe and you can see we run our

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.429 
conduit pipe and you can see we run our
black<00:01:37.890> poly<00:01:38.189> them<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.060> underside<00:01:39.540> lots<00:01:40.290> of

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
black poly them on the underside lots of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.350 
black poly them on the underside lots of
this<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.790> pretty<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.150> we

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this you know it's not pretty but we

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.730 
this you know it's not pretty but we
just<00:01:42.570> zip<00:01:42.720> tie<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.960> together<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.560> it's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
just zip tie it together because it's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.649 
just zip tie it together because it's
really<00:01:43.890> inexpensive<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.790> use<00:01:44.909> wire<00:01:45.149> zip

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
really inexpensive you can use wire zip

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.929 
really inexpensive you can use wire zip
ties<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.549> fancy<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
ties if you really want to get fancy and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.910 
ties if you really want to get fancy and
use<00:01:48.090> conduit<00:01:48.479> clamps<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.380> too

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
use conduit clamps you can do that too

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770 
use conduit clamps you can do that too
but<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.460> found<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.939> these<00:01:51.420> things<00:01:51.630> really

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
but we found that these things really

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.499 
but we found that these things really
don't<00:01:52.170> move<00:01:52.350> once<00:01:52.649> they're<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:52.920> place<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.509> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
don't move once they're in place and you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
don't move once they're in place and you
know<00:01:54.600> zip<00:01:55.290> ties<00:01:55.500> work<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.009> fine<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.520> they're

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
know zip ties work just fine and they're

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.660 
know zip ties work just fine and they're
cheap<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.299> irrigate<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.469> towers<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
cheap to irrigate these towers we have a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.510 
cheap to irrigate these towers we have a
one<00:02:00.000> inch<00:02:00.259> feed<00:02:01.259> line<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.250> kind<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
one inch feed line so this is kind of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.870 
one inch feed line so this is kind of
our<00:02:02.640> main<00:02:03.329> feed<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.409> runs<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.460> length<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
our main feed that runs the length of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.510 
our main feed that runs the length of
the<00:02:06.000> greenhouse<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:07.680> really<00:02:07.979> long<00:02:08.160> runs

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the greenhouse and for really long runs

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.389 
the greenhouse and for really long runs
we'll<00:02:08.759> hack<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.149> cut<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.690> half

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
we'll hack it cut it in half

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.550 
we'll hack it cut it in half
and<00:02:10.489> we'll<00:02:10.759> do<00:02:10.970> two<00:02:11.450> lines<00:02:11.780> off<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.379> main

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
and we'll do two lines off of the main

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.440 
and we'll do two lines off of the main
pump<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.489> make<00:02:13.640> sure<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.909> we<00:02:14.030> maintain<00:02:14.420> our

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
pump to make sure that we maintain our

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.270 
pump to make sure that we maintain our
pressure<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.049> we<00:02:15.170> don't<00:02:15.319> have<00:02:15.530> lower

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
pressure that we don't have lower

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.100 
pressure that we don't have lower
pressure<00:02:16.580> at<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.909> very<00:02:17.120> end<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.569> higher

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
pressure at the very end and higher

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.960 
pressure at the very end and higher
pressure<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:20.000> know<00:02:20.120> closer<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.840> pump<00:02:21.049> and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
pressure you know closer to the pump and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.250 
pressure you know closer to the pump and
essentially<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.060> just<00:02:23.090> tee<00:02:23.390> off<00:02:23.569> of<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:23.959> line

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
essentially we just tee off of this line

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.569 
essentially we just tee off of this line
and<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:25.670> see<00:02:25.849> here<00:02:26.060> we<00:02:26.150> use<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.420> expensive

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
and you see here we use the expensive

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.550 
and you see here we use the expensive
hose<00:02:28.579> clamps<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.659> guys<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:30.110> use<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
hose clamps you guys can use just the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.680 
hose clamps you guys can use just the
crimp<00:02:30.860> style<00:02:31.099> hose<00:02:31.340> clamps<00:02:31.730> if<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:32.000> want<00:02:32.209> or

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
crimp style hose clamps if you want or

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.630 
crimp style hose clamps if you want or
if<00:02:32.989> you're<00:02:33.290> not<00:02:33.769> running<00:02:34.159> a<00:02:34.250> whole<00:02:34.430> lot<00:02:34.610> of

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
if you're not running a whole lot of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.860 
if you're not running a whole lot of
pressure<00:02:34.909> you<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.299> just<00:02:35.450> use<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.599> heat<00:02:35.840> gun

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
pressure you can just use a heat gun

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.920 
pressure you can just use a heat gun
essentially<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.860> put<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:38.150> poly<00:02:38.390> pipe<00:02:38.659> on

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
essentially to put the the poly pipe on

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.289 
essentially to put the the poly pipe on
the<00:02:39.049> barbed<00:02:39.260> fittings<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:40.159> this<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:41.000> poly

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
the barbed fittings but this this poly

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.720 
the barbed fittings but this this poly
tubing<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.959> really<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.500> cheapest<00:02:43.190> way<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.430> go

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
tubing is really the cheapest way to go

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.630 
tubing is really the cheapest way to go
it's<00:02:44.329> really<00:02:44.599> inexpensive<00:02:45.019> stuff<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.370> we<00:02:46.489> just

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
it's really inexpensive stuff so we just

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.550 
it's really inexpensive stuff so we just
tee<00:02:46.819> off<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.209> there<00:02:47.359> you<00:02:47.780> can<00:02:47.930> see<00:02:48.079> we<00:02:48.230> run<00:02:48.410> our

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
tee off of there you can see we run our

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.599 
tee off of there you can see we run our
half-inch<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.760> little<00:02:50.359> feed<00:02:50.569> line<00:02:50.780> up<00:02:51.609> every

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
half-inch a little feed line up every

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.580 
half-inch a little feed line up every
little<00:02:52.970> zone<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.660> we<00:02:53.810> create<00:02:54.170> we<00:02:54.379> put<00:02:54.560> a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
little zone that we create we put a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.619 
little zone that we create we put a
valve<00:02:54.859> on<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.730> allows<00:02:56.000> us<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.239> change

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
valve on and this allows us to change

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.589 
valve on and this allows us to change
the<00:02:57.109> pressure<00:02:57.319> on<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.950> zone<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.569> choke<00:02:59.569> it

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
the pressure on the zone and choke it

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.539 
the pressure on the zone and choke it
down<00:02:59.750> or<00:03:00.109> give<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.409> more<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:01.099> nice<00:03:01.250> thing<00:03:01.519> is

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
down or give it more the nice thing is

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.160 
down or give it more the nice thing is
we<00:03:01.879> can<00:03:01.909> crank<00:03:02.329> this<00:03:02.510> all<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> way<00:03:02.900> up<00:03:03.019> and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
we can crank this all the way up and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.599 
we can crank this all the way up and
blow<00:03:03.440> everything<00:03:03.769> out<00:03:04.040> because<00:03:04.310> we've<00:03:04.459> got

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
blow everything out because we've got

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.059 
blow everything out because we've got
really<00:03:04.819> high<00:03:05.180> pressure<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:06.560> it's<00:03:06.709> kind<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.980> a

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
really high pressure so it's kind of a

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.470 
really high pressure so it's kind of a
nice<00:03:07.220> way<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.459> clean<00:03:07.760> everything<00:03:08.150> out<00:03:08.239> from

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
nice way to clean everything out from

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.339 
nice way to clean everything out from
time<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.870> time<00:03:09.340> we<00:03:10.340> run<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.640> up<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:11.030> an<00:03:11.870> L<00:03:12.079> and

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
time to time we run it up to an L and

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.039 
time to time we run it up to an L and
this<00:03:13.190> particular<00:03:13.549> one<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.599> straight

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
this particular one is a straight

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.839 
this particular one is a straight
configuration<00:03:15.859> a<00:03:15.980> lot<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.340> times<00:03:16.579> we<00:03:16.730> will

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
configuration a lot of the times we will

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.309 
configuration a lot of the times we will
actually<00:03:16.970> run<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.419> pipe<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:17.989> center<00:03:18.230> of

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
actually run this pipe to the center of

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.629 
actually run this pipe to the center of
the<00:03:18.440> mass<00:03:18.620> T<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.519> again<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.090> then<00:03:20.630> kind<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.639> you

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
the mass T it again and then kind of you

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.089 
the mass T it again and then kind of you
know<00:03:22.760> spread<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.870> out<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.319> these<00:03:24.470> other<00:03:24.769> lines

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
know spread it out to these other lines

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.720 
know spread it out to these other lines
evenly<00:03:25.849> put<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> tee<00:03:27.079> in<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.500> then<00:03:27.829> run<00:03:28.700> a

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
evenly put a tee in and then run a

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.940 
evenly put a tee in and then run a
length<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.389> either<00:03:29.660> side<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.109> tee<00:03:30.410> put

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
length on either side of that tee put

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.409 
length on either side of that tee put
other<00:03:31.129> tees<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.519> I'll<00:03:31.669> show<00:03:31.849> it<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.120> over

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
other tees in I'll show it to you over

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.479 
other tees in I'll show it to you over
here<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:33.260> one<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.530> basically<00:03:33.919> just<00:03:34.220> a

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
here this one is basically just a

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.860 
here this one is basically just a
straight<00:03:34.790> configuration<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.690> we're

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
straight configuration that we're

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.420 
straight configuration that we're
experimenting<00:03:36.290> with<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.739> see<00:03:36.889> if<00:03:36.919> it's<00:03:37.129> easier

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
experimenting with to see if it's easier

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.890 
experimenting with to see if it's easier
because<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:37.730> saves<00:03:37.940> us<00:03:38.090> on<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.269> couple<00:03:38.569> of<00:03:38.629> parts

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
because it saves us on a couple of parts

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.210 
because it saves us on a couple of parts
and<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.440> little<00:03:39.620> bit<00:03:39.739> easier<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.010> put

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
and it's a little bit easier to put

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.819 
and it's a little bit easier to put
together<00:03:40.599> so<00:03:41.599> far<00:03:41.810> it's<00:03:41.989> it's<00:03:42.410> working<00:03:42.799> just

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
together so far it's it's working just

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.439 
together so far it's it's working just
fine<00:03:43.190> this<00:03:43.699> way<00:03:43.879> as<00:03:44.030> well

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
fine this way as well

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.409 
fine this way as well
well<00:03:44.930> tee<00:03:45.109> off<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.680> line<00:03:46.400> here<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.269> we'll

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
well tee off of this line here and we'll

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.809 
well tee off of this line here and we'll
run<00:03:47.629> these<00:03:47.810> lines<00:03:48.169> along<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.069> bottoms<00:03:49.579> of<00:03:49.730> our

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
run these lines along the bottoms of our

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.460 
run these lines along the bottoms of our
conduits<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.660> can<00:03:50.810> see<00:03:50.959> these<00:03:51.139> are<00:03:51.319> just

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
conduits and you can see these are just

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.099 
conduits and you can see these are just
zip<00:03:51.650> tied<00:03:51.829> up<00:03:51.980> here<00:03:52.190> as<00:03:52.280> well<00:03:52.510> off<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.569> here<00:03:53.989> we

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
zip tied up here as well off of here we

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.170 
zip tied up here as well off of here we
just<00:03:54.230> use<00:03:54.349> a<00:03:54.709> little<00:03:54.980> barbed<00:03:55.340> fitting<00:03:55.730> to

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
just use a little barbed fitting to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.710 
just use a little barbed fitting to
connect<00:03:56.569> an<00:03:56.780> eighth<00:03:57.230> inch<00:03:58.209> piece<00:03:59.209> of<00:03:59.239> tubing

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
connect an eighth inch piece of tubing

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.980 
connect an eighth inch piece of tubing
and<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.940> essentially<00:04:02.299> you<00:04:03.109> know

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
and that essentially you know

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.080 
and that essentially you know
that<00:04:04.530> essentially<00:04:04.950> will<00:04:05.100> just<00:04:05.520> feed<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.880> tops

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
that essentially will just feed the tops

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.360 
that essentially will just feed the tops
of<00:04:06.270> our<00:04:06.360> towers<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.990> lot<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.620> folks<00:04:07.800> ask<00:04:08.070> about

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
of our towers a lot of folks ask about

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.560 
of our towers a lot of folks ask about
clogging<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:10.400> it's<00:04:11.400> not<00:04:11.670> really<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.210> common

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
clogging and it's not really a common

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.570 
clogging and it's not really a common
thing<00:04:12.780> usually<00:04:13.020> our<00:04:13.380> problems<00:04:13.860> our<00:04:14.010> air<00:04:14.370> as

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
thing usually our problems our air as

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.120 
thing usually our problems our air as
opposed<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.690> air<00:04:16.230> in<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.470> lines<00:04:16.710> as<00:04:16.860> opposed

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130

opposed to air in the lines as opposed
to<00:04:17.250> solids<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:18.450> can<00:04:18.570> see<00:04:18.750> there<00:04:18.960> there's<00:04:19.200> some

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
to solids you can see there there's some

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.890 
to solids you can see there there's some
solids<00:04:19.770> coming<00:04:20.070> out<00:04:20.239> most<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.480> solids<00:04:21.630> in

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
solids coming out most of the solids in

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.150 
solids coming out most of the solids in
our<00:04:22.020> system<00:04:22.320> are<00:04:22.410> small<00:04:22.650> enough<00:04:22.800> but<00:04:23.070> they

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
our system are small enough but they

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.440 
our system are small enough but they
just<00:04:23.310> get<00:04:23.460> passed<00:04:23.760> right<00:04:23.970> through<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.300> tube

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
just get passed right through the tube

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.340 
just get passed right through the tube
no<00:04:24.750> problem

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
no problem

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.510 
no problem
so<00:04:26.340> for<00:04:26.550> drainage<00:04:26.940> we<00:04:27.330> just<00:04:27.540> basically<00:04:27.720> have<00:04:28.230> a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
so for drainage we just basically have a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.440 
so for drainage we just basically have a
four<00:04:29.520> inch<00:04:29.760> septic<00:04:30.710> drain<00:04:31.710> line<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.450> into

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
four inch septic drain line and into

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.830 
four inch septic drain line and into
this<00:04:33.570> drain<00:04:33.840> line<00:04:34.080> we<00:04:34.290> run<00:04:34.560> these<00:04:35.720> pieces<00:04:36.720> of

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
this drain line we run these pieces of

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.660 
this drain line we run these pieces of
gutter<00:04:37.140> it's<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.440> four-inch<00:04:37.770> gutter<00:04:38.160> with<00:04:38.430> in

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
gutter it's a four-inch gutter with in

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.900 
gutter it's a four-inch gutter with in
caps<00:04:38.990> these<00:04:39.990> are<00:04:40.320> about<00:04:40.530> oh<00:04:40.860> around<00:04:41.640> here

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
caps these are about oh around here

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.490 
caps these are about oh around here
they're<00:04:42.030> about<00:04:42.240> four<00:04:42.540> dollars<00:04:42.750> for<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.290> ten

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
they're about four dollars for a ten

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.860 
they're about four dollars for a ten
foot<00:04:43.710> section<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.370> these<00:04:44.940> gutter<00:04:45.270> cats<00:04:45.570> if<00:04:45.750> we

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
foot section and these gutter cats if we

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.780 
foot section and these gutter cats if we
buy<00:04:46.020> them<00:04:46.200> in<00:04:46.290> bulk<00:04:46.470> cost<00:04:46.770> us<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.160> buck<00:04:47.370> fifty

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
buy them in bulk cost us a buck fifty

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.330 
buy them in bulk cost us a buck fifty
bucks<00:04:48.030> sixty<00:04:48.450> each<00:04:48.660> so<00:04:49.320> really<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.860> makes<00:04:50.070> your

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
bucks sixty each so really it makes your

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.600 
bucks sixty each so really it makes your
it<00:04:51.300> can<00:04:51.480> make<00:04:51.630> your<00:04:51.780> drain<00:04:52.080> trough<00:04:53.040> pretty

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
it can make your drain trough pretty

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.060 
it can make your drain trough pretty
inexpensive<00:04:54.330> we<00:04:55.020> drill<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.320> hole<00:04:55.620> in<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.920> end

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
inexpensive we drill a hole in the end

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.610 
inexpensive we drill a hole in the end
you<00:04:56.790> can<00:04:56.940> see<00:04:57.150> here<00:04:57.420> we<00:04:57.870> drill<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.140> hole<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
you can see here we drill a hole in the

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.420 
you can see here we drill a hole in the
end<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.890> this<00:04:59.010> trough<00:04:59.280> and<00:05:00.920> we<00:05:01.920> basically<00:05:02.130> just

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
end of this trough and we basically just

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.570 
end of this trough and we basically just
put<00:05:02.730> a<00:05:02.760> fitting<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.380> threaded<00:05:04.380> fitting<00:05:04.770> it's<00:05:04.950> I

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
put a fitting a threaded fitting it's I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.020 
put a fitting a threaded fitting it's I
think<00:05:05.760> that's<00:05:06.060> 3/4<00:05:06.660> inch<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:07.110> one<00:05:07.320> inch

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
think that's 3/4 inch to one inch

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.490 
think that's 3/4 inch to one inch
fitting<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.300> we<00:05:09.750> then<00:05:09.900> we<00:05:09.930> drill<00:05:10.230> another

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
fitting and we then we drill another

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.380 
fitting and we then we drill another
hole<00:05:10.590> here<00:05:11.010> that's<00:05:11.220> about<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.520> 1/4<00:05:11.970> inch<00:05:12.150> one

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
hole here that's about a 1/4 inch one

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.760 
hole here that's about a 1/4 inch one
and<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.570> quarter<00:05:12.840> inch<00:05:12.990> hole<00:05:13.050> with<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.350> hole<00:05:13.530> saw

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
and a quarter inch hole with a hole saw

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.850 
and a quarter inch hole with a hole saw
and<00:05:13.980> our<00:05:14.670> our<00:05:14.970> troughs<00:05:15.630> just<00:05:16.110> basically<00:05:16.470> rest

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
and our our troughs just basically rest

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.520 
and our our troughs just basically rest
right<00:05:17.850> in<00:05:18.090> our<00:05:18.240> drain<00:05:18.510> line<00:05:18.750> there<00:05:18.990> it's<00:05:19.500> a

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
right in our drain line there it's a

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.320 
right in our drain line there it's a
really<00:05:19.680> inexpensive<00:05:20.010> way<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.520> do<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:20.910> and<00:05:21.060> it

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
really inexpensive way to do it and it

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.220 
really inexpensive way to do it and it
works<00:05:21.540> really<00:05:21.870> well

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
works really well

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.920 
works really well
I<00:05:22.470> do<00:05:22.950> recommend<00:05:23.430> going<00:05:23.760> with<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:24.030> 3/4<00:05:24.660> inch<00:05:24.690> as

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
I do recommend going with a 3/4 inch as

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.450 
I do recommend going with a 3/4 inch as
opposed<00:05:25.230> to<00:05:25.320> a<00:05:25.410> half<00:05:25.620> inch<00:05:25.920> it<00:05:26.100> will<00:05:26.190> make<00:05:26.340> your

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
opposed to a half inch it will make your

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.370 
opposed to a half inch it will make your
life<00:05:26.670> a<00:05:26.790> lot<00:05:26.910> easier<00:05:26.970> and<00:05:27.570> reduce<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.170> amount

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
life a lot easier and reduce the amount

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.250 
life a lot easier and reduce the amount
of<00:05:28.470> times<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.890> have<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.070> clog<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:31.050> you'll

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
of times you have a clog so you'll

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.690 
of times you have a clog so you'll
notice<00:05:31.440> in<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.740> lot<00:05:31.890> of<00:05:31.920> our<00:05:32.100> videos<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.580> we

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
notice in a lot of our videos that we

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.430 
notice in a lot of our videos that we
whitewash<00:05:33.150> our<00:05:33.390> framework<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.110> that's<00:05:34.230> just

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
whitewash our framework and that's just

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.100 
whitewash our framework and that's just
basically<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:35.010> reflect<00:05:35.400> light<00:05:35.660> we<00:05:36.660> just<00:05:36.900> use<00:05:37.080> a

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
basically to reflect light we just use a

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.900 
basically to reflect light we just use a
lime<00:05:37.440> wash<00:05:37.710> it's<00:05:38.040> just<00:05:38.520> kind<00:05:38.790> of<00:05:38.820> a

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
lime wash it's just kind of a

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.820 
lime wash it's just kind of a
traditional<00:05:39.360> white<00:05:39.570> wash<00:05:39.780> it's<00:05:40.020> non-toxic<00:05:40.470> if

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
traditional white wash it's non-toxic if

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.260 
traditional white wash it's non-toxic if
it<00:05:40.950> falls<00:05:41.160> in<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.430> water<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:41.820> actually<00:05:41.910> kind

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
it falls in the water to actually kind

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.160 
it falls in the water to actually kind
of<00:05:42.390> supplement<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:42.990> system<00:05:43.320> nutrition

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
of supplement the system nutrition

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.450 
of supplement the system nutrition
besides<00:05:46.170> that<00:05:46.350> over<00:05:46.740> here<00:05:46.860> I<00:05:46.920> just<00:05:47.160> wanted<00:05:47.340> to

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
besides that over here I just wanted to

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.070 
besides that over here I just wanted to
show<00:05:47.580> you<00:05:47.640> how<00:05:48.000> we<00:05:48.060> configured<00:05:48.660> these<00:05:48.840> ones

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
show you how we configured these ones

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.380 
show you how we configured these ones
and<00:05:49.290> again<00:05:49.440> we<00:05:50.100> had<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.280> lot<00:05:50.490> of<00:05:50.640> these<00:05:50.760> on<00:05:51.090> hand

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
and again we had a lot of these on hand

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.300 
and again we had a lot of these on hand
so<00:05:51.600> we<00:05:51.720> use<00:05:51.900> them<00:05:52.140> these<00:05:52.650> aren't<00:05:52.860> always<00:05:53.040> the

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
so we use them these aren't always the

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.040 
so we use them these aren't always the
most<00:05:53.340> economical<00:05:54.090> option<00:05:54.240> these<00:05:54.630> these<00:05:54.870> hose

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
most economical option these these hose

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.800 
most economical option these these hose
clamps<00:05:55.440> but<00:05:56.220> you<00:05:56.700> can<00:05:56.850> see<00:05:57.030> here<00:05:57.270> we<00:05:57.420> come<00:05:57.630> up

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
clamps but you can see here we come up

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.440 
clamps but you can see here we come up
we<00:05:58.440> run<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:58.740> out<00:05:58.890> we<00:05:59.070> split<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.580> so<00:06:00.240> that

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
we run it out we split it so that

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.510 
we run it out we split it so that
distributes<00:06:01.110> a<00:06:01.170> little<00:06:01.380> bit<00:06:01.500> more<00:06:01.620> evenly<00:06:01.980> and

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
distributes a little bit more evenly and

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.510 
distributes a little bit more evenly and
we<00:06:02.580> get<00:06:02.700> a<00:06:02.730> little<00:06:02.880> bit<00:06:03.030> more<00:06:04.370> evenness<00:06:05.370> and

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
we get a little bit more evenness and

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.370 
we get a little bit more evenness and
pressure<00:06:05.790> across<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.210> whole<00:06:06.510> mass<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:06.990> you

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
pressure across the whole mass and you

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.990 
pressure across the whole mass and you
can<00:06:07.500> see<00:06:07.650> this<00:06:07.740> is<00:06:07.890> a<00:06:07.920> larger<00:06:08.340> mass<00:06:08.550> we've<00:06:08.820> got

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
can see this is a larger mass we've got

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.850 
can see this is a larger mass we've got
let's<00:06:09.570> see<00:06:09.720> one<00:06:09.930> two<00:06:10.050> three<00:06:10.230> four<00:06:10.410> five<00:06:10.590> we've

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
let's see one two three four five we've

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.810 
let's see one two three four five we've
got<00:06:10.980> five<00:06:11.220> columns<00:06:11.670> on<00:06:11.850> here

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
got five columns on here

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.120 
got five columns on here
so<00:06:13.060> we<00:06:13.240> want<00:06:14.050> to<00:06:14.110> distribute<00:06:14.380> this<00:06:14.680> this

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
so we want to distribute this this

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.100 
so we want to distribute this this
pressure<00:06:15.670> pretty<00:06:15.970> evenly<00:06:16.240> we<00:06:16.600> split<00:06:16.900> it<00:06:17.020> and

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
pressure pretty evenly we split it and

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.480 
pressure pretty evenly we split it and
then<00:06:17.260> we<00:06:17.350> just<00:06:17.500> run<00:06:17.560> our<00:06:17.770> t's<00:06:17.950> off<00:06:18.160> of<00:06:18.340> that

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
then we just run our t's off of that

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.620 
then we just run our t's off of that
split<00:06:18.850> line<00:06:20.490> so<00:06:21.490> if<00:06:21.610> you're<00:06:21.730> interested<00:06:22.270> in<00:06:22.390> in
