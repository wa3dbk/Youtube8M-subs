00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.710
 Hello everyone and welcome to this 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.379
 first video of jean bou tv in a 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.960
 previous article on shop.com we had 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.060
 talked about a temporary offer 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 special on amazon that allowed to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.710
 buy a replacement battery for 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.599
 iphone 4 and 4s with a capacity 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.320
 ie increased with a duration of approx 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.109
 twice 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.770
 at only 17 euros we go to see in 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.140
 this video how to assemble it inside 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.960
 of the package find the battery 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.450
 obviously it's a star screwdriver la 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.820
 battery attention and 2680 milian per 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.010
 therefore almost twice that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.090
 classic of the iphone this vi 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.920
 will allow to have a duration 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.190
 obviously increased to get to the end 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.199
 day the screwdriver supplied e 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.809
 serves to unscrew the two screws or on the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.570
 bottom of the iphone 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.039
 here are two are simple to unscrew 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.329
 But without this screwdriver you can't 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.860
 to do it 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.590
 the second screwdriver, however, he had to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.700
 buy separately from briko costs about 67 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.310
 EUR 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.979
 serves to detach the connector of the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.930
 battery 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.759
 from the motherboard and therefore it is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 these two are essential for the operation 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.869
 screws that it maybe you see little 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.640
 because they are a millimeter are 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.920
 those two screws or that attack the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 connector to the motherboard I had the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.610
 taken away previously I don't have them now 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.579
 remittances because taking them apart is a bit 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 complicated so I didn't want to lose 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.100
 time to reassemble them anyway now 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.360
 you will see where they are inserted 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.880
 if you are doing this 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.520
 while while watching the video don't 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:54.049
 you will have trouble recognizing them 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.049
 we're going to open it ok before the screw is removed 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.540
 and also the second ok to open the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.959
 phone then just make a slide 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.959
 upwards and rises a bit like a club 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.269
 old nodia ok we opened the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.950
 phone here is this label 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.170
 this label is the warranty 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.300
 ie practically if you go to paul for 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.680
 check if the phone has been opened 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.410
 obviously if you want less 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.880
 I think the battery would guarantee it 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.170
 the warranty time is over and therefore 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.600
 we care little 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.390
 among other things this label passes below 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.120
 the battery therefore potentially 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.680
 you might be able to change it without that 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.030
 Apple notices it then without 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.250
 void the warranty provided that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.410
 obviously the case of the situation 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.470
 the replace these two slots 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.700
 they were the ones where those were inserted 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.640
 small lives that I just did to you 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.010
 see this one you see the first one is 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.870
 that a bit more difficult to remove in 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.590
 the one that locks the connector la 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.959
 second 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.209
 let's say a support block however is not 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.470
 it's not a fundamental anyway you have to 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.090
 challenge them both 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.250
 obviously once unscrewed you will have the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.500
 connector which is attached by snap 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.260
 so it will be removed quite easily 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.019
 with the help of thin tweezers 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.410
 we try to raise it you will feel a little 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.850
 click 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.829
 in the icy sense it is not 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.930
 very difficult but it is a lot of parts 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.850
 delicate and therefore better to pay attention 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.010
 now disconnect the battery 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.139
 attached with a glue from the center 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.750
 see how I'm doing because in 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:33.739
 this way you won't go to ruin the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.650
 volume buttons ok made so much strength 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.500
 not 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.720
 does not run any risk going off the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.360
 battery 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:47.760
 ok and you can tear it off perfectly you have it 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.629
 removed this is the battery that 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.790
 classic apple the one we're going to 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.680
 insert will be the same as this but more 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.260
 powerful that is, that is, it will have the same 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.060
 amperage and therefore will not damage the 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.120
 our iphone 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.200
 we learn from the package ok 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.170
 as you can see also aesthetically have the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.340
 same shape and therefore I am 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.819
 interchangeable we wo n't have problems 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.250
 then to insert it we position it 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.750
 exactly like the previous one 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.180
 starting first from above when they have 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.160
 towards below pay attention there is a 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.560
 ribbon cable connecting the connector 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.570
 to the battery 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.449
 be careful with crush it or 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.479
 at least not to put it below between 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.590
 connector and motherboard why 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.590
 otherwise it won't work 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.099
 ok exert a little pressure but 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.810
 without exaggerating because I repeat we are 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.550
 always working on the card badly 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.550
 until you hear a click 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.030
 ok , pay attention to the fact 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.000
 which should not repeat send the cable to the 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.919
 nose under the connector and now 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.789
 try if it works it shouldn't 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.419
 work 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.949
 now I'll explain why what you are 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.840
 looking at a video fragment that 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.610
 I had removed initially thought that 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.409
 the phone didn't turn on for mine 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.030
 error in connecting the battery 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.220
 I thought here you see you have connected 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.690
 bad actually the battery connector 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.659
 it was simply empty and therefore it is 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.150
 enough to close it put it in charge e 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.400
 to see the symbol appear immediately 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.039
 battery charge after a few 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.800
 minutes has rekindled 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:37.440
 ok we loaded it and now let's see 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:39.060
 if it actually works ok 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.430
 lamela has appeared and therefore now the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.560
 phone will turn on I remind you that for
