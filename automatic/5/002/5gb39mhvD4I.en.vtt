showcasing<00:00:02.730> us<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.750> iron<00:00:04.080> tight<00:00:04.500> now<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:05.069> is

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
showcasing us the iron tight now this is

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.680 
showcasing us the iron tight now this is
a<00:00:05.250> really<00:00:05.580> cool<00:00:05.759> iron<00:00:05.970> from<00:00:06.210> books<00:00:06.480> in

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
a really cool iron from books in

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.520 
a really cool iron from books in
Minecraft<00:00:06.899> 18<00:00:07.799> plus<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.540> pretty<00:00:09.540> much<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
Minecraft 18 plus and pretty much it's a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.640 
Minecraft 18 plus and pretty much it's a
really<00:00:10.860> cool<00:00:11.040> design<00:00:11.070> how<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.700> works<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.059> it's

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
really cool design how it works is it's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.629 
really cool design how it works is it's
building<00:00:13.650> your<00:00:13.799> spawn<00:00:14.070> chunks<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.519> it

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
building your spawn chunks but it

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.670 
building your spawn chunks but it
produces<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> ton<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> iron<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.080> really<00:00:16.650> short

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
produces a ton of iron in really short

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
produces a ton of iron in really short
period<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.160> time<00:00:17.220> sorry<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> rain<00:00:18.000> but

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
a ton of iron I had this iron farm on

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.510 
a ton of iron I had this iron farm on
for<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> don't<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:32.669> long<00:00:33.180> probably<00:00:33.690> a

every hour you get a few large chest
full<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.809> these<00:00:40.050> guys<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.040> pretty<00:00:41.280> crazy

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
full of these guys so it's pretty crazy

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.139 
full of these guys so it's pretty crazy
in<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> few<00:00:42.030> thousand<00:00:42.649> so<00:00:43.649> um<00:00:43.950> yeah<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.309> pretty

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
in a few thousand so um yeah so pretty

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.240 
in a few thousand so um yeah so pretty
much<00:00:45.239> how<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> works<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.860> iron

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
much how it works is you have the iron

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
much how it works is you have the iron
firm<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.969> has<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.510> believe<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.930> 64

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
firm that has like I believe like 64

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.889 
firm that has like I believe like 64
colleges<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.180> much<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.719> don't

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
colleges and then pretty much you don't

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.959 
colleges and then pretty much you don't
want<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.289> chunk<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> pretty<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.430> load<00:00:53.789> or

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
want this chunk to pretty much load or

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.779 
want this chunk to pretty much load or
whatnot<00:00:54.289> um<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.579> have

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
whatnot um so what you do is you have

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.930 
whatnot um so what you do is you have
this<00:00:57.649> little<00:00:58.649> machine<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
this little machine right here that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
this little machine right here that
pretty<00:01:00.120> much<00:01:00.180> shoots<00:01:00.570> poppies<00:01:01.440> into<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
pretty much shoots poppies into this

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.640 
pretty much shoots poppies into this
nether<00:01:02.879> portal<00:01:03.300> which<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.019> reloads<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
nether portal which then reloads the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.830 
nether portal which then reloads the
chunks<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.280> what's<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> chunks<00:01:05.909> reload<00:01:06.270> more

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
chunks so what's the chunks reload more

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.530 
chunks so what's the chunks reload more
iron<00:01:07.080> golems<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.740> song<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.240> chunks

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
iron golems can song and then the chunks

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
iron golems can song and then the chunks
reload<00:01:09.780> again<00:01:09.869> Morris<00:01:10.260> pond<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
reload again Morris pond and then the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
reload again Morris pond and then the
same<00:01:11.490> thing<00:01:11.549> happens<00:01:12.090> over<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.420> over<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.720> get

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
same thing happens over and over you get

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.289 
same thing happens over and over you get
the<00:01:13.020> picture<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> does<00:01:15.000> happen

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the picture so then one that does happen

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.320 
the picture so then one that does happen
you're<00:01:15.659> gonna<00:01:15.780> look<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:17.070> ton<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> iron<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
you're gonna look at a ton of iron in a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.760 
you're gonna look at a ton of iron in a
short<00:01:18.570> period<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.869> time<00:01:18.930> soon<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.500> really

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
short period of time soon be really

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.050 
short period of time soon be really
happy<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> got

like<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.790> actually<00:01:30.270> tried<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.200> design

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
like I actually tried out this design

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.929 
like I actually tried out this design
before<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> unfortunately<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
before and unfortunately with this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.160 
before and unfortunately with this
design<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:34.860> looking<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:36.720> ton

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
design I actually was looking at a ton

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
design I actually was looking at a ton
of<00:01:37.200> iron<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.700> actually<00:01:38.909> had<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.420> ahead

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
of iron so I actually had to go ahead

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.539 
of iron so I actually had to go ahead
