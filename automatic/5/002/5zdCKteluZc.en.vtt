pigment based prints can go into the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.999 
pigment based prints can go into the
hundreds<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.000> years<00:02:00.409> then<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.619> print<00:02:01.829> heads

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
hundreds of years then the print heads

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.149 
hundreds of years then the print heads
clogged<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.409> well<00:02:04.409> they<00:02:04.590> clogged<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:05.040> the

just never had any luck with them I

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.730 
just never had any luck with them I
print<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.180> often<00:03:39.750> which<00:03:40.050> is<00:03:40.080> good<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:40.650> the
