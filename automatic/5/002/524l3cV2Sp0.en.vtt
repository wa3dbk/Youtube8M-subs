being<00:00:01.740> careful<00:00:03.470> let's<00:00:04.470> evaluate<00:00:04.859> some

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
being careful let's evaluate some

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.270 
being careful let's evaluate some
expressions<00:00:08.900> here<00:00:09.900> are<00:00:10.139> three<00:00:10.500> mathematical

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
expressions here are three mathematical

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.759 
expressions here are three mathematical
expressions<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.480> may<00:00:12.660> look<00:00:12.929> very<00:00:12.960> similar

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
expressions that may look very similar

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.960 
expressions that may look very similar
but<00:00:14.250> are<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.580> fact<00:00:14.849> very<00:00:15.710> different<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
but are in fact very different in the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.900 
but are in fact very different in the
first<00:00:18.240> expression<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.680> 2<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.609> 4th

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
first expression we have 2 to the 4th

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.779 
first expression we have 2 to the 4th
power<00:00:21.050> which<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.350> evaluated<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:25.789> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
power which can be evaluated as the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.279 
power which can be evaluated as the
exponent<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.510> 4<00:00:27.869> represents<00:00:28.439> all<00:00:29.010> these<00:00:29.519> twos

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
exponent of 4 represents all these twos

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.040 
exponent of 4 represents all these twos
2<00:00:31.289> times<00:00:31.560> 2<00:00:31.769> equals<00:00:31.800> 4<00:00:32.399> 4<00:00:33.030> times<00:00:33.329> 2<00:00:33.510> equals<00:00:33.540> 8

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
2 times 2 equals 4 4 times 2 equals 8

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.240 
2 times 2 equals 4 4 times 2 equals 8
and<00:00:34.350> 8<00:00:34.770> times<00:00:35.070> 2<00:00:35.340> equals<00:00:35.700> 16<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.410> next<00:00:41.040> one

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and 8 times 2 equals 16 the next one

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.600 
and 8 times 2 equals 16 the next one
gets<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.610> little<00:00:41.879> bit<00:00:42.360> harder<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.860> exponent<00:00:44.489> of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
gets a little bit harder the exponent of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.389 
gets a little bit harder the exponent of
4<00:00:45.000> belongs<00:00:45.870> only<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.710> directly<00:00:47.280> next

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
4 belongs only to what is directly next

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.139 
4 belongs only to what is directly next
to<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.750> left<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.219> does<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.760> include

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
to it on the left so it does not include

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.229 
to it on the left so it does not include
the<00:00:51.539> negative<00:00:52.110> sign<00:00:52.520> 2<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> fourth<00:00:54.180> power

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the negative sign 2 to the fourth power

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.410 
the negative sign 2 to the fourth power
can<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.379> written<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:58.820> don't<00:00:59.820> forget<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
can be written as don't forget the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.900 
can be written as don't forget the
negative<00:01:00.899> sign<00:01:01.170> which<00:01:01.739> will<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.100> outside<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
negative sign which will be outside the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.740 
negative sign which will be outside the
parentheses<00:01:03.799> once<00:01:04.799> again<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.939> multiply<00:01:06.210> these

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
parentheses once again we multiply these

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.429 
parentheses once again we multiply these
twos<00:01:07.080> together<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.340> end<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.000> 16<00:01:09.600> but

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
twos together and we end up with 16 but

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.300 
twos together and we end up with 16 but
this<00:01:10.710> time<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.549> sign<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.270> very<00:01:12.770> different<00:01:16.310> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
this time the sign is very different in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.380 
this time the sign is very different in
the<00:01:18.299> next<00:01:18.860> expression<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.520> negative<00:01:20.850> 2

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the next expression we have negative 2

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.190 
the next expression we have negative 2
inside<00:01:22.290> parentheses<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.430> an<00:01:23.909> exponent<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.689> 4

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
inside parentheses and an exponent of 4

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.090 
inside parentheses and an exponent of 4
outside<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.460> parentheses<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:28.110> means<00:01:28.500> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
outside the parentheses this means that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.850 
outside the parentheses this means that
we<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.310> 4<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.090> whatever<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.960> inside<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we have 4 of whatever is inside the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.780 
we have 4 of whatever is inside the
parentheses<00:01:32.540> let's<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.170> get

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
parentheses let's see what we get

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.569 
parentheses let's see what we get
negative<00:01:35.790> 2<00:01:36.299> times<00:01:36.930> negative<00:01:37.049> 2<00:01:37.680> gives<00:01:38.009> us

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
negative 2 times negative 2 gives us

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.590 
negative 2 times negative 2 gives us
positive<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.950> positive<00:01:40.950> 4<00:01:41.250> times<00:01:41.850> negative<00:01:42.090> 2

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
positive for positive 4 times negative 2

equals negative 8 negative 8 times
negative<00:01:46.770> 2<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.670> positive<00:01:48.390> 16<00:01:50.930> remember<00:01:51.930> the

negative 2 is positive 16 remember the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
next to it on the left so it does not

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.389 
next to it on the left so it does not

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
affect the negative sign however if we

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.359 
affect the negative sign however if we
use<00:02:02.430> parentheses<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:04.020> exponent<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:04.920> applies
