do<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.920> first<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:30.090> maintain<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
do this first of all you can maintain a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
do this first of all you can maintain a
full<00:00:31.140> field<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.710> even<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.130> five<00:00:32.369> cards

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
full field or even this is five cards

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389 
full field or even this is five cards
that<00:00:33.149> aren't<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.590> waiting<00:00:34.800> room<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.280> when

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that aren't in your waiting room so when

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.970 
that aren't in your waiting room so when
you<00:00:35.460> decoupage<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.030> still<00:00:36.620> have<00:00:37.620> them

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
you decoupage you can still have them

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
you decoupage you can still have them
yeah<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.670> good<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.719> also<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.020> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
yeah that's good you can also have a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810 
yeah that's good you can also have a
card<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.379> cloth<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.860> helps<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.610> don't

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
card in your cloth this helps so don't

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.560 
card in your cloth this helps so don't
like<00:00:42.500> don't<00:00:43.500> heal<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.910> deck<00:00:45.180> refresh

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
like don't heal and then deck refresh

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
like don't heal and then deck refresh
because<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:45.960> deck<00:00:46.110> impression<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.500> be

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
because your deck impression will be

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.000 
because your deck impression will be
crap<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.670> should<00:00:47.820> heal<00:00:48.030> after<00:00:48.590> your<00:00:49.590> deck<00:00:49.860> or

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
crap you should heal after your deck or

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.310 
crap you should heal after your deck or
fridge<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:51.390> also<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.719> cards<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> lot<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
fridge you also have cards it's a lot of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.529 
fridge you also have cards it's a lot of
stock<00:00:52.590> also<00:00:53.370> don't<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.910> climax<00:00:54.329> cards

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
stock also don't don't have climax cards

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240

in your stock book because you won't

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.380 
in your stock book because you won't
deck<00:00:56.430> refresh<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.030> they'll<00:00:57.120> ruin

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
deck refresh with them and they'll ruin

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.619 
deck refresh with them and they'll ruin
your<00:00:57.600> cancel<00:00:58.020> range<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:01:00.149> rate<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
your cancel range which is the rate that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.120 
your cancel range which is the rate that
you<00:01:00.780> can't<00:01:01.109> say<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> fortune<00:01:07.140> that's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you can't say this is a fortune that's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.490 
you can't say this is a fortune that's
basically<00:01:08.430> deck<00:01:09.090> compression<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:10.290> pretty

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
basically deck compression it's pretty

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
basically deck compression it's pretty
much<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:10.920> pretty<00:01:11.159> logical<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:11.939> common

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
much it's pretty logical it's all common

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
much it's pretty logical it's all common
sense<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.229> last<00:01:13.409> non<00:01:13.680> climax<00:01:14.130> car<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
sense the last non climax car do you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.370 
sense the last non climax car do you
have<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.729> deck<00:01:14.939> Memorial<00:01:15.689> cancel<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
have in your deck Memorial cancel and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.620 
have in your deck Memorial cancel and
this<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.400> important<00:01:18.000> strategy

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
this was very important strategy

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
this was very important strategy
freeways<00:01:20.270> also<00:01:21.270> another<00:01:22.110> important<00:01:22.650> strategy

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
freeways also another important strategy

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.249 
freeways also another important strategy
especially<00:01:23.100> early<00:01:23.400> game<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.450> keeping<00:01:25.140> your

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
especially early game is keeping your

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.300 
especially early game is keeping your
opponent<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:26.040> getting<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> six<00:01:26.939> damage<00:01:28.310> if

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
opponent from getting to six damage if

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
opponent from getting to six damage if
you<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:30.060> points<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.450> six<00:01:30.630> damage<00:01:30.780> they

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you get your points at six damage they

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
you get your points at six damage they
can<00:01:31.079> simply<00:01:31.350> clock<00:01:31.670> level<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> kill

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
can simply clock level up and kill

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.910 
can simply clock level up and kill
whatever<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:34.799> want

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
whatever you have that you don't want

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.140 
whatever you have that you don't want
your<00:01:34.979> point<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> level<00:01:35.670> ahead<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.030> what

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
your point to be a level ahead so what

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.120 
your point to be a level ahead so what
you<00:01:36.210> should<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:37.590> leave<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:37.979> at

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you should do is you can leave them at

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.830 
you should do is you can leave them at
five<00:01:38.549> damage

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
five damage

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.230 
five damage
this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.679> this<00:01:41.219> is<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.399> compromise

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
this is like this is a compromise

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
this is like this is a compromise
between<00:01:42.270> doing<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.259> much<00:01:43.409> damage<00:01:43.469> as<00:01:43.859> possible

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
between doing as much damage as possible

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.010 
between doing as much damage as possible
and<00:01:44.700> also<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.600> letting<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.929> level<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:47.420> yes<00:01:48.420> if

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and also not letting the level up yes if

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.240 
and also not letting the level up yes if
they<00:01:49.140> level<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.560> we'll<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.920> able<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.130> play<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
they level up we'll be able to play a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.700 
they level up we'll be able to play a
high<00:01:50.429> level<00:01:50.729> card<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.960> high-level<00:01:52.350> card
