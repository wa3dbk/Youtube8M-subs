hey guys fan out here and yes I have

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.080 
hey guys fan out here and yes I have
made<00:00:09.219> a<00:00:09.490> two<00:00:09.550> by<00:00:10.030> two<00:00:10.059> buds<00:00:10.750> trapdoor<00:00:11.590> now<00:00:12.400> this

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
made a two by two buds trapdoor now this

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.870 
made a two by two buds trapdoor now this
thing<00:00:13.150> is<00:00:13.500> extremely<00:00:14.500> compact<00:00:14.950> it<00:00:15.250> stays<00:00:15.550> open

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
thing is extremely compact it stays open

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.089 
thing is extremely compact it stays open
long<00:00:16.689> enough<00:00:16.720> so<00:00:17.140> that<00:00:17.170> you<00:00:17.410> can<00:00:17.590> just<00:00:17.830> drop

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
long enough so that you can just drop

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.519 
long enough so that you can just drop
through<00:00:18.430> without<00:00:18.640> taking<00:00:19.180> any<00:00:19.360> damage<00:00:19.660> of<00:00:20.080> the

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
through without taking any damage of the

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.800 
through without taking any damage of the
sorts<00:00:21.039> you<00:00:21.699> just<00:00:21.970> got<00:00:22.119> a<00:00:22.150> sneak<00:00:22.420> peek<00:00:22.660> of<00:00:22.750> the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
sorts you just got a sneak peek of the

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.260 
sorts you just got a sneak peek of the
redstone<00:00:23.350> so<00:00:24.100> yeah<00:00:24.310> let's<00:00:24.580> just<00:00:24.670> strip<00:00:25.119> away

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
redstone so yeah let's just strip away

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.590 
redstone so yeah let's just strip away
the<00:00:25.600> sandstone<00:00:26.109> and<00:00:26.289> show<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:26.859> how<00:00:27.130> it<00:00:27.250> works

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
the sandstone and show you how it works

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.779 
the sandstone and show you how it works
alrighty<00:00:28.600> then<00:00:28.900> so<00:00:29.289> this<00:00:29.859> is<00:00:30.100> it<00:00:30.369> strip

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
alrighty then so this is it strip

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.810 
alrighty then so this is it strip
completely<00:00:31.150> naked<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.160> entirety<00:00:33.790> of

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
completely naked this is the entirety of

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.780 
completely naked this is the entirety of
the<00:00:34.000> Redstone<00:00:34.420> one<00:00:34.660> quarter<00:00:35.199> is<00:00:35.350> just<00:00:36.280> five

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
the Redstone one quarter is just five

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.340 
the Redstone one quarter is just five
long<00:00:37.089> by<00:00:37.930> three<00:00:38.320> wide<00:00:39.100> by<00:00:39.670> three<00:00:40.390> high<00:00:40.690> four<00:00:41.199> if

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
long by three wide by three high four if

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.420 
long by three wide by three high four if
you<00:00:41.500> include<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.949> floor<00:00:42.339> but<00:00:42.580> who<00:00:43.030> does<00:00:43.269> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you include the floor but who does that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.130 
you include the floor but who does that
so<00:00:45.430> yeah<00:00:45.580> that's<00:00:45.850> exactly<00:00:46.239> how<00:00:46.720> it<00:00:46.900> works

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
so yeah that's exactly how it works

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.250 
so yeah that's exactly how it works
should<00:00:47.320> you<00:00:47.470> saw<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.739> in<00:00:47.890> action<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:50.049> quick

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
should you saw it in action it's a quick

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.479 
should you saw it in action it's a quick
shot<00:00:50.680> from<00:00:51.100> above<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.379> yeah<00:00:53.979> I<00:00:54.010> think<00:00:54.190> I'm

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
shot from above so yeah I think I'm

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.340 
shot from above so yeah I think I'm
gonna<00:00:54.610> do<00:00:54.790> that<00:00:54.940> tutorial<00:00:55.299> now<00:00:55.690> it's<00:00:56.199> about

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
gonna do that tutorial now it's about

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.759 
gonna do that tutorial now it's about
time<00:00:56.739> isn't<00:00:56.979> it<00:00:57.510> okay<00:00:58.510> then<00:00:58.750> so<00:00:59.019> to<00:00:59.080> build<00:00:59.440> one

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
time isn't it okay then so to build one

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.640 
time isn't it okay then so to build one
quarter<00:01:00.369> of<00:01:00.400> this<00:01:00.850> two-by-two<00:01:01.570> bud<00:01:02.049> trapdoor

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
quarter of this two-by-two bud trapdoor

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.910 
quarter of this two-by-two bud trapdoor
you<00:01:03.369> want<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.180> use<00:01:04.390> these<00:01:04.960> materials<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.799> I

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
you want to use these materials and I

pistons a water bucket and a cauldron

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.580 
pistons a water bucket and a cauldron
alright<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:30.189> want<00:01:30.369> to<00:01:30.429> start<00:01:30.460> by<00:01:31.590> first

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
alright so you want to start by first

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.560 
alright so you want to start by first
defining<00:01:32.799> where<00:01:33.310> your<00:01:33.579> floor<00:01:34.030> will<00:01:34.240> be<00:01:34.420> of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
defining where your floor will be of

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.899 
defining where your floor will be of
course<00:01:34.600> in<00:01:35.049> my<00:01:35.649> case<00:01:35.679> it<00:01:36.159> will<00:01:36.280> be<00:01:36.340> right<00:01:36.670> there

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
course in my case it will be right there

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.010 
course in my case it will be right there
and<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.149> will<00:01:37.210> be<00:01:37.479> placing<00:01:37.719> redstone<00:01:38.289> there<00:01:38.679> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and I will be placing redstone there to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.289 
and I will be placing redstone there to
control<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.249> so<00:01:42.249> you<00:01:42.340> place<00:01:42.549> Pistons<00:01:43.060> like

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
control it so you place Pistons like

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.169 
control it so you place Pistons like
this<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.549> yeah<00:01:46.420> it's<00:01:46.689> like<00:01:46.810> that<00:01:47.079> um<00:01:47.380> a

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
this so yeah it's like that um a

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.590 
this so yeah it's like that um a
redstone<00:01:49.179> block<00:01:49.569> diagonal<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.590> piston

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
redstone block diagonal of that piston

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.779 
redstone block diagonal of that piston
normal<00:01:52.600> block<00:01:52.780> right<00:01:52.990> there<00:01:53.579> dust<00:01:54.579> all<00:01:54.759> over

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
normal block right there dust all over

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.160 
normal block right there dust all over
there<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:56.310> block<00:01:57.310> with<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.240> sticky<00:01:58.689> piston<00:01:58.869> on

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
there a block with a sticky piston on

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.929 
there a block with a sticky piston on
top<00:01:59.499> that<00:02:00.280> sticky<00:02:00.639> piston<00:02:01.119> has<00:02:01.389> the<00:02:01.810> cauldron

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
top that sticky piston has the cauldron

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.239 
top that sticky piston has the cauldron
attached<00:02:03.939> with<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.810> water<00:02:05.049> bucket<00:02:05.530> inside<00:02:06.069> of

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
attached with the water bucket inside of

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.270 
attached with the water bucket inside of
it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.160 
it
then<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:08.060> have<00:02:08.270> your<00:02:08.300> redstone<00:02:08.899> comparator

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
then you have your redstone comparator

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.050 
then you have your redstone comparator
take<00:02:09.800> your<00:02:09.950> output<00:02:10.310> from<00:02:10.610> there<00:02:10.940> into<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:12.230> block

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
take your output from there into a block

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.790 
take your output from there into a block
into<00:02:14.060> redstone<00:02:14.630> curving<00:02:15.020> around<00:02:15.110> towards

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
into redstone curving around towards

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.010 
into redstone curving around towards
these<00:02:16.010> two<00:02:16.280> sticky<00:02:16.640> pistons<00:02:17.120> with<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.510> repeater

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
these two sticky pistons with a repeater

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.880 
these two sticky pistons with a repeater
on<00:02:18.110> one<00:02:18.410> tick<00:02:19.030> then<00:02:20.030> we<00:02:20.450> need<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:22.360> loop<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:24.680> need

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
on one tick then we need a loop we need

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.510 
on one tick then we need a loop we need
a<00:02:25.040> sticky<00:02:25.640> piston<00:02:25.930> right<00:02:27.160> where's<00:02:28.160> my<00:02:28.190> sticky

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
a sticky piston right where's my sticky

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.500 
a sticky piston right where's my sticky
pistons<00:02:28.850> sticky<00:02:29.750> piston<00:02:30.140> right<00:02:30.410> there<00:02:31.510> like

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
pistons sticky piston right there like

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.370 
pistons sticky piston right there like
that<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:35.330> gets<00:02:35.540> powered<00:02:36.020> through

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
that and that that gets powered through

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.770 
that and that that gets powered through
a<00:02:36.560> repeater<00:02:37.069> on<00:02:37.160> for<00:02:37.670> textile<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.540> this

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
a repeater on for textile of this

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.130 
a repeater on for textile of this
redstone<00:02:39.170> dust<00:02:39.850> then<00:02:40.850> your<00:02:41.239> redstone<00:02:41.600> torch

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
redstone dust then your redstone torch

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.850 
redstone dust then your redstone torch
right<00:02:42.680> there<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.660> another<00:02:44.660> repeater<00:02:45.650> and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
right there and another repeater and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.120 
right there and another repeater and
there<00:02:46.220> they<00:02:47.000> place<00:02:47.300> two<00:02:47.540> blocks<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:48.830> with

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
there they place two blocks like so with

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.280 
there they place two blocks like so with
the<00:02:49.250> detector<00:02:49.700> oil<00:02:49.880> on<00:02:50.000> top<00:02:50.209> then<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.989> all

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
the detector oil on top then this is all

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.550 
the detector oil on top then this is all
you<00:02:51.769> will<00:02:51.800> need<00:02:51.950> for<00:02:52.239> most<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:54.319> last

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
you will need for most of it the last

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.550 
you will need for most of it the last
thing<00:02:54.830> is<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.580> redstone<00:02:56.030> torch<00:02:56.360> right<00:02:57.140> there<00:02:57.380> to

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
thing is a redstone torch right there to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.270 
thing is a redstone torch right there to
reset<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.980> whole<00:02:58.130> thing<00:02:59.410> so<00:03:00.410> yeah<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.739> will<00:03:01.130> now

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
reset the whole thing so yeah I will now

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.220 
reset the whole thing so yeah I will now
be<00:03:01.430> showing<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.910> how<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.150> tile<00:03:02.540> these<00:03:02.840> designs

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
be showing you how to tile these designs

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.850 
be showing you how to tile these designs
so<00:03:03.590> hold<00:03:03.980> tight<00:03:04.100> okay<00:03:04.519> then<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:05.569> how<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.410> tile

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
so hold tight okay then so how you tile

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.009 
so hold tight okay then so how you tile
it<00:03:07.100> that's<00:03:07.489> an<00:03:07.760> excellent<00:03:08.030> question<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.780> I'm

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
it that's an excellent question and I'm

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.720 
it that's an excellent question and I'm
going<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.200> show<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:10.400> add

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
going to show you so you just add

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.970 
going to show you so you just add
Pistons<00:03:11.480> along<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:11.989> this<00:03:12.320> so<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.799> it

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
Pistons along like this so that it

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.449 
Pistons along like this so that it
actually<00:03:13.160> makes<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:14.180> two<00:03:14.269> by<00:03:14.720> two<00:03:14.750> shape<00:03:15.459> then

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
actually makes a two by two shape then

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.340 
actually makes a two by two shape then
next<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.329> piston<00:03:17.660> with<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.810> cauldron

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
next to the piston with a cauldron

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.289 
next to the piston with a cauldron
attached<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.980> place<00:03:19.190> another<00:03:19.340> sticky<00:03:19.880> piston

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
attached you place another sticky piston

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.340 
attached you place another sticky piston
with<00:03:20.959> yet<00:03:21.230> another<00:03:21.790> cauldron<00:03:22.790> attached<00:03:23.350> place

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
with yet another cauldron attached place

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.860 
with yet another cauldron attached place
water<00:03:24.590> in<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.829> cold<00:03:25.040> run<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.600> get<00:03:26.600> sticky

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
water in the cold run and get sticky

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.380 
water in the cold run and get sticky
business<00:03:27.049> back<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:30.230> then<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.940> again<00:03:31.940> go<00:03:32.150> out

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
business back so then you again go out

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.979 
business back so then you again go out
with<00:03:32.750> your<00:03:32.959> comparator<00:03:34.269> with<00:03:35.269> your<00:03:35.540> redstone

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
with your comparator with your redstone

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.880 
with your comparator with your redstone
dust<00:03:38.290> redstone<00:03:39.290> dust<00:03:39.440> on<00:03:39.650> their<00:03:40.090> repeater<00:03:41.090> on

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
dust redstone dust on their repeater on

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.599 
dust redstone dust on their repeater on
four<00:03:42.890> tix<00:03:44.049> torch<00:03:46.030> normal<00:03:47.030> repeater<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:48.609> your

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
four tix torch normal repeater and your

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.420 
four tix torch normal repeater and your
piston<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.260> piston<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.500> course<00:03:51.799> has<00:03:52.100> your

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
piston that piston of course has your

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.870 
piston that piston of course has your
detector<00:03:53.390> rail<00:03:53.540> attached<00:03:53.900> again<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:55.579> place

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
detector rail attached again you place

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.660 
detector rail attached again you place
another<00:03:56.090> block<00:03:57.019> there<00:03:57.769> this<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.250> all<00:03:58.370> very

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
another block there this is all very

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.580 
another block there this is all very
very<00:03:58.940> straightforward<00:03:59.690> as<00:03:59.810> I<00:03:59.930> just<00:04:00.140> did<00:04:00.410> the

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
very straightforward as I just did the

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.260 
very straightforward as I just did the
tutorial

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.880 

but<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.390> can<00:04:04.570> see<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.930> happening<00:04:05.410> this

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
but you can see it happening this

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.860 
but you can see it happening this
happens<00:04:06.340> sometimes<00:04:06.400> even<00:04:07.180> when<00:04:07.210> you<00:04:07.390> tile<00:04:07.690> it

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
happens sometimes even when you tile it

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.250 
happens sometimes even when you tile it
a<00:04:07.900> couple<00:04:08.410> of<00:04:08.560> times<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:10.810> going<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.050> show<00:04:11.200> you

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
a couple of times I'm going to show you

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.460 
a couple of times I'm going to show you
how<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.560> fix<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.220> as<00:04:12.520> well<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.810> first<00:04:14.110> replace

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
how to fix that as well so first replace

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.560 
how to fix that as well so first replace
our<00:04:14.740> sticky<00:04:15.460> pistons<00:04:17.850> so<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:19.330> see<00:04:19.540> that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
our sticky pistons so you see that

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
our sticky pistons so you see that
happening<00:04:20.200> now<00:04:20.410> my<00:04:20.680> solution<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.459> is<00:04:21.640> I

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
happening now my solution to that is I

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
happening now my solution to that is I
grab<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.890> lever<00:04:25.440> flick<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> lever<00:04:26.740> on<00:04:26.980> right

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
grab a lever flick the lever on right

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.360 
grab a lever flick the lever on right
there<00:04:27.850> update<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.750> piston<00:04:29.230> that<00:04:29.410> one<00:04:30.190> will

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
there update this piston that one will

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.500 
there update this piston that one will
go<00:04:30.550> right<00:04:30.730> there<00:04:31.000> then<00:04:31.960> remove<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.410> lever<00:04:32.740> and

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
go right there then remove the lever and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.450 
go right there then remove the lever and
the<00:04:34.510> repeater<00:04:35.380> right<00:04:35.620> there<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.130> can<00:04:36.250> place

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
the repeater right there you can place

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.760 
the repeater right there you can place
the<00:04:36.580> torch<00:04:36.850> back<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.600> place<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.050> repeater<00:04:38.320> back

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the torch back and place a repeater back

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.820 
the torch back and place a repeater back
as<00:04:38.980> well<00:04:39.390> so<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:40.420> should<00:04:40.870> not<00:04:41.020> work<00:04:41.350> just

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
as well so that should not work just

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.940 
as well so that should not work just
fine<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.790> for<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.120> other<00:04:43.300> side<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:44.680> actually

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
fine so for the other side you actually

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
fine so for the other side you actually
don't<00:04:45.460> need<00:04:45.640> a<00:04:45.880> couple<00:04:46.300> of<00:04:46.510> things<00:04:47.760> seeing<00:04:48.760> as

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
don't need a couple of things seeing as

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.970 
don't need a couple of things seeing as
you<00:04:49.090> can<00:04:49.210> just<00:04:49.390> take<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.750> output<00:04:50.200> from<00:04:50.470> this

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
you can just take the output from this

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.180 
you can just take the output from this
redstone<00:04:51.400> signal<00:04:51.760> for<00:04:52.690> those<00:04:53.320> Pistons<00:04:56.190> so

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
redstone signal for those Pistons so

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.630 
redstone signal for those Pistons so
let's<00:04:57.400> do<00:04:57.700> that<00:04:57.730> real<00:04:58.150> quick<00:04:58.890> right<00:04:59.890> there<00:04:59.950> now

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
let's do that real quick right there now

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.170 
let's do that real quick right there now
these<00:05:00.850> Pistons<00:05:01.300> still<00:05:01.570> need<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.930> extend<00:05:02.230> and

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
these Pistons still need to extend and

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.080 
these Pistons still need to extend and
we<00:05:04.180> do<00:05:04.390> that<00:05:04.600> by<00:05:04.990> redstone<00:05:05.860> blocks<00:05:06.280> again

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
we do that by redstone blocks again

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.800 
we do that by redstone blocks again
right<00:05:07.570> there<00:05:08.520> then<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.790> block<00:05:10.090> next<00:05:10.390> then

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
right there then a block next then

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.280 
right there then a block next then
redstone<00:05:11.530> all<00:05:11.680> over<00:05:11.980> there<00:05:14.070> then<00:05:15.070> we<00:05:15.370> grab<00:05:15.820> a

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
redstone all over there then we grab a

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.020 
redstone all over there then we grab a
output<00:05:17.290> from<00:05:17.500> this<00:05:17.710> redstone<00:05:18.100> dust<00:05:18.520> repeater

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
output from this redstone dust repeater

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.970 
output from this redstone dust repeater
on<00:05:19.120> four<00:05:19.540> tix<00:05:20.250> torch<00:05:21.250> goes<00:05:21.490> up<00:05:22.410> in<00:05:23.410> a<00:05:23.470> repeater

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
on four tix torch goes up in a repeater

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.870 
on four tix torch goes up in a repeater
into<00:05:24.730> a<00:05:24.970> sticky<00:05:25.630> piston<00:05:25.900> with<00:05:29.669> that<00:05:30.669> will

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
into a sticky piston with that will

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.780 
into a sticky piston with that will
happen<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.240> couple<00:05:31.270> of<00:05:31.570> times<00:05:32.190> with<00:05:33.190> detector

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
happen a couple of times with detector

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.470 
happen a couple of times with detector
rails<00:05:35.130> so<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.340> tectorial<00:05:36.669> detector<00:05:37.300> rail

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
rails so the tectorial detector rail

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.980 
rails so the tectorial detector rail
let's<00:05:38.440> do<00:05:38.650> that<00:05:38.860> same<00:05:39.250> thing<00:05:39.280> on<00:05:39.790> this<00:05:40.450> side<00:05:40.510> as

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
let's do that same thing on this side as

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.790 
let's do that same thing on this side as
well<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:42.400> we<00:05:42.490> take<00:05:42.669> repeater<00:05:43.090> for<00:05:43.480> tix<00:05:43.800> porch

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
well so we take repeater for tix porch

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.670 
well so we take repeater for tix porch
and<00:05:45.310> another<00:05:45.940> repeater<00:05:46.240> one<00:05:46.570> tick<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:47.110> then<00:05:47.470> a

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
and another repeater one tick and then a

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.390 
and another repeater one tick and then a
sticky<00:05:48.370> piston<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:49.540> this<00:05:49.930> should<00:05:50.710> be<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:51.070> done

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
sticky piston so this should be you done

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.820 
sticky piston so this should be you done
on<00:05:51.669> this<00:05:51.910> side<00:05:52.150> you<00:05:52.180> don't<00:05:52.330> need<00:05:52.900> the<00:05:53.200> Pistons

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
on this side you don't need the Pistons

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.170 
on this side you don't need the Pistons
with<00:05:54.010> the<00:05:54.100> cauldrons<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:56.650> yeah<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.940> is

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
with the cauldrons so yeah that is

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.610 
with the cauldrons so yeah that is
basically<00:05:58.720> it<00:05:59.100> no<00:06:00.100> ahem<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:01.300> only<00:06:01.600> need<00:06:02.050> this

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
basically it no ahem you only need this

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.680 
basically it no ahem you only need this
torch<00:06:03.010> right<00:06:03.280> here<00:06:03.520> on<00:06:03.730> one<00:06:04.030> side<00:06:04.300> because<00:06:04.600> you

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
torch right here on one side because you

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.080 
torch right here on one side because you
want<00:06:04.870> to<00:06:04.900> update<00:06:05.080> it<00:06:05.440> just<00:06:05.740> once<00:06:06.340> obviously

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
want to update it just once obviously

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.970 
want to update it just once obviously
it's<00:06:07.270> unnecessary<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.169> have<00:06:08.380> it<00:06:08.530> on<00:06:08.650> other

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
it's unnecessary to have it on other

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.260 
it's unnecessary to have it on other
site

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
site

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.020 
site
um<00:06:10.650> so<00:06:11.650> yeah<00:06:11.800> I<00:06:11.830> think<00:06:12.010> I've<00:06:12.370> said<00:06:12.520> about<00:06:12.670> what

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
um so yeah I think I've said about what

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.540 
um so yeah I think I've said about what
I<00:06:13.060> needed<00:06:13.360> to<00:06:13.540> say<00:06:13.650> so<00:06:14.650> yeah<00:06:15.070> that's<00:06:15.370> basically

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
I needed to say so yeah that's basically

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.910 
I needed to say so yeah that's basically
