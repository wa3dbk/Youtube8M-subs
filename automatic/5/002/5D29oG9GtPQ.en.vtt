00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.639
 will show how downgraded your iphone 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.450
 ipad ipod which is on the island and 7.1 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.759
 in beta so this tutorial runs on 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.940
 europe1 matter what beta so you have 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.939
 the psw from the previous version 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.070
 so this famous and psw you can 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.050
 download on this site equipped sw 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.720
 downloader points like brian 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.490
 registration 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.890
 so you are on the home so the page 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.380
 you choose your device 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.079
 then his hotel and finally you 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.920
 go choose the bankrupt die 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:49.170
 once it's done click on 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:51.710
 download if it does not give you 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.710
 can terminate 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.410
 you have here after the link that appears 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.730
 you click on it and hop it will get 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.840
 to put 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.180
 I already had so it's not 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 necessary once you have it 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.840
 download so you will have to open 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.799
 itunes 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.159
 so we could see I'm in seven 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.280
 points 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.460
 as I say and so you have to 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.200
 click restore ipad but what 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.670
 you have to do was relying on alt 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.729
 is just as much of course talent 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 just click and eat the ipad 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.250
 so there you come to locate ipes w in 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.560
 question so with respect to your 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.600
 idevice and this one and you do 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.110
 open live warns you like it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.470
 will erase and restore your ipad to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.659
 the stop at ios version is 0.4 and then 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.049
 he will check the restoration with 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.259
 of apple so do restore there they 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.380
 extract the software that is present 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.049
 in ipes w because you have to know that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.290
 every update on every cross 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.630
 like that of 7.1 so on not when 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.229
 these 0.1 points and updates a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.869
 term which are internal software m and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.110
 we pay must correct after these updates 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.110
 day oit 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.360
 so 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 waiting for the ipad so the ipad 2 passes 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:27.670
 and 1 and so the apple will light up and 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.079
 so precisely there the process is in 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.670
 snap and so do not 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.790
 touch and especially not to the ipad does it 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.860
 do not disconnect and make sure that you 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.860
 have his batteries for the operation 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.050
 so then after he goes to the 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.200
 ipad software restore 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.970
 so that is ios 7.0 software 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.970
 points 4 ohms instant 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.989
 so now he's going to the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.390
 restoration of the internal program of 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.390
 the ipad so there almost finished 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.720
 slamming the restore 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.310
 does it restart so there I you 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.520
 so warn that message disappears in 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.180
 two one second is so there you see 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.160
 itunes is cut off and so the ipad is 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.690
 well restored so here we will leave the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.680
 time to restart and I come to you 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.010
 prove how he went 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.080
 now 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.130
 in six years 0.4 so when it restarts 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.480
 there you always have a bar of 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.620
 loading so do not worry 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.420
 as soon as it's over 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.040
 in a few minutes can so much 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.870
 there will be finished restarting 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.550
 so you see there is being 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.550
 read by computer 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.790
 so little thing to know now 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.350
 the ipad is locked on an ID 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.080
 apple so if you have not done it 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.770
 restore it so these little security 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.060
 it could be bad I think 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.060
 so you have to type your credentials 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.070
 and then click continue so 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.200
 so here it is yes it warns you like 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.950
 what are you welcome on your 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.950
 new ipad 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.550
 so as you can see 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.630
 now we have a year 6.0 so so 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.340
 while we could see in seven 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.340
 points 0.4 and so here is
