00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.270 
single square dead-on in the center and
I'm<00:00:43.000> gonna<00:00:43.120> make<00:00:43.330> a<00:00:43.559> half-inch<00:00:44.559> across<00:00:45.070> each

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
I'm gonna make a half-inch across each

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.400 
I'm gonna make a half-inch across each
line<00:00:45.610> as<00:00:46.089> we<00:00:46.300> go<00:00:46.449> around<00:00:46.600> I'm<00:00:46.900> just<00:00:46.930> doing<00:00:47.290> this

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
line as we go around I'm just doing this

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.030 
line as we go around I'm just doing this
by<00:00:47.620> eye<00:00:47.650> and<00:00:48.250> not<00:00:48.370> really<00:00:48.730> measuring<00:00:49.120> it

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
by eye and not really measuring it

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.100 
by eye and not really measuring it
exactly<00:00:51.040> with<00:00:51.220> a<00:00:51.280> ruler<00:00:51.640> but<00:00:51.970> you<00:00:52.660> can<00:00:52.809> do<00:00:52.930> as

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
exactly with a ruler but you can do as

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.710 
exactly with a ruler but you can do as
you<00:00:53.260> wish<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.940> just<00:00:55.180> use<00:00:55.300> your<00:00:55.329> ruler

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
you wish and then just use your ruler

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.290 
you wish and then just use your ruler
and<00:00:56.079> connect<00:00:56.440> those<00:00:56.530> lines<00:00:56.680> together<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
and connect those lines together and

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000 
and connect those lines together and
then<00:00:58.420> what<00:00:58.600> we're<00:00:58.719> going<00:00:58.809> to<00:00:58.870> do<00:00:58.989> we<00:00:59.559> cut<00:00:59.860> out

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
then what we're going to do we cut out

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.700 
then what we're going to do we cut out
the<00:01:00.039> entire<00:01:00.520> first<00:01:00.760> layer<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.300> leave<00:01:02.260> the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
the entire first layer and leave the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.400 
the entire first layer and leave the
half<00:01:03.370> inch<00:01:03.610> rectangles<00:01:04.420> in<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.930> Centers<00:01:05.379> of

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
half inch rectangles in the Centers of

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.120 
half inch rectangles in the Centers of
north-south-east-west<00:01:06.039> and<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.860> going

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
north-south-east-west and that's going

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.330 
north-south-east-west and that's going
to<00:01:09.190> be<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.690> edge<00:01:10.690> of<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.830> corridor<00:01:12.310> or

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
to be the edge of the corridor or

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.070 
to be the edge of the corridor or
whatever<00:01:12.700> that's<00:01:12.940> entering<00:01:13.300> this<00:01:13.450> area<00:01:13.840> and

whatever that's entering this area and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.900 
whatever that's entering this area and
from<00:01:14.289> there<00:01:14.470> a<00:01:14.500> bridge<00:01:14.890> will<00:01:15.190> go<00:01:15.369> across<00:01:15.640> to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
from there a bridge will go across to

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.029 
from there a bridge will go across to
the<00:01:16.060> center<00:01:16.300> where<00:01:17.170> three<00:01:17.470> other<00:01:17.619> bridges

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
the center where three other bridges

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.410 
the center where three other bridges
will<00:01:18.190> lead<00:01:18.369> off<00:01:18.660> so<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.830> rip<00:01:21.789> out<00:01:21.910> that<00:01:21.970> first

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
will lead off so you rip out that first

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.850 
will lead off so you rip out that first

just<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.950> speed<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.280> up<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.520> bit<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:13.530> yeah

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
just to speed this up a bit and yeah

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.470 
just to speed this up a bit and yeah
continue<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.459> so<00:02:15.700> one<00:02:15.849> of<00:02:15.940> these<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.209> just<00:02:16.360> left

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
continue on so one of these I just left

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.750 
continue on so one of these I just left
as<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> half<00:02:16.959> piece<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.739> one<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.250> final<00:02:18.520> one

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
as a half piece on the one the final one

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.130 
as a half piece on the one the final one
and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:20.170> after<00:02:20.800> its<00:02:20.920> cured<00:02:21.520> or<00:02:21.879> cooled<00:02:22.209> it's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
and then after its cured or cooled it's

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.510 
and then after its cured or cooled it's
a<00:02:23.230> matter<00:02:23.379> of<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.650> peel<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.010> off

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
a matter of just peel it off

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.850 
a matter of just peel it off
so<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:25.030> we<00:02:25.120> haven't<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.900> get<00:02:26.260> off<00:02:26.379> get<00:02:26.709> rid

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
so that we haven't and get off get rid

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.820 
so that we haven't and get off get rid
of<00:02:26.920> any<00:02:27.099> wisps<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:28.390> place<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.110> thin

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
of any wisps and then place a thin

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.580 
of any wisps and then place a thin
diagonal<00:02:30.310> strip<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.270> hot<00:02:31.720> glue<00:02:31.930> across

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
diagonal strip of hot glue across

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.500 
diagonal strip of hot glue across
underneath

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
underneath

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.410 
underneath
we're<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.319> existing<00:02:34.769> hot<00:02:34.920> glue<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.730> stick

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
we're the existing hot glue is and stick

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.530 
we're the existing hot glue is and stick
in<00:02:36.599> another<00:02:36.900> two<00:02:37.799> inch<00:02:38.040> long<00:02:38.400> popsicle<00:02:39.329> stick

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
in another two inch long popsicle stick

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.160 
in another two inch long popsicle stick
there<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.829> will<00:02:41.060> hold<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.569> shape

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
there and that will hold it in shape

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.819 
there and that will hold it in shape
then<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:44.010> line<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.549> hot<00:02:44.670> glue<00:02:44.819> on<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.829> step

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
then a line of hot glue on the step

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.890 
then a line of hot glue on the step
entering<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.030> central<00:02:48.390> column<00:02:48.569> on

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
entering and on the central column on

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.470 
entering and on the central column on
the<00:02:49.230> cardboard<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.819> it's<00:02:51.000> not<00:02:51.209> long

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the cardboard and if it's not long

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.160 
the cardboard and if it's not long
enough<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:52.170> place<00:02:52.560> extra<00:02:52.890> pieces<00:02:53.459> of

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
enough just place extra pieces of

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.649 
enough just place extra pieces of
popsicle<00:02:55.170> sticks<00:02:55.440> there<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:57.090> extend<00:02:57.329> the

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
popsicle sticks there to extend the

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.680 
popsicle sticks there to extend the
bridge<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.640> continue<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.790> all<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.569> way

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
bridge and continue this all the way

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.550 
bridge and continue this all the way
around<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:02.700> small<00:03:03.450> line<00:03:03.689> of<00:03:03.870> hot<00:03:03.989> glue<00:03:04.140> and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
around just a small line of hot glue and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.140 
around just a small line of hot glue and
continue<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.400> there<00:03:05.609> if<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:05.940> need

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
continue that and if there if you need

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.960 
continue that and if there if you need
to<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.599> extend<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.109> by<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.470> adding

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
to you can extend it by just adding

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.300 
to you can extend it by just adding
popsicle<00:03:08.970> sticks<00:03:09.209> as<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.750> go<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.739> just<00:03:10.769> all

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
popsicle sticks as you go so just all

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.160 
popsicle sticks as you go so just all
the<00:03:11.549> way<00:03:11.639> around<00:03:11.849> north<00:03:12.120> south<00:03:12.359> east<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.139> west

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the way around north south east and west

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.309 
the way around north south east and west
so<00:03:14.099> these<00:03:14.340> are<00:03:14.549> forming<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.299> bridges<00:03:16.109> now<00:03:16.139> you

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
so these are forming the bridges now you

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.780 
so these are forming the bridges now you
can<00:03:16.530> basically<00:03:16.769> if<00:03:17.069> you<00:03:17.129> wanted<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.670> could

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
can basically if you wanted to you could

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.509 
can basically if you wanted to you could
make<00:03:17.970> these<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.180> bit<00:03:18.389> more<00:03:19.170> rickety<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.040> cut

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
make these a bit more rickety and cut

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.780 
make these a bit more rickety and cut
them<00:03:20.639> up<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.090> do<00:03:21.389> whatever<00:03:21.599> you<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.790> you

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
them up and do whatever you like but you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.640 
them up and do whatever you like but you
know<00:03:23.879> that's<00:03:24.030> totally<00:03:24.510> up<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.620> how

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
know that's totally up to you as to how

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.680 
know that's totally up to you as to how
you<00:03:25.769> wish<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.370> do<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.609> so<00:03:27.180> now<00:03:27.269> it's<00:03:27.420> taking

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
you wish to do it so now it's taking

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.490 
you wish to do it so now it's taking
shape<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.989> we're<00:03:28.109> going<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.260> grab<00:03:28.470> some

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
shape and we're going to grab some

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.250 
shape and we're going to grab some
matchsticks<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.790> these<00:03:30.180> are<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> craft

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
matchsticks so these are a craft

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.629 
matchsticks so these are a craft
matchsticks<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.859> have<00:03:32.040> no<00:03:32.159> heads<00:03:32.370> on<00:03:32.489> them

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
matchsticks that have no heads on them

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.780 
matchsticks that have no heads on them
they<00:03:33.329> are<00:03:33.359> 2<00:03:34.049> inches<00:03:34.230> wise<00:03:34.590> 5<00:03:34.980> centimeters<00:03:35.609> and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
they are 2 inches wise 5 centimeters and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.789 
they are 2 inches wise 5 centimeters and
I'm<00:03:36.450> cutting<00:03:36.629> them<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:36.989> half<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.470> then<00:03:37.560> in

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
I'm cutting them in half and then in

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.589 
I'm cutting them in half and then in
half<00:03:37.829> again<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:38.519> we're<00:03:39.359> going<00:03:39.449> to<00:03:39.510> have

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
half again so we're going to have

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.470 
half again so we're going to have
quarters<00:03:40.199> so<00:03:41.160> these<00:03:41.280> will<00:03:41.489> be<00:03:41.519> half<00:03:41.970> an<00:03:42.209> inch

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
quarters so these will be half an inch

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.250 
quarters so these will be half an inch
each<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.169> then<00:03:43.980> I'm<00:03:44.099> just<00:03:44.250> going<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:45.260> use

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
each and then I'm just going to use

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.849 
each and then I'm just going to use
those<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.859> create<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:48.269> little<00:03:51.079> pylons<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.230> to

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
those to create a little pylons to to

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.900 
those to create a little pylons to to
attach<00:03:54.889> handrails<00:03:55.889> on<00:03:56.220> now<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.489> handrails

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
attach handrails on now the handrails

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.990 
attach handrails on now the handrails
again<00:03:57.120> we<00:03:57.239> actual<00:03:57.540> rope<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.730> know<00:03:59.849> it'll

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
again we actual rope so you know it'll

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.759 
again we actual rope so you know it'll
be<00:04:00.060> ropes<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.690> people<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.049> hold<00:04:01.379> on<00:04:01.590> to

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
be ropes that people can hold on to

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.770 
be ropes that people can hold on to
while<00:04:01.889> they're<00:04:02.069> crossing<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.699> bridge<00:04:02.819> so

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
while they're crossing the bridge so

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.360 
while they're crossing the bridge so
it's<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:04.139> matter<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.410> just<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.680> blob<00:04:04.919> of<00:04:04.949> hot<00:04:05.220> glue

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
it's a matter of just a blob of hot glue

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.099 
it's a matter of just a blob of hot glue
and<00:04:05.790> stick<00:04:06.569> down<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.430> little<00:04:08.430> pylons<00:04:09.109> poles

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
and stick down the little pylons poles

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.529 
using boots of speed to jump ahead here
and<00:04:22.199> then<00:04:23.099> just<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.789> center<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.330> each

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
bridge as well I've also placed one

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.790 
bridge as well I've also placed one
again<00:04:27.570> it's<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.810> matter<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.080> just<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.380> blob<00:04:28.680> of

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
again it's a matter of just a blob of

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.129 
again it's a matter of just a blob of
hot<00:04:29.010> glue<00:04:29.159> and<00:04:29.580> then<00:04:30.330> stick<00:04:30.599> down<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.930> pole

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
hot glue and then stick down the pole

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.310 
hot glue and then stick down the pole
and<00:04:31.669> just<00:04:32.669> give<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.120> few<00:04:33.150> moments<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:34.020> cure

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
and just give it a few moments to cure

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.900 
and just give it a few moments to cure
so<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.310> it's<00:04:35.520> hole<00:04:35.789> held<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.539> place

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
so that it's hole held in place

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.270 
so that it's hole held in place
and<00:04:38.150> firmly<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:39.560> now<00:04:39.830> we're<00:04:39.950> gonna<00:04:40.040> grab<00:04:40.160> some

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
and firmly so now we're gonna grab some

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.800 
and firmly so now we're gonna grab some
string<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.360> you're<00:04:41.450> going<00:04:41.480> to<00:04:41.630> want<00:04:41.780> to

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
string and you're going to want to

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.390 
string and you're going to want to
measure<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.260> make<00:04:42.560> sure<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.070> string<00:04:43.340> is

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
measure to make sure that the string is

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.010 
measure to make sure that the string is
long<00:04:43.610> enough<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:43.970> cover<00:04:44.180> each<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.570> pylons

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
long enough to cover each of the pylons

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.200 
long enough to cover each of the pylons
from<00:04:45.230> the<00:04:45.620> from<00:04:46.280> each<00:04:46.550> side<00:04:46.820> of<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.030> bridge

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
from the from each side of the bridge

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.930 
from the from each side of the bridge
and<00:04:47.540> then<00:04:48.230> you're<00:04:48.350> going<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.590> unwind<00:04:49.130> the

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
and then you're going to unwind the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.060 
and then you're going to unwind the
string<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.480> pull<00:04:50.540> apart<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:51.890> you've<00:04:52.040> got

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
string and pull apart so that you've got

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.670 
string and pull apart so that you've got
several<00:04:52.700> different<00:04:52.900> strands<00:04:53.900> now<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.440> depends

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
several different strands now it depends

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.780 
several different strands now it depends
on<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.860> string<00:04:55.070> that<00:04:55.160> you're<00:04:55.280> using<00:04:55.490> as<00:04:55.700> to

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
on the string that you're using as to

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.010 
on the string that you're using as to
how<00:04:55.880> many<00:04:56.060> strands<00:04:56.330> you're<00:04:56.480> going<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.690> get<00:04:56.810> I

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
how many strands you're going to get I

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.200 
how many strands you're going to get I
like<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.830> leave<00:04:58.100> at<00:04:58.250> least<00:04:58.460> two<00:04:58.700> strands

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
like to leave at least two strands

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.720 
like to leave at least two strands
intertwined<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.080> then<00:05:00.860> blog<00:05:01.280> with<00:05:01.400> hot<00:05:01.520> glue

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
intertwined and then blog with hot glue

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.870 
intertwined and then blog with hot glue
on<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.970> top<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.270> each<00:05:02.360> pole<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:03.640> drop<00:05:04.640> down

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
on the top of each pole and drop down

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.440 
on the top of each pole and drop down
the<00:05:05.380> strands<00:05:06.380> into<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:07.120> there<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.240> go

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
the strands into that and there you go

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.770 
the strands into that and there you go
so<00:05:08.810> there's<00:05:09.200> your<00:05:09.440> rope<00:05:09.680> and<00:05:10.600> somewhat<00:05:11.600> to

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
so there's your rope and somewhat to

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.780 
so there's your rope and somewhat to
scale<00:05:12.020> now<00:05:12.740> you<00:05:12.800> can<00:05:13.100> just<00:05:13.220> leave<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.520> string

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
scale now you can just leave the string

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.610 
scale now you can just leave the string
as<00:05:13.970> is<00:05:14.390> you<00:05:14.570> don't<00:05:14.750> have<00:05:14.930> to<00:05:15.080> break<00:05:15.230> it<00:05:15.410> up<00:05:15.470> if

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
as is you don't have to break it up if

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.820 
as is you don't have to break it up if
you<00:05:15.650> don't<00:05:15.710> want<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.450> but<00:05:17.450> you<00:05:17.870> know<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:18.140> just<00:05:18.470> do

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
you don't want to but you know I just do

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.080 
you don't want to but you know I just do
it<00:05:18.920> that<00:05:19.010> way<00:05:19.160> because<00:05:19.340> it's<00:05:19.610> at<00:05:19.730> least<00:05:19.910> a

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
it that way because it's at least a

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.990 
it that way because it's at least a
little<00:05:20.180> bit<00:05:20.360> more<00:05:20.570> to<00:05:20.900> scale<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:22.610> continue

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
little bit more to scale so continue

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.900 
little bit more to scale so continue
that<00:05:23.150> all<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.420> way<00:05:23.570> around<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.350> so<00:05:24.610> on<00:05:25.610> all

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
that all the way around and so on all

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.750 
that all the way around and so on all
eight<00:05:26.290> sections<00:05:27.290> and<00:05:27.590> then<00:05:27.830> I<00:05:28.070> place<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.430> bulb

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
eight sections and then I place a bulb

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.060 
eight sections and then I place a bulb
of<00:05:28.880> hot<00:05:29.030> glue<00:05:29.150> on<00:05:29.270> top<00:05:29.630> again<00:05:30.200> just<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.920> hold

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
of hot glue on top again just to hold

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.430 
of hot glue on top again just to hold
everything<00:05:31.370> in<00:05:31.610> place<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.120> then<00:05:32.720> just<00:05:32.960> snip

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
everything in place and then just snip

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.130 
everything in place and then just snip
off<00:05:33.590> the<00:05:33.830> excess<00:05:34.280> bits<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.730> string<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.900> that

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
off the excess bits of string so that

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.570 
off the excess bits of string so that
you're<00:05:36.890> clearing<00:05:37.370> up<00:05:37.520> everything<00:05:38.120> that's

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
you're clearing up everything that's

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.850 
you're clearing up everything that's
gone<00:05:40.580> overboard<00:05:40.940> right<00:05:41.540> so<00:05:42.410> that's<00:05:42.530> what<00:05:42.740> it

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
gone overboard right so that's what it

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.710 
gone overboard right so that's what it
looks<00:05:43.010> like<00:05:43.220> now<00:05:43.490> essentially<00:05:44.210> just<00:05:44.390> needs<00:05:44.600> to

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
looks like now essentially just needs to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.370 
looks like now essentially just needs to
be<00:05:44.840> painted<00:05:45.520> and<00:05:46.520> you<00:05:46.880> can<00:05:47.170> do<00:05:48.170> a<00:05:48.200> wide

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
be painted and you can do a wide

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.510 
be painted and you can do a wide
selection<00:05:48.830> of<00:05:48.860> what's<00:05:49.040> underneath<00:05:49.340> the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
selection of what's underneath the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.180 
selection of what's underneath the
bridge<00:05:49.700> but<00:05:49.850> I<00:05:49.970> tend<00:05:50.300> to<00:05:50.360> use<00:05:50.510> darkness<00:05:51.190> so

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
bridge but I tend to use darkness so

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.650 
bridge but I tend to use darkness so
that's<00:05:52.580> what<00:05:52.790> you<00:05:52.940> can<00:05:53.060> see<00:05:53.240> here<00:05:53.270> in<00:05:53.600> a

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
that's what you can see here in a

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.080 
that's what you can see here in a
previous<00:05:54.080> version<00:05:54.260> that<00:05:54.590> I<00:05:54.680> made<00:05:54.890> and<00:05:55.190> the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090
