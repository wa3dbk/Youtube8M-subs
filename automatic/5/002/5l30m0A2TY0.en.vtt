freedom colors the firebox lightning

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.519 
freedom colors the firebox lightning
which<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.170> no<00:00:29.349> slow<00:00:29.740> slow<00:00:30.250> that<00:00:30.640> slightly<00:00:31.529> down

which is no slow slow that slightly down
graded<00:00:32.890> on<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.730> cpu<00:00:34.270> but<00:00:34.930> this<00:00:35.500> one<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:35.830> stable

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
graded on the cpu but this one is stable

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.300 
graded on the cpu but this one is stable
o'clock<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:37.200> 3.8<00:00:38.200> gigahertz<00:00:38.530> on<00:00:39.130> the

o'clock to 3.8 gigahertz on the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.300 
o'clock to 3.8 gigahertz on the
processor<00:00:39.880> so<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:41.350> firebox<00:00:41.710> is<00:00:41.950> going<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.160> run

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
processor so the firebox is going to run

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.530 
processor so the firebox is going to run
a<00:00:42.340> little<00:00:42.520> bit<00:00:42.670> more<00:00:42.880> faster<00:00:43.330> than<00:00:43.450> the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
a little bit more faster than the

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.560 
a little bit more faster than the
lightning<00:00:44.220> but<00:00:45.220> nonetheless<00:00:45.430> if<00:00:46.120> you<00:00:46.390> bought

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
lightning but nonetheless if you bought

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.510 
lightning but nonetheless if you bought
the<00:00:46.600> Lightning<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.230> can<00:00:47.380> probably<00:00:47.590> overclock

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
the Lightning you can probably overclock

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.110 
the Lightning you can probably overclock
it<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:48.880> 3.8<00:00:49.510> gigahertz<00:00:49.960> processor<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.820> make<00:00:51.970> up

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
it to 3.8 gigahertz processor to make up

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.080 
it to 3.8 gigahertz processor to make up
for<00:00:52.150> difference<00:00:52.660> but<00:00:53.550> yeah<00:00:54.550> it's<00:00:54.730> go<00:00:54.850> straight

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
for difference but yeah it's go straight

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.000 
for difference but yeah it's go straight
into<00:00:55.180> it<00:00:55.300> on<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:56.080> front<00:00:56.260> as<00:00:56.500> you<00:00:56.590> can<00:00:56.710> see<00:00:56.860> it's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
into it on the front as you can see it's

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.750 
into it on the front as you can see it's
nice<00:00:57.160> and<00:00:57.220> green<00:00:58.860> because<00:00:59.860> it<00:00:59.980> is<00:01:00.040> a<00:01:00.070> 50<00:01:00.370> mb<00:01:00.670> of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
nice and green because it is a 50 mb of

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.600 
nice and green because it is a 50 mb of
course<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.270> then<00:01:01.740> you<00:01:02.740> can<00:01:02.890> see<00:01:03.100> here<00:01:03.430> it's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
course and then you can see here it's

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.709 
course and then you can see here it's
got<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.850> temperature<00:01:04.269> reading<00:01:04.799> minds<00:01:05.799> day<00:01:06.070> at

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
got the temperature reading minds day at

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.630 
got the temperature reading minds day at
23.4<00:01:07.719> obviously<00:01:08.649> if<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.859> load<00:01:09.009> up<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.250> game<00:01:09.429> it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
23.4 obviously if you load up a game it

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.899 
23.4 obviously if you load up a game it
got<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.880> little<00:01:10.119> bit<00:01:11.130> power<00:01:12.130> times<00:01:12.429> only<00:01:12.729> been

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
got a little bit power times only been

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.039 
got a little bit power times only been
on<00:01:13.030> for<00:01:13.090> 21<00:01:13.570> minutes<00:01:13.719> and<00:01:14.109> the<00:01:14.469> RPM<00:01:15.189> is<00:01:15.549> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
on for 21 minutes and the RPM is a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.239 
on for 21 minutes and the RPM is a
thousand<00:01:17.609> so<00:01:18.609> on<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.450> top<00:01:19.659> we<00:01:20.170> have<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.409> slot

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
thousand so on the top we have a slot

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:22.830 
thousand so on the top we have a slot
for<00:01:21.310> your<00:01:21.579> headphones<00:01:21.909> lock<00:01:22.240> your<00:01:22.420> microphone

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
for your headphones lock your microphone

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.969 
for your headphones lock your microphone

in which is why I do sometimes and then

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.580 
in which is why I do sometimes and then
on<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.859> side<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:43.329> where<00:01:43.600> it's<00:01:44.020> nice<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:44.289> green

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
on the side is where it's nice and green

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.399 
on the side is where it's nice and green
as<00:01:44.710> well<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.569> can't<00:01:46.749> see<00:01:47.049> into<00:01:47.170> it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
as well and then you can't see into it

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.980 
as well and then you can't see into it
but<00:01:47.920> it's<00:01:48.249> kind<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.490> hard<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.179> I<00:01:49.600> really<00:01:49.810> can't

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
but it's kind of hard and I really can't

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.859 
but it's kind of hard and I really can't
be<00:01:50.049> asked<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.289> open<00:01:50.439> up<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.850> it's<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.329> really

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
be asked to open up but it's a really

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.149 
be asked to open up but it's a really
nice<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.170> tidy<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:53.499> there<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.710> cables<00:01:54.069> are

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
nice and tidy and there the cables are

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.389 
nice and tidy and there the cables are
put<00:01:54.310> away<00:01:54.429> nice<00:01:54.749> you<00:01:55.749> are<00:01:55.929> one<00:01:56.319> van<00:01:56.889> running<00:01:57.249> on

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
put away nice you are one van running on

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.010 
put away nice you are one van running on
the<00:01:57.490> side<00:01:57.700> and<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:01.060> ruin<00:02:01.389> ringing<00:02:01.840> really

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
the side and it's ruin ringing really

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.359 
the side and it's ruin ringing really
nice<00:02:02.139> machine<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.649> on<00:02:02.709> the<00:02:02.799> other<00:02:02.889> side<00:02:03.159> it's

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
nice machine and on the other side it's

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.469 
nice machine and on the other side it's
a<00:02:03.520> plain<00:02:03.969> black<00:02:04.270> case<00:02:04.869> in<00:02:06.119> actually<00:02:07.119> open<00:02:07.389> this

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
a plain black case in actually open this

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.480 
a plain black case in actually open this
up<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.959> all<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:08.920> there<00:02:09.190> is<00:02:09.340> genetic

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
up and all it is in there is genetic
