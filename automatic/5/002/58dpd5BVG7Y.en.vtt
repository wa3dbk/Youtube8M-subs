trust<00:01:54.570> key<00:01:54.689> pair<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.049> pliers<00:01:55.320> because<00:01:55.740> you're

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
trust key pair of pliers because you're

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.550 
trust key pair of pliers because you're
going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> need<00:01:56.219> them<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.640> stuff

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
going to need them for this stuff

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
going to need them for this stuff
actually<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.860> make<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.280> loop<00:01:59.399> right

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
actually you make a little loop right

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
actually you make a little loop right
see<00:02:00.899> how<00:02:00.960> flexible<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.619> wants<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.070> bounce

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
see how flexible it is wants to bounce

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.149 
see how flexible it is wants to bounce
back<00:02:03.350> you're<00:02:04.350> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> crimp<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> middle

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
back you're going to crimp the middle

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.600 
back you're going to crimp the middle
with<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> pliers<00:02:06.170> like<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.369> you're<00:02:08.489> going

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
with the pliers like so and you're going

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.010 
with the pliers like so and you're going
to<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.849> loop<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.509> you're<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
to take the loop and you're going to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.400 
to take the loop and you're going to
twist<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
twist it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.480 
twist it
hype<00:02:14.020> four<00:02:15.020> or<00:02:15.140> five<00:02:15.320> wraps<00:02:15.620> maybe<00:02:15.950> six<00:02:16.250> wraps

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
hype four or five wraps maybe six wraps

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.180 
hype four or five wraps maybe six wraps
depending<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:17.030> how<00:02:17.180> small<00:02:17.450> loop<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.860> loop<00:02:19.010> is

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
depending on how small loop the loop is

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.680 
depending on how small loop the loop is
how<00:02:19.490> small<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.820> want<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> loop<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.420> doesn't

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
how small you want to loop it doesn't

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.380 
how small you want to loop it doesn't
need<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.900> go<00:02:21.020> crazy<00:02:21.260> see<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:22.120> guitar<00:02:23.120> string

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
need to go crazy see that guitar string

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.820 
need to go crazy see that guitar string
actually<00:02:23.690> works<00:02:23.840> great<00:02:24.080> see<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.560> look<00:02:24.710> how

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
actually works great see that look how

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.110 
actually works great see that look how
clean<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.430> look<00:02:25.610> how<00:02:25.730> nice<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:25.940> is

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
clean it is look how nice that is

to take your other end of your wire and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.230 
to take your other end of your wire and
you're<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.100> put<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.430> through<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.000> first

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
you're going to put it through the first

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.270 
you're going to put it through the first
initial<00:02:56.540> loop<00:02:56.870> all<00:02:57.800> right<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.040> see<00:02:58.190> where

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
initial loop all right you see where

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.350 
initial loop all right you see where
this<00:02:58.340> concepts<00:02:58.790> going<00:03:00.100> there<00:03:01.100> you<00:03:01.190> go<00:03:01.360> they

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
this concepts going there you go they

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.820 
this concepts going there you go they
like<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:02.750> make<00:03:02.990> a<00:03:03.020> loop<00:03:03.170> like<00:03:03.230> there<00:03:03.590> then

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
like that make a loop like there then

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.980 
like that make a loop like there then
you're<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.070> come<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.490> other<00:03:04.640> end

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
you're going to come to the other end

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.320 
you're going to come to the other end
the<00:03:05.990> other<00:03:06.140> end<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.440> wire<00:03:06.470> that's<00:03:06.830> bear

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
the other end of the wire that's bear

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.360 
the other end of the wire that's bear
you're<00:03:08.330> going<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.510> do<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> same<00:03:08.870> thing<00:03:09.370> we're

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
you're going to do the same thing we're

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:19.300 
you're going to do the same thing we're
going<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:11.140> bend<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:13.989> hold<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.050> in<00:03:15.170> place<00:03:18.310> crimp

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
going to bend it hold it in place crimp

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.160 
going to bend it hold it in place crimp
it<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.610> your<00:03:19.730> pliers<00:03:19.880> like<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:21.530> did<00:03:23.170> okay

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
it with your pliers like I just did okay

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.710 
it with your pliers like I just did okay
then<00:03:24.380> you're<00:03:24.470> going<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.650> grab<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.040> end<00:03:25.720> start

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
then you're going to grab the end start

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.280 
then you're going to grab the end start
twisting<00:03:28.270> get<00:03:29.270> a<00:03:29.330> couple<00:03:29.630> loops<00:03:29.780> on<00:03:30.020> here<00:03:30.200> I

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
twisting get a couple loops on here I

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.479 
twisting get a couple loops on here I
generally<00:03:30.890> make<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:33.170> leading<00:03:33.470> end<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:34.370> end

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
generally make the leading end the end

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.680 
generally make the leading end the end
you're<00:03:34.610> going<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.790> tie<00:03:34.910> something<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.450> and

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
you're going to tie something to and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.600 
you're going to tie something to and
touch<00:03:35.840> something<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.410> whatever<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.459> prefer

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
touch something to whatever you prefer

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.920 
touch something to whatever you prefer
to<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.000> animal<00:03:38.239> doesn't<00:03:38.420> get<00:03:38.600> away<00:03:38.690> I

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
to the animal doesn't get away I

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.509 
to the animal doesn't get away I
generally<00:03:39.530> make<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.950> smaller<00:03:40.280> loop

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
generally make that a smaller loop

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.320 
generally make that a smaller loop
because<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.850> doesn't<00:03:41.090> need<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.209> be<00:03:41.330> big<00:03:43.330> so

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
because it doesn't need to be big so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.240 
because it doesn't need to be big so
check<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.600> out<00:03:44.780> yeah<00:03:45.580> damn<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.860> trust<00:03:49.160> me

snares with heavier wire and as it has

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.070 
snares with heavier wire and as it has
the<00:04:57.310> tendency<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.820> want<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.210> slide<00:04:59.419> back<00:04:59.810> up

the tendency to want to slide back up
the<00:05:00.229> wire<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.099> other<00:05:01.340> loop<00:05:01.550> being<00:05:02.090> that's

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
the wire to the other loop being that's

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.659 
the wire to the other loop being that's
flexible<00:05:02.800> so<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.830> can<00:05:04.099> do<00:05:04.190> is<00:05:04.310> you<00:05:04.370> can<00:05:04.430> slide

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
flexible so you can do is you can slide

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.879 
flexible so you can do is you can slide

wire<00:05:18.340> you're<00:05:19.340> going<00:05:19.490> to<00:05:19.550> set<00:05:19.759> it<00:05:19.789> all<00:05:20.150> right

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
wire you're going to set it all right

now<00:05:20.570> you're<00:05:20.690> gonna<00:05:20.810> hold<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.080> with<00:05:21.199> your

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
now you're gonna hold it with your

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.589 
now you're gonna hold it with your
fingers<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.650> right<00:05:22.099> above<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.550> joint<00:05:23.000> where

fingers and right above the joint where

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.360 
fingers and right above the joint where
the<00:05:23.630> loop<00:05:23.870> connects<00:05:24.199> to<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.410> wire<00:05:24.560> you're

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
the loop connects to the wire you're

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.620 
the loop connects to the wire you're
going<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.550> put<00:05:25.699> a<00:05:25.729> little<00:05:25.789> piece<00:05:26.060> of<00:05:26.180> wire<00:05:26.330> wrap

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
going to put a little piece of wire wrap

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.540 
going to put a little piece of wire wrap
it<00:05:26.750> around<00:05:26.840> so<00:05:27.289> it<00:05:27.409> can't<00:05:27.590> go<00:05:27.710> past<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.370> loop

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
it around so it can't go past the loop

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.760 
it around so it can't go past the loop
and<00:05:28.810> that'll<00:05:29.810> be<00:05:29.930> set<00:05:30.139> because<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.620> won't

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
and that'll be set because it won't

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.640 
and that'll be set because it won't
effect<00:05:31.099> of<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.849> closing<00:05:32.120> of<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:32.599> of<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:33.380> trap

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
just remember you make a loop crimp it

i<00:05:56.150> said<00:05:56.210> if<00:05:56.419> you<00:05:56.479> don't<00:05:56.599> want<00:05:56.720> it<00:05:56.780> to<00:05:56.840> slide<00:05:56.990> up

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
i said if you don't want it to slide up

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.370 
i said if you don't want it to slide up
and<00:05:57.169> down<00:05:57.259> you<00:05:57.919> can<00:05:58.099> set<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.810> new<00:05:59.810> size<00:06:00.080> and

and down you can set the new size and

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.450 
and down you can set the new size and
then<00:06:00.470> put<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.620> little<00:06:00.770> piece<00:06:00.919> of<00:06:01.039> wire<00:06:01.190> there

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
then put a little piece of wire there

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.020 
then put a little piece of wire there
keep<00:06:02.150> it<00:06:02.240> from<00:06:02.360> sliding<00:06:02.599> makes<00:06:03.380> life<00:06:03.620> easier

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
keep it from sliding makes life easier
