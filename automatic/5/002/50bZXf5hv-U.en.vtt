00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.250
 is no news to any of us who 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.630
 Health in Brazil is our 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.630
 health is sick 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.690
 that same health our system of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.210
 health is really sick and I wanted to 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 share with you this theme of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 Our health, I wanted to talk to 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 you strike a conversation and reflect a bit 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.480
 to what extent this system of ours 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.890
 health it ends up being driven by 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.809
 economic interests 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.430
 maybe someone asks me more chaos like 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.219
 So how can anyone have 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.210
 interest that the health system be 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.980
 even worst 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 the mec can someone want people 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.620
 died in the corridors can not somebody 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.750
 that public hospitals should be 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.570
 in a precarious situation the patients 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.059
 worsening plays to the upcoming number 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.010
 points in hospital corridors in the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.750
 my point of view the answer seems 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.910
 to the extent that our system 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.000
 health is getting worse and worse 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.400
 This compels people even those who 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.330
 you can not afford to run 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.189
 behind a system to unimed a hymn 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.340
 I know what to be able to have a care 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.229
 little better with this the health plans 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020
 are growing and doctors are also 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.930
 gaining in the private and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.900
 Who loses it is that you lose it. 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.900
 and it is that loses with all of us 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.030
 we lose with this is in this context of 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.250
 precarious health of hospitals 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.500
 public that I wanted to put this 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.990
 news and video where a nurse 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.360
 is dancing on the desktop 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.689
 she is in her uniform and started dancing 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.520
 and the friends filmed her dancing to the valley 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.770
 remember that at no time does this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.799
 nurse was filmed mistreating 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.369
 someone in the hospital responding to your 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.840
 any of it was filmed 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.869
 dancing and no time was also 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.880
 affirmed that she danced in the file 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.469
 or at the time it was 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.320
 to be serving someone I wanted 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.810
 Enjoy this video to congratulate 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.100
 nurses and nurses who work 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.810
 in private hospitals as well as in 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.730
 the publics I'm sure that some 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.460
 of you have already been treated in hospitals 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.940
 especially the public and saw 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.460
 these scrappy people work hard and 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.670
 stresses this 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.160
 suffering and profound stress and how 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.250
 any institution to the army to 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.670
 police the churches the government congress 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.140
 all have their rotten fruit but the great 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.460
 majority are good excellent 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.950
 professionals 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.950
 It's very risky to judge someone 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.870
 or judge a category or judge all 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.780
 the nurses because of an error of 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.050
 one or the other but this nurse who 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.970
 was filmed dancing I would be judging 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.610
 condemning this official does not 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.610
 I'm judging the nurse even because 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.100
 no details of what happened is very 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.290
 precipitate we're throwing someone 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.170
 which was only allowed for dancing 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.270
 and appeared in the filming people like me 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.280
 said before that he went to 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.100
 at one time or another in hospitals 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.860
 aware of the work and of the three 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.600
 nurses and nurses. 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.090
 the nurses who put their hands 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.840
 mass are they who take the person after 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.000
 who dies 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.160
 it is they who go there or call the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.860
 another official, all merit to the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.080
 doctors and medical but also the merit 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.050
 to nurses and nurses who 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.840
 even with wages of misery so there 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.390
 striving in a situation that many of 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.340
 we would not dare to do as I did 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.290
 I told you in other videos all the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.900
 Sometimes a matter such as this one comes out 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.370
 I go there and give a 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.230
 look at the comments 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.360
 and of course many comments 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.490
 defended the nurse and other 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.830
 accused as being the worst 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.660
 launching the environment of 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.390
 work and in that sense I wanted to 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.910
 share some questions with you 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.250
 This nurse was filmed attending 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.680
 ill a patient that nurse has in 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.230
 your work history but series of 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.800
 negative practices how many doctors in the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.790
 Brazil make medical mistakes and are not 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.710
 dismissed 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.350
 how many hospital directors were 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.180
 dismissed or expelled by a bad 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.889
 management in my point of view 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.379
 we have to be careful and xu 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.689
 professional who is a salary 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.159
 millions of Brazilians who depend 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:30.349
 of those salaries depends on that 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.629
 money is helping a lot of people in the 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.490
 hospitals that we have and there 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.529
 I make it very clear whoever is 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.080
 I caught red-handed a nurse who 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.870
 you are mistreating a patient who is 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.930
 being negligent for sure this our 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.090
 channel here will be a point of complaint 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.639
 against those feet of the professionals of the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.550
 same way this same channel will be a 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.960
 defense of good professionals 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.669
 health area 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.039
 before this matter on this 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.020
 It's up to the 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.509
 we at the moment of stress in the environment 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.969
 does not play with the other does not 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:08.000
 make a joke do not try to relax and 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:10.939
 manage your own 3 so you can 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.560
 then better serve your target audience 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:16.069
 something we can not forget 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.529
 who is actually dancing in this country is 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:21.020
 the poor who can not afford an insurance 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.360
 health and much less a consultation 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.349
 privately and while we are 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.080
 dancing there in the congress are 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.120
 applauding and seeing the cabin is 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.719
 happening to the sick of our 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.759
 Brazil 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.219

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.979
 physical and psychological insalubrity 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:41.979
 being outside his kant file and 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.620
 because the old saying goes. 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:48.080

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.300
