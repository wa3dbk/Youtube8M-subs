fault<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> trick<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:21.109> go<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.690 

the<00:01:11.079> alternative<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.070> disconnect<00:01:12.579> the

the alternative is to disconnect the

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
battery on the quick release every time

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.609 
battery on the quick release every time
but<00:01:15.310> on<00:01:15.460> these<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:16.030> key<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.869> apparently<00:01:17.409> is

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
but on these the key it apparently is

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.919 
but on these the key it apparently is
synchronized<00:01:18.280> so<00:01:18.850> if<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.149> did<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.420> on

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
synchronized so if you did that on

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.590 
synchronized so if you did that on
return<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:21.130> would<00:01:21.189> have<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.460> put<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.729> key<00:01:21.969> in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
return you would have to put the key in

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.620 
return you would have to put the key in
the<00:01:22.960> ignition<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:24.250> two<00:01:24.429> minutes<00:01:24.850> for<00:01:25.509> it<00:01:25.569> to

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
the ignition for two minutes for it to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.200 
the ignition for two minutes for it to
talk<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.380> computer<00:01:26.939> synchronize<00:01:27.939> and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
talk to the computer synchronize and

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.199 
talk to the computer synchronize and
then<00:01:28.479> she'll<00:01:28.689> start<00:01:28.990> so<00:01:29.799> we've<00:01:30.700> found<00:01:30.850> it's<00:01:31.090> a

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
then she'll start so we've found it's a

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.449 
then she'll start so we've found it's a
lot<00:01:31.360> easier<00:01:31.689> just<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:32.350> disconnect<00:01:32.860> this<00:01:33.009> 20

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459
