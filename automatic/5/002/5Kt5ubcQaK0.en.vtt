hey what's up there do you sell fish

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.679 
hey what's up there do you sell fish
today<00:00:02.010> I'm<00:00:02.190> going<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.490> do<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> quickly<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.570> show

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
today I'm going to do a quickly and show

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.030 
today I'm going to do a quickly and show
you<00:00:03.750> how<00:00:03.959> you<00:00:04.020> can<00:00:04.290> test<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.710> diagnose

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
you how you can test and diagnose

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.099 
you how you can test and diagnose
problems<00:00:05.310> with<00:00:05.520> your<00:00:05.670> PCV<00:00:06.270> system<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.870> also

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
problems with your PCV system and also

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.680 
problems with your PCV system and also
how<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.700> PCV<00:00:08.700> system<00:00:08.849> on<00:00:09.120> your<00:00:09.240> car<00:00:09.420> works

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
how the PCV system on your car works

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.620 
how the PCV system on your car works
alright<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.889> PCV<00:00:11.519> stands<00:00:11.820> for<00:00:12.059> positive

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
alright so PCV stands for positive

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.870 
alright so PCV stands for positive
crankcase<00:00:13.110> ventilation<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.130> its<00:00:14.460> job<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.849> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
crankcase ventilation and its job is to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.269 
crankcase ventilation and its job is to
relieve<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> pressure<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.710> builds<00:00:17.039> up<00:00:17.130> in

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
relieve the pressure that builds up in

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
engine it could cause oil contamination

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.160 
engine it could cause oil contamination
it<00:01:05.070> could<00:01:05.339> blow<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.880> crank<00:01:06.420> seals<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.960> can

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it could blow your crank seals you can

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.590 
it could blow your crank seals you can
share<00:01:07.439> seals<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:08.549> oil<00:01:08.760> paint<00:01:09.060> gaskets

because<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> find

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because it's just going to have to find

because it's just going to have to find
a<00:01:11.310> way<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> PCV<00:01:13.860> valve

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
a way out then if you have a PCV valve

that stuck close for example you know

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
that stuck close for example you know
it's<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> cause<00:01:17.220> those<00:01:17.460> leaks<00:01:17.729> it's

it's going to cause those leaks it's

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
it's going to cause those leaks it's
going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> contaminate<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.900> oil<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.700> maybe

going to contaminate the oil and maybe

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.929 
going to contaminate the oil and maybe
even<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.890> engine<00:01:22.890> sludge<00:01:23.159> could<00:01:23.580> happen

even the engine sludge could happen

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
even the engine sludge could happen
which<00:01:24.630> could<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.229> damage<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.770> engine<00:01:26.070> if

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
which could really damage your engine if

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.090 
which could really damage your engine if
you<00:01:26.790> let<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.360> treat<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.070> also<00:01:29.070> a

you let it go and treat it and also a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
you let it go and treat it and also a
lot<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.340> times<00:01:29.520> when<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.090> find<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.630> PCV<00:01:31.020> valve

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
lot of times when you find a PCV valve

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
lot of times when you find a PCV valve
that's<00:01:31.350> stuck<00:01:31.590> close<00:01:31.880> your<00:01:32.880> pieces<00:01:33.119> the

telltale sign that you have a PC you out
that's<00:01:41.009> stuck<00:01:41.220> close<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.670> generally

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that's stuck close because generally

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.969 
that's stuck close because generally

speaking the oil dipstick tube is

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
speaking the oil dipstick tube is
probably<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> easiest<00:01:44.670> way<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
probably the easiest way for the

let's get on to how this stuff looks on
a<00:03:24.970> car<00:03:25.240> and<00:03:26.230> how<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.740> can<00:03:26.950> test<00:03:27.160> your<00:03:27.280> PCV

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
a car and how you can test your PCV

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.780 
a car and how you can test your PCV
valve<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:29.260> know<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.470> did<00:03:29.740> when<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.610> did<00:03:30.760> a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.840 
drawing it was for a v-shaped engine but
we<00:03:33.130> got<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.310> be<00:03:33.370> doing<00:03:33.550> this<00:03:33.640> on<00:03:33.820> a

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
we got to be doing this on a

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.780 
we got to be doing this on a
four-cylinder<00:03:34.660> engine<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:36.160> know<00:03:36.280> it's

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
four-cylinder engine it you know it's

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.930 
four-cylinder engine it you know it's
works<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> same<00:03:37.360> way<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.900> gotta<00:03:38.110> have<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.940> PCV

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
works the same way you gotta have a PCV

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.820 
works the same way you gotta have a PCV
valve<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.750> guy<00:03:40.930> right<00:03:41.110> here<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.530> can<00:03:41.650> have<00:03:41.739> a

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
valve this guy right here you can have a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.280 
valve this guy right here you can have a
vacuum<00:03:42.040> hose<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.270> goes<00:03:43.330> from<00:03:43.660> your<00:03:43.780> PC<00:03:44.020> URL

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
vacuum hose that goes from your PC URL

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.350 
vacuum hose that goes from your PC URL
to<00:03:44.470> your<00:03:44.590> intake<00:03:44.890> manifold<00:03:45.400> which<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:46.030> here

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
to your intake manifold which is here

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.729 
to your intake manifold which is here
and<00:03:47.020> then<00:03:47.080> you're<00:03:47.260> gonna<00:03:47.350> have<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.500> breather

and then you're gonna have a breather

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.699 
and then you're gonna have a breather
tube<00:03:48.040> supplies<00:03:48.790> fresh<00:03:49.150> air<00:03:49.360> and<00:03:49.930> now<00:03:50.290> on<00:03:50.500> this

PCV valve and inspect it further and a

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.400 
PCV valve and inspect it further and a
lot<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.330> times<00:04:28.510> these<00:04:28.630> are<00:04:28.690> PCB<00:04:29.110> ELLs<00:04:29.260> are

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
lot of times these are PCB ELLs are

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.070 
lot of times these are PCB ELLs are
screwed<00:04:29.770> into<00:04:29.950> your<00:04:30.280> valve<00:04:30.820> cover<00:04:31.020> so<00:04:32.020> you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
screwed into your valve cover so you

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.080 
screwed into your valve cover so you
want<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.710> sometimes<00:04:33.460> you're<00:04:33.730> going<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:33.940> need<00:04:34.030> a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
want to sometimes you're going to need a

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.450 
want to sometimes you're going to need a
wrench<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.330> take<00:04:34.600> him<00:04:34.780> out<00:04:34.930> this<00:04:35.230> one<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.710> don't

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
wrench to take him out this one I don't

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.740 
wrench to take him out this one I don't
know<00:04:36.520> yet<00:04:36.730> but<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.000> don't<00:04:37.210> think<00:04:37.300> it's<00:04:37.480> screwed

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
know yet but I don't think it's screwed

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.320 
know yet but I don't think it's screwed
in<00:04:37.840> there<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.170> think<00:04:38.230> it's<00:04:38.590> just<00:04:38.710> got<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.330> rubber

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
in there I think it's just got a rubber

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.810 
in there I think it's just got a rubber
grommet<00:04:40.630> on<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.050> bottom<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:42.340> just<00:04:42.580> the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
grommet on the bottom and it's just the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.280 
grommet on the bottom and it's just the
forced<00:04:43.180> into<00:04:43.420> your<00:04:43.540> valve<00:04:43.750> cover<00:04:46.830> there<00:04:47.830> we<00:04:48.010> go

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
forced into your valve cover there we go

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.820 
forced into your valve cover there we go
all<00:04:50.290> right

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
all right

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.240

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
oil residue is normal since you know no

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.630 
oil residue is normal since you know no
matter<00:04:56.890> what<00:04:56.980> you<00:04:57.250> do

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
oil is going to get up through your PCV

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.570 
oil is going to get up through your PCV
valve<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.920> your<00:05:00.040> ante<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:00.580> now<00:05:01.510> next<00:05:02.430> we<00:05:03.430> are

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
valve to your ante so now next we are

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.100 
valve to your ante so now next we are
going<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.680> get<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:05.890> PCV<00:05:06.490> valve<00:05:06.730> off<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.900> what

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
going to get this PCV valve off and what

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.700 
going to get this PCV valve off and what
this<00:05:08.350> might<00:05:08.560> break<00:05:09.000> during<00:05:10.000> removal<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:10.990> it's

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
this might break during removal but it's

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.970 
this might break during removal but it's
okay<00:05:12.480> because<00:05:13.480> they're<00:05:13.720> only<00:05:13.900> five<00:05:14.140> bucks<00:05:14.380> and

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
okay because they're only five bucks and

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.710 
okay because they're only five bucks and
it's<00:05:15.400> time<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.760> replace<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.090> anyway

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.960

there we go all right guys and here it
is<00:05:22.120> there's<00:05:22.750> actual<00:05:23.170> lookit<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.890> PCV

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
is there's actual lookit of the PCV

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.850 
is there's actual lookit of the PCV
valve<00:05:24.670> itself<00:05:25.300> that's<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.900> balance<00:05:26.260> in<00:05:26.560> there

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
valve itself that's the balance in there

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.550 
valve itself that's the balance in there
that's<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.970> that's<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:28.990> valve<00:05:29.230> that<00:05:29.320> moves

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
that's the that's the valve that moves

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.200 
that's the that's the valve that moves
up<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:29.920> there's<00:05:30.070> vacuum<00:05:30.520> here<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:30.940> allows<00:05:31.180> a

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
up and there's vacuum here and allows a

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.650 
up and there's vacuum here and allows a
pan<00:05:32.170> case<00:05:32.580> pressure<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:34.060> be<00:05:34.180> passed<00:05:34.450> through

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
pan case pressure to be passed through

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.260 
pan case pressure to be passed through
the<00:05:34.810> smell<00:05:35.080> back<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.650> your<00:05:35.770> intake<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.340> the

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
the smell back to your intake and the

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.240 
the smell back to your intake and the
way<00:05:37.600> people<00:05:37.900> test<00:05:38.200> these<00:05:38.350> is<00:05:38.560> basically<00:05:38.980> to

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
way people test these is basically to

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.290 
way people test these is basically to
just<00:05:40.860> shake<00:05:41.860> it<00:05:41.890> and<00:05:42.160> if<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.670> valve<00:05:42.850> is<00:05:43.030> moving

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
just shake it and if the valve is moving

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.360 
just shake it and if the valve is moving
around<00:05:43.390> freely<00:05:43.900> then<00:05:44.320> it's<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.620> good<00:05:44.740> PCV<00:05:45.160> valve

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
around freely then it's a good PCV valve

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.850 
around freely then it's a good PCV valve
but<00:05:45.640> in<00:05:45.730> order<00:05:45.880> to<00:05:45.910> be<00:05:46.120> 100%<00:05:46.480> sure<00:05:46.930> we're<00:05:47.740> going

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
but in order to be 100% sure we're going

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.190 
but in order to be 100% sure we're going
to<00:05:47.920> reattach<00:05:48.190> this<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:49.030> to<00:05:49.810> our<00:05:49.900> intake

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
to reattach this to the to our intake

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.350 
to reattach this to the to our intake
and<00:05:50.530> then<00:05:51.400> we're<00:05:51.550> going<00:05:51.640> to<00:05:51.760> start<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.150> car

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
and then we're going to start the car

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.270 
and then we're going to start the car
and<00:05:52.600> then<00:05:53.410> we're<00:05:53.500> going<00:05:53.620> to<00:05:53.650> come<00:05:53.830> back<00:05:53.860> here

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
and then we're going to come back here

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.370 
and then we're going to come back here
we're<00:05:55.090> going<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.270> open<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.570> throw<00:05:55.780> and<00:05:56.020> then

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
we're going to open the throw and then

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:05.720 
we're going to open the throw and then
check<00:05:56.650> for<00:05:56.680> vacuum<00:05:57.310> here

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.780 

all<00:06:06.210> right<00:06:06.360> as<00:06:06.480> you<00:06:06.600> can<00:06:06.750> see<00:06:07.250> this<00:06:08.250> valve

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
all right as you can see this valve

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.360 
all right as you can see this valve
there's<00:06:09.030> vacuum<00:06:09.540> here<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.080> this<00:06:10.200> valve<00:06:10.470> we

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
there's vacuum here and this valve we

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.810 
there's vacuum here and this valve we
can<00:06:11.520> actually<00:06:11.640> hear<00:06:12.060> it

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.880 

you<00:06:18.120> actually<00:06:18.450> hear<00:06:18.840> it<00:06:18.900> open<00:06:19.260> and<00:06:19.350> close<00:06:19.590> so

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
you actually hear it open and close so

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.070 
you actually hear it open and close so
this<00:06:20.280> is<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:20.490> good<00:06:20.700> valve<00:06:20.970> here<00:06:21.270> this<00:06:21.510> is<00:06:21.690> if<00:06:21.960> you

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
this is a good valve here this is if you

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.560 
this is a good valve here this is if you
were<00:06:22.200> testing<00:06:22.620> this<00:06:22.770> PCD<00:06:23.160> well<00:06:23.430> we<00:06:24.210> would<00:06:24.360> call

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
were testing this PCD well we would call

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.360 
were testing this PCD well we would call
this<00:06:24.720> a<00:06:24.870> good<00:06:25.020> Bell<00:06:25.230> and<00:06:25.470> there<00:06:25.980> you<00:06:26.100> have<00:06:26.160> it

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
this a good Bell and there you have it

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.400 
this a good Bell and there you have it
folks<00:06:26.550> we<00:06:26.970> didn't<00:06:27.270> have<00:06:27.540> to<00:06:27.750> play<00:06:28.080> with<00:06:28.290> the

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
folks we didn't have to play with the

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.740 
folks we didn't have to play with the
throttle<00:06:28.680> plate<00:06:28.890> to<00:06:29.460> see<00:06:29.790> whether<00:06:29.970> that<00:06:30.150> PCV

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
throttle plate to see whether that PCV

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.750 
throttle plate to see whether that PCV
valve<00:06:30.960> was<00:06:31.110> working<00:06:31.470> or<00:06:31.590> not<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:32.070> that's

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
valve was working or not and that's

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.460 
valve was working or not and that's
really<00:06:32.970> all<00:06:33.180> there<00:06:33.360> is<00:06:33.390> to<00:06:33.480> testing<00:06:34.050> your<00:06:34.170> PCV

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
really all there is to testing your PCV

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.530 
really all there is to testing your PCV
valve<00:06:34.770> and<00:06:35.580> with<00:06:35.700> that<00:06:35.850> said<00:06:36.090> I<00:06:36.270> hope<00:06:36.420> this

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
valve and with that said I hope this

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.060 
valve and with that said I hope this
