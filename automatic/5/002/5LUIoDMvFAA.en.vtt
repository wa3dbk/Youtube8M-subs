out of the legs optimally we would like
to<00:00:49.790> do<00:00:50.030> this<00:00:50.150> on<00:00:50.330> a<00:00:50.390> roll<00:00:50.720> and<00:00:51.019> we<00:00:51.320> have<00:00:51.440> access

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
to do this on a roll and we have access

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.770 
to do this on a roll and we have access
to<00:00:52.040> a<00:00:52.070> pool<00:00:52.339> we<00:00:52.580> actually<00:00:52.970> would<00:00:53.360> do<00:00:53.570> that

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
to a pool we actually would do that

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.049 
to a pool we actually would do that
there<00:00:54.470> but<00:00:54.949> this<00:00:55.070> hotel<00:00:55.430> just<00:00:55.670> doesn't<00:00:55.909> have

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
one or we're making do with what we have

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.460 
one or we're making do with what we have
so<00:00:59.120> many<00:00:59.239> guys<00:00:59.449> losing<00:00:59.720> their<00:00:59.989> footing<00:01:00.290> last

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
so many guys losing their footing last

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.280 
so many guys losing their footing last
night<00:01:00.799> and<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:01.729> your<00:01:02.210> heels<00:01:02.479> or<00:01:02.750> your<00:01:02.780> your

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
night and so your heels or your your

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.200 
night and so your heels or your your
frontier<00:01:03.860> V<00:01:04.040> coming<00:01:04.370> out<00:01:04.489> from<00:01:04.790> under<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.000> at

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
frontier V coming out from under you at

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.000 
frontier V coming out from under you at
odd<00:01:05.360> angles<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.140> kind<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.530> put<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:06.860> into

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
odd angles and kind of put you into

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.280 
odd angles and kind of put you into
proper<00:01:07.460> position<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:08.720> just<00:01:09.049> probably

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
proper position so it just probably

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.109 
proper position so it just probably
really<00:01:09.770> it's<00:01:10.220> hard<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.520> say<00:01:10.670> but<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:10.940> probably

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
really it's hard to say but it probably

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.180 
really it's hard to say but it probably
just<00:01:11.270> depends<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.690> what<00:01:11.869> happens<00:01:12.100> for<00:01:13.100> an

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
just depends on what happens for an

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.160 
just depends on what happens for an
individual<00:01:13.790> player<00:01:14.030> throughout<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.750> game

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
think it's trained us a little bit so I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.360 
think it's trained us a little bit so I
was<00:03:06.990> concerned<00:03:07.350> with<00:03:07.650> kind<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:07.920> how<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.100> guys

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
was concerned with kind of how the guys

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.130 
was concerned with kind of how the guys
would<00:03:08.670> react<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.360> emotionally

would react to that emotionally

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.870 
would react to that emotionally
physically<00:03:10.560> what<00:03:11.220> I've<00:03:11.310> seen<00:03:11.460> over<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.700> past

is<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.360> we're<00:03:15.480> move<00:03:15.630> we've<00:03:15.750> already<00:03:15.870> moved

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
is that we're move we've already moved

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.900

match<00:03:21.030> tomorrow<00:03:21.630> night<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.260> probably<00:03:22.920> the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
match tomorrow night and so probably the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.490 
match tomorrow night and so probably the
way<00:03:23.220> we're<00:03:23.430> going<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.670> lean<00:03:24.420> right<00:03:24.990> now<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.410> my

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
way we're going to lean right now in my

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.890 
way we're going to lean right now in my
thinking<00:03:25.740> is<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.790> will<00:03:27.120> give<00:03:27.270> those<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.750> lot

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
thinking is that will give those a lot

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.710 
thinking is that will give those a lot
of<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.110> same<00:03:28.290> players<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.770> chance<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.250> react

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
of the same players a chance to react

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.530 
of the same players a chance to react
again<00:03:30.770> against<00:03:31.770> Toronto<00:03:32.160> immensely<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.420> know

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
again against Toronto immensely you know
