00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.960
 also not as work that has to miss the competition because of one 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.800
 calf injury 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.949
 definitely a better one 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.350
 and the 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.720
 perhaps 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.720
 not far from state made the ride in the round 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.820
 I think so b 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.939
 and I have no idea 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.040
 and the right training too 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.750
 We will be injured from you 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.380
 after the good 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.840
 yesterday 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840
 and in smaller ones 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.210
 it stops raining we think it's alright 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.190
 there can just play yes of course 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 Heerenveen won three at Feyenoord last season thanks to one at home 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.270
 goal of kristian bak nielsen 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.340
 victor elm made his debut with heerenveen the midfielder in the same game 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.190
 came over during the winter break from the cal mark ff we played directly in the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.460
 basic elf 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.190
 yes but the real one 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.640
 competition for heerenveen and nec 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.440
 three reasons prison 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.050
 the oldest it is a container it does quite a bit of money yes feyenoord 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.420
 to have 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.760
 scored three goals in the second 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.080
 I hope 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 I know you can open city transport 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.980
 yes fine that is 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.430
 Yes 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.820
 since 19 38, Heerenveen no longer lost at Feyenoord's own field 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.190
 On Saturday, Jan de Jonge's team will do everything they can to score points 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.970
 friesland we did not like that 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.520
 played the door very well 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.010
 only the 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.370
 17 points and that will be good enough for men 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.470
 of course we hope that again the water can be three points less 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.360
 the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.210
 hence it's nice to
