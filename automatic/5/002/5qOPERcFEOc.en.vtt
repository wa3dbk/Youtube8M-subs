power<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> overall<00:01:43.560> franchise<00:01:44.189> into<00:01:44.520> him

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
power for the overall franchise into him

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
power for the overall franchise into him
I<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.540> think<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.170> move

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
I just don't think it's the right move

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
I just don't think it's the right move
if<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:47.610> they're<00:01:47.759> doing<00:01:48.000> hopefully

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
if it is what they're doing hopefully

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.760 
if it is what they're doing hopefully
improved<00:01:48.840> wrong<00:01:49.049> anyway<00:01:49.380> mark<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
improved wrong anyway mark what do you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.109 
improved wrong anyway mark what do you
think<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.430> goes<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.090> we

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
think I think this goes back to what we

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.520 
think I think this goes back to what we
were<00:01:51.240> talking<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.840> Star<00:01:52.049> Wars<00:01:52.259> where

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
were talking about with Star Wars where

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.530 
were talking about with Star Wars where
people<00:01:52.920> were<00:01:53.009> concerned<00:01:53.399> or<00:01:53.729> maybe<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.299> they

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
people were concerned or maybe they they

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.480 
people were concerned or maybe they they
want<00:01:54.810> JJ<00:01:55.170> Abrams<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.740> involved<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.159> every

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
want JJ Abrams to be involved in every

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.859 
want JJ Abrams to be involved in every
Star<00:01:56.729> Wars<00:01:56.909> movie<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.659> no<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
Star Wars movie and it's like no you

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.660 
Star Wars movie and it's like no you
gotta<00:01:57.960> pull<00:01:58.380> back<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:58.740> he<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> director

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
gotta pull back because he is a director

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.030 
gotta pull back because he is a director
he's<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.329> closely<00:02:00.630> attached<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.500> his<00:02:01.710> film

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
he's very closely attached to his film

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.499 
he's very closely attached to his film
and<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.520> can't<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.909> him<00:02:02.969> oversee<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and you can't have him oversee the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.300 
and you can't have him oversee the
entire<00:02:03.810> universe<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.469> think<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:04.829> people<00:02:04.860> miss

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
entire universe I think what people miss

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
entire universe I think what people miss
sometimes<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.000> sometimes<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> most

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
sometimes is that sometimes the most

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.710 
sometimes is that sometimes the most
famous<00:02:07.290> person<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.890> any<00:02:08.280> given<00:02:08.879> pool<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
famous person in any given pool is the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.630 
famous person in any given pool is the
one<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> you're<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> lot

one that you're going to go to so a lot

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.920 
one that you're going to go to so a lot
of<00:02:11.670> people<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:12.150> whatever<00:02:12.270> reason<00:02:12.660> know<00:02:12.780> who

people at DC but they know who Zack

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
Snyder is same thing with Lucasfilm

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.479 
Snyder is same thing with Lucasfilm
we're<00:02:19.769> not<00:02:19.890> everybody's<00:02:20.189> gonna<00:02:20.280> know<00:02:20.459> who

Kathleen Kennedy is but they all know JJ

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.349 
Kathleen Kennedy is but they all know JJ
Abrams<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.129> one<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.489> guys<00:02:23.670> who's<00:02:24.090> bring

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
Abrams is one of the guys who's bring

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.390 
Abrams is one of the guys who's bring
his<00:02:24.540> vision<00:02:24.569> onboard<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.890> future<00:02:26.219> of<00:02:26.310> these

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
his vision onboard the future of these

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
his vision onboard the future of these
films<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:26.969> I<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:27.359> Zack<00:02:27.840> Snyder<00:02:28.109> I<00:02:28.260> don't

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
films so I think Zack Snyder I don't

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.020 
films so I think Zack Snyder I don't
think<00:02:28.739> he<00:02:28.859> should<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.280> guy<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.730> oversee

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
think he should be the guy to oversee

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.729 
think he should be the guy to oversee
the<00:02:30.150> entire<00:02:30.359> DC<00:02:30.569> Universe<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.409> don't<00:02:31.590> think

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the entire DC Universe and I don't think

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.470 
the entire DC Universe and I don't think
he<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.280> guy<00:02:32.400> he's<00:02:32.609> producing<00:02:33.030> some<00:02:33.180> films

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
he is the guy he's producing some films

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.210 
he is the guy he's producing some films
he's<00:02:33.780> got<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> great<00:02:34.230> visual<00:02:34.470> flair<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:34.950> think

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
he's got a great visual flair I think

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.160 
he's got a great visual flair I think
he's<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> very<00:02:35.549> talented<00:02:35.879> dude<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.900> think

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
he's a very talented dude but I think

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.569 
he's a very talented dude but I think
you<00:02:37.260> need<00:02:37.379> other<00:02:37.590> people<00:02:37.950> around<00:02:38.189> him<00:02:38.400> to

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
you need other people around him to

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.280 
you need other people around him to
inject<00:02:38.879> more<00:02:39.060> story<00:02:39.359> into<00:02:39.659> it<00:02:39.750> because<00:02:39.959> unlike

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
inject more story into it because unlike

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.599 
inject more story into it because unlike
you<00:02:40.439> I<00:02:40.470> didn't<00:02:40.739> love<00:02:40.859> Man<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.159> Steel<00:02:41.340> at<00:02:41.459> all

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
you I didn't love Man of Steel at all

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.759 
you I didn't love Man of Steel at all
for<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.209> exact<00:02:42.840> reason<00:02:42.959> thought<00:02:43.409> visually

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
for that exact reason thought visually

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.379 
for that exact reason thought visually
it<00:02:43.859> looks<00:02:44.010> fantastic<00:02:44.189> I<00:02:44.760> wanted<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.299> little

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
it looks fantastic I wanted a little

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.910 
it looks fantastic I wanted a little
more<00:02:45.540> meat<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.109> chef

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
more meat on it chef

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.580 
more meat on it chef
well<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.549> think<00:02:47.879> Zack<00:02:48.480> Snyder<00:02:48.840> has

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
well I think Zack Snyder has

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.809 
well I think Zack Snyder has
demonstrated<00:02:49.799> through<00:02:50.370> his<00:02:50.400> comic-book

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
demonstrated through his comic-book

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.909 
demonstrated through his comic-book
adaptations<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.720> he's<00:02:52.439> not<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.799> a

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
adaptations that he's not just a

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.470 
adaptations that he's not just a
director<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:53.340> he's<00:02:53.489> also<00:02:53.669> a<00:02:53.790> producer<00:02:54.299> with

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
director but he's also a producer with

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.599 
director but he's also a producer with
his<00:02:54.659> wife<00:02:54.840> they<00:02:55.169> produced<00:02:55.620> all<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.889> films<00:02:56.220> so

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
his wife they produced all the films so

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.770 
his wife they produced all the films so
I<00:02:56.639> think<00:02:56.760> coming<00:02:57.299> at<00:02:57.419> it<00:02:57.540> from<00:02:57.629> that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
I think coming at it from that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.470 
I think coming at it from that
perspective<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.409> think<00:02:58.439> them<00:02:59.400> overseeing<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
perspective I think them overseeing the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.470 
perspective I think them overseeing the
DC<00:03:00.840> Cinematic<00:03:01.560> Universe<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:02.819> kind<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.239> falls

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
DC Cinematic Universe it kind of falls

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.390 
DC Cinematic Universe it kind of falls
into<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.780> little<00:03:04.109> bit<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.409> Feige<00:03:04.620> like<00:03:05.159> even

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
into a little bit of a Feige like even

jump taking the jump from Man of Steel
that<00:03:54.900> already<00:03:55.409> had<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> little<00:03:55.949> bit<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.310> that

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400

producing it you know he's just

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.920 
producing it you know he's just
breathing<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.790> end<00:04:39.940> yeah<00:04:40.120> what's<00:04:40.660> these

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
breathing in the end yeah what's these

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.590 
breathing in the end yeah what's these
more<00:04:41.200> slow<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.980> got<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.250> ramp<00:04:42.490> up<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.940> shot

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
more slow you got to ramp up that shot

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.150 
more slow you got to ramp up that shot
you<00:04:43.900> need<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.050> do<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.260> speed<00:04:44.500> ramp<00:04:44.770> thing<00:04:44.980> so<00:04:45.130> I

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
you need to do the speed ramp thing so I

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.500 
you need to do the speed ramp thing so I
don't<00:04:45.190> think<00:04:45.490> that's<00:04:45.640> gonna<00:04:45.790> be<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.030> case<00:04:46.300> but

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
don't think that's gonna be the case but

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.600 
don't think that's gonna be the case but
I<00:04:46.570> just<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:46.930> think<00:04:47.050> it's<00:04:47.320> about<00:04:47.530> tone<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:48.520> know
