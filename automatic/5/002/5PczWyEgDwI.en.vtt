00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
pilot and this is just a way of mixing

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.650 
pilot and this is just a way of mixing
up<00:00:11.340> your<00:00:11.370> mineral<00:00:11.849> powders<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.300> your

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
foundations in a more hygienic way than

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.369 
foundations in a more hygienic way than
they're<00:00:14.940> swirling<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> lid<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.350> I

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
they're swirling on the lid so I

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.960 
they're swirling on the lid so I
reviewed<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.220> talked<00:00:17.460> about<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
reviewed this and I talked about it and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.640 
reviewed this and I talked about it and

it's totally up to yourself what you use
this<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.790> i<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.270> found<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
this for but i actually found that the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.460 
this for but i actually found that the
fact

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
fact

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.990 
fact
has<00:02:07.650> this<00:02:07.800> little<00:02:07.950> lip<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.729> made<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
has this little lip here it made it a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.219 
has this little lip here it made it a
little<00:02:09.119> bit<00:02:09.300> more<00:02:09.450> difficult<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.869> hold<00:02:10.020> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
little bit more difficult to hold that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.390 
little bit more difficult to hold that
you<00:02:10.290> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.680> to<00:02:10.710> hold<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.100> like<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
you kind of have to hold it like that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.250 
you kind of have to hold it like that
rather<00:02:11.970> than<00:02:12.120> holding<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.990> because

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
rather than holding on like this because

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.630 
rather than holding on like this because
it<00:02:13.560> felt<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.950> were<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.220> drop<00:02:14.430> it

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
it felt like you were going to drop it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.340 
it felt like you were going to drop it
but<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:15.240> we've<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.660> rid<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.080> little

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
but now we've got rid of that little

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.900 
but now we've got rid of that little
edge<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.830> they've<00:02:16.920> made<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.220> lot<00:02:17.400> easier<00:02:17.460> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
edge and they've made it a lot easier to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.520 
edge and they've made it a lot easier to
hold<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.450> sort<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.110> instead

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
hold so it's sort of like this instead

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.530 
hold so it's sort of like this instead
and<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.610> fact<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:20.940> they<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> little

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
and the fact that they have a little

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.510 
and the fact that they have a little
caps<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.200> an<00:02:22.350> absolutely<00:02:22.770> amazing<00:02:22.950> idea

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
caps on it is an absolutely amazing idea

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.890 
caps on it is an absolutely amazing idea
because<00:02:23.850> not<00:02:24.000> only<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.240> you're<00:02:24.540> going<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.810> be

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
because not only are you're going to be

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.240 
because not only are you're going to be
able<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.200> all<00:02:25.380> your<00:02:25.440> makeup<00:02:25.680> set<00:02:25.980> out<00:02:26.130> on

able to have all your makeup set out on
your<00:02:26.490> counter<00:02:26.880> with<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.480> caps<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:27.990> protect

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
your counter with the caps on to protect

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.290 
your counter with the caps on to protect
it<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.340> you're<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> makeup<00:02:29.880> artist<00:02:30.000> in

I've used these all the time the only

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.520 
I've used these all the time the only
problem<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:18.810> with<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.019> one<00:03:19.290> is

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
problem that I have with this one is

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.470 
problem that I have with this one is
first<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.190> all<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.640> little<00:03:20.880> bit<00:03:20.970> like<00:03:21.209> a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
first of all it's a little bit like a

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.060 
first of all it's a little bit like a
little<00:03:21.690> bit<00:03:21.810> flimsy<00:03:22.230> but<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.620> never<00:03:22.830> going

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
little bit flimsy but it's never going

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.350 
little bit flimsy but it's never going
to<00:03:23.130> smashed<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.610> broken<00:03:23.970> or<00:03:24.060> anything<00:03:24.090> like

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
to smashed a broken or anything like

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.540 
to smashed a broken or anything like
that<00:03:24.480> still<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.140> perfect<00:03:25.320> condition<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.519> I

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
that still in perfect condition but I

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.220 
that still in perfect condition but I
did<00:03:26.820> find<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.330> stained<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.900> little<00:03:28.110> bit

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
did find that it's stained a little bit

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.180 
did find that it's stained a little bit
as<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.410> can<00:03:28.560> see<00:03:28.709> there's<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> little<00:03:28.950> bit

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
as you can see there's a little bit

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.350 
as you can see there's a little bit
staining<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.760> there<00:03:29.910> because<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.239> was<00:03:30.269> a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
staining on there because it was a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.390 
staining on there because it was a
little<00:03:30.660> bit<00:03:30.900> more<00:03:31.140> difficult<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.680> wash<00:03:31.860> than

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
little bit more difficult to wash than

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.100 
little bit more difficult to wash than
the<00:03:32.519> new<00:03:32.670> one<00:03:32.910> which<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.239> lot<00:03:33.540> smoother

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
the new one which is a lot smoother

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.500 
the new one which is a lot smoother
texture<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.580> sort<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.850> wipes<00:03:36.180> clean

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
texture to it so it sort of wipes clean

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.360 
texture to it so it sort of wipes clean
better<00:03:37.320> than<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> other<00:03:37.830> one<00:03:37.980> which<00:03:38.160> was<00:03:38.340> a

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
better than the other one which was a

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.430 
better than the other one which was a
little<00:03:38.640> bit<00:03:38.730> more<00:03:38.850> porous<00:03:39.360> only<00:03:40.049> can<00:03:40.200> adapt

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
little bit more porous only can adapt

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.229 
little bit more porous only can adapt
