can be gone by getting instrumentum
which<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:48.079> this<00:01:49.430> instrumentum<00:01:51.049> can<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.140> got

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
which is this instrumentum can we got

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.170 
which is this instrumentum can we got
through<00:01:52.470> crafting<00:01:52.799> tables<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> such<00:01:53.490> you

you're<00:03:43.560> going<00:03:43.710> to<00:03:43.770> need<00:03:43.890> those<00:03:44.160> three<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.910> be

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
you're going to need those three to be

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.840 
you're going to need those three to be
able<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.300> find<00:03:45.600> this<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.320> new<00:03:46.740> frame<00:03:47.310> that's

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
able to find this one new frame that's

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.780 
able to find this one new frame that's
involved<00:03:48.300> in<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:49.380> latest<00:03:49.590> atomic<00:03:50.190> bees<00:03:50.430> and

involved in the latest atomic bees and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.660 
involved in the latest atomic bees and
that<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.510> temporal<00:03:52.080> frame<00:03:52.310> let's<00:03:53.310> go<00:03:53.460> into

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
that is the temporal frame let's go into

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.550 
that is the temporal frame let's go into
it<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.910> we<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:54.210> explain<00:03:54.900> exactly<00:03:55.260> what<00:03:55.440> this

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
it and we can explain exactly what this

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.410 
it and we can explain exactly what this
does<00:03:55.770> so<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.550> temporal<00:03:56.850> frame<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.210> see

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
does so the temporal frame you can see

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.420 
does so the temporal frame you can see

guys over them this temporal friend of

guys over them this temporal friend of
course<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.450> believe<00:04:48.930> that<00:04:49.230> there<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.620> a<00:04:49.740> change

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
course I believe that there is a change

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.460 
course I believe that there is a change
within<00:04:51.270> which<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.750> have<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.320> have<00:04:52.440> the
