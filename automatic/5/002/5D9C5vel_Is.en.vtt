you've got the CD player and this is
your<00:04:05.980> navigation<00:04:06.489> so<00:04:06.609> what<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:06.760> was<00:04:06.850> mentioning

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
your navigation so what I was mentioning

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.699 
your navigation so what I was mentioning
earlier<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.540> reason<00:04:07.690> we<00:04:07.870> like<00:04:08.019> navigation<00:04:08.440> is

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
earlier the reason we like navigation is

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.470 
earlier the reason we like navigation is
partly<00:04:09.489> because<00:04:09.579> of<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.850> navigation<00:04:10.329> it's<00:04:10.450> a

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
partly because of the navigation it's a

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.440 
partly because of the navigation it's a
very<00:04:10.690> good<00:04:10.870> system<00:04:11.230> its<00:04:11.799> intuitive<00:04:12.299> if<00:04:13.299> you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
very good system its intuitive if you

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.300 
very good system its intuitive if you
looked<00:04:13.690> at<00:04:14.910> them<00:04:15.910> in<00:04:16.570> general<00:04:16.870> it's<00:04:17.830> just<00:04:18.190> an

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
looked at them in general it's just an

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.520 
looked at them in general it's just an
easy

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
easy

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.830 
easy
it's<00:04:20.430> an<00:04:20.519> easy<00:04:20.669> map<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.120> read<00:04:21.269> you<00:04:21.419> can<00:04:21.569> scroll

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
it's an easy map to read you can scroll

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.469 
it's an easy map to read you can scroll
in<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.079> out<00:04:22.319> very<00:04:22.889> very<00:04:23.220> simple<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:24.330> do

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
in and out very very simple and you do

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.540 
in and out very very simple and you do
that<00:04:24.630> just<00:04:24.900> by<00:04:25.050> spinning<00:04:25.800> your<00:04:25.949> toggle<00:04:26.220> switch

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
that just by spinning your toggle switch

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.939 
that just by spinning your toggle switch
here<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:28.020> will<00:04:28.169> focus<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.620> in<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.860> out

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
here and that will focus you in and out

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.550 
here and that will focus you in and out
but<00:04:29.400> what<00:04:29.610> we<00:04:30.300> like<00:04:30.479> as<00:04:30.660> much<00:04:30.870> about<00:04:31.110> this<00:04:31.319> is

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
but what we like as much about this is

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.100 
but what we like as much about this is
if<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.770> take<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:32.099> in<00:04:32.280> all<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.150> your<00:04:33.449> ear

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
if you take it in all of your ear

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.800 
if you take it in all of your ear
electronics<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:35.729> your<00:04:35.880> Bluetooth<00:04:36.270> now<00:04:36.509> it

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
electronics so your Bluetooth now it

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.870 
electronics so your Bluetooth now it
operates<00:04:37.319> through<00:04:37.560> this<00:04:37.710> display<00:04:38.160> panel<00:04:38.550> and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
operates through this display panel and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.730 
operates through this display panel and
if<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.270> didn't<00:04:39.509> have<00:04:39.630> this<00:04:39.870> it's<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.139> much<00:04:40.440> more

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
if you didn't have this it's a much more

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.629 
if you didn't have this it's a much more
limited<00:04:40.949> system<00:04:41.699> and<00:04:41.940> then<00:04:42.509> if<00:04:42.599> you<00:04:42.690> go<00:04:42.870> back

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
limited system and then if you go back

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.010 
limited system and then if you go back
down<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.849> entertainment<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.479> same<00:04:45.690> is<00:04:45.840> true

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
down to entertainment the same is true

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.969 
down to entertainment the same is true
so<00:04:46.289> you've<00:04:46.410> got<00:04:47.300> your<00:04:48.300> am/fm<00:04:48.660> stereo<00:04:49.259> s--<00:04:49.620> a

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
so you've got your am/fm stereo s-- a

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.850 
so you've got your am/fm stereo s-- a
much<00:04:50.490> more<00:04:50.669> comprehensive<00:04:51.090> display<00:04:51.870> of

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
much more comprehensive display of

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.310 
much more comprehensive display of
what's<00:04:53.130> available<00:04:53.430> in<00:04:54.139> comparison<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.289> just

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
what's available in comparison to just

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.110 
what's available in comparison to just
like<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.680> regular<00:04:56.360> LED<00:04:57.360> or<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.680> small<00:04:58.680> print<00:04:58.949> out

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
like a regular LED or a small print out

or<00:05:00.120> lay<00:05:00.360> out<00:05:00.509> on<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.110> dash<00:05:01.320> which<00:05:01.560> is

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
or lay out on the dash which is

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.499 
or lay out on the dash which is
typically<00:05:02.220> what<00:05:02.400> you'd<00:05:02.699> see<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.180> other<00:05:03.270> nice
