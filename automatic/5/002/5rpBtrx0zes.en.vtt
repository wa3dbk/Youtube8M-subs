00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.550 
it I guess it's just a cover so that
piece<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:43.150> stationary<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.990> vent<00:01:45.260> inside

let's<00:03:05.960> see<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:07.000> then<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.120> did<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
let's see so then I did to the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.500 
let's see so then I did to the
kitchenette<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.980> course<00:03:10.310> if<00:03:11.150> you're<00:03:11.300> curious

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
kitchenette of course if you're curious

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.090 
kitchenette of course if you're curious
about<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.840> kitchenette<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.920> another

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
about the kitchenette I have another

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.750 
about the kitchenette I have another
video<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.140> run-through<00:03:15.489> but<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.520> guess

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
video of the run-through but I guess

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.740 
video of the run-through but I guess
they<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.030> do<00:03:17.120> another<00:03:17.330> little<00:03:18.070> showing<00:03:19.750> so

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
they can do another little showing so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.890 
they can do another little showing so
the<00:03:20.840> tabletop<00:03:21.260> swills<00:03:21.830> out<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:24.010> pretty<00:03:25.010> nice

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
the tabletop swills out that pretty nice

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.630 
the tabletop swills out that pretty nice
it's<00:03:26.900> kind<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.140> central<00:03:27.580> table<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.560> then<00:03:30.770> it

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
it's kind of a central table and then it

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.380 
it's kind of a central table and then it
goes<00:03:32.120> all<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.270> way<00:03:32.390> over<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.269> it's<00:03:35.269> out

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
goes all the way over so that it's out

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.050 
goes all the way over so that it's out
of<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.630> way<00:03:35.810> yet<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.680> still<00:03:36.890> have<00:03:37.100> tabletop

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
of the way yet you still have tabletop

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.110 
of the way yet you still have tabletop
access<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.310> brings<00:03:40.580> it<00:03:40.730> closer<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
access and it brings it closer to the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.460 
access and it brings it closer to the
bench<00:03:41.360> see<00:03:41.510> right<00:03:41.720> there<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.290> can

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
bench see right there so you can

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.979 
bench see right there so you can
actually<00:03:42.500> sit<00:03:43.370> down<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.730> use<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.420> computer<00:03:44.600> or

actually sit down and use a computer or

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.870 
actually sit down and use a computer or
whatever<00:03:47.470> yeah<00:03:48.500> then<00:03:48.890> once<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.370> open<00:03:49.670> the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
I forgot how many CFM's it rolls but if

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.080 
I forgot how many CFM's it rolls but if
we<00:05:17.360> can<00:05:17.509> pull<00:05:17.720> quite<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:17.990> bit<00:05:18.610> of<00:05:19.610> course<00:05:19.850> it's

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
we can pull quite a bit of course it's

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.909 
we can pull quite a bit of course it's
got<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.449> in-and-out<00:05:21.199> option

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.399 

well<00:05:25.520> air<00:05:25.819> in<00:05:26.120> if<00:05:26.419> you<00:05:26.569> needed<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:27.189> pretty<00:05:28.189> nice

well air in if you needed to pretty nice

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.450 
well air in if you needed to pretty nice
and<00:05:30.409> yeah<00:05:31.129> propane<00:05:31.580> is<00:05:31.819> super<00:05:32.240> cheap<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:33.460> it

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
and yeah propane is super cheap and it

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.730 
and yeah propane is super cheap and it
burns<00:05:34.849> pretty<00:05:35.029> hot<00:05:35.330> it's<00:05:36.080> probably<00:05:36.529> the<00:05:36.590> best

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
burns pretty hot it's probably the best

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.679 
burns pretty hot it's probably the best
choice<00:05:37.039> to<00:05:37.099> go<00:05:37.430> with<00:05:37.460> there's<00:05:38.240> like<00:05:38.569> the

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:38.689 
choice to go with there's like the

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.860 
choice to go with there's like the
isobutane<00:05:39.680> stuff<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:41.300> kind<00:05:41.749> of<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
isobutane stuff that kind of the

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.050 
isobutane stuff that kind of the
culinary<00:05:42.409> industry<00:05:42.949> uses<00:05:43.639> for<00:05:43.789> indoor

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
culinary industry uses for indoor

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.110 
culinary industry uses for indoor
cooking<00:05:44.240> which<00:05:45.110> I<00:05:45.199> guess<00:05:45.349> burns<00:05:45.620> cleaner<00:05:46.120> but

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
cooking which I guess burns cleaner but

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.839 
cooking which I guess burns cleaner but
it's<00:05:47.629> way<00:05:48.020> more<00:05:48.050> expensive<00:05:49.840> so<00:05:50.840> I<00:05:51.729> got<00:05:52.729> some

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
it's way more expensive so I got some

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.249 
it's way more expensive so I got some
curtains<00:05:53.180> -<00:05:53.770> these<00:05:54.770> guys<00:05:55.810> are<00:05:56.810> blackout

curtains - these guys are blackout
curtains<00:05:57.710> yeah<00:05:59.020> gonna<00:06:00.020> go<00:06:04.389> like<00:06:05.389> that<00:06:05.659> you

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
curtains yeah gonna go like that you

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.360 
curtains yeah gonna go like that you
know<00:06:06.110> of<00:06:06.289> course<00:06:06.469> and<00:06:06.740> you<00:06:06.800> kind<00:06:06.979> of<00:06:07.039> see<00:06:07.279> them

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
know of course and you kind of see them

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.279 
know of course and you kind of see them
up<00:06:07.639> a<00:06:07.729> little<00:06:07.879> bit<00:06:08.029> more<00:06:08.180> so<00:06:08.479> no<00:06:08.840> light<00:06:09.050> comes

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
up a little bit more so no light comes

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.769 
up a little bit more so no light comes
through<00:06:09.729> works<00:06:10.729> pretty<00:06:10.969> good<00:06:13.360> I<00:06:14.360> guess<00:06:14.659> I

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:14.779 
through works pretty good I guess I

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.029 
through works pretty good I guess I
don't<00:06:14.870> know<00:06:14.990> if<00:06:15.110> I've<00:06:15.229> shown<00:06:15.469> these<00:06:15.650> lights
