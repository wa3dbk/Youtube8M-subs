00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.360
 Welcome to tactics the 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.950
 people with our sixth part and that 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.530
 we want you after we last 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.740
 partly showed you how the pictures 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.809
 at the deg found in undoubtedly must 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.670
 take care of the videos today 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.019
 We want to do that today in the first step 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.099
 Just a few impressions 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:24.199
 show few shots unedited so 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.929
 Real the straight from the fendt in 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.789
 Two fish plus the videos to come 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.899
 We will be doing different formats 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.469
 test for a course, the 1080th 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.989
 Variant with 30 images in the second 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.590
 and once at 60 with one say 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.140
 got to 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.720
 60 not necessarily better that was 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.740
 over the 30th 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.710
 30 tons processed at the 60th 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.160
 she is only half making herself 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.200
 I personally work with the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.610
 thirties variant, the responsive 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 in my region or in the post 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.640
 edit production 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.170
 but everyone has to do that for themselves 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.080
 maybe just have a look 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.750
 the first impressions commented on 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.110
 like to write and also from yours 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.240
 experiences or yes what you the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 video editing maybe otherwise 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.340
 still wanted to know how to make it easy 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.930
 can recognize 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.530
 you see very clearly in the videos 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.880
 so we have with 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.130
 starting with the 30 per second 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.009
 that forms something in my view 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.500
 even sharper than when you're 60 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.729
 Pictures per second takes that was so 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.840
 a little matter of taste but such a 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.490
 a little bit of course in which 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.670
 format you later reflect that 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.840
 but would like to and want to play 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.850
 it looks like it's a bit 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.710
 pixeliger we have of course the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.910
 Possibility also postprocessing 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.980
 I'll take you that way 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.909
 next video shows you can see that 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.220
 here very nice in the 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.020
 Landscapes or even at 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.890
 to speak at the place at the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.720
 football field and yes, how hard too 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.030
 can recognize on the tennis court there 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.159
 of course, this crumb 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.970
 on the horizon is the fish's eye 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.530
 Fish-eye effect we also in the video 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.789
 rework 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.140
 We already have you at 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.910
 the pictures show how to do this 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.060
 fish-eye effect, for example, with 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.420
 can receive lines 56 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.430
 There are also possibilities as you 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.200
 that the youth are talking 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.360
 after calculations can improve 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.480
 Overall, I think you can say that 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.180
 the desperate plus excellent 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.060
 So pictures for the camera resp 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.900
 the device in the price segment that is out 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.430
 in my view the measure of all things 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.360
 have the camera wants to give the will 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.040
 The picture really wobble - free quality 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.780
 Of course you can not go together 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.670
 Of course this is still a drawback 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.590
 I think you can do it in this too 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.930
 Price are just not expected 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.610
 you should see the video at this place 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.100
 We would be pleased if 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.519
 told a thumb gives us upwards 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.519
 us on
