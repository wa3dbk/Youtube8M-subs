regularly i hope you're doing that
anyway<00:02:47.909> but<00:02:48.909> um<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.859> a<00:02:50.889> pacing<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.579> your

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700

that's<00:02:56.950> kind<00:02:57.159> of<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.489> misconception<00:02:58.419> because

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
that's kind of a misconception because

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.339 
that's kind of a misconception because
I've<00:03:00.609> never<00:03:00.849> really<00:03:01.239> had<00:03:01.359> another<00:03:01.689> infection

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
I've never really had another infection

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.110 
I've never really had another infection
anywhere<00:03:02.889> else<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.099> piercings<00:03:03.639> cuz<00:03:03.849> I<00:03:03.939> take

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
anywhere else for piercings cuz I take

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.929 
anywhere else for piercings cuz I take
care<00:03:04.299> of<00:03:04.419> them<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.620> last<00:03:05.859> question<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.669> is

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
care of them and the last question is is

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.869 
care of them and the last question is is
do<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.389> regret<00:03:07.689> doing<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.200> no<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:09.099> don't<00:03:09.639> at<00:03:09.849> all

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
do you regret doing it no I don't at all

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.229 
do you regret doing it no I don't at all
because<00:03:10.290> usually<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.560> do<00:03:12.040> not<00:03:12.340> find<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.909> reason

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
because usually I do not find a reason

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.619 
because usually I do not find a reason
to<00:03:13.269> smile<00:03:14.489> normally<00:03:15.489> like<00:03:16.049> most<00:03:17.049> people<00:03:17.439> do<00:03:17.590> um

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
to smile normally like most people do um

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.110 
to smile normally like most people do um
so<00:03:19.629> actually<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.530> gives<00:03:20.799> me<00:03:20.889> a<00:03:21.220> reason<00:03:21.940> to

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
so actually this gives me a reason to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.920 
so actually this gives me a reason to
smile<00:03:22.479> I<00:03:23.549> know<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.669> sounds<00:03:24.699> stupid<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.209> it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
smile I know it sounds stupid but it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.390 
smile I know it sounds stupid but it
gives<00:03:26.109> you<00:03:26.290> these<00:03:26.440> as<00:03:26.620> well<00:03:26.889> because<00:03:27.159> I<00:03:27.250> can
