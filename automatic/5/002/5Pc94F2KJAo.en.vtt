00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.880
 super reel series kim cobra 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.060
 also to see the redman brand 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.530
 this is a reel in size 4000 that 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.230
 I mention to you that it is the largest size 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.380
 versatile is to say you get 200 yards 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
 of the 12-pound monofilament or if 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 you want to braid it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.419
 it will go much much more because 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.980
 are designed for the layers these 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.960
 good reels practically because 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.669
 they have a track 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 rear the brake is rear with what 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.079
 you may be fishing being 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.140
 adjusting without being bothering the line 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.840
 that comes from the cane do not have to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 to be getting into this part and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.449
 clogging the thread then 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 they simply do it from the side 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.239
 later and can fish with bait 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.370
 this way on the reels for all 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.789
 those who do not know this way they 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.739
 for when fishing with live bait or 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.079
 well with baits thoroughly then this 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.510
 is this reel is special for the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.949

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.410
 new ones that arrived that are from this 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.380
 coffee color also in that I thought so that 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.649
 make an adequate combo the spu give them 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.619
 is designed for fresh water is not 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.479
 designed for salt water because then the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.310
 materials are not made to resist 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.920
 the corrosion of salt water but if the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.899
 sweet water then for those who 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.750
 fish in carp that fish bass or 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.240
 in small species with bait is 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.490
