recommend<00:04:34.730> this<00:04:34.790> line<00:04:35.120> especially<00:04:35.780> if<00:04:35.870> you're

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020

looking for a new body care system

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.120 
looking for a new body care system
because<00:04:37.730> even<00:04:38.270> though<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.510> might<00:04:38.960> be<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.710> little

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
because even though it might be a little

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.650 
because even though it might be a little
bit<00:04:40.250> higher<00:04:40.370> priced<00:04:40.730> I<00:04:40.940> think<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.360> could<00:04:41.510> do
