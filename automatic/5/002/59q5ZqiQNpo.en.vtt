what do you want up here I get a few
more<00:02:17.190> options<00:02:17.400> on<00:02:17.970> my<00:02:18.090> different<00:02:18.420> brushes<00:02:18.690> by

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
more options on my different brushes by

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.770 
more options on my different brushes by
toggling<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.770> brush<00:02:20.160> panel<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:21.210> brush<00:02:21.600> I'm

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
toggling the brush panel the brush I'm

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.930 
toggling the brush panel the brush I'm
looking<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.380> particular<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:23.130> dune<00:02:23.580> grass

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
looking for in particular is dune grass

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.120 
looking for in particular is dune grass
would<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.020> select<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:25.860> go<00:02:26.010> over

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
would that one select it I can go over

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.670 
would that one select it I can go over
to<00:02:26.310> scattering<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.150> check<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.020> already

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
to scattering and check that and already

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.160 
to scattering and check that and already
it<00:02:29.010> looks<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.280> lot<00:02:29.400> more<00:02:29.460> organic<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.990> match

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
it looks a lot more organic but to match

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.680 
it looks a lot more organic but to match
the<00:02:31.530> back<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.370> my<00:02:32.400> dog<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.060> got<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.300> flip<00:02:33.510> that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the back of my dog I got to flip that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.170 
the back of my dog I got to flip that
horizontally<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.680> I'll<00:02:34.770> flip<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> X<00:02:35.520> access

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
horizontally so I'll flip the X access

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.900 
horizontally so I'll flip the X access
and<00:02:36.450> then<00:02:37.170> maybe<00:02:37.410> I'll<00:02:37.650> just<00:02:37.680> tweak<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.610> bend

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
and then maybe I'll just tweak the bend

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.610 
and then maybe I'll just tweak the bend
of<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> little<00:02:39.480> bit<00:02:39.720> there<00:02:40.290> are<00:02:40.380> different

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
of that a little bit there are different

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.590 
of that a little bit there are different
effects<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.040> can<00:02:41.070> do<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.400> here<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.420> don't

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
effects you can do in here but we don't

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.650 
effects you can do in here but we don't
need<00:02:42.780> them<00:02:42.960> right<00:02:43.020> now<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.270> set

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
need them right now so with that set

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.840 
need them right now so with that set
aside<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.380> should<00:02:46.740> be<00:02:46.890> able<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.220> go<00:02:47.430> over<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.670> my

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
aside I should be able to go over to my

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.160 
aside I should be able to go over to my
canvas<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.680> start<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.800> brush<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.900> what<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
canvas and start to brush in what the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.430 
canvas and start to brush in what the
hair<00:02:52.590> looked<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:53.130> at<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.910> previous<00:02:54.330> stage<00:02:54.990> and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
hair looked like at a previous stage and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.040 
hair looked like at a previous stage and
it<00:02:56.430> looks<00:02:56.610> pretty<00:02:56.790> organic<00:02:57.330> unless<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.900> run

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
it looks pretty organic unless you run

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.800 
it looks pretty organic unless you run
into<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.440> hard<00:02:58.740> edge<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.340> again<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.540> kind<00:03:00.750> of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
into that hard edge so again you kind of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.510 
into that hard edge so again you kind of
want<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.050> choose<00:03:01.290> your<00:03:01.440> brush<00:03:01.710> head<00:03:01.950> wisely<00:03:02.490> i

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
want to choose your brush head wisely i

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.330 
want to choose your brush head wisely i
use<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.910> bracket<00:03:03.360> key<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:04.010> switch<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.310> a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
use the bracket key to switch to a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.450 
use the bracket key to switch to a
smaller<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.530> by<00:03:07.530> affecting<00:03:08.130> how<00:03:08.280> much

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
smaller one and by affecting how much

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.610 
smaller one and by affecting how much
you<00:03:08.610> want<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.110> angle<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.230> be<00:03:10.350> random<00:03:10.800> and

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
you want the angle to be random and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.430 
you want the angle to be random and
yadda<00:03:13.620> ya<00:03:13.920> blah<00:03:14.880> blah<00:03:15.090> blah<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.630> think<00:03:16.290> that's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
yadda ya blah blah blah I think that's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.930 
yadda ya blah blah blah I think that's
about<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:17.010> guess<00:03:17.459> messing<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
about it I guess messing with the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.560 
about it I guess messing with the
opacity<00:03:18.209> up<00:03:18.510> here<00:03:18.720> helps<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:21.260> super<00:03:22.260> duper
