the<00:00:13.980> way<00:00:14.009> things<00:00:14.160> are<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:14.580> right<00:00:14.910> now<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.420> i

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the way things are going right now and i

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.859 
the way things are going right now and i
think<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> first<00:00:16.049> two<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.470> three<00:00:16.710> years<00:00:17.039> i

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
think the first two to three years i

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.599 
think the first two to three years i
think<00:00:18.869> there<00:00:19.020> could<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.380> potential<00:00:20.039> for

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
think there could be potential for

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.509 
think there could be potential for
breaking<00:00:21.119> records<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.680> time<00:00:22.949> period<00:00:22.980> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
breaking records in that time period of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
the amount of consoles sold worldwide I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.310 
the amount of consoles sold worldwide I
just<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.730> gonna<00:00:26.910> do<00:00:27.320> phenomenally

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
