00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
now what I'm going to do now is I'm just

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.760 
now what I'm going to do now is I'm just
seasoning<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.170> felt<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
seasoning up to what I like so I felt a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.380 
seasoning up to what I like so I felt a
bit<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.980> butter<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> salt

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
bit of butter in there and a bit of salt

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.860 
bit of butter in there and a bit of salt
and<00:00:48.510> pepper

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and pepper

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.340 
and pepper
so<00:00:49.280> season<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.719> it's<00:00:51.719> nice<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.020> get<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.199> your

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so season up it's nice to get all your

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.260 
so season up it's nice to get all your
seasoning<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.949> first<00:00:53.460> rather<00:00:53.789> than<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
seasoning in first rather than at the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.990 
seasoning in first rather than at the
end<00:00:54.620> because<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.100> heat<00:00:56.489> from<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.730> microwave

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
end because the heat from the microwave

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.520 
end because the heat from the microwave
we<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.690> give<00:00:57.870> me<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.079> flavor<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.500> well

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
we can give me a bit more flavor as well

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.810 
we can give me a bit more flavor as well
so<00:00:59.390> bit<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.480> salt<00:01:01.789> concede<00:01:02.789> pepper

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.950 

good<00:01:09.820> idea<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.179> try<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.299> little<00:01:10.539> bit<00:01:10.630> of<00:01:10.750> water

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
good idea to try a little bit of water

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.330 
good idea to try a little bit of water
as<00:01:11.170> well<00:01:11.200> at<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.500> bottom<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.979> give<00:01:12.100> that<00:01:12.219> bit

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
as well at the bottom to give that bit

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.679 
as well at the bottom to give that bit
more<00:01:12.549> moisture<00:01:12.759> as<00:01:12.939> well<00:01:13.090> because<00:01:13.329> if<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.479> put

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
more moisture as well because if you put

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.510 
more moisture as well because if you put
just<00:01:13.869> put<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.350> butter<00:01:14.469> in<00:01:14.770> there<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.280> butter
