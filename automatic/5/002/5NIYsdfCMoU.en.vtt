00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:09.170
 powerful apparatus above and only are 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.230
 here finally to present you this 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.570
 new episode of the tc of the blade that if 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.889
 I'm not wrong and the episode number 15 then 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.320
 boys hadn't been doing for a while 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.170
 this is my greeting because it was like one 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.640
 week not not included so much however it is 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.410
 however, enough of that time 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.760
 I didn't upload videos because I uploaded it 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.920
 exactly in April 4th 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.410
 today at 9 15 there are five days that 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.150
 I did not greet him with a powerful blade 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.220
 so maybe i don't know if i did it 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.989
 ok though we welcome that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.790
 there are few of them to land in immediately 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.829
 game to challenge a little what happens 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.340
 in these little ones in the match right away 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.840
 the episode in explaining a little something 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.850
 it happens in this episode because it is 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.520
 practically the first game I decided 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.420
 to try to play that tournament 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.000
 against the computer 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.180
 fortunately obviously I played with 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.859
 what is called in the poor mode 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.300
 computer because this is because mister 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.920
 gian of the players do not know if you 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.840
 remember in the last episode 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.220
 episode 14 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.470
 I made the whole new team 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.000
 I just didn't have the money for one 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.940
 buy mind players so I had to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.470
 to make challenges and to challenge them and I had to 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.970
 win games with a gap 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.040
 two goals more than scoring more than five 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.440
 goal or win three in a row and then 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.170
 some have given me mixed here 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.880
 given the chance, I am a man 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.860
 I decided to start playing 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.540
 against the computer I will do it only 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.730
 when I really need the players 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.680
 he believes this was the only time 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.300
 and in any case it went quite well 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 because in the first game he won 8 0 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.610
 in fact, we believe the piscitella bonus 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.560
 so now they have become two e 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.240
 obviously I 'm not showing you goals 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.070
 because type in the first 8 to 0 would be 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.170
 came the video too long and then I have to 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.390
 cut it and I had to cut it with three 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.910
 share because as you know the given line 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.800
 type 2 or 3 defeats now I don't remember is 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.820
 without reason I will win by giving the 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.880
 defeat 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.219
 and this why 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.590
 I don't know why but so I decided to 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.450
 make a new account 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.250
 for all the hypothesis of now I do not know 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.530
 if you say the name on which everyone 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.180
 they add and so things though 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.590
 I'll probably say it then here I have 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.090
 won yet another game we are 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.950
 gone plus three players of the point of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.930
 Stella Pala I take two these two 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.110
 I'm Samuel Argentine central defender 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.980
 of the always of 3 5 2 and sieges of the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.650
 3 5 2 Moroccan than five-star 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.569
 skill for this I took it and then me 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.250
 need an external barclays then 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.410
 another player who decided to ho 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.599
 decided to take ek levi cuvelier 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.230
 sorry cradle was a midfielder 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.569
 central I used it as cdc of the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.340
 stoke city and bronze and is really strong 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.840
 guys to be a bronze I have it 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.790
 discovered some time in a year me 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.540
 I say because it was precisely to do 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.549
 I was just making a Belgian team 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.959
 Belgians to make a Belgian team and I have 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.880
 found this player that really 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.519
 strong to be a bronze then I have it 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.860
 also paid relatively little then here 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.709
 in fact we are going to make the game 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.870
 online and let's see who I meet that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.640
 it doesn't remind me of it looks like then 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.799
 player meeting who had no st 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.299
 big team there was more players 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.950
 single that the agreement 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.079
 I, as I have always said, is better 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.420
 build a team based on understanding 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.670
 maybe with not very strong players anymore 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.459
 which makes a team with players who 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.769
 they are beasts and then returned to the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.540
 guys a novelty of these videos that 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.220
 if you remember in the last 12 of the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.750
 pala I asked to comment with 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.370
 of puns powerful because precisely 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.870
 start making these contests 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.840
 yes yes guys i did it after that 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.750
 I would say that the console that week 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.730
 won to me is a powerful leader and then 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.230
 maybe to you no, but I advise you to do 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.019
 just win this person this 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.489
 person will win 10,000 credits indeed 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.560
 that I say it now because not the story 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.079
 to re after if he is watching the video 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.569
 you who won the commensal week is the 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.579
 people like the for the week but not the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.190
 personal message and I will buy you the 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.720
 your player anyway so also 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.380
 this I said this instead in 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.750
 this episode 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.389
 what I ask you to do with you 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.870
 make me a sentence the most powerful phrase that 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.880
 it occurs to you that you are there 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.250
 can be a long sentence like one 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.229
 short sentence and one that will make you laugh more 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.449
 let's put it this way or the most original one 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.070
 will win another 10 thousand credits 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:17.109
 the only thing to participate of course 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.449
 in addition to commenting on the videos just put 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.489
 I like it and subscribe to the channel 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.350
 if you want to add also favorites 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.669
 however, I go out things when it seems to me 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.410
 rules many defenses 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.930
 so just make a sentence then 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.729
 accomplices tella i will look at all comments 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.340
 maybe I'll even do a compilation 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.960
 here is how I do as the week only 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.120
 there will be hardly any because they are 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.210
 unsubscribe and then I will choose the winner 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.100
 who will win 10,000 credits then tender 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.440
 screen 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.460
 first of all I wanted to thank you for the 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.380
 now that there are as many as 8 thousand 794 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.810
 kit you are really fantastic and then 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.800
 I also want to ask a little thing 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.259
 since obviously 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.870
 me in the videos where to upload which is 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.389
 which are they are piscitella then speaks of the 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.669
 team of history of possibilities e 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.229
 then var and maybe hupac opening or things 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.810
 so because then in the second channel 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.610
 hopefully tomorrow or the day after tomorrow and will be the 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.530
 video of the sale must see 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.090
 for when the strong is still now 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.050
 I will return to this topic shortly 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.440
 I win 6 to 2 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.060
 and yes I have already put myself lodz player e 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.889
 see that I also sell arnautovic that 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.539
 that I had in the first team 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.280
 anyway now of course I have 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.009
 changed speech I don't remember any more 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.069
 what I was talking about and then 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.990
 I took video excusat and then maybe if 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.599
 you have a series to advise you why 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.770
 the most admitted like the runners of the 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.629
 ball I see that you like it 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.909
 but maybe it continues to load there 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.620
 the palm of the ball then not every day 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.509
 because to me it is really nice to have 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.909
 a video a day however after a while stove 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.030
 and maybe if you have something else in mind 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.919
 apple recommended series anyway now 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.210
 I will return to this topic because 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.800
 see here I found an opponent 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.110
 show what he does to football 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.330
 at the beginning he passes it to the goalkeeper and makes an own goal 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.590
 and then here from this yes this yes 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.930
 a smart guy indeed i 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.300
 players from three will go to four 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.620
 piscitella assumptions of the bonus will go to 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.699
 plus four 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.620
 so I was talking about the new one 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.650
 series so if maybe you have from 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.419
 will mark advise you don't know maybe yes 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.400
 always based on the otherwise but not 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.930
 say a road to glory or something 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.819
 because in fact I'm already doing it with the 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.669
 I could of the shovel that I put there also 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.469
 of the rules and now then there is this 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.120
 thing like of the week of the accounts of the 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.979
 week committee is much more powerful 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.870
 so if you know advise it vi 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.580
 you would powerfully like then 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.610
 another small thing I always remember you 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.409
 to participate in the facebook page I have 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.180
 already made the extraction however little time 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.099
 ago I had made a first page contest 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.050
 facebook will be contes like diva way 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.689
 quant other adversary and written then 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.819
 light 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.929
 my little boenisch kid will go 5 e 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.519
 so can various things 

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:48.139
 now maybe they are serving me 

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:51.229
 something, however, obviously you will have 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.889
 too soon because the live streaming 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.219
 I think so 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:58.249
 Thursday the Latin version and the 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:00.349
 having been Latin ls yes no, however yes 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:01.819
 will see on Friday maybe no one knows e 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.129
 anyway guys and not lately 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.229
 obviously you will have a team 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.569
 you have a shady and beautiful semi-finals environment 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.279
 then a destination like nina anyway guys 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.259
