00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.330 
is what I whoa I'll start from the
beginning<00:00:22.539> what<00:00:22.900> happened<00:00:23.259> was<00:00:23.439> someone

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
beginning what happened was someone

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.529 
beginning what happened was someone
recommended<00:00:25.029> that<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.539> do<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:26.140> video<00:00:26.920> on<00:00:27.400> my<00:00:28.060> team

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
recommended that I do a video on my team

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.470 
recommended that I do a video on my team
fortress<00:00:28.929> 2<00:00:29.140> backpack<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.849> thought<00:00:31.179> I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
fortress 2 backpack and I thought I

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.200 
fortress 2 backpack and I thought I
thought<00:00:32.169> that<00:00:32.379> was<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.500> good<00:00:32.680> idea<00:00:32.830> so<00:00:33.309> I

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
thought that was a good idea so I

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.380 
thought that was a good idea so I
recorded<00:00:34.600> that<00:00:34.809> video<00:00:35.170> but<00:00:35.440> then<00:00:35.650> I<00:00:36.519> sort<00:00:37.239> of

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
recorded that video but then I sort of

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.780 
recorded that video but then I sort of
felt<00:00:38.110> that<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.379> video<00:00:38.620> was<00:00:38.739> too<00:00:38.980> long<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.760> too

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
felt that the video was too long and too

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.360 
felt that the video was too long and too
drawn-out<00:00:40.390> so<00:00:41.050> what<00:00:41.470> I'll<00:00:41.559> do<00:00:41.800> is<00:00:41.830> I'll<00:00:42.220> do

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
drawn-out so what I'll do is I'll do

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.979 
drawn-out so what I'll do is I'll do
something<00:00:42.610> just<00:00:42.940> slightly<00:00:43.090> different<00:00:43.809> and

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
something just slightly different and

we go number 1 is the Australian rocket
launcher<00:00:58.120> which<00:00:58.870> is<00:00:59.079> probably<00:00:59.739> what<00:00:59.949> most<00:00:59.980> of

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
launcher which is probably what most of

launcher which is probably what most of
you<00:01:00.460> guys<00:01:00.609> know<00:01:00.940> me<00:01:00.969> for<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.370> on<00:01:03.460> my

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
you guys know me for I got it on my

first tour of man vs. machine two cities

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.359 
first tour of man vs. machine two cities
and<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.810> worth<00:01:08.170> I<00:01:08.410> think<00:01:08.470> somewhere<00:01:09.190> between

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
and it's worth I think somewhere between

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.130 
and it's worth I think somewhere between
80<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:11.160> 150<00:01:12.160> dollars<00:01:12.550> when<00:01:13.479> it<00:01:13.600> first<00:01:13.869> came

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
80 and 150 dollars when it first came

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.460 
80 and 150 dollars when it first came
out<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.950> was<00:01:15.220> worth<00:01:15.549> probably<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.810> hundred

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
out it was worth probably a hundred

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.710 
out it was worth probably a hundred
fifty<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.130> three<00:01:18.159> hundred<00:01:18.430> dollars<00:01:18.790> which<00:01:19.420> I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
fifty to three hundred dollars which I

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.570 
fifty to three hundred dollars which I
think<00:01:20.229> when<00:01:20.439> I<00:01:20.470> got<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.280> was<00:01:21.310> worth

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
think when I got it it was worth

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.060 
think when I got it it was worth
somewhere<00:01:22.270> between<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.689> hundred<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.200> fifty<00:01:23.860> to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
somewhere between a hundred and fifty to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.990 
somewhere between a hundred and fifty to
like<00:01:24.250> two<00:01:25.060> hundred<00:01:25.270> something<00:01:25.750> dollars<00:01:27.000> but

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.540 
worth a few keys when it first came out
I<00:02:27.750> think<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.200> was<00:02:28.230> worth<00:02:28.530> almost<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.100> bud

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
I think it was worth almost a bud

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.750 
I think it was worth almost a bud
but<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.900> price<00:02:31.290> has<00:02:31.320> gone<00:02:31.560> down<00:02:31.740> quite<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
but now the price has gone down quite a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.780 
but now the price has gone down quite a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.250

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
like like a so but yeah the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.710 
like like a so but yeah the
price<00:02:43.500> went<00:02:43.830> down<00:02:43.950> quite<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.580> bit<00:02:44.820> on<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.330> all<00:02:45.600> of

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
price went down quite a bit on on all of

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.450 
price went down quite a bit on on all of
the<00:02:45.870> Australians<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:46.830> I'm<00:02:47.220> actually

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
the Australians really I'm actually

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.670 
the Australians really I'm actually
surprised<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:49.170> Australian

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
surprised that the Australian

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.590 
surprised that the Australian
rocket-launcher<00:02:50.340> retained<00:02:50.790> its<00:02:51.000> value<00:02:51.390> as

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
rocket-launcher retained its value as

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.860 
rocket-launcher retained its value as
much<00:02:52.080> as<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.410> did<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:53.730> probably<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.660> I

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
much as it did it's probably like I

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.780 
much as it did it's probably like I
don't<00:02:55.260> know<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.620> seems<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.580> price

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
don't know it seems like it the price

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.450 
don't know it seems like it the price
for<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.120> went<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.050> least<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.710> it's

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
for that went down the least and it's

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.310 
for that went down the least and it's
still<00:02:59.760> I<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:00.690> still<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.930> most

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
still I think it's still the most

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.820 
still I think it's still the most
valuable<00:03:02.090> Australian<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:04.620> pretty

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
valuable Australian so that's pretty

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.420 
valuable Australian so that's pretty
cool<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.820> that's<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.050> three<00:03:07.380> most<00:03:07.800> valuable

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
cool so that's the three most valuable

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.090 
cool so that's the three most valuable
