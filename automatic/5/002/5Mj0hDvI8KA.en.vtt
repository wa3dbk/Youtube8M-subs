flat<00:00:22.970> now<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.150> comes<00:00:24.359> number<00:00:24.539> nine<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:25.109> what

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
flat now here comes number nine now what

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.429 
flat now here comes number nine now what
i<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.470> i<00:00:25.650> see<00:00:26.070> he<00:00:26.220> has<00:00:26.340> an<00:00:26.460> angle<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.000> me<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> i

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
i do i see he has an angle on me so i

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
my fullback however he missed and why

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.280 
my fullback however he missed and why
did<00:00:39.510> he<00:00:39.629> miss<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:41.690> he<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.260> good

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
did he miss because he was not in good

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 
did he miss because he was not in good
position<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.250> make<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.700> tackle<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.450> that's

position to make this tackle and that's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.869 
position to make this tackle and that's
what<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> new<00:00:46.469> collision<00:00:46.980> based<00:00:47.160> system<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
what the new collision based system is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.450 
what the new collision based system is
and<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> momentum<00:00:48.719> based<00:00:49.410> system<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.039> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and the momentum based system is you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.119 
and the momentum based system is you
have<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.180> good<00:00:51.210> position<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:53.100> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
do it quick enough he didn't get enough

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.670 
do it quick enough he didn't get enough
position<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.209> make<00:02:34.389> a<00:02:34.420> successful<00:02:34.900> tackle<00:02:35.500> and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
this play in order for this touchdown to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.199 
this play in order for this touchdown to
happen<00:02:40.379> so<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:41.409> mean<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:41.859> game<00:02:42.129> here<00:02:42.549> man<00:02:42.790> it

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
happen so I mean this game here man it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.420 
happen so I mean this game here man it
has<00:02:43.450> real<00:02:43.810> good<00:02:44.879> simulation<00:02:47.250> animations<00:02:48.250> I

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
has real good simulation animations I

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.089 
has real good simulation animations I
mean<00:02:48.639> it<00:02:48.849> it's<00:02:49.150> not<00:02:49.329> perfect<00:02:49.959> yes<00:02:50.379> you<00:02:50.950> know

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
mean it it's not perfect yes you know

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.959 
mean it it's not perfect yes you know
but<00:02:52.060> still<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.719> mean<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:54.099> can't<00:02:54.370> ask<00:02:54.549> much<00:02:54.939> more
