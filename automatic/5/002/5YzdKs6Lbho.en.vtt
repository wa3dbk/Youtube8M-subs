 The shape of this cushion has the secret to lead to the proper posture comfortably 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:40.230

 This is a natural movement for upper body weights to concentrate under the buttocks and cover the pain . 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.080

 Exgel is soft like human skin 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:19.290
 Shock absorption is about 5 to 10 times that of urethane foam, so it is difficult to bottom even if thin 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.290
 It is a material 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.810
 Urethane phones used for general cushions 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:35.190
 There is only longitudinal cushioning 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:37.400
