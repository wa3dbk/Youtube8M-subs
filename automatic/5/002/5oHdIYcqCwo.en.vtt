00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:10.460

 a moment still goku son you got yourself 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.670
 actually well considered as you this 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.700
 and want to defeat when you return 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.010
 on the earth up to good that off 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.539
 4 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.490
 a brutal one for the left 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 that's enough for the fusion that's the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.960
 secret weapon of no jeans and yet 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.039
 much better than opposition that yes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.039
 really awesome 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.250
 this energy yes, but that's how 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.250
 does that work? 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.120
 after already 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.740
 Are you serious as serious as you are 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.420
 not by the fusion we will become one 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.250
 new kicker strong warriors form the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 stronger than anyone else not so 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.260
 kita I ask you what are you waiting for 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.839
 who does not do that 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.200
 in fact, the two opponents seem 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.850
 to be about the same size 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.659
 but this fight will surely be 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.219
 draw this person 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.810
 amazing result produced 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.110
 I already asked how I look 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.110
 would 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.950
 The muscles are warns when you are whole 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.990
 at the beginning, as I once in my position 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.520
 I know this fight has to me first 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.020
 get used to it but that should not 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.159
 will excuse not easy sometimes 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.159
 if I have my arm amputated 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.939
 in spite of the matter 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.960
 I have no reason to stop him 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.310
 sees in Potsdam a second one has 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.080
 must have his chance at the right moment 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.010
 use like georgia 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.229
 and then we will 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.420
 We generate up to a great extent, I know 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.860
 thought I agree but for one 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.860
 little is not enough for a long time 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.900
 The effect of the merger is over 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.490
 we only solved the shield 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.380
 I could almost have imagined that 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.540
 we strengthened two people there 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.150
 pleasing that is not possible 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.010
 this song on the self at what 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.480
 was that tolerable again 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.480
 earn absorption understand 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.080
 I hope you have to go out here 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.819
 I always hope when you get angry 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.290
 has become he has such comic 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.880
 Sandblast through any holes 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.190
 expelled in his head 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.190
 best means in any case, nothing good
