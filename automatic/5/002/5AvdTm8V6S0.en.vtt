00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.099 
is the minolta 24 85 millimeter it's
very<00:00:15.509> very<00:00:15.750> sharp<00:00:15.990> excellent<00:00:16.680> bouquet<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:18.109> it

very very sharp excellent bouquet and it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.230 
very very sharp excellent bouquet and it
has<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> range<00:00:19.590> pretty<00:00:20.340> much<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.699> anything

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
has a range pretty much of anything

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.620 
has a range pretty much of anything
you'd<00:00:21.420> want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.689> shoot<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.340> 24<00:00:24.330> millimeter

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
you'd want to shoot so a 24 millimeter

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.529 
you'd want to shoot so a 24 millimeter
and<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.410> 1.5<00:00:25.890> crop<00:00:26.130> factor<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.609> 36<00:00:27.150> millimeter

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and the 1.5 crop factor is 36 millimeter

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.370 
and the 1.5 crop factor is 36 millimeter
so<00:00:27.720> that's<00:00:27.900> pretty<00:00:28.260> good<00:00:28.410> wide<00:00:28.590> angle<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:30.380> at

so that's pretty good wide angle and at

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
so that's pretty good wide angle and at
85<00:00:31.740> millimeter<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.669> gives<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> plenty<00:00:33.120> zoom

can<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.489> half<00:00:38.579> times<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
can do one and a half times that so that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.010 
can do one and a half times that so that
gives<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.980> even<00:00:41.100> greater<00:00:41.280> range<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.899> you
