00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to go back so that means that you're a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.539 
to go back so that means that you're a
lot<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> fun<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.740> hang<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.159> because<00:01:14.310> he'd

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
lot of fun to hang out with because he'd

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.410 
lot of fun to hang out with because he'd
rather<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.939> doing<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.259> what<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.860> is

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
rather be doing that what you can do is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.200 
rather be doing that what you can do is
basically<00:01:18.439> work<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> around<00:01:19.710> meals<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
basically work it around meals so that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
basically work it around meals so that
he's<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.830> hungry<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.009> wants<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.280> go

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
he's actually hungry and wants to go

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
he's actually hungry and wants to go
back<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.759> his<00:01:23.850> cage<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.240> eat<00:01:24.390> his<00:01:24.509> meal<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.229> if

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
back to his cage to eat his meal so if

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
back to his cage to eat his meal so if
you're<00:01:25.890> feeding<00:01:26.189> him<00:01:26.340> its<00:01:26.580> food<00:01:26.729> outside<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
you're feeding him its food outside of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 
you're feeding him its food outside of
his<00:01:27.630> cage<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.960> he<00:01:28.049> literally<00:01:28.380> has<00:01:28.650> nothing<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
his cage and he literally has nothing to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.260 
his cage and he literally has nothing to
do<00:01:29.549> inside<00:01:29.880> except<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:31.369> just<00:01:32.369> sit<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:33.000> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
do inside except for just sit there and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.510 
do inside except for just sit there and
wish<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> he<00:01:33.750> was<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.400> need

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
wish that he was out with you you need

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
wish that he was out with you you need
to<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.000> something<00:01:36.180> reinforcing<00:01:37.020> like

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to look for something reinforcing like

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.590 
to look for something reinforcing like
you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.380> put<00:01:37.530> inside<00:01:37.770> his<00:01:38.130> cage<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:39.329> he<00:01:39.450> can

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you can put inside his cage that he can

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.109 
you can put inside his cage that he can
actually<00:01:39.689> look<00:01:39.990> forward<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> doing<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.130> for

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
actually look forward to doing so for

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
actually look forward to doing so for
example<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.780> try<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.320> feed<00:01:43.530> our<00:01:43.680> Birds

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
example we try not to feed our Birds

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
example we try not to feed our Birds
outside<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> their<00:01:44.970> cage<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.390> mean<00:01:45.540> unless<00:01:45.720> it's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
outside of their cage I mean unless it's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.870 
outside of their cage I mean unless it's
treats<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.560> training<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.729> their

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
treats for training but they get their

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.149 
treats for training but they get their
actual<00:01:48.240> meals<00:01:48.570> inside<00:01:49.259> their<00:01:49.470> cages<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.009> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
actual meals inside their cages so that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.380 
actual meals inside their cages so that
they<00:01:50.520> actually<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:51.000> something<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.299> look

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
they actually have something to look

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.710 
they actually have something to look
forward<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.320> back<00:01:52.530> easy<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
forward to so they go back easy so I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.399 
forward to so they go back easy so I
would<00:01:54.960> recommend<00:01:55.140> possibly<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:57.409> maybe

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
would recommend possibly that and maybe

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.319 
would recommend possibly that and maybe
also<00:01:58.979> our<00:01:59.340> birds<00:01:59.549> will<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.210> really

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
also our birds will like get really

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.240 
also our birds will like get really
excited<00:02:00.810> over<00:02:00.990> any

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
excited over any

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.510 
excited over any
toy<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:02.180> if<00:02:02.600> they<00:02:03.140> aren't<00:02:03.350> hungry<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:04.010> we<00:02:04.370> need

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
toy so if they aren't hungry and we need

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.250 
toy so if they aren't hungry and we need
them<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.700> go<00:02:04.910> back<00:02:05.090> well<00:02:05.330> like<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.810> new<00:02:06.020> toy

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
them to go back well like have a new toy

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.690 
them to go back well like have a new toy
and<00:02:06.530> put<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.010> in<00:02:07.130> there<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.430> they'll<00:02:07.550> look

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
and put it in there and they'll look

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.400 
and put it in there and they'll look

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
they'll be really excited to go check

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.820 
they'll be really excited to go check
that<00:02:09.590> out<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:11.660> yeah<00:02:11.840> that's<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.680> think

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
that out so yeah that's what I can think

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.890 
that out so yeah that's what I can think
of<00:02:13.040> but<00:02:13.400> basically<00:02:13.940> you're<00:02:14.270> just<00:02:14.300> trying<00:02:14.780> to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
of but basically you're just trying to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.880 
of but basically you're just trying to
look<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.170> something<00:02:15.620> that's<00:02:15.650> more

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
look for something that's more

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.430 
look for something that's more
reinforcing<00:02:16.730> or<00:02:16.940> at<00:02:17.450> least<00:02:17.630> more<00:02:17.840> reinforcing

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
reinforcing or at least more reinforcing

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.920 
reinforcing or at least more reinforcing
at<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> time<00:02:18.890> than<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.490> are<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.090> which<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.840> be

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
at the time than you are so which can be

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.540 
at the time than you are so which can be
a<00:02:20.959> little<00:02:21.200> bit<00:02:21.320> hard<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.130> creative

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
a little bit hard so just get creative

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.699 
a little bit hard so just get creative
on<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.880> because<00:02:23.290> Ranger<00:02:24.290> wants<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.560> hang<00:02:24.650> out

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
on that because Ranger wants to hang out

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.040
