 he encouraged, Said said borrowed 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.389
 the sheets removed 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.139
 as a next step 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.779
 If you look around this chorus and the one between them 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.439
 Get Untersteinbach 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.890
 there you can percent you can get the word 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 we have 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.289
 who less professional 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.490
 and at some but the hamburger writer has 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.029
 and in it just lukewarm water 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.490
 and first of all 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.150
 Change in the team around 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.380
 v 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.090
 make a mistake 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.600
 Frequently rss-feed on landline 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 currently visited 4 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.760
 Hochheim 13 for 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.320
 HBH 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.230
 Berlin 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.720
 the race finds it can do water damage 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.720
 it's clear that it's going fast 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.230
 to 30 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.400
 RSC 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 if subsequently on the 7 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.390
 sentence 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.840
 H 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.470
 so could 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.490
 both after the game actually 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.410
 perhaps 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.250
 first are 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.500
 drip off or times 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.510
 with it a cloth 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.810
 pat dry 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.360
 but since we are here now 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.730
 MJ want one 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.730
 Kids right over to the next step 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.159
 Banks should land 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.069
 They can do boxing mostly 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.229
 the segment is why 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.379
 pat dry until well dry 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.820
 no matter what he really needs 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.629
 around Mr. Kuhn 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.219
 Conversely, it has been developed at a favorable low price 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.599
 rather, he is one 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.599
 in the nuclear power plant in the race 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.489
 2 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.579
 and the 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.779
 and first and foremost 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.379
 around 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.679
 next to again 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.969
 Contact Tel 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.969
 We have to do that now 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.649
 the saleswoman 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.229
 Conradi are attacked mostly I do not want to be discouraged 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
 Company had to pay 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.619
 Maybe he was not exactly in the water 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.519
 Sillian 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.439
 however, could 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.439
 how so 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.779
 risk of death 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.779
 we would never go 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.499
 who also used the injured 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.729
 the percentage point 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.959
 one counts all well 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.039
 so lived through 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.839
 Let's leave the heart there 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:44.759
 No, 7 for an hour the ideas like to talk again 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.139
 go swimming 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.459
 handed over by the restructuring 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.189
 Already alarmed in the morning so that no contacts are given 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.809
 he does not see 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:59.059
 the Bobpilot percent settled 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.059
 I could go even one percent up 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.659
 but debt Burda percent special devices the central banks 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:07.989
 can 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.059
 good grades 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:12.150
 2 "I would do that now 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.919
 ten minutes 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.129
 around 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.049
 but I'll take it good again 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.739
 after another 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.800
 let's just lay it down real hours it's an outdoor set 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.230
 down Nabucco test customers might blow out like that 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.230
 to the audience the reason is co-producer is 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.080
 and then that's really half an hour's old 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.659
 like me Munich 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.979
 were there
