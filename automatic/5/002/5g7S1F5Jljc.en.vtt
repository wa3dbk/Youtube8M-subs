after I leave my room you come and find

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.969 
after I leave my room you come and find
the<00:01:12.510> lamp<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:12.990> proceed<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> hide<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.860> in

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
to use the lamp according to the theory

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
to use the lamp according to the theory
of<00:01:20.670> mind<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.119> will<00:01:21.270> go<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.540> room<00:01:21.720> because

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
of mind I will go to my room because

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
they'll think that I'll go check your

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.789 
they'll think that I'll go check your
room<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.750> where<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.170> lamp<00:01:34.590> is
