00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.200
 hi weights this michael and today we 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.030
 let's talk about the phenomenon of today 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.820
 why are we yawning 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.949
 and why yawning is contagious why 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.990
 when I see to open and just 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.800
 thinking about it , I have a desire 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.740
 winter 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.840
 let's start with theories when 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 yawn you breathe air and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.140
 eardrum 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.429
 slightly stretched so this 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.160
 moment of audible noise lusha 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.739
 phenomenon when you knock down and at the same time 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.290
 drawn out with the whole body is called 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.000
 pulling up 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 invent a wrong opinion that people are yawning 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.230
 when their body needs more air 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.600
 more oxygen one study 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.969
 showed that changes in the proportion of oxygen 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 the air around the person does not force 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.100
 yawn him more or less and when people 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.660
 are engaged in physical exercise and their 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.460
 the body really needs more 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.649
 quantity with the people they call not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.079
 more often and ordinary experience actually 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.439
 indicate that the reason is yawning 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.140
 connected by the state of cooling once 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.650
 tired and exhausted then internal 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.080
 your brain temperature rises but 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.430
 your brain is like an optimal computer 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.439
 all works only on some 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 certain temperature and during 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.090
 name is in the cool air enters 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.759
 inward through mouth and ears chilling 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.240
 facial vessels and actually helping 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.860
 chilling your brain is easy 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.860
 amenable to research during 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.750
 observations of all you parrots experience 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.369
 showed that the parrot yawns only when 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.210
 specific temperature range 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.490
 the environment 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.740
 too cold and yawning too much 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140
 cool the brain too hot and today 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.270
 turnover raise its temperature parrots 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.189
 great for the role of like for 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.320
 research data as they yawn 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.450
 just like us but not experiencing 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.980
 contagious and effects of everything 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.210
 if you show someone a video on 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.070
 which people are yawning 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.580
 most likely he will also appear 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.990
 wish cygnus if so much you don't 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.570
 put an ice pack 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.670
 we give him a cover keeping his brain 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.229
 chilled seriously at university in 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.970
 albany new york state punished that 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.690
 man is less infectious 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.050
 yawning 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.030
 with such a package on the head it means 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.540
 what yawn for cooling own 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.090
 brain 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 privileges not only for birds also 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.290
 studies have shown that yawning is still 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.920
 raises blood pressure 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.170
 facial muscles and helps yourself 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.800
 focus while pulling a 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.940
 you stretch all your muscles 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.310
 preparing them for immediate 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.480
 su work so when it comes to 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.760
 herd animals 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.640
 the infectious property of yawning has 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.560
 meaning one after another every herd yawns 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.080
 and everyone stay on guard 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.209
 according to this theory diligence and 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.180
 water is its positive properties 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.250
 when one animal yawns it 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.760
 kind of reminds other members 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.940
 herds 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.400
 what you need to stay on guard and of course 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.080
 when we say that yawning is contagious 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.180
 we are not meant to remember 100 times 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.900
 rather, it has more to do with such 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.080
 services like 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.030
 empathy is sympathy called 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.890
 feeling when you show worry 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.959
 for someone you do n't want him to be 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.980
 better empathy is ability 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.090
 recognize and share emotions that 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.950
 experiencing other people 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.659
 emotional union is a phenomenon 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.569
 making you feel emotion 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 around even if you yourself are not 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.069
 wish for example when you are among 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.599
 happy people for rises 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.720
 mood or when anger and fear 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.209
 the crowd cause you gregarious feeling children 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.549
 with autism who are having problems 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.849
 posts in social interactions 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.560
 develops less often than other children in 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.310
 time watching the video where other people 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.920
 drained 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.170
 so yawning is contagious of 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.730
 emotional togetherness or the whole thing in and 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.319
 party with last year at the university 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.879
 sand cities were approved 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.159
 what's the stretch that's best 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.879
 manifested prague family then among 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.030
 friends 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.329
 then among friends and finally among 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.099
 strangers at lida university were 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.639
 conducted studies with the participation of the group 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.500
 people 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.970
 the purpose of which was to find out how 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.709
 they are sold empathy 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.959
 but among people waiting to be written 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.419
 test sit day man working on 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.470
 a researcher somewhere a man yawned 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.789
 every minute for ten minutes 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.169
 wonderful that those participants which 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.130
 subsequently wrote a test for 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.909
 maximum points 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.190
 infectious yawning was also served 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:34.949
 more to the rest let's talk about 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.659
 today animals especially amazes me 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.870
 the fact that animals are very diverse 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:41.520
 kinds of food are all yawning and every screw and 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.440
 for various reasons will make such 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.010
 animals like guinea pigs and some 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.229
 monkey species 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.599
 yawns in order to frighten enemies and 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.639
 show your sharp fangs some 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.860
 species penguins cry to attract 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.930
 sail and the serpent just helps to align 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.970
 position of your own jaw and and open 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.380
 trachea that in better breathe after you say 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.320
 his body is big dinner 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.330
 fish of which i more often when the quantity 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.230
 oxygen in the water below normal 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.360
 and the temperature of the water is above well in this way 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.850
 and when you yawn you do the same 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.530
 the most like all animals on the planet for 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.160
 most likely you do it on the other 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.650
 the reason 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.100
 unique for your kind that is for 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.100
 human 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.340
 what's really cool is that 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.550
 yawning is nothing but an ancient signal 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.000
 telling us people let's do it 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.449
 let's get higher and as always thank you for 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.449
