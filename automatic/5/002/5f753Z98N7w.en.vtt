00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.780
 Hi hello 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.730
 Deep cultivation of Corydoras 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.730
 I entered the 4th week 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.610
 Well today is the last round today 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.890
 I would like to show you where to talk about the tank from the plastic case 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.890
 It is the present condition of plastic case 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.300
 It has grown up 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.419
 If it becomes about this size 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.090
 E's a 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:47.190
 9 I say good or put some food 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:51.760
 It is such a state that gathers at an immediate moment, and the pattern is also quite 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:57.340
 You can also see say Naa So, if you throw away and had come to fog 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:02.600
 Actually I think Japan has a very difficult head to talk about Hydrogen to that gold 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:07.990
 It is a little specialized picture, but if you keep it together with tropical fish and other materials , 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:13.570
 Speaking is a bit in time, so it's a bit bigger than that. 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.790
 It 's very difficult in terms of timing, so it 's especially mixed now in our Bible . 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.820
 so 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.460
 Well if you only bought Corydoras 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.880
 You do n't need to eat much without paying too much attention 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.479
 It is what relationship Tteyuu 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.479
 Around here I Hen 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:37.360
 But when is this time of the main eye is higher, such as water 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.360
 If it is a tank, it may become this regulation more quickly 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.900
 Such as a little today we are also have Well Well the main subject or around and swim in the calm this 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.530
 Hula sounds so 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.610
 In reality 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 I removed it 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.000
 Please 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.230
 Alternating current 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.970
 I would like to do 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.320
 But I bought the usual pro case 2 and removed it 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.940
 In the case of Koitsu, there is such a font 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.410
 This too 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.410
 It's a bit disturbing, so I 'll take it off 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.700
 Let's 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.810
 There is considerable weight to lift, but this is itself 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.810
 Hmm 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.180
 I'm doing this to some extent 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.209
 The fluent water 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.870
 It's not because I've pulled over 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.830
 I I do not tell him very much this wish 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.470
 I still have everything here now 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.120
 Is that okay? 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.330
 It is very difficult to meet each other 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.240
 Let alone open the time so good up 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.890
 Yup 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:08.000
 Let's do it from now on 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:10.850
 It island of wife out Naa but I have to say fallen various now more and more or 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.360
 There are about 3 plastic police guards happening 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.080
 Hmm 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.940
 I can still do it 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.020
 Tag This is perfect now 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.800
 It's gone 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.800
 It's kinda nice 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.600
 If you are in this situation 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.790
 Let's have a look at Ichijo 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.400
 I just say 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.360
 It was found 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.430
 I will go to 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.600
 more than 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.170
 It's funny, but I'll stop by for a moment 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.170
 Do you understand 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.160
 It is a book-type 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.550
 Well it looks like this 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.550
 Doing Tei 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.190
 Take it down to the tank 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.580
 Oh dear 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.860
 Since it is already a matter of semi-force such as practical knowledge 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.490
 It is from here 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.740
 that 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.550
 I was searching for Acer by myself 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.420
 I think I'll have done my best 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:54.490
 This time 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.490
 Other than Corydoras I want to end this is more than I want to end Thank you
