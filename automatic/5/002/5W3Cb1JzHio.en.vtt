00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
server is part of a workgroup it's not

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.020 
server is part of a workgroup it's not
part<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.990> domain<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.920> preferable<00:00:11.730> way<00:00:11.969> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
part of a domain the preferable way to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.169 
part of a domain the preferable way to
do<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.570> with<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.780> domain<00:00:13.259> controller<00:00:13.500> and

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
do this is with a domain controller and

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.730 
do this is with a domain controller and
machines<00:00:15.179> join<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.750> domain<00:00:16.080> but<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> also

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
machines join to the domain but it also

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.429 
machines join to the domain but it also
works<00:00:17.010> with<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> workgroup<00:00:17.690> so<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> local

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
works with a workgroup so I have a local

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.720 
works with a workgroup so I have a local
user<00:00:19.590> called<00:00:19.949> print<00:00:20.220> user<00:00:20.900> if<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:23.400> were<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
user called print user if this were on a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.900 
user called print user if this were on a
domain<00:00:24.949> then<00:00:25.949> obviously<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.699> use<00:00:26.880> your

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
domain then obviously you just use your

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
domain then obviously you just use your
own<00:00:27.180> person<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.380> since<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.949> workgroup

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
own person but since this is a workgroup

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859 
own person but since this is a workgroup
I<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> create<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> local<00:00:30.029> user<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
I have to create a local user on the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.330 
I have to create a local user on the
machine<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.650> holds<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> printer<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:37.340> start

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
machine that holds the printer so start

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.549 
machine that holds the printer so start

the<00:02:17.760> final<00:02:18.060> tab<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.239> want<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.629> look<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.900> is

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
the final tab I want you to look at is

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.399 
the final tab I want you to look at is
the<00:02:19.260> sharing<00:02:19.739> tab<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.250> sever<00:02:21.120> 2003<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.170> looks

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
the sharing tab on sever 2003 this looks

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.660 
the sharing tab on sever 2003 this looks
a<00:02:22.470> little<00:02:22.530> different<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.250> what<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.489> want<00:02:23.610> to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
a little different so what you want to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.830 
a little different so what you want to
do<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.909> want<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.060> check<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.390> box<00:02:24.599> it

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
do is you want to check this box it

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.380 
do is you want to check this box it
shares<00:02:25.079> share<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.650> printer<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.909> uh<00:02:26.939> on

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
shares share this printer but uh on

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.500 
shares share this printer but uh on
Server<00:02:27.629> 2008<00:02:28.079> I<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.379> click<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.739> box

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
Server 2008 I have to click that box

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.240 
Server 2008 I have to click that box
then<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.629> comes<00:02:30.810> back<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.319> moves<00:02:31.829> for<00:02:32.099> some

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
then it comes back and moves for some

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.160 
then it comes back and moves for some
reason<00:02:32.579> so<00:02:33.120> I'm<00:02:33.180> going<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.329> share<00:02:34.019> this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
reason so I'm going to share this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.970 
reason so I'm going to share this
printer<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:36.109> I'm<00:02:37.109> not<00:02:37.349> can't<00:02:37.560> remember<00:02:37.799> but

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
printer and I'm not can't remember but

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.319 
printer and I'm not can't remember but
there<00:02:38.129> may<00:02:38.250> actually<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.519> permissions<00:02:39.120> here

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
there may actually be permissions here

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.940 
there may actually be permissions here
as<00:02:39.450> well<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:39.659> know<00:02:39.810> there's<00:02:40.109> some<00:02:40.290> folders<00:02:40.739> with

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
as well I know there's some folders with

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.580 
as well I know there's some folders with
2003<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:42.659> may<00:02:42.810> have<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.049> actually<00:02:43.140> share

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
2003 so you may have to actually share

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.479 
2003 so you may have to actually share
it<00:02:43.769> here<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.069> well

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
it here as well

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.809 
it here as well
you<00:02:44.670> always<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.359> folders<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.819> so

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
you always have to with folders so so

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.220 
you always have to with folders so so
now<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.269> I've<00:02:48.480> shared<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.870> I'm<00:02:49.019> going<00:02:49.170> to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
now that I've shared it I'm going to

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.780 
now that I've shared it I'm going to
apply<00:02:49.409> and<00:02:49.859> okay<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> got<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.829> Windows<00:02:53.609> 7

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
apply and okay so I got a Windows 7

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.839 
apply and okay so I got a Windows 7
machine<00:02:53.970> here<00:02:54.480> someone<00:02:54.900> click<00:02:55.109> start<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
machine here someone click start and

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.410 
machine here someone click start and
Printers<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.359> in<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.599> same<00:02:57.859> workgroup

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
Printers and it's in the same workgroup

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.670 
Printers and it's in the same workgroup
it<00:03:00.420> could<00:03:00.569> also<00:03:00.689> be<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.709> same<00:03:01.980> domain<00:03:03.439> if<00:03:04.439> it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
it could also be the same domain if it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.589 
it could also be the same domain if it
were<00:03:04.799> joined<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.310> domain<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.420> I'm<00:03:06.480> going

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
were joined to the domain so I'm going

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.470 
were joined to the domain so I'm going
to<00:03:06.659> add<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> network<00:03:07.290> printer<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:09.329> is

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
to add a network printer and this is

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.059 
to add a network printer and this is
just<00:03:09.629> going<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> scan<00:03:10.170> I'm<00:03:10.409> going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> stop<00:03:10.859> it

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
just going to scan I'm going to stop it

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.179 
just going to scan I'm going to stop it
I'm<00:03:11.790> done<00:03:12.000> with<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.650> I'm<00:03:16.709> going<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.889> say<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
I'm done with it so I'm going to say the

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.240 
I'm done with it so I'm going to say the
printer<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.489> want<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:17.940> wasn't<00:03:18.299> listed<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:19.650> can

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
printer I want it wasn't listed I can

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.280 
printer I want it wasn't listed I can
choose<00:03:20.489> by<00:03:20.669> share<00:03:21.000> names<00:03:21.269> such<00:03:21.540> as<00:03:21.569> special

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
choose by share names such as special

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.170 
choose by share names such as special
specialization<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:24.109> server<00:03:25.109> name<00:03:26.120> although<00:03:27.120> it

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
specialization a server name although it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.610 
specialization a server name although it
would<00:03:27.269> probably<00:03:27.389> be<00:03:27.599> better<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:28.079> its<00:03:28.410> IP

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
would probably be better to do its IP

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:41.140 
would probably be better to do its IP
address<00:03:35.329> backslash<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.900> first<00:03:37.139> floor

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.080 

that<00:03:42.150> would<00:03:42.239> be<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.530> name<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:44.159> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
that would be the the name of the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.500 
that would be the the name of the
printer

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
printer

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.509 
printer
that's<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.319> machine<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.310> using

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
that's on the machine so it's using

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.490 
that's on the machine so it's using
NetBIOS<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:49.040> can<00:03:50.040> use<00:03:50.220> by<00:03:50.459> TCP<00:03:51.299> IP<00:03:51.449> address<00:03:52.349> or

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
NetBIOS I can use by TCP IP address or

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.839 
NetBIOS I can use by TCP IP address or
hostname<00:03:52.769> but<00:03:53.069> I<00:03:53.099> just<00:03:53.190> want<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.430> browse<00:03:53.639> for

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
hostname but I just want to browse for

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.819 
hostname but I just want to browse for
the<00:03:53.909> printer<00:03:54.209> that's<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.109> best<00:03:55.290> way<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.470> do<00:03:55.680> it

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
the printer that's the best way to do it

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.949 
the printer that's the best way to do it
in<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.310> domain<00:03:57.090> or<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.359> workgroup

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
in a domain or a workgroup

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.800 
in a domain or a workgroup
so<00:03:58.319> next<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.090> then<00:04:00.090> these<00:04:00.239> are<00:04:00.299> all<00:04:00.419> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
so next and then these are all the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.509 
so next and then these are all the
machines<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.620> Server<00:04:04.829> 2008<00:04:05.459> and

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
machines so it's on the Server 2008 and

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.589 
machines so it's on the Server 2008 and
it's<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:05.879> to<00:04:05.940> ask<00:04:06.090> me<00:04:06.239> for<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.449> password

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
it's going to ask me for a password

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.930 
it's going to ask me for a password
because<00:04:07.379> it's<00:04:07.650> not<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.859> domain<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.729> I'm<00:04:08.819> not

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
because it's not a domain so I'm not

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.949 
because it's not a domain so I'm not
really<00:04:09.209> authenticated<00:04:10.019> yet<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:15.720> the

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
really authenticated yet to to the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.560 
really authenticated yet to to the
domain<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.430> machine<00:04:17.880> that's<00:04:18.150> holding<00:04:18.479> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
domain to the machine that's holding the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.009 
domain to the machine that's holding the
printer

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
printer

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.100 
printer
so<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.729> can<00:04:21.879> do<00:04:21.970> remember<00:04:22.389> my<00:04:22.539> credentials

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
so and I can do remember my credentials

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.920 
so and I can do remember my credentials
so<00:04:24.750> okay

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
so okay

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.159 
so okay
there<00:04:26.319> we<00:04:26.379> go<00:04:26.710> first<00:04:26.919> floor<00:04:27.690> click<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:29.020> it's

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
there we go first floor click on it it's

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.629 
64-bit system or an Itanium system
sometimes<00:04:49.090> you'll<00:04:49.389> see<00:04:49.509> XP<00:04:49.900> or<00:04:50.139> 2000<00:04:50.770> or<00:04:51.039> vista

sometimes you'll see XP or 2000 or vista

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.020 
sometimes you'll see XP or 2000 or vista
specific<00:04:52.270> operating<00:04:52.599> systems<00:04:53.050> there<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:54.639> yeah

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
specific operating systems there so yeah

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.730 
specific operating systems there so yeah
go<00:04:55.300> ahead<00:04:55.539> and<00:04:55.780> install<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.229> driver<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.680> you

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
go ahead and install the driver and you

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.409 
go ahead and install the driver and you
can<00:04:56.830> see<00:04:56.949> the<00:04:57.039> backslash<00:04:57.520> backslash<00:04:57.729> Server

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
can see the backslash backslash Server

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.899 
can see the backslash backslash Server
2008<00:04:59.139> B<00:04:59.409> that's<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:00.280> name<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.669> server

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
2008 B that's the name of the server

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:12.570 
2008 B that's the name of the server
over<00:05:01.150> there<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:07.259> next<00:05:08.259> and<00:05:08.800> finish<00:05:09.599> so<00:05:11.580> it's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
over there and next and finish so it's

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.740 
over there and next and finish so it's
not<00:05:12.669> actually<00:05:12.819> going<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.210> print<00:05:13.360> anything

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
not actually going to print anything

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.129 
not actually going to print anything
cause<00:05:13.870> it's<00:05:14.020> not<00:05:14.139> a<00:05:14.199> real<00:05:14.259> printer<00:05:15.930> but<00:05:19.139> there

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
cause it's not a real printer but there

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.680 
cause it's not a real printer but there
it<00:05:20.229> is<00:05:20.289> their<00:05:20.560> server<00:05:21.039> first<00:05:21.729> floor<00:05:21.969> on<00:05:22.240> Server

it is their server first floor on Server
2008<00:05:23.379> B<00:05:23.590> and<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:25.030> can<00:05:25.060> see<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.750> if<00:05:25.900> I<00:05:26.080> view

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
2008 B and you can see that if I view

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.040 
2008 B and you can see that if I view
will<00:05:28.509> do<00:05:28.599> medium<00:05:28.930> icons<00:05:29.729> doing<00:05:30.729> large<00:05:30.969> icons

this<00:05:35.050> little<00:05:35.259> printer<00:05:35.500> here<00:05:35.770> has<00:05:35.979> these<00:05:36.250> two

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
this little printer here has these two

this little printer here has these two
people<00:05:36.849> underneath<00:05:37.539> it<00:05:37.719> that<00:05:37.870> means<00:05:38.020> it's

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
people underneath it that means it's

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.909 
people underneath it that means it's
being<00:05:38.349> shared<00:05:38.740> with<00:05:39.729> people<00:05:39.909> in<00:05:40.770> 2003<00:05:41.770> you'll

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
being shared with people in 2003 you'll

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.890 
being shared with people in 2003 you'll
see<00:05:42.069> a<00:05:42.099> little<00:05:42.250> hand<00:05:42.550> because<00:05:43.120> it's<00:05:43.300> handing

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
see a little hand because it's handing

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.260 
see a little hand because it's handing
the<00:05:43.960> printer<00:05:44.229> out<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:44.620> people<00:05:44.889> to<00:05:44.949> be<00:05:45.069> used<00:05:45.430> so

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
the printer out to people to be used so

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.740 
the printer out to people to be used so
anyway<00:05:47.139> this<00:05:47.710> is<00:05:47.770> done<00:05:48.039> in<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.250> workgroup<00:05:48.750> in

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
anyway this is done in a workgroup in

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.209 
anyway this is done in a workgroup in
about<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.050> month<00:05:50.289> or<00:05:50.469> so<00:05:50.500> it'll<00:05:51.069> actually

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
about a month or so it'll actually

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.420 
about a month or so it'll actually
forget<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:52.990> printer<00:05:53.349> so<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:54.159> constantly

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
forget that printer so you constantly

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.059 
forget that printer so you constantly
have<00:05:54.880> to<00:05:55.029> uninstall<00:05:55.300> and<00:05:55.690> reinstall<00:05:55.810> and<00:05:56.500> it's

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
have to uninstall and reinstall and it's

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.320 
have to uninstall and reinstall and it's
more<00:05:57.250> difficult<00:05:57.610> when<00:05:57.729> you're<00:05:57.849> using<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:58.180> home

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
more difficult when you're using a home

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.120 
more difficult when you're using a home
version<00:05:58.599> or<00:05:59.020> Linux<00:05:59.380> machine<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.919> share

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
version or Linux machine to share

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.550 
version or Linux machine to share
printers<00:06:00.580> in<00:06:00.729> a<00:06:00.789> workgroup<00:06:00.969> so<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.990> ideal<00:06:02.319> way

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
printers in a workgroup so the ideal way

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.529 
printers in a workgroup so the ideal way
to<00:06:02.620> do<00:06:02.830> this<00:06:02.979> is<00:06:03.219> in<00:06:03.460> a<00:06:03.639> domain<00:06:04.389> controller

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
to do this is in a domain controller

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.649 
to do this is in a domain controller
environment<00:06:05.699> but<00:06:06.699> hopefully<00:06:07.240> you've<00:06:07.389> learned

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
environment but hopefully you've learned

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.600 
environment but hopefully you've learned
something<00:06:07.900> with<00:06:08.169> this<00:06:08.349> and<00:06:08.620> you'll<00:06:09.400> get<00:06:09.490> to

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
something with this and you'll get to

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.010 
something with this and you'll get to
play<00:06:09.729> with<00:06:09.880> your<00:06:10.029> server<00:06:10.180> more<00:06:10.479> often<00:06:10.870> and

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
play with your server more often and

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.649 
play with your server more often and
possibly<00:06:11.889> share<00:06:12.099> printers<00:06:12.539> thanks<00:06:13.539> for

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
possibly share printers thanks for
