00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Congenital anomalies and delivery 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.859
 premature are in many countries causes 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.590
 important infant mortality 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.320
 chronic illness and disability 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.719
 calculates that every year 270 thousand new 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.910
 born died during the first 28 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.960
 days of life due to anomalies 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.660
 congenital this time we will talk about 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.440
 a subject that is titled anencephaly the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.170
 birth without brain let's start 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.480
 anencephaly is a defect in the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.090
 merger of several sites closing the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.910
 neural tube in the neuro process the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.070
 action during embryogenesis occurs 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.489
 when the head end or head 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.739
 of the neural tube fails to close 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.379
 generally between day 23 and 26 of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.090
 pregnancy resulting in a 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.879
 congenital brain malformation 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.250
 characterized by the partial absence or 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.710
 total brain skull and leather 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.440
 scalp in these conditions the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.440
 newborns are also unaware 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.290
 of blind deaf and insensitive to pain 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.780
 the activity is usually reduced to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.909
 respiratory system and the presence of some 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.330
 elementary reflexes the trunk of the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.760
 Encephalon is developed only in a 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.140
 25% of the cases and also present a 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.690
 poor development of the gland 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.330
 hypophysis the life expectancy at 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.790
 birth is only a few days this 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.909
 condition is one of the least disturbances 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.430
 common of the central nervous system its 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.210
 Frequency varies between 1 and 2 per each 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.310
 thousand births 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.049
 upset affects girls more to 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.400
 often that to males 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.070
 the causes of the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.170
 anencephaly although it is believed that the diet 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.340
 of the mother and the ingestion of vitamins 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.509
 can play an important role 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.400
 Recent investigations include 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.290
 within the possible causes the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.690
 ingestion of anti epilepsy drugs 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.360
 during pregnancy mechanical aggression 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.850
 contact with pesticides factors 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.369
 environmental radiation and anomalies 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.340
 chromosome there is no cure or 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.960
 standard treatment for anencephaly 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.899
 and the prognosis for individuals 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.870
 affected are poor most 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.940
 patients do not survive childhood if 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.340
 the child is not born dead usually 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.580
 dies a few hours or days after the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.580
 birth
