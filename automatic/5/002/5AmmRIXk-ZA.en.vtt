hot pod now I'm a huge fan of heated

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.980 
hot pod now I'm a huge fan of heated
rollers<00:00:12.130> in<00:00:12.280> setting<00:00:12.700> but<00:00:13.299> I've<00:00:13.420> got<00:00:13.599> too<00:00:13.809> many

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
rollers in setting but I've got too many

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.710 
rollers in setting but I've got too many
problems<00:00:14.230> one<00:00:15.190> is<00:00:15.400> a<00:00:15.580> often<00:00:16.150> I<00:00:16.240> find<00:00:16.480> with<00:00:16.690> my

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
problems one is a often I find with my

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.320 
problems one is a often I find with my
roller<00:00:16.990> isn't<00:00:17.500> enough<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:18.010> also<00:00:18.730> if<00:00:19.180> it<00:00:19.300> is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
roller isn't enough and also if it is

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.170 
roller isn't enough and also if it is
hot<00:00:19.690> it's<00:00:20.170> too<00:00:20.290> hot<00:00:20.650> to<00:00:20.800> hold<00:00:20.950> but<00:00:21.790> one<00:00:21.970> thing<00:00:22.150> I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
hot it's too hot to hold but one thing I

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.700 
hot it's too hot to hold but one thing I
find<00:00:22.390> with<00:00:22.510> this<00:00:22.720> is<00:00:22.930> that<00:00:23.080> I<00:00:23.230> can<00:00:23.380> heat<00:00:23.560> them

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
find with this is that I can heat them

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.650 
find with this is that I can heat them
up<00:00:23.800> individually<00:00:24.040> they<00:00:24.970> get<00:00:25.120> just<00:00:25.300> such<00:00:25.630> a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
up individually they get just such a

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.510 
up individually they get just such a
fantastic<00:00:26.170> heat<00:00:26.590> that<00:00:26.830> it<00:00:26.950> will<00:00:27.040> hold<00:00:27.370> the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
fantastic heat that it will hold the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.130 
fantastic heat that it will hold the
curl<00:00:27.700> and<00:00:27.880> really<00:00:28.150> well<00:00:28.300> but<00:00:28.840> it's<00:00:28.990> also

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
curl and really well but it's also

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.780 
curl and really well but it's also
incredibly<00:00:29.740> cool<00:00:29.980> on<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.250> outside<00:00:30.610> which

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
incredibly cool on the outside which

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.970 
incredibly cool on the outside which
means<00:00:31.000> I<00:00:31.120> can<00:00:31.270> touch<00:00:31.480> it<00:00:31.720> so<00:00:32.710> what<00:00:32.800> I'm<00:00:32.890> gonna

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
means I can touch it so what I'm gonna

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.430 
means I can touch it so what I'm gonna
do<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.190> going<00:00:33.280> to<00:00:33.340> show<00:00:33.520> you<00:00:33.580> how<00:00:33.820> to<00:00:34.120> set<00:00:34.750> using

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
do is going to show you how to set using

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.930 
do is going to show you how to set using
just<00:00:35.740> the<00:00:35.950> large<00:00:36.220> ones<00:00:36.430> now<00:00:36.580> we've<00:00:36.700> got<00:00:36.850> the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
for a loose movement and something

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.690 
for a loose movement and something
really<00:00:44.320> casual<00:00:44.740> we're<00:00:45.220> gonna<00:00:45.400> go<00:00:45.520> for<00:00:45.670> the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
large in a whole set we're gonna brick

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.730 
large in a whole set we're gonna brick
bind<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.610> and<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.360> first<00:00:49.630> section<00:00:50.110> instead<00:00:50.620> of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
bind it and the first section instead of

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.590 
bind it and the first section instead of
going<00:00:50.920> back<00:00:51.130> like<00:00:51.550> we<00:00:51.700> might<00:00:51.850> normally<00:00:52.090> I'm

going back like we might normally I'm
going<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:52.930> go<00:00:53.020> forward<00:00:53.500> so<00:00:53.530> I<00:00:53.650> can<00:00:53.829> get<00:00:53.950> a

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
going to go forward so I can get a

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.250 
going to go forward so I can get a
little<00:00:54.190> bit<00:00:54.310> of<00:00:54.400> lift<00:00:54.610> up<00:00:54.880> and<00:00:55.270> around

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
I've taken a rectangular section at the

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.550 
I've taken a rectangular section at the
top<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:58.989> head<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.899> I'm<00:01:01.989> going<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.290> section

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
top of the head and I'm going to section

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.740 
top of the head and I'm going to section
out<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.040> front<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:07.180> everybody<00:01:07.540> starts

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
out the front now everybody starts

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.020 
out the front now everybody starts
differently<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.470> know<00:01:08.500> some<00:01:08.830> people<00:01:09.250> want<00:01:09.940> to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
differently you know some people want to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.730 
differently you know some people want to
start<00:01:10.330> at<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.600> back<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:10.990> some<00:01:11.440> people<00:01:11.620> want

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.200 
start at the back and some people want
to<00:01:11.800> start<00:01:12.010> at<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.100> front<00:01:12.280> I<00:01:12.610> think<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.060> front

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
to start at the front I think the front

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.790 
to start at the front I think the front
is<00:01:13.300> where<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.450> need<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.750> most<00:01:13.930> hold<00:01:14.320> especially

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
is where I need the most hold especially

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.560 
is where I need the most hold especially
if<00:01:14.860> it's<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.070> shoe<00:01:15.280> so<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:15.940> am<00:01:16.090> going<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.299> start<00:01:16.510> at

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
if it's a shoe so I am going to start at

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.910 
if it's a shoe so I am going to start at
the<00:01:16.630> front<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:17.020> time

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.590 

it's<00:01:21.460> really<00:01:21.700> important<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.240> remember<00:01:22.390> as

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
it's really important to remember as

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.899 
it's really important to remember as
well<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:22.990> have<00:01:23.140> prepared<00:01:23.800> this<00:01:24.010> hammer<00:01:24.310> then

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
well we have prepared this hammer then

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.570 
well we have prepared this hammer then
I'm<00:01:24.970> going<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.150> take<00:01:25.330> my<00:01:25.479> robot<00:01:26.670> comb<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:27.850> up

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.370 

twist<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.820> around

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.319

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
grips that go over the top but I prefer

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.420 
grips that go over the top but I prefer
to<00:01:44.070> use<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.369> pin<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.210> whatever<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.720> prefer<00:01:46.430> you

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
something a bit more set so we're going

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.319 
something a bit more set so we're going
to<00:04:00.540> go<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:01.199> vintage<00:04:01.949> even<00:04:02.549> more<00:04:02.639> traditional

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329

look<00:04:03.569> with<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.290> set<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.250> for<00:04:06.180> example<00:04:06.629> if<00:04:07.019> we

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
look with a set so for example if we

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.300 
look with a set so for example if we
were<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.349> take<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.650> front<00:04:07.799> section<00:04:08.010> here<00:04:09.139> and

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
were to take the front section here and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.219 
were to take the front section here and
take<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.459> back<00:04:11.639> that<00:04:12.599> could<00:04:12.750> give<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> nice

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
take you back that could give you a nice

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.979 
take you back that could give you a nice
wave<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.829> stretches<00:04:14.340> back<00:04:14.389> but<00:04:15.389> my

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
wave that stretches back but my

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.589 
wave that stretches back but my
preference<00:04:16.440> would<00:04:17.009> be<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.789> go<00:04:17.940> forward<00:04:18.449> so

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
preference would be to go forward so

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.390 
preference would be to go forward so
that<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.750> can<00:04:19.019> get<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> little<00:04:19.409> bit<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.739> lift<00:04:20.009> at

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
that I can get a little bit of lift at

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.370 
that I can get a little bit of lift at
the<00:04:20.430> front<00:04:20.729> here<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.150> then<00:04:21.659> sweep<00:04:22.019> him<00:04:22.229> back

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
the front here and then sweep him back
