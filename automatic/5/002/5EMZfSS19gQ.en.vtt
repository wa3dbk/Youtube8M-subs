now<00:00:05.750> we're<00:00:06.049> going<00:00:06.140> to<00:00:06.200> go<00:00:06.350> ahead<00:00:06.380> and<00:00:06.830> begin<00:00:06.980> to

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
now we're going to go ahead and begin to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.250 
now we're going to go ahead and begin to
look<00:00:07.430> more<00:00:07.670> of<00:00:07.790> these<00:00:07.970> properties<00:00:08.630> I'm<00:00:09.110> going

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
look more of these properties I'm going

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.570 
look more of these properties I'm going
to<00:00:09.320> clear<00:00:09.559> my<00:00:09.710> canvas<00:00:10.070> a<00:00:10.160> little<00:00:10.370> bit<00:00:10.460> by

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
to clear my canvas a little bit by

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.490 
to clear my canvas a little bit by
deleting<00:00:10.879> a<00:00:11.030> few<00:00:11.210> of<00:00:11.299> these<00:00:11.420> so<00:00:12.260> I'm<00:00:12.379> just

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
deleting a few of these so I'm just

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.709 
deleting a few of these so I'm just
going<00:00:12.620> to<00:00:12.709> delete<00:00:12.830> that<00:00:13.010> one<00:00:13.219> this<00:00:14.209> one<00:00:14.270> and

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
going to delete that one this one and

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.450 
going to delete that one this one and
that<00:00:14.809> one<00:00:15.500> and<00:00:15.680> we're<00:00:15.980> going<00:00:16.100> to<00:00:16.129> left<00:00:16.309> with

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
that one and we're going to left with

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.090 
that one and we're going to left with
just<00:00:16.490> this<00:00:16.940> one<00:00:17.289> circular<00:00:18.289> synthetic

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
just this one circular synthetic

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.470 
just this one circular synthetic
primitive<00:00:19.520> now<00:00:19.640> I'm<00:00:19.699> going<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:19.880> click<00:00:20.029> on<00:00:20.240> it

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
primitive now I'm going to click on it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.210 
primitive now I'm going to click on it
on<00:00:20.600> the<00:00:20.840> list<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:21.289> then<00:00:21.830> I'm<00:00:21.890> going<00:00:21.980> to<00:00:22.039> move

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
on the list and then I'm going to move

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.740 
on the list and then I'm going to move
it<00:00:22.369> around<00:00:22.429> so<00:00:22.849> that<00:00:22.880> we<00:00:23.029> can<00:00:23.210> see<00:00:23.390> that<00:00:23.509> it<00:00:23.660> is

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
it around so that we can see that it is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.779 
it around so that we can see that it is
in<00:00:23.900> fact<00:00:23.929> a<00:00:24.320> circle<00:00:24.710> I'm<00:00:25.220> also<00:00:25.400> going<00:00:25.580> to<00:00:25.640> go

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
in fact a circle I'm also going to go

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.880 
in fact a circle I'm also going to go
ahead<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.240> launch<00:00:26.509> a<00:00:26.779> square<00:00:27.199> like<00:00:27.619> so

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
ahead and launch a square like so

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.919 
ahead and launch a square like so
because<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:29.029> first<00:00:29.240> thing<00:00:29.449> that<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:29.630> want<00:00:29.869> to

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
because the first thing that I want to

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.140 
because the first thing that I want to
look<00:00:30.019> at<00:00:30.230> here<00:00:30.560> is<00:00:30.740> some<00:00:31.249> of<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:31.579> ways<00:00:31.789> in

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
look at here is some of the ways in

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.450 
look at here is some of the ways in
which<00:00:32.180> we<00:00:32.329> can<00:00:32.509> adjust<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.290> fall<00:00:33.620> off<00:00:33.829> these

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
which we can adjust the fall off these

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.550 
which we can adjust the fall off these
three<00:00:34.790> buttons<00:00:34.940> here<00:00:35.300> adjust<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.960> fall<00:00:36.350> off

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
three buttons here adjust the fall off

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.390 
three buttons here adjust the fall off
as<00:00:36.770> far<00:00:37.100> as<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:38.390> edges<00:00:39.020> of<00:00:39.170> these<00:00:39.800> objects<00:00:40.280> are

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
as far as the edges of these objects are

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.130 
as far as the edges of these objects are
concerned<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.000> if<00:00:41.570> you<00:00:41.690> notice<00:00:41.810> here<00:00:42.050> there's

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
concerned so if you notice here there's

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.050 
concerned so if you notice here there's
a<00:00:42.260> slider<00:00:42.590> for<00:00:43.160> fall<00:00:43.340> off<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:43.700> if<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.850> pull<00:00:44.030> this

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
a slider for fall off and if I pull this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.830 
a slider for fall off and if I pull this
all<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.390> way<00:00:44.420> down<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.630> zero<00:00:44.960> what<00:00:45.950> you'll<00:00:46.160> see

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720 

is<00:00:48.900> that<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.650> end<00:00:49.830> up<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.040> basically<00:00:50.400> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
is that we end up with basically a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.890 
is that we end up with basically a
circular<00:00:51.120> object<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.510> reason<00:00:51.600> why<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
circular object the reason why is

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.680 
circular object the reason why is
because<00:00:51.990> the<00:00:52.500> edges<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.610> square<00:00:53.970> have

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
because the edges of that square have

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.720 
because the edges of that square have
fallen<00:00:55.200> off<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.650> they're<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.340> becomes<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
fallen off and they're just becomes this

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.979 
fallen off and they're just becomes this
smooth<00:00:57.420> gradient<00:00:58.200> from<00:00:58.860> basically<00:00:59.760> black<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
smooth gradient from basically black to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.840 
smooth gradient from basically black to
that<00:01:01.559> 500<00:01:02.520> Watts<00:01:03.120> light<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:05.010> i<00:01:05.160> increase

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that 500 Watts light so if i increase

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.480 
that 500 Watts light so if i increase
the<00:01:06.510> fall<00:01:06.690> off<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> way<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.530> you'll<00:01:08.340> see

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the fall off all the way up you'll see

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.940 
the fall off all the way up you'll see
that<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.700> end<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.910> with<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:09.119> pure<00:01:09.930> 500<00:01:10.740> watt

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that we end up with a pure 500 watt

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.650 
that we end up with a pure 500 watt
square<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.820> light<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.240> no<00:01:12.420> fall-off

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
square of light with no fall-off

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.830 
square of light with no fall-off
whatsoever<00:01:13.550> so<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.670> idea<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.390> three

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
whatsoever so the idea with these three

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.800 
whatsoever so the idea with these three
fall<00:01:16.080> off<00:01:16.260> buttons<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.630> going

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
fall off buttons is that this is going

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.060 
fall off buttons is that this is going
to<00:01:18.869> more<00:01:19.110> or<00:01:19.140> less<00:01:19.260> be<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.500> same<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.830> setting

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
to more or less be the same as setting

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.420 
to more or less be the same as setting
the<00:01:20.130> fall-off<00:01:20.400> percentage<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> hundred

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
the fall-off percentage to a hundred

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.120 
the fall-off percentage to a hundred
whereas<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:24.180> linear<00:01:24.930> fall<00:01:25.320> off<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
whereas this linear fall off is going to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.780 
whereas this linear fall off is going to
be<00:01:26.250> more<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:27.330> linear<00:01:27.660> ramp<00:01:28.140> from<00:01:28.619> fully<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
be more of a linear ramp from fully on

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.749 
be more of a linear ramp from fully on
down<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.869> more<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:31.800> less<00:01:31.979> fully<00:01:32.250> off<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.700> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
down to more or less fully off and of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.800 
down to more or less fully off and of
course<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.149> is<00:01:33.300> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> depend<00:01:33.600> greatly

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
course this is going to depend greatly

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.859 
course this is going to depend greatly
on<00:01:34.080> where<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:35.130> slider<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.869> then

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
on where we have this slider and then

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.249 
on where we have this slider and then
finally<00:01:37.440> this<00:01:38.250> curve<00:01:38.820> ramp<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> give

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
finally this curve ramp is going to give

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.109 
finally this curve ramp is going to give
us<00:01:40.289> a<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.710> bit<00:01:40.890> more<00:01:41.190> of<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.399> natural<00:01:41.610> fall

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
us a little bit more of a natural fall

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.029 
us a little bit more of a natural fall
off<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.450> particularly<00:01:42.899> true<00:01:43.200> when<00:01:43.860> we're

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
off and particularly true when we're

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.790 
off and particularly true when we're
working<00:01:44.160> with<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.090> low<00:01:45.539> fall<00:01:45.840> off<00:01:46.050> somewhere<00:01:46.680> in

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
working with a low fall off somewhere in

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.400 
working with a low fall off somewhere in
the<00:01:46.890> neighborhood<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.399> 1<00:01:47.970> or<00:01:48.000> 0<00:01:48.330> you're<00:01:49.259> going

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
the neighborhood of 1 or 0 you're going

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.990 
the neighborhood of 1 or 0 you're going
to<00:01:49.470> barely<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> edges<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> square

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to barely see the edges of the square

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.990 
to barely see the edges of the square
there<00:01:51.180> now<00:01:51.390> why<00:01:52.289> does<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.160> become<00:01:53.550> important

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
there now why does this become important

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.969 
there now why does this become important
and<00:01:54.149> when<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.080> you<00:01:55.259> want<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.530> use<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.770> well

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and when would you want to use this well

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.350 
and when would you want to use this well
obviously<00:01:56.220> if<00:01:56.580> you're<00:01:56.729> wanting<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.330> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
obviously if you're wanting to have a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.389 
obviously if you're wanting to have a
square<00:01:57.750> shape<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.830> quickest<00:01:59.160> thing<00:01:59.220> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
square shape then the quickest thing to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.100 
square shape then the quickest thing to
do<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.910> simply<00:02:00.270> click<00:02:00.569> on<00:02:00.720> this<00:02:00.869> first

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
do is just to simply click on this first

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.260 
do is just to simply click on this first
fall<00:02:01.350> off<00:02:01.500> however<00:02:02.429> generally<00:02:02.850> speaking

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
fall off however generally speaking

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.580 
fall off however generally speaking
you're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.660> want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> go<00:02:03.929> ahead<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.440> use

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you're going to want to go ahead and use

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.900 
you're going to want to go ahead and use
this<00:02:04.830> fall<00:02:05.039> off<00:02:05.220> for<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> most<00:02:05.700> natural

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
this fall off for the most natural

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.960 
this fall off for the most natural
lights<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.660> particularly<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:08.220> low<00:02:08.729> fall

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
lights and particularly for a low fall

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.850 
lights and particularly for a low fall
off<00:02:09.149> percentage<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.929> zero<00:02:10.380> which<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:10.830> I

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
off percentage like zero which is what I

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.110 
off percentage like zero which is what I
tend<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.160> work<00:02:11.310> at<00:02:11.490> now<00:02:11.610> let's<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:11.970> how<00:02:12.060> that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
tend to work at now let's see how that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.320 
tend to work at now let's see how that
works<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.810> our<00:02:13.310> circular<00:02:14.310> primitive<00:02:15.120> here

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
works with our circular primitive here

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.180 
works with our circular primitive here
so<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:15.959> i<00:02:16.020> turn<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.319> fall-off<00:02:16.500> down<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.980> zero

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
so if i turn the fall-off down to zero

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.290 
so if i turn the fall-off down to zero
you'll<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.550> we<00:02:17.640> basically<00:02:17.849> end<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.150> with

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
you'll see that we basically end up with

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.780 
you'll see that we basically end up with
the<00:02:18.390> exact<00:02:18.720> same<00:02:18.959> thing<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:20.069> we<00:02:20.220> have<00:02:20.459> our

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the exact same thing is if we have our

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.570 
the exact same thing is if we have our
fall<00:02:21.120> off<00:02:21.300> set<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.870> 0<00:02:22.110> over<00:02:22.770> here<00:02:22.800> basically

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
fall off set to 0 over here basically

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.460 
fall off set to 0 over here basically
two<00:02:24.150> circular<00:02:24.599> objects<00:02:24.959> even<00:02:25.110> though<00:02:25.319> they're

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
two circular objects even though they're

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.680 
two circular objects even though they're
not<00:02:25.520> circular<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:27.060> reason<00:02:27.330> why<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.450> is

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
not circular the reason why this is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.600 
not circular the reason why this is
important<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:28.530> these<00:02:29.099> buttons<00:02:29.459> up

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
important is because these buttons up

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.970 
important is because these buttons up
here<00:02:29.640> also<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.540> an<00:02:30.660> impact<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:31.830> hit

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
here also have an impact so if I hit

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.610 
here also have an impact so if I hit
solid<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:33.239> this<00:02:33.420> does<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:33.930> effectively

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
solid what this does is it effectively

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.949 
solid what this does is it effectively
makes<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.550> outside<00:02:36.000> edges<00:02:36.239> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.630> solid

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
makes the outside edges of the solid

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.449 
makes the outside edges of the solid
that<00:02:37.080> we<00:02:37.170> can't<00:02:37.380> see<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.770> immediately<00:02:38.160> until

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
that we can't see that immediately until

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.430 
that we can't see that immediately until
he<00:02:38.610> put<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:38.940> over<00:02:39.030> here<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.050> can<00:02:40.140> see<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
he put it over here and you can see that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.650 
he put it over here and you can see that
the<00:02:40.560> edges<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.130> box<00:02:41.610> are<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.060> fact<00:02:42.239> solid

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
the edges of that box are in fact solid

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.290 
the edges of that box are in fact solid
meaning<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.349> black<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:44.300> not

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
meaning that the black is not

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.660 
meaning that the black is not
transparent<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.709> opaque<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.520> its

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
transparent it is opaque and its

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.790 
transparent it is opaque and its
blocking<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.360> even<00:02:49.140> though<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.349> appears<00:02:49.739> to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
blocking out even though this appears to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800 
blocking out even though this appears to
be<00:02:49.920> circular<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.459> not<00:02:50.640> it's<00:02:50.940> giving<00:02:51.569> us<00:02:51.690> that

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
be circular it's not it's giving us that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.720 
be circular it's not it's giving us that
rectangular<00:02:52.319> edge<00:02:52.650> now<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.010> i<00:02:53.069> turn<00:02:53.130> off<00:02:53.280> solid

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
rectangular edge now if i turn off solid

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.910 
rectangular edge now if i turn off solid
you'll<00:02:53.849> see<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.599> these<00:02:54.780> two<00:02:55.020> shapes<00:02:55.260> blend

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
you'll see that these two shapes blend

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.130 
you'll see that these two shapes blend
and<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.849> can<00:02:57.000> allow<00:02:57.090> us<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.659> have<00:02:57.840> some

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
and this can allow us to have some

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.380 
and this can allow us to have some
really<00:02:58.409> interesting<00:02:58.670> sort<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.849> morphing

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
really interesting sort of morphing

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.850 
really interesting sort of morphing
shapes<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.110> our<00:03:01.349> reflections<00:03:01.950> which<00:03:02.129> are<00:03:02.280> very

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
shapes in our reflections which are very

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.120 
shapes in our reflections which are very
now<00:03:03.490> likewise<00:03:04.030> we<00:03:04.180> can<00:03:04.300> also<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.780> dark<00:03:05.380> and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
now likewise we can also do a dark and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.470 
now likewise we can also do a dark and
what<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.370> effectively<00:03:06.730> does<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.090> make<00:03:07.270> this

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
what this effectively does is make this

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.830 
what this effectively does is make this
a<00:03:07.800> light-blocking<00:03:09.240> emitter<00:03:10.240> more<00:03:10.570> or<00:03:10.660> less

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
a light-blocking emitter more or less

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.380 
a light-blocking emitter more or less
it's<00:03:11.230> using<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.220> shape<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.610> we<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:13.180> in

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
it's using the shape that we have in

one is half and what half does is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.160 
one is half and what half does is
effectively<00:03:30.190> cut<00:03:30.550> that<00:03:30.940> bulb<00:03:31.300> in<00:03:31.570> half<00:03:31.810> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
effectively cut that bulb in half and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.440 
effectively cut that bulb in half and
again<00:03:32.380> well<00:03:32.890> see<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.190> more<00:03:33.450> appropriately

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
again well see that more appropriately

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.750 
again well see that more appropriately
if<00:03:34.600> we<00:03:34.720> increase<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.560> fall<00:03:35.920> off<00:03:36.100> something

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
if we increase the fall off something

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.699 
if we increase the fall off something
like<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.480> maybe<00:03:38.140> do<00:03:38.350> something<00:03:38.530> like

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
like so and maybe do something like

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.310 
like so and maybe do something like
linear<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.180> can<00:03:40.390> see<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.630> we<00:03:40.750> end<00:03:41.050> up

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
linear so you can see that we end up

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.010 
linear so you can see that we end up
with<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:41.560> very<00:03:41.920> different<00:03:42.310> shaped<00:03:43.239> object

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
with this very different shaped object

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.830 
with this very different shaped object
than<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.560> square<00:03:44.950> by<00:03:45.550> simply<00:03:45.940> using<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.630> half

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
than a square by simply using the half

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.890 
than a square by simply using the half
and<00:03:47.200> using<00:03:48.130> our<00:03:48.190> fall<00:03:48.400> off<00:03:48.580> accordingly<00:03:49.150> and

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
and using our fall off accordingly and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.720 
and using our fall off accordingly and
finally<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.410> have<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.620> outside<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.489> what<00:03:51.640> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
finally we have the outside and what the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.220 
finally we have the outside and what the
outside<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.180> doing<00:03:52.360> let<00:03:52.480> me<00:03:52.540> turn<00:03:52.660> off<00:03:52.720> half<00:03:53.020> is

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
outside is doing let me turn off half is

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.210 
outside is doing let me turn off half is
it's<00:03:54.190> taking<00:03:54.430> our<00:03:55.230> fall<00:03:56.230> off<00:03:56.440> all<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:57.040> way<00:03:57.160> to

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
it's taking our fall off all the way to

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.530 
it's taking our fall off all the way to
the<00:03:57.459> outside<00:03:57.489> edge<00:03:57.850> so<00:03:58.150> let<00:03:58.270> me<00:03:58.330> just<00:03:58.450> go<00:03:58.510> ahead

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
the outside edge so let me just go ahead

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.520 
the outside edge so let me just go ahead
and<00:03:58.660> turn<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:58.900> down<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.170> zero<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.410> you'll

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
and turn this down to zero and you'll

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.380 
and turn this down to zero and you'll
see<00:03:59.650> what<00:03:59.770> I<00:03:59.800> mean<00:03:59.860> it's<00:04:00.220> increasing<00:04:01.060> our<00:04:01.180> fall

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
see what I mean it's increasing our fall

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.729 
see what I mean it's increasing our fall
off<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.810> outside<00:04:02.170> edge<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.410> we<00:04:02.500> don't<00:04:02.650> have

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
off to the outside edge if we don't have

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.500 
off to the outside edge if we don't have
this<00:04:02.890> on<00:04:03.100> you'll<00:04:03.820> see<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:04.090> our<00:04:04.209> fall<00:04:04.360> off

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
this on you'll see that our fall off

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.289 
this on you'll see that our fall off
stays<00:04:04.720> within<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.680> square<00:04:06.160> however<00:04:07.000> if<00:04:07.180> we

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
stays within that square however if we

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.420 
stays within that square however if we
have<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.690> outside<00:04:08.140> on<00:04:08.350> its<00:04:08.650> increasing<00:04:09.340> our

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
have the outside on its increasing our

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.830 
have the outside on its increasing our
follow<00:04:09.640> up<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.850> make<00:04:09.940> sure<00:04:10.060> that<00:04:10.209> we<00:04:10.299> have<00:04:10.480> even

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
follow up to make sure that we have even

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.090 
follow up to make sure that we have even
a<00:04:10.870> little<00:04:11.049> bit<00:04:11.170> of<00:04:11.320> fall<00:04:11.470> off<00:04:11.620> all<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.010> way

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
a little bit of fall off all the way

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.830 
a little bit of fall off all the way
into<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.430> corners<00:04:12.820> which<00:04:13.450> could<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.810> a

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
into the corners which could be a

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.360 
into the corners which could be a
desirable<00:04:14.200> quality<00:04:14.769> in<00:04:14.920> certain

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
desirable quality in certain

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.300 
desirable quality in certain
circumstances<00:04:16.049> now<00:04:17.049> these<00:04:17.500> other<00:04:17.769> sliders

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
circumstances now these other sliders

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.820 
circumstances now these other sliders
are<00:04:18.549> basically<00:04:19.090> pretty<00:04:19.390> self-explanatory

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
are basically pretty self-explanatory

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.290 
are basically pretty self-explanatory
the<00:04:20.830> wattage<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.630> increasing<00:04:22.630> from<00:04:22.780> 0<00:04:22.870> to

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
the wattage is increasing from 0 to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.750 
the wattage is increasing from 0 to
10,000<00:04:25.300> what<00:04:25.570> however<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.680> first<00:04:26.979> thousand

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
10,000 what however the first thousand

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.330 
10,000 what however the first thousand
occupy<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.479> first<00:04:28.870> half<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.320> then<00:04:29.560> we<00:04:30.130> work

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
occupy the first half and then we work

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.180 
occupy the first half and then we work
in<00:04:30.600> basically<00:04:31.600> 1000<00:04:32.410> increments<00:04:32.830> all<00:04:32.979> the<00:04:33.100> way

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
in basically 1000 increments all the way

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.310 
in basically 1000 increments all the way
down<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.430> 10,000<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.750> reason<00:04:35.050> why<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.169> because

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
down to 10,000 the reason why is because

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.840 
down to 10,000 the reason why is because
you<00:04:35.680> want<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.860> have<00:04:35.979> fine<00:04:36.190> control<00:04:36.610> here<00:04:36.820> in

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
you want to have fine control here in

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.880 
you want to have fine control here in
the<00:04:36.970> beginning<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.540> then<00:04:38.080> larger<00:04:38.500> control

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
the beginning and then larger control

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.040 
the beginning and then larger control
towards<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.669> end<00:04:39.910> when<00:04:40.120> you<00:04:40.300> want<00:04:40.479> big<00:04:40.810> big

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
towards the end when you want big big

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.020 
towards the end when you want big big
changes<00:04:41.470> now<00:04:42.070> bear<00:04:42.310> in<00:04:42.340> mind<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.790> the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
changes now bear in mind that the

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.719 
changes now bear in mind that the
wattage<00:04:43.510> that<00:04:43.930> we<00:04:44.050> set<00:04:44.290> here<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.680> going<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.610> be

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
wattage that we set here is going to be

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.940 
wattage that we set here is going to be
directly<00:04:46.090> impacted<00:04:46.810> by<00:04:46.990> what<00:04:47.020> our<00:04:47.500> exposure

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
directly impacted by what our exposure

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.590 
directly impacted by what our exposure
setting<00:04:48.460> is<00:04:48.580> for<00:04:48.790> our<00:04:48.880> Maxwell<00:04:49.240> camera

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
setting is for our Maxwell camera

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.490 
setting is for our Maxwell camera
remember<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.560> was<00:04:50.710> using<00:04:50.860> an<00:04:51.250> EV<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:52.000> 8<00:04:52.600> so

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
remember that I was using an EV of 8 so

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.219 
remember that I was using an EV of 8 so
this<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.669> going<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:54.970> work<00:04:55.180> fine<00:04:55.540> for<00:04:55.570> an<00:04:55.930> EV<00:04:56.140> of

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
this is going to work fine for an EV of

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.800 
this is going to work fine for an EV of
8<00:04:56.350> at<00:04:56.590> 500<00:04:57.070> watts<00:04:57.250> however<00:04:57.700> if<00:04:57.910> we<00:04:58.390> wanted<00:04:58.750> to

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
8 at 500 watts however if we wanted to

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.450 
8 at 500 watts however if we wanted to
have<00:04:59.140> like<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.380> daylight<00:04:59.800> scene<00:05:00.040> then<00:05:00.190> we<00:05:00.280> would

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
have like a daylight scene then we would

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.930 
have like a daylight scene then we would
need<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.729> use<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:01.150> much<00:05:01.419> much<00:05:01.690> higher<00:05:02.080> EV<00:05:02.940> now

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
need to use a much much higher EV now

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.090 
need to use a much much higher EV now
below<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.900> we<00:05:04.990> have<00:05:05.020> bulb<00:05:05.440> lengths<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:05.979> this

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
below that we have bulb lengths and this

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.010 
below that we have bulb lengths and this
was<00:05:06.220> going<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:06.400> be<00:05:06.490> much<00:05:07.120> more<00:05:07.150> apparent<00:05:07.780> here

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
was going to be much more apparent here

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.600 
was going to be much more apparent here
if<00:05:08.140> we<00:05:08.320> switch<00:05:08.530> over<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:08.860> something<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:09.550> this

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
if we switch over to something like this

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.850 
if we switch over to something like this
and<00:05:10.090> we<00:05:10.810> increase<00:05:11.140> our<00:05:11.260> fall<00:05:11.470> off<00:05:11.650> just<00:05:11.830> a

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
and we increase our fall off just a

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.740 
and we increase our fall off just a
little<00:05:11.890> bit<00:05:12.099> so<00:05:12.280> that<00:05:12.310> we<00:05:12.490> can<00:05:12.669> see<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.210> little

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
little bit so that we can see a little

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.210 
little bit so that we can see a little
bit<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:13.990> that<00:05:14.200> fall<00:05:14.440> off<00:05:14.620> I'm<00:05:14.919> going<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.160> go

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
bit of that fall off I'm going to go

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.590 
bit of that fall off I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.430> crease<00:05:15.820> our<00:05:16.090> bulb

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
ahead and crease our bulb

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.640 
ahead and crease our bulb
length<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:16.960> what<00:05:17.140> that's<00:05:17.290> going<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.470> do<00:05:17.560> is

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
length and what that's going to do is

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.100 
length and what that's going to do is
it's<00:05:17.680> going<00:05:17.890> to<00:05:17.950> pull<00:05:18.250> out<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.850> you<00:05:19.750> can<00:05:19.930> see

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
it's going to pull out and you can see

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.330 
it's going to pull out and you can see
that<00:05:20.260> we<00:05:20.350> end<00:05:20.500> up<00:05:20.590> with<00:05:20.710> something<00:05:21.070> looks

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
that we end up with something looks

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.280 
that we end up with something looks
kinda<00:05:21.610> like<00:05:21.640> a<00:05:21.760> fluorescent<00:05:22.270> tube<00:05:22.480> if<00:05:23.140> we

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
kinda like a fluorescent tube if we

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.620 
kinda like a fluorescent tube if we
reduce<00:05:23.470> our<00:05:23.740> fall<00:05:23.980> off<00:05:24.190> we<00:05:24.880> effectively<00:05:25.300> ended

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
reduce our fall off we effectively ended

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.360 
reduce our fall off we effectively ended
up<00:05:25.750> with<00:05:25.930> something<00:05:26.470> that's<00:05:26.560> not<00:05:27.100> all<00:05:27.340> that

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
up with something that's not all that

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.490 
up with something that's not all that
dissimilar<00:05:27.760> from<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.480> fluorescent<00:05:29.170> tube<00:05:29.320> now

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
dissimilar from a fluorescent tube now

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.190 
dissimilar from a fluorescent tube now
if<00:05:29.710> I<00:05:29.830> reduce<00:05:30.070> the<00:05:30.580> height

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
if I reduce the height

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.230 
if I reduce the height
like<00:05:32.830> so<00:05:33.160> then<00:05:33.820> we're<00:05:33.940> going<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.090> get

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
like so then we're going to get

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.610 
like so then we're going to get
something<00:05:34.510> that's<00:05:34.570> even<00:05:34.870> more<00:05:34.900> like<00:05:35.590> a

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
something that's even more like a

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.140 
something that's even more like a
fluorescent<00:05:36.130> tube<00:05:36.250> now<00:05:36.370> you<00:05:36.430> may<00:05:36.760> notice<00:05:36.790> that

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
fluorescent tube now you may notice that

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.530 
fluorescent tube now you may notice that
as<00:05:37.270> I'm<00:05:37.510> moving<00:05:37.660> up<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.050> canvas<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:39.540> objects

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
as I'm moving up the canvas the objects

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.820 
as I'm moving up the canvas the objects
the<00:05:40.720> primitives<00:05:41.140> are<00:05:41.200> automatically

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
the primitives are automatically

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.890 
the primitives are automatically
distorting<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:42.700> the<00:05:43.360> reason<00:05:43.600> why<00:05:43.690> is<00:05:43.720> because

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
distorting and the reason why is because

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.510 
distorting and the reason why is because
they<00:05:44.260> have<00:05:44.290> to<00:05:44.470> map<00:05:44.650> down<00:05:44.830> to<00:05:44.980> a<00:05:45.010> sphere<00:05:45.340> so

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
they have to map down to a sphere so

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.800 
they have to map down to a sphere so
this<00:05:45.670> is<00:05:45.790> automatically<00:05:46.330> doing<00:05:46.690> your

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
this is automatically doing your

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.380 
this is automatically doing your
spherical<00:05:47.350> mapping<00:05:47.800> for<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.490> now<00:05:48.730> also

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
spherical mapping for you now also

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.490 
spherical mapping for you now also
notice<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.660> we<00:05:49.840> have<00:05:50.020> that<00:05:50.230> sort<00:05:50.470> of

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
notice that we have that sort of

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.750 
notice that we have that sort of
fluorescent<00:05:50.950> shape<00:05:51.100> which<00:05:51.280> is<00:05:51.400> creating<00:05:51.700> a

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
fluorescent shape which is creating a

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.690 
fluorescent shape which is creating a
very<00:05:51.910> nice<00:05:52.060> reflection<00:05:52.720> here<00:05:53.590> on<00:05:53.770> our<00:05:54.220> object

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
very nice reflection here on our object

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.640 
very nice reflection here on our object
so<00:05:54.820> I'll<00:05:54.910> just<00:05:54.940> leave<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.540> as<00:05:56.050> is<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:56.560> I'll

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
so I'll just leave that as is and I'll

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.990 
so I'll just leave that as is and I'll
create<00:05:56.860> another<00:05:57.070> square<00:05:57.430> so<00:05:57.640> that<00:05:57.670> we<00:05:57.820> can

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
create another square so that we can

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.780 
create another square so that we can
look<00:05:58.300> at<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:58.720> rest<00:05:59.470> of<00:05:59.710> these<00:05:59.890> settings<00:06:00.610> here

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
look at the rest of these settings here

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.320 
look at the rest of these settings here
so<00:06:01.050> not<00:06:02.050> only<00:06:02.110> do<00:06:02.230> we<00:06:02.320> have<00:06:02.350> bulb<00:06:02.970> length<00:06:03.970> which

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
so not only do we have bulb length which

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.700 
so not only do we have bulb length which
is<00:06:04.360> again<00:06:04.870> going<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.170> kind<00:06:05.320> of<00:06:05.350> stretch<00:06:05.500> out

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
is again going to kind of stretch out

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.050 
is again going to kind of stretch out
our<00:06:05.830> bulb<00:06:06.010> and<00:06:06.160> give<00:06:06.370> us<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.580> different<00:06:06.880> shape

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
our bulb and give us a different shape

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.700 
our bulb and give us a different shape
you<00:06:07.720> can<00:06:07.840> see<00:06:07.930> we<00:06:08.020> have<00:06:08.050> kind<00:06:08.320> of<00:06:08.380> more<00:06:08.590> of<00:06:08.620> a

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
you can see we have kind of more of a

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.930 
you can see we have kind of more of a
laws<00:06:08.950> in<00:06:09.190> shape<00:06:09.370> here<00:06:09.490> because<00:06:09.640> I<00:06:09.670> didn't<00:06:09.820> pull

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
laws in shape here because I didn't pull

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.640 
laws in shape here because I didn't pull
it<00:06:10.030> all<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.150> way<00:06:10.210> out<00:06:10.300> but<00:06:10.930> we<00:06:11.050> also<00:06:11.200> have<00:06:11.320> bulb

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
it all the way out but we also have bulb

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.080 
it all the way out but we also have bulb
position<00:06:12.190> and<00:06:12.280> what<00:06:12.340> this<00:06:12.460> is<00:06:12.520> going<00:06:12.670> to<00:06:12.790> do<00:06:12.940> is

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
position and what this is going to do is

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.970 
position and what this is going to do is
it's<00:06:13.120> going<00:06:13.390> to<00:06:13.540> allow<00:06:13.630> us<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:14.020> move<00:06:14.170> the<00:06:14.770> light

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
it's going to allow us to move the light

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.550 
it's going to allow us to move the light
to<00:06:15.220> be<00:06:15.310> centered<00:06:15.640> at<00:06:15.760> the<00:06:15.850> top<00:06:16.090> or<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:16.810> light

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
to be centered at the top or the light

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.710 
to be centered at the top or the light
to<00:06:17.710> be<00:06:17.800> centered<00:06:18.100> at<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.430> bottom<00:06:18.790> or<00:06:18.940> any

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
to be centered at the bottom or any

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.050 
to be centered at the bottom or any
point<00:06:20.020> in<00:06:20.170> between<00:06:20.260> now<00:06:21.040> this<00:06:21.520> can<00:06:21.790> lead<00:06:22.000> to

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
point in between now this can lead to

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.870 
point in between now this can lead to
some<00:06:22.360> interesting<00:06:22.480> shapes<00:06:23.110> if<00:06:23.380> you've<00:06:24.160> messed

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
some interesting shapes if you've messed

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.490 
some interesting shapes if you've messed
with<00:06:25.150> your<00:06:25.390> bulb<00:06:25.630> length<00:06:25.900> and<00:06:26.140> your<00:06:26.290> bulb

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
with your bulb length and your bulb

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.320 
with your bulb length and your bulb
position<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.310> decrease<00:06:27.790> your<00:06:27.820> fall<00:06:28.120> off

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
position and you decrease your fall off

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.270 
position and you decrease your fall off
you<00:06:28.900> can<00:06:29.020> end<00:06:29.140> up<00:06:29.260> with<00:06:29.440> some<00:06:29.890> very<00:06:30.070> very

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
you can end up with some very very

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.010 
you can end up with some very very
interesting<00:06:30.400> shapes<00:06:31.000> that<00:06:31.120> maybe<00:06:31.420> you

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
interesting shapes that maybe you

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.350 
interesting shapes that maybe you
wouldn't<00:06:32.320> necessarily<00:06:32.410> expect<00:06:32.980> to<00:06:33.370> come<00:06:33.580> from

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
wouldn't necessarily expect to come from

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.320 
wouldn't necessarily expect to come from

you<00:06:59.650> don't<00:06:59.680> want<00:06:59.980> to<00:07:00.070> work<00:07:00.190> with<00:07:00.220> the<00:07:00.430> opacity

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640 
you don't want to work with the opacity

you don't want to work with the opacity
too<00:07:01.060> much<00:07:01.240> unless<00:07:01.480> you<00:07:01.630> have<00:07:01.720> a<00:07:01.750> particular

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230 
too much unless you have a particular

too much unless you have a particular
reason<00:07:02.410> to<00:07:02.800> do<00:07:02.950> so<00:07:03.180> the<00:07:04.180> last<00:07:04.480> thing<00:07:04.750> that<00:07:04.780> we

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
reason to do so the last thing that we

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.050 
reason to do so the last thing that we
want<00:07:04.960> to<00:07:05.170> look<00:07:05.230> at<00:07:05.410> here<00:07:05.620> is<00:07:05.830> the<00:07:06.130> color<00:07:06.400> now

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
want to look at here is the color now

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.400 
want to look at here is the color now
the<00:07:07.120> color<00:07:07.360> by<00:07:07.780> clicking<00:07:07.840> this<00:07:08.170> color<00:07:08.350> is

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
the color by clicking this color is

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.080 
the color by clicking this color is
going<00:07:08.590> to<00:07:08.650> launch<00:07:08.770> the<00:07:09.190> system<00:07:09.520> color<00:07:09.730> palette

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
going to launch the system color palette

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.210 
going to launch the system color palette
and<00:07:10.540> we<00:07:10.630> can<00:07:10.780> pick<00:07:10.870> any<00:07:11.050> color<00:07:11.200> we<00:07:11.410> want<00:07:11.590> and

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.220 
and we can pick any color we want and

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.890 
and we can pick any color we want and
maybe<00:07:12.370> I'll<00:07:12.550> just<00:07:12.670> pick<00:07:12.880> something<00:07:13.150> like<00:07:13.540> Oh

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
maybe I'll just pick something like Oh

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.520 
maybe I'll just pick something like Oh
an<00:07:14.620> orange<00:07:15.190> color<00:07:15.460> that<00:07:15.640> will<00:07:15.700> work<00:07:15.850> and<00:07:16.530> now

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
an orange color that will work and now

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.130 
an orange color that will work and now
you<00:07:17.590> can<00:07:17.890> see<00:07:17.920> that<00:07:18.220> this<00:07:18.520> synthetic<00:07:19.140> square

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.140 
you can see that this synthetic square

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.350 
you can see that this synthetic square
which<00:07:20.440> is<00:07:20.470> what<00:07:20.650> we<00:07:20.740> started<00:07:21.040> with<00:07:21.100> is<00:07:21.340> now<00:07:21.940> set

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
which is what we started with is now set

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.450 
which is what we started with is now set
to<00:07:22.390> a<00:07:22.630> 500-watt<00:07:23.380> orange<00:07:23.920> and<00:07:24.100> of<00:07:24.160> course<00:07:24.340> we

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460 
to a 500-watt orange and of course we

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.430 
to a 500-watt orange and of course we
can<00:07:24.610> see<00:07:24.760> that<00:07:24.960> directly<00:07:25.960> impact<00:07:26.440> our<00:07:27.160> Maxwell

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
can see that directly impact our Maxwell

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.850 
can see that directly impact our Maxwell
fire<00:07:29.440> render<00:07:30.310> so<00:07:30.940> that<00:07:31.300> concludes<00:07:31.870> this<00:07:32.530> half

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
fire render so that concludes this half

of our properties now we're going to

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.000 
of our properties now we're going to
look<00:07:34.870> a<00:07:34.930> little<00:07:35.020> bit<00:07:35.200> more<00:07:35.350> at<00:07:35.590> this<00:07:35.770> other

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.010 
look a little bit more at this other

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.110 
look a little bit more at this other
half<00:07:36.310> of<00:07:36.490> our<00:07:36.580> properties<00:07:37.060> in<00:07:37.240> the<00:07:37.420> next<00:07:37.690> video
