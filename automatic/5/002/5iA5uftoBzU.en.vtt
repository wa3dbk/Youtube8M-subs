00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.210
 We're back today, we're going to show. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.530
 how you cut yourself smart and find yourself 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.530
 picanha here on the ground fire 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.380
 here I have three pieces of picanha more 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.230
 or less than 1 kilo and three hundred to one 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.059
 and a half and you can see that 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.850
 we have here a picanha a good 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:42.789
 coloring good marbling and a 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.609
 very interesting external fat 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.920
 As I said in the previous video, this is it. 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.079
 Marbling is very important and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.049
 external fat will it cause 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.079
 our BBQ pizza is juicy and 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.760
 soft and now I'll show you how to cut it 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.739
 spicy 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.609
 we cut about eight 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.340
 inches thick to do 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.509
 remembering that this is the picanha to 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.640
 I spit the famous picanha de bola for you. 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.500
 do at your house with a kiss you have 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.920
 which cut about 12 centimeters 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:22.149
 and then a very sharp knife 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.909
 We'll get this movement here and there. 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:29.170
 a very sharp knife does not do here the 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.070
 our Ford actually surgery 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.820
 bright 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 Here's how the campaign went. 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.820
 Amazing 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.120
 Good now I'll show you how we 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.880
 We respect the picanha whenever you pick the 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.300
 part of the fat that is larger in the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.410
 top of the skewer is the mirror you pick 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:00.150
 in this position and will almost pierce the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:03.720
 ask and then you and with your hand bend 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.160
 her to stay round and strength in the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.500
 spit 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.530
 You certainly can not do it. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.560
 the first time because this here depends 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.400
 a lot of technique there was a lot of experience 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.590
 in my case 28 years are looking and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.940
 skewing meat preparing a barbecue 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:34.800
 so you go that way you force 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.820
 and you're sure to make a skewer 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.870
 wonderful 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.330
 It is ready here for our respect 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.690
 salt and bring to the fire and make 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.690
 our work 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.769
 close this distance from the fire for more 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.290
 or less 15 minutes at seven minutes 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.620
 the screen of the first sealed and then we 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.069
 Let's delay it, it's a fire for her. 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.069
 rip out 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.090
 here is our our picanha took and 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.670
 in the range of 12 minutes 15 minutes we already 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.349
 we can make it 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.349
 Let's see how she stayed there. 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.200
 noting that there are various ways of 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.210
 prepare for the dogs 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.760
 I sing and show the way we 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.060
 we do here on the ground fire 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.870
 the next program I'll show 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.350
 How do we prepare? 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.800
 famous rib fire from the ground up to the 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.800
 next
