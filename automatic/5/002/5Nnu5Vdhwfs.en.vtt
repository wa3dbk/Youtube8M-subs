use as a daily driver right now is the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.680 
use as a daily driver right now is the
battery<00:01:01.680> life<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.640> did<00:01:02.789> also<00:01:03.000> late<00:01:03.480> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
battery life and we did also late this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.770 
battery life and we did also late this
year<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.409> samsung<00:01:04.920> galaxy<00:01:04.949> s6<00:01:05.670> active<00:01:05.939> with

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

year see a samsung galaxy s6 active with
a<00:01:06.810> much<00:01:07.020> larger<00:01:07.200> battery<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.860> big

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
a much larger battery in that big

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
a much larger battery in that big
ruggedized<00:01:08.610> body<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.420> I'm<00:01:09.510> still<00:01:09.750> excited

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
ruggedized body but I'm still excited

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480 
ruggedized body but I'm still excited
anyway<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> note<00:01:10.740> 5

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
anyway for the note 5

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
anyway for the note 5
hopefully<00:01:12.180> it'll<00:01:12.330> again<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:13.170> rid<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
hopefully it'll again get rid of the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.190 
hopefully it'll again get rid of the
Samsung<00:01:14.250> fake<00:01:14.760> leathery<00:01:15.240> materials<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
Samsung fake leathery materials and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620 
Samsung fake leathery materials and
bring<00:01:16.740> back<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> real<00:01:17.220> metal<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:18.210> probably

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
bring back the real metal this probably

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240 
bring back the real metal this probably
also<00:01:18.750> means<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.439> built<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> galaxy

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
also means if it's built like the galaxy

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.859 
also means if it's built like the galaxy
s6<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.450> expandable

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
s6 that it will not have expandable

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.240 
s6 that it will not have expandable
storage<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> won't<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> removable

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
storage and it won't have a removable

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
storage and it won't have a removable
battery<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> battery<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:24.960> big<00:01:25.170> enough

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
battery but if the battery is big enough

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
battery but if the battery is big enough
I'm<00:01:25.619> ok<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> hundred

of Android wear smartwatches have come
out<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.359> they're<00:04:04.510> all<00:04:04.629> pretty<00:04:05.049> similar<00:04:05.620> in

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
out and they're all pretty similar in

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.379 
out and they're all pretty similar in
terms<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.220> specs<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.910> they're<00:04:07.090> all<00:04:07.209> running

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
terms of specs and they're all running

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.539 
terms of specs and they're all running
near<00:04:07.660> identical<00:04:07.810> software<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.400> thing

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
near identical software but the thing

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.460 
near identical software but the thing
that<00:04:09.669> separates<00:04:10.090> them<00:04:10.299> all<00:04:10.449> now<00:04:10.660> is<00:04:10.900> their

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
that separates them all now is their

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.259 
that separates them all now is their
design<00:04:11.859> it's<00:04:12.160> how<00:04:12.430> they<00:04:12.609> look<00:04:12.819> on<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.030> wrist

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
design it's how they look on the wrist

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.270 
design it's how they look on the wrist
some<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.019> them<00:04:14.139> are<00:04:14.379> much<00:04:14.680> closer<00:04:14.949> to<00:04:15.129> a

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
some of them are much closer to a

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.550 
some of them are much closer to a
traditional<00:04:15.849> timepiece<00:04:16.389> look<00:04:16.660> while<00:04:17.199> others

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
traditional timepiece look while others

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.620 
traditional timepiece look while others
gravitate<00:04:18.130> more<00:04:18.160> towards<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.940> super<00:04:19.329> sleek

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
gravitate more towards a super sleek

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.390 
gravitate more towards a super sleek
modern<00:04:19.989> look<00:04:20.199> now<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.650> have<00:04:20.799> things<00:04:20.979> out<00:04:21.190> like

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
modern look now we have things out like

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.730 
modern look now we have things out like
the<00:04:21.549> Apple<00:04:21.909> watch<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.300> pebble<00:04:23.080> time<00:04:23.380> and

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
the Apple watch and pebble time and

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.560 
the Apple watch and pebble time and
things<00:04:24.340> are<00:04:24.490> starting<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.789> branch<00:04:25.150> out<00:04:25.330> and

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
things are starting to branch out and

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.940 
things are starting to branch out and
design<00:04:25.810> is<00:04:25.960> starting<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.289> shake<00:04:26.440> up<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.650> little

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
design is starting to shake up a little

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.010 
design is starting to shake up a little
so<00:04:27.160> I'm<00:04:27.280> now<00:04:27.520> curious<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.120> see<00:04:28.150> what<00:04:28.540> motor<00:04:28.780> was

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
so I'm now curious to see what motor was

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.780 
so I'm now curious to see what motor was
going<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.350> do<00:04:29.500> with<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.220> second<00:04:30.520> generation

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
going to do with the second generation

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.610 
going to do with the second generation
of<00:04:31.120> their<00:04:31.270> SmartWatch<00:04:31.690> which<00:04:32.320> I'm<00:04:32.470> pretty

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
of their SmartWatch which I'm pretty

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.840 
of their SmartWatch which I'm pretty
sure<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:32.890> going<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.190> be<00:04:33.280> coming<00:04:33.550> out<00:04:33.640> in<00:04:33.760> the
