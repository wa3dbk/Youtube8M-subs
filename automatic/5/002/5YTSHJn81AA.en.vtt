 Hello and welcome 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.019
 come to a new video i have yes 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.730
 ever made a video how to use 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.920
 powerpoint little computer player 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.509
 can create and I will be there very much 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.250
 very often asked if that too with 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.599
 free programs because I have 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.880
 that at the time with microsoft office 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.509
 shown and that does not exist 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 free 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.529
 yes that's possible, for example, with 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.869
 libre office or openoffice or what 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 is there so alternative I like 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.460
 simply times the short-show today as 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 that works in principle yes and if 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.219
 you do not even know what that is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 then he looked at this play on himself 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.580
 you first the old video to me 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.830
 I'll show you how to link here 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.880
 As I said, computer games are needed 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.810
 imputed ok the only problem what 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.480
 they actually have is this 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.310
 interaction so i just have it now 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.489
 a door and in the room short 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.630
 laced together and paint especially 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.430
 beautiful but exactly and we do 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.790
 Now as follows there is such an invisible one 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.570
 button on it click here below 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.369
 rectangle because the door is rectangles and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.579
 pull over here our little one 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:21.119
 rectangle then say right click 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.289
 interaction action at the exit here 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.990
 you could jump straight to the next one 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.020
 folie thing I do now but synonymous 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.399
 for some reasons because it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.090
 not always directly the next film is 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.060
 jump to the slide object probably you two 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.889
 okay so now we have to do the whole thing 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.929
 only to make invisible here you have to 

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:47.009
 already the frame to zero centimeters 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:53.270
 Make and change the color to whoops color 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.270
 invisible on this 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.630
 right here with the frame also open 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.280
 visible and then we see nothing 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.920
 more and now we come directly 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.930
 start screen presentations say 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.080
 if I now here on the doorknob 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.290
 I land in another room that would be good 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.550
 see it for the first one then what 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.270
 hopefully again in the next video 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.270
 bye bye
