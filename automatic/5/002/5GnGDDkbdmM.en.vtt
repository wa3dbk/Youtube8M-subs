play<00:00:04.319> time<00:00:04.560> which<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.279> think<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.609> really

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
play time which I think is really

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.080 
play time which I think is really
important<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.480> students<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.639> this<00:00:08.639> does<00:00:08.940> not

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
important for students and this does not

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.180 
important for students and this does not
have<00:00:09.300> direct<00:00:09.480> application<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.500> bead<00:00:10.889> making

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
have direct application to bead making

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.209 
have direct application to bead making
but<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.240> general<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:13.080> fundamental<00:00:14.070> aspect

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
but it's in general a fundamental aspect

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.919 
but it's in general a fundamental aspect
of<00:00:14.639> being<00:00:14.820> making<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.420> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.719> take<00:00:15.900> a

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
of being making we're going to take a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.019 
of being making we're going to take a
cane<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.529> beautiful<00:00:17.010> glass<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.789> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
cane of beautiful glass this is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.660 
cane of beautiful glass this is
transparent<00:00:18.690> cobalt<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:20.010> I'm<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> heat

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
transparent cobalt and I'm going to heat

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.599 
transparent cobalt and I'm going to heat
it<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.000> middle<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:23.310> torch<00:00:25.609> gradually

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
it in the middle on the torch gradually

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.939 
it in the middle on the torch gradually
further<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.689> I'm<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.680> play

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
with it like a taffy ball we're going to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.360 
with it like a taffy ball we're going to
compress<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.239> glass<00:00:33.480> together<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.219> see

one<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> your<00:01:07.680> fingers<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.520> nice<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.790> easy

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
one of your fingers so go nice and easy

one of your fingers so go nice and easy
don't<00:01:09.630> force<00:01:09.930> things<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.710> starting

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
don't force things and if it's starting

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.539 
don't force things and if it's starting
to<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.760> control<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.570> soupy<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:17.430> know

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
to get out of control and soupy you know

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.219 
to get out of control and soupy you know
pull<00:01:17.850> away<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.420> heat<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.990> let<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
pull away from the heat and let the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.070 
pull away from the heat and let the
glass<00:01:19.560> sort<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.040> settle<00:01:20.430> down<00:01:20.720> let<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.750> heat

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
glass sort of settle down let the heat

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.310 
glass sort of settle down let the heat
soak<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:23.150> is<00:01:24.150> usually<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> time<00:01:24.960> lag<00:01:25.290> between

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
soak in is usually a time lag between

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.219 
soak in is usually a time lag between
when<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.369> heat<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> glass

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
when you put heat in and when the glass

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.390 
when you put heat in and when the glass
moves<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.610> play<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.270> time<00:01:30.869> lag<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:32.250> can

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
moves so play with that time lag you can

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
moves so play with that time lag you can
see<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.729> beautiful<00:01:32.909> shape<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> we're

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
see that beautiful shape that we're

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.710 
see that beautiful shape that we're
having<00:01:34.140> now<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.530> reheat<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:39.479> takes

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
having now you can reheat it it takes

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.499 
having now you can reheat it it takes
more<00:01:40.079> heat<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.470> time<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.460> heat<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> fat<00:01:42.030> part<00:01:42.360> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
more heat and time to heat a fat part of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080 
more heat and time to heat a fat part of
glass<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> thin<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> heat<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
glass and a thin one so if you heat the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
glass and a thin one so if you heat the
handle<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.930> part<00:01:46.200> where<00:01:46.350> you're<00:01:46.500> connecting

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
handle the part where you're connecting

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
handle the part where you're connecting
on<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> glob<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> pull

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
on to the glob with that's going to pull

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
on to the glob with that's going to pull
apart<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.710> quickly<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.640> oops

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
apart really quickly like that oops

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.219 
apart really quickly like that oops
so<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.320> reconnect<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.520> always<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:54.060> back

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
so go reconnect you can always go back

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.179 
so go reconnect you can always go back
glass<00:01:55.229> has<00:01:55.500> no<00:01:55.740> memory<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.710> reconnect

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
glass has no memory you can reconnect

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160 
glass has no memory you can reconnect
and<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.030> accordion<00:02:00.479> thing<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:00.869> many

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and do that accordion thing as many

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.929 
and do that accordion thing as many
times<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> very
