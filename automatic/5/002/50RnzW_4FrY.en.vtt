the paper like that we got our drain cut
out<00:00:45.850> there<00:00:46.059> so<00:00:46.330> we<00:00:46.449> can<00:00:46.600> lower<00:00:46.720> that<00:00:46.839> fat<00:00:47.260> and

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
perimeter of the bill then we've got

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.810 
perimeter of the bill then we've got
ducks<00:01:05.140> play<00:01:05.920> until<00:01:06.160> they<00:01:06.340> narrows<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.729> can

might be able to see that that's already

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.719 
might be able to see that that's already
in<00:01:16.570> down<00:01:16.780> there<00:01:16.990> but<00:01:17.770> get<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.369> this<00:01:18.490> side

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
in down there but get to this side

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.499 
in down there but get to this side
building<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.300> work<00:01:19.479> our<00:01:19.630> way<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:19.869> other<00:01:20.020> way

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
yeah we just finished up with the ISO

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.380 
yeah we just finished up with the ISO
board<00:01:27.220> as<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:27.490> see<00:01:27.700> it's<00:01:27.820> all<00:01:27.970> done<00:01:28.210> around

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
board as you see it's all done around

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.150 
board as you see it's all done around
there<00:01:28.660> it's<00:01:29.229> all<00:01:29.380> tapered<00:01:29.770> down<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.039> the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
there it's all tapered down to the

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.449 
there it's all tapered down to the
center<00:01:30.630> over<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.960> far<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.679> can<00:01:32.920> board<00:01:33.220> over

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459 
center over that far you can board over

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.800 
center over that far you can board over
there<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:33.700> see<00:01:33.819> how<00:01:33.880> it's<00:01:34.030> lower<00:01:34.479> there<00:01:34.720> in

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
there and see how it's lower there in

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.300 
there and see how it's lower there in
the<00:01:34.869> center<00:01:35.140> things<00:01:35.319> on<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.590> higher<00:01:35.770> edges

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
the center things on the higher edges

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.980 
the center things on the higher edges
now<00:01:36.819> we're<00:01:36.940> going<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.119> install<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.509> cricket

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
now we're going to install a cricket

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.550 
now we're going to install a cricket
divert<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.099> water<00:01:39.340> towards<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.759> drain<00:01:40.060> here

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

divert that water towards the drain here
and<00:01:41.560> install<00:01:42.250> next<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.759> then<00:01:42.849> it's<00:01:42.970> time<00:01:43.179> to

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
and install next and then it's time to

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.300 
and install next and then it's time to
put<00:01:43.330> some<00:01:43.450> conklin<00:01:43.899> on<00:01:44.050> alright<00:01:45.009> as<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.220> can

put some conklin on alright as you can
see<00:01:45.550> we<00:01:45.670> got<00:01:45.789> one<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.179> crickets<00:01:46.569> in<00:01:46.750> right

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
see we got one of the crickets in right

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.290 
see we got one of the crickets in right
here<00:01:47.170> this<00:01:48.099> is<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.310> cricket<00:01:48.640> system<00:01:48.970> produced

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
here this is a cricket system produced
