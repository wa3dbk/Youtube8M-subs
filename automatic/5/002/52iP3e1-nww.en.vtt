I'm<00:00:15.920> often<00:00:16.099> asked<00:00:16.400> by<00:00:16.580> by<00:00:16.970> new<00:00:17.150> triathletes

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
I'm often asked by by new triathletes

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.600 
I'm often asked by by new triathletes
for<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.259> swimming<00:00:18.560> should<00:00:18.950> we<00:00:19.099> just<00:00:19.310> get<00:00:19.460> in

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
for the swimming should we just get in

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.490 
for the swimming should we just get in
and<00:00:19.759> swim<00:00:20.000> for<00:00:20.029> 15<00:00:20.509> minutes<00:00:20.810> or<00:00:20.930> 20<00:00:21.169> minutes<00:00:21.200> or

and swim for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or
30<00:00:21.529> minutes<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.520> I<00:00:22.699> would<00:00:22.849> say<00:00:23.029> emphatically

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
30 minutes and I would say emphatically

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.779 
30 minutes and I would say emphatically
no<00:00:23.810> you<00:00:24.439> know<00:00:24.529> let's<00:00:24.739> break<00:00:25.009> it<00:00:25.189> down<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.579> same

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
no you know let's break it down the same

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.030 
no you know let's break it down the same
as<00:00:25.910> we<00:00:26.029> do<00:00:26.150> on<00:00:26.270> running<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:26.720> on<00:00:26.840> cycling<00:00:27.380> let's

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
as we do on running and on cycling let's

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.409 
as we do on running and on cycling let's
break<00:00:28.250> it<00:00:28.399> down<00:00:28.430> to<00:00:28.730> interval<00:00:29.059> training

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
break it down to interval training

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.440 
break it down to interval training
repetition<00:00:29.960> training<00:00:30.610> use<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:31.849> drills<00:00:32.119> so

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
repetition training use the drills so

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.020 
repetition training use the drills so
essential<00:00:33.079> you<00:00:33.440> know<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.710> technique<00:00:34.100> is<00:00:34.399> so

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
essential you know the technique is so

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.580 
essential you know the technique is so
so<00:00:35.300> important<00:00:35.719> in<00:00:35.780> swimming<00:00:36.079> probably<00:00:36.410> more

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
so important in swimming probably more

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.340 
so important in swimming probably more
so<00:00:36.829> than<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.100> other<00:00:37.280> two<00:00:37.309> disciplines<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.629> get

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
so than the other two disciplines so get

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.560 
so than the other two disciplines so get
your<00:00:39.469> stroke<00:00:39.680> analyzed<00:00:40.239> find<00:00:41.239> out<00:00:41.420> what

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
your stroke analyzed find out what

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.989 
your stroke analyzed find out what
you're<00:00:41.690> doing<00:00:41.899> wrong<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:42.140> then<00:00:42.999> rebuild

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.860 
the next hundred concentrates from there
let's<00:00:55.010> go<00:00:55.129> back<00:00:55.339> to<00:00:55.460> full<00:00:55.640> stroke<00:00:55.940> coach<00:00:56.659> this

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
let's go back to full stroke coach this

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.239 
let's go back to full stroke coach this
I'm<00:00:56.989> doing<00:00:57.170> okay<00:00:57.469> let's<00:00:57.739> try<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:57.949> again

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
I'm doing okay let's try it again

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.160 
I'm doing okay let's try it again
let's<00:00:58.489> try<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.699> again<00:00:59.149> bit<00:00:59.510> by<00:00:59.690> bit<00:00:59.719> and<00:01:00.109> we

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
let's try it again bit by bit and we

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.950 
let's try it again bit by bit and we
gradually<00:01:00.379> get<00:01:00.679> there<00:01:00.890> we<00:01:01.760> always<00:01:02.059> say<00:01:02.300> that

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
gradually get there we always say that

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.680 
gradually get there we always say that
you<00:01:03.409> don't<00:01:03.739> move<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.519> chin<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.120> shoulders

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
you don't move the chin to the shoulders

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.180 
you don't move the chin to the shoulders
you<00:01:06.020> always<00:01:06.260> move<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.590> shoulders<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.100> the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
you always move the shoulders to the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.170 
you always move the shoulders to the
chin<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:07.880> working<00:01:08.090> through<00:01:08.270> there<00:01:08.960> there

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
chin so working through there there

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.110 
chin so working through there there
there<00:01:11.180> there<00:01:12.040> it's<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.190> nice<00:01:13.400> little<00:01:13.760> warm-up

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120

karma my favorite drill for swimming we
call<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.670> three<00:01:28.850> plus<00:01:29.060> six<00:01:29.300> I'm<00:01:29.660> not<00:01:29.780> sure<00:01:29.960> what

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
call it three plus six I'm not sure what

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.410 
call it three plus six I'm not sure what
the<00:01:30.170> technical<00:01:30.560> name<00:01:30.710> is<00:01:30.910> but<00:01:31.910> it's<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.180> drill

the technical name is but it's the drill
where<00:01:32.690> we<00:01:32.780> do<00:01:32.930> three<00:01:33.290> arm<00:01:33.470> strokes<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.300> then

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
where we do three arm strokes and then

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.940 
where we do three arm strokes and then
stop<00:01:35.840> at<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.050> end<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.320> third<00:01:36.470> arm<00:01:36.650> stroke

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.470 
in front so we're on our side six leg
beads<00:01:41.870> and<00:01:42.200> then<00:01:42.920> repeat<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.340> cycle<00:01:43.550> so<00:01:44.300> what

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
beads and then repeat the cycle so what

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.760 
beads and then repeat the cycle so what
we're<00:01:44.660> doing<00:01:44.690> with<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.260> where<00:01:45.560> we're

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
we're doing with that where we're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.110 
we're doing with that where we're
getting<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.100> good<00:01:46.250> rotation<00:01:46.400> we're<00:01:46.940> getting

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
getting the good rotation we're getting

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.050 
getting the good rotation we're getting
rotation<00:01:47.630> both<00:01:47.840> sides<00:01:48.880> we're<00:01:49.880> emphasizing
