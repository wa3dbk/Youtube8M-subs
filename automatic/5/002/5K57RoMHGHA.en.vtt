00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.130 
skateboarders on common ground
I<00:00:42.210> think<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.309> Southbank<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.360> torn<00:00:46.079> down

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I think if the Southbank was torn down

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.310 
I think if the Southbank was torn down
or<00:00:46.649> made<00:00:46.980> until<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.760> shopping<00:00:48.450> area<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
or made until like a shopping area I'm I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.020 
or made until like a shopping area I'm I
think<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.800> shopping<00:00:50.160> area<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> fine<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
think a shopping area is fine but I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
think a shopping area is fine but I
think<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.750> nice<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.320> they

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
think that it would be nice if they

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.670 
think that it would be nice if they
could<00:00:52.800> kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.520> make<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.360> work<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:55.530> know

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
could kind of make it work you know

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.069 
could kind of make it work you know
where<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> two<00:00:56.430> could<00:00:56.670> meet<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.270> where

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
where the two could meet you know where

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.799 
where the two could meet you know where
it's<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.379> totally<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.699> tourists<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.660> where

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it's not totally for tourists and where

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.009 
it's not totally for tourists and where

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it's not totally for skateboarders it's

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.380 
it's not totally for skateboarders it's

and she spoke with the homeless people I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.190 
and she spoke with the homeless people I
