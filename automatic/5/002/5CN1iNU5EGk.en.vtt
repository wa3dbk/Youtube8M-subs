we have a computerized can bus system
which<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.750> integrated<00:00:55.320> into<00:00:55.470> them<00:00:55.650> so

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
which is integrated into them so

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
which is integrated into them so
basically<00:00:56.460> anything<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.330> goes<00:00:57.510> wrong<00:00:57.720> with

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
basically anything that goes wrong with

these trucks the computer system and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
these trucks the computer system and
then<00:00:59.879> will<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.239> me<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.540> email<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.019> also<00:01:01.290> see

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
then will see me an email and also see

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.130 
then will see me an email and also see
my<00:01:01.589> manager<00:01:01.949> an<00:01:02.100> email<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.510> we'll<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.930> able<00:01:04.050> to

work out directly off their what is
wrong<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.030> trucks<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.380> design<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
wrong with the trucks so the design of

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.710 
wrong with the trucks so the design of
these<00:01:07.920> trucks<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.399> is<00:01:08.700> pretty<00:01:09.090> outrageous<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
these trucks is is pretty outrageous to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.490 
these trucks is is pretty outrageous to
say<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> least

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
say the least

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.840

I<00:01:10.530> don't<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:10.979> you'll<00:01:11.220> find<00:01:11.399> any<00:01:11.670> other

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I don't think you'll find any other

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.310 
I don't think you'll find any other

sort of art with design like this when

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.930 
sort of art with design like this when
we<00:01:15.930> visited<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> factory<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.950> September<00:01:17.880> of

we visited the factory in September of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.870 
we visited the factory in September of
last<00:01:18.000> year<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.770> rows<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.220> agents<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
last year the rows of our agents and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.160 
last year the rows of our agents and
people<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.390> floor<00:01:21.630> had<00:01:21.750> never<00:01:21.960> seen

people on the floor had never seen

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.760 
people on the floor had never seen
anything<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.410> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
anything like it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.130 
anything like it
and<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.039> fact<00:01:23.300> applying<00:01:24.300> this<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and in fact applying this at which the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.100 
and in fact applying this at which the
truck<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> biggest<00:01:26.070> challenges

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
truck was one of the biggest challenges

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.359 
truck was one of the biggest challenges
so<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.470> Wellington's<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.039> very

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
so as you know Wellington's a very

so as you know Wellington's a very
growing<00:01:29.640> community<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.360> certainly<00:01:30.840> one

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
growing community and certainly one

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.080 
growing community and certainly one
aspect<00:01:31.440> of<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.190> project<00:01:32.550> was<00:01:32.670> ensuring<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
aspect of this project was ensuring that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
aspect of this project was ensuring that
we<00:01:33.330> could<00:01:33.720> cater<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.410> growth<00:01:34.560> moving

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
we could cater for that growth moving

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.890 
we could cater for that growth moving
toward<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.940> only<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> these<00:01:36.300> trucks<00:01:36.630> meets

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
toward not only to these trucks meets
