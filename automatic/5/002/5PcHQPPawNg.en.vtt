00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:09.200
 Two not 2013 mountain bikes of the 2013 model 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.200
 It is introduction of a lot 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.420
 j 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:23.800
 Unlike previous 26-inch wheels, it is 29 inches 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:26.180
 Very comfortable since it is possible to us an obstacle easy to ride and de 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:33.320
 You can run off road 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:34.430
 The amount of proceeds in Hitokogi be left wooden leg ever by the wheel diameter is large 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.590
 It is increasing so much 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.590
 I think it would be a very good ride even in town 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 It is a driving system 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:01:00.660
 I front three rear will be the fact that the grade variable transmission to write's ten picture 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.660
 Everything is assembled with parts of Shimano except the chain 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.950
 Shifter also Shimano 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:19.030
 Disk comes with a hydraulic disc hydraulic Hayes 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.030
 It's comes to hereabouts Hen of the class almost hydraulic disc will come to the basic 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.750
 Since the frame uses white at one point for hard work, the disc brake also adopts white 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.750
 is 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.420
 It's you say 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.910
 The children 's logo of the tire is completely renewed 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.320
 Background this is matte black 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.320
 I will 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:10.860
 There are plenty of suspension , but also here because it has a 100mm label, driving off road 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:16.160
 I think it is possible enough 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.160
 Suspension lockout is also possible at this point 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.700
 The brother of the steering wheel is also oversized from 2 to 7 from this year, so all of the power 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:43.860
 Some people 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.860
 I think that there is no tarver loss and the power from the steering wheel can be converted to propulsion 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.590
 Here during the period of 2013 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:06.180
 Chiba is possible for you to use as a test-drive cars in the cycle 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:11.290
 Another 4700 discs from a 26-inch mountain bike 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:17.019
 Then from dart pros system 8.5 ds 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:20.620
 Prepare a cross bike as a test ride Which is suitable for off-road travel compared to three rides 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.090
 I think you can understand what you are doing 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.990
 Last is the weight 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:32.970
 Ten thousand field of 2013 model year 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:35.900
 The frame size was 15.5 inches and the weight was 14.0 kg . 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.900
