perfect foundation for myself just I've
been<00:00:11.429> looking<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:11.940> something<00:00:12.300> that's<00:00:12.480> quite

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.420 
water base and just gives you some sort
of<00:00:24.630> glow<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.380> i've<00:00:25.470> been<00:00:25.500> trialing<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.279> so

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
of glow so i've been trialing now so

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.310 
of glow so i've been trialing now so
it's<00:00:26.550> about<00:00:27.230> January<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.590> I've<00:00:29.130> tried<00:00:29.490> Mac

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
it's about January and I've tried Mac

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.220 
it's about January and I've tried Mac
some<00:00:31.320> Nora<00:00:31.590> Mercier<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:32.910> blank<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.989> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
some Nora Mercier and some blank on I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.799 
some Nora Mercier and some blank on I
find<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.280> tiling<00:00:35.730> foundations<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.570> really

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
find that tiling foundations are really

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.959 
find that tiling foundations are really
good<00:00:36.960> idea<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.469> sometimes<00:00:37.969> foundation

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
good idea because sometimes foundation

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.810 
good idea because sometimes foundation
about<00:00:39.210> 30<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:40.079> 220<00:00:40.590> 230<00:00:40.860> pounds<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:41.730> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
about 30 like 220 230 pounds and if you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.930 
about 30 like 220 230 pounds and if you
buy<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> wrong<00:00:42.390> shade<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.079> quite<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:44.040> big

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
buy the wrong shade it's quite a big

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.220 
buy the wrong shade it's quite a big
chunk<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.300> orbit<00:00:45.600> over<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.020> waste

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
chunk that orbit over just a waste

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.860 
chunk that orbit over just a waste
generally<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.520> I'm<00:00:47.700> I've<00:00:48.149> got<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> tip<00:00:48.840> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
generally so I'm I've got a tip that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.619 
generally so I'm I've got a tip that
when<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.850> looking<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:51.149> different

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
when I was out looking at different

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.700 
when I was out looking at different
foundations<00:00:51.809> people<00:00:52.170> were<00:00:52.260> saying<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.530> we

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
foundations people were saying also we

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.100 
foundations people were saying also we
don't<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.980> any<00:00:53.360> samples<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.809> can't<00:00:54.989> give

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
don't have any samples you can't give

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.990 
don't have any samples you can't give
any<00:00:55.260> samples<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.820> great

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
any samples or not and I think the great

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.520 
any samples or not and I think the great
idea<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.079> buy<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.410> own

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
idea for that is to just buy your own

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.260 
idea for that is to just buy your own
open<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.730> bought<00:01:00.090> these<00:01:00.210> in

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
open with you like I bought these in

open with you like I bought these in

trial<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> moment<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.329> found

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
trial in it but for the moment I found

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
trial in it but for the moment I found
at<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> moment<00:01:58.170> my<00:01:58.229> skills<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.619> Pat<00:01:58.829> geez<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
at the moment my skills like Pat geez I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
at the moment my skills like Pat geez I
think<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.610> will<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.820> great<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.090> summer<00:02:00.479> but

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
think this will be great for summer but

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.530 
think this will be great for summer but
not<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.799> much<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.040> these<00:02:02.310> months<00:02:03.000> leading<00:02:03.360> up

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
not so much for these months leading up

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.969 
not so much for these months leading up
to<00:02:03.750> spring<00:02:03.990> summer<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.469> think<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.799> what

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
to spring summer so I think this is what

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.230 
to spring summer so I think this is what
I'm<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.219> purchase<00:02:05.610> closer<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.060> summer

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
I'm going to purchase closer to summer

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.610 
I'm going to purchase closer to summer

super<00:02:18.710> heavy<00:02:19.160> coverage<00:02:19.580> for<00:02:19.820> me<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.940> was<00:02:20.030> sort

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
super heavy coverage for me I was sort

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.370 
super heavy coverage for me I was sort
of<00:02:20.300> looking<00:02:20.420> something<00:02:20.810> like<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.170> just<00:02:21.320> thought

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380

showing here but if you're raw drawn to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.970 
showing here but if you're raw drawn to
heavier<00:02:29.450> coverage<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:30.350> would<00:02:30.830> definitely

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
heavier coverage I would definitely

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.500 
heavier coverage I would definitely
recommend<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:31.550> for<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.120> some<00:02:32.270> more

than that it matches in with your skin
which<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.640> sort<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.940> quite<00:02:35.780> clever<00:02:36.050> it's<00:02:36.230> just

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
which is sort of quite clever it's just

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.170 
which is sort of quite clever it's just
down<00:02:36.560> here<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.920> can<00:02:37.040> see<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.310> blended<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.940> so

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
down here you can see it's blended in so

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.900 
down here you can see it's blended in so
it<00:02:38.930> smells<00:02:39.740> quite<00:02:40.070> nice<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.790> bit

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
it smells quite nice it's a bit

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.550 
it smells quite nice it's a bit
different<00:02:41.090> smell<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.930> sort<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.140> mac<00:02:42.290> fun

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
different smell to this sort of mac fun

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.280 
different smell to this sort of mac fun
and<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.880> sort<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.480> more<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.750> matte<00:02:44.930> color

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
and it's sort of more of a matte color

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.220 
and it's sort of more of a matte color
so<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.100> like<00:02:46.310> heavier<00:02:46.940> more<00:02:47.690> map<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.110> make

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
so if you like heavier more map to make

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.260 
so if you like heavier more map to make
