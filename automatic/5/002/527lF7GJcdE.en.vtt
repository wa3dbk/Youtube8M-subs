cruciferous vegetables are low in

cruciferous vegetables are low in

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220

and I cannot digest and so one of the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.920 
and I cannot digest and so one of the
questions<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.880> break<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.329> well<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.750> about

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
questions the break was well how about

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.569 
questions the break was well how about
cut<00:01:34.110> vegetables<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.340> are<00:01:35.400> people

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
cut vegetables you know there are people

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.870 
cut vegetables you know there are people
out<00:01:35.759> there<00:01:35.930> Ruffus<00:01:36.930> who<00:01:37.290> mean<00:01:37.560> well<00:01:37.610> they<00:01:38.610> want

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
out there Ruffus who mean well they want

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
out there Ruffus who mean well they want
to<00:01:38.909> support<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.450> diet<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:39.930> love<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.439> they

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to support this diet they love and they

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.280 
to support this diet they love and they
but<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.310> tell<00:01:41.549> people<00:01:41.729> all<00:01:42.299> raw<00:01:42.689> vegetables

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
but they tell people all raw vegetables

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.350 
but they tell people all raw vegetables
are<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.470> as<00:01:43.890> easy<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.430> digest<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:45.149> cook

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
are just as easy to digest as cook

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.130 
are just as easy to digest as cook
vegetables<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.950> completely<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:48.329> true

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
vegetables this is completely not true

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.100 
vegetables this is completely not true
ok<00:01:49.560> what's<00:01:50.130> true<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.700> cooking<00:01:51.390> breaks

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
ok what's true is that cooking breaks

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
ok what's true is that cooking breaks
down<00:01:52.380> cellulose<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> takes<00:01:53.549> things<00:01:53.729> that

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
down cellulose so it takes things that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.069 
down cellulose so it takes things that
are<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.270> digestible<00:01:55.399> like<00:01:56.399> woody<00:01:57.079> root

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
are not digestible like woody root

digestive<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.759> can<00:02:09.940> cook<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.300> make

digestive now you can cook it and make
it<00:02:10.479> digestible<00:02:11.170> but<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.440> also<00:02:11.560> make<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.860> toxic

it digestible but you also make it toxic

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.390 
it digestible but you also make it toxic
because<00:02:12.970> cooking<00:02:13.410> creates<00:02:14.410> toxicity<00:02:15.280> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
because cooking creates toxicity it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.530 
because cooking creates toxicity it
actually<00:02:15.760> creates<00:02:16.530> toxic<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.710> carcinogenic

1112<00:02:22.090> years<00:02:22.120> ago<00:02:22.510> was<00:02:23.020> called<00:02:23.290> acrylamide<00:02:23.620> and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
1112 years ago was called acrylamide and

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.180 
1112 years ago was called acrylamide and
it<00:02:24.670> shows<00:02:24.910> up<00:02:25.150> anyplace<00:02:25.660> there<00:02:26.020> are<00:02:26.230> complex

complex carbohydrates you cook them you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.270

are creating toxic and in this case a

are creating toxic and in this case a
carcinogenic<00:02:37.150> compound<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.910> cooking<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.060> not

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090

an option if what you want is the

everything's<00:02:44.709> relative<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.910> if<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.780> take

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
if we took that guy up we went from that

large green organic fresh salad he'd be

healthier<00:03:00.790> as<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.940> result<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.020> not

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
healthier as a result but it's not

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.320 
healthier as a result but it's not
because<00:03:02.440> that's<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.770> healthy<00:03:03.100> diet<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:04.060> just

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
because that's a healthy diet it's just

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330 
because that's a healthy diet it's just
a<00:03:04.420> better<00:03:04.690> diet<00:03:05.020> than<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.739> crap<00:03:06.010> he<00:03:06.220> was

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
a better diet than the crap he was

a better diet than the crap he was
eating<00:03:06.550> before<00:03:06.670> okay<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.690> it's<00:03:07.989> important<00:03:08.530> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
eating before okay and it's important to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.860 
eating before okay and it's important to
understand<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.220> because<00:03:09.280> many<00:03:10.270> people<00:03:10.690> out

they think this is it I have found the

Holy Grail

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.560 
Holy Grail
this<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.950> best<00:03:33.100> there<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.730> they<00:03:34.330> think

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
this is the best there is and they think

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.150 
this is the best there is and they think
that<00:03:34.720> because<00:03:34.930> all<00:03:35.350> of<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> sudden<00:03:35.860> there's

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
that because all of a sudden there's

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.949 
that because all of a sudden there's
this<00:03:36.340> huge<00:03:36.700> change<00:03:37.060> they<00:03:37.269> can't<00:03:37.480> imagine

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
this huge change they can't imagine

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.060 
this huge change they can't imagine
could<00:03:38.170> be<00:03:38.260> better<00:03:38.410> than<00:03:38.709> that

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
could be better than that

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.190 
could be better than that
but<00:03:39.519> what's<00:03:39.730> true<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.180> anytime<00:03:40.540> we

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
but what's true is that anytime we

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.979 
but what's true is that anytime we
improve<00:03:41.739> anything<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:42.580> improve<00:03:42.790> our<00:03:42.940> diet<00:03:43.209> we

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
improve anything we improve our diet we

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.810 
improve anything we improve our diet we

that's why okay what you want to do in

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
going to go into why that is here that's

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.100 
going to go into why that is here that's
another<00:06:32.700> discussion<00:06:32.910> but<00:06:33.870> trust<00:06:34.470> me<00:06:34.590> on<00:06:34.680> that

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
another discussion but trust me on that

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.340 
another discussion but trust me on that
