00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 water determines disease water determines 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.300
 health adequate appropriate water 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.719
 Restore health is impressive 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.150
 because it is water have the purity the ph is 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.090
 important the obstruction power is 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.800
 Important conductivity is important. 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.140
 and surface tension 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.260
 Today I get tourism with water and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.550
 organized a deionized water 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.570
 moisturizes she locates her antioxidant and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 it detoxifies, ie water can be 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.140
 used as water it can be 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 antioxidant there is antioxidant water 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.239
 it has to be chemically reduced 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.789
 talking because the opposite of oxidized is 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.710
 reduced, there is a way to 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.640
 make a little water to can 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.440
 antioxidant 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.520
 this is another property the first 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.879
 something we do not have to do with water 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.940
 today is the bottle of water 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.649
 that plastic bottle that 90% of the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.840
 water that we see and is sold in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.369
 plastic bottle that bottle 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490
 subjected to heat 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.150
 it produces a female hormone called 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.560
 xenon estrogen and this stretch is strone 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.119
 that the utah is highly proliferative 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.840
 including prostate cancer is due to 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.869
 he 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.830
 breast cancer some organs have a lot 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.880
 sensitivity 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 already the water closer to 7.27 squid a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 slightly alkaline worker begins to 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.970
 improve near the physiological water 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.040
 more alkaline it will facilitate others 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.320
 other reactions in the body also 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.689
 facilitating the recovery of people 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.330
 we study benefits in water 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.520
 hot 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.350
 from the pregnant woman to the best age 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.570
 then the benefits for children 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.119
 benefits for the environment because 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.369
 You do not use the bottle anymore, let's go. 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.259
 benefits for the elderly, it acts 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.240
 various forms and have to pass 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.630
 personal benefit 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.080
 Magnesium is such a large mineral. 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.920
 importance that in germany in germany 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.979
 university of bonn in germany we 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.020
 we have a doctorate in magnesium ratio 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.910
 doctorate in magnesium for 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.550
 understand the importance he has is 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.430
 Impressive amount is 450 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.160
 documented functions of our friend obama 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.440
 to say that life is not possible without 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.290
 adequate amount of magnesium is 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.069
 present in the brain the same 10 in the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.790
 hair the heart of muscle mass where 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.450
 week are already documented 450 functions 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.450
 scientific
