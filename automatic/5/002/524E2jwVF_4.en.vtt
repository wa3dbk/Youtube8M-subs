okay<00:00:05.060> the<00:00:05.569> strobe<00:00:06.410> light<00:00:06.910> installation<00:00:07.910> on

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
okay the strobe light installation on

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.919 
okay the strobe light installation on
the<00:00:11.290> paramotor

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
the paramotor

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.060 
the paramotor
figured<00:00:14.929> I<00:00:15.019> would<00:00:15.200> need<00:00:15.320> to<00:00:15.469> switch<00:00:15.740> pretty

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
figured I would need to switch pretty

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.940 
figured I would need to switch pretty
quick<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:17.240> all<00:00:17.450> I<00:00:17.570> did<00:00:17.840> was<00:00:18.020> mold<00:00:18.380> some<00:00:18.650> foam

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
quick and all I did was mold some foam

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.609 
quick and all I did was mold some foam
and<00:00:19.369> then<00:00:19.789> use<00:00:20.090> tie<00:00:20.390> wraps<00:00:20.750> with<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:21.230> little

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
and then use tie wraps with a little

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.609 
and then use tie wraps with a little
rocker<00:00:21.949> arm<00:00:22.279> switch<00:00:22.759> right<00:00:23.060> here<00:00:23.330> that<00:00:24.289> I<00:00:24.320> can

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
rocker arm switch right here that I can

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.419 
rocker arm switch right here that I can
reach<00:00:24.859> when<00:00:25.250> I'm<00:00:25.490> flying<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.390> in<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.630> air

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
reach when I'm flying and in the air

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.810 
reach when I'm flying and in the air
the<00:00:28.939> other<00:00:29.119> thing<00:00:29.419> is<00:00:29.679> these<00:00:30.679> strobe<00:00:31.550> lights

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the other thing is these strobe lights

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.000 
the other thing is these strobe lights
are<00:00:32.000> about<00:00:32.090> 100<00:00:32.480> bucks<00:00:32.630> apiece<00:00:32.840> they're<00:00:33.500> very

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
are about 100 bucks apiece they're very

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.740 
are about 100 bucks apiece they're very
very<00:00:34.220> good<00:00:34.550> their<00:00:34.760> aircraft<00:00:35.150> strobe<00:00:35.480> lights

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
very good their aircraft strobe lights

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.590 
very good their aircraft strobe lights
and<00:00:35.989> they're<00:00:36.559> very<00:00:36.710> light<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:39.129> vibration<00:00:40.600> can

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
and they're very light and vibration can

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.619 
and they're very light and vibration can
damage<00:00:42.050> them<00:00:42.289> the<00:00:42.500> circuitry<00:00:42.980> inside<00:00:43.539> as<00:00:44.539> a

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
damage them the circuitry inside as a

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.619 
damage them the circuitry inside as a
matter<00:00:44.809> of<00:00:44.870> fact<00:00:45.079> I<00:00:45.289> had<00:00:45.590> damaged<00:00:46.070> one<00:00:46.629> because

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
matter of fact I had damaged one because

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.010 
matter of fact I had damaged one because
I<00:00:47.780> did<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.109> rigid<00:00:48.680> mount<00:00:49.309> on<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:50.300> motor<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:50.840> the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
I did a rigid mount on the motor and the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.670 
I did a rigid mount on the motor and the
motor<00:00:51.070> vibrates<00:00:52.070> quite<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.399> bit<00:00:52.719> so<00:00:53.719> I<00:00:53.750> elected

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
motor vibrates quite a bit so I elected

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.009 
motor vibrates quite a bit so I elected
to<00:00:54.739> use<00:00:55.629> some<00:00:56.629> fuel<00:00:57.469> line<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.660> then<00:00:59.660> I<00:00:59.690> use

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
to use some fuel line and then I use

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.889 
to use some fuel line and then I use
these<00:01:00.260> little<00:01:00.559> clamps<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.480> some<00:01:02.480> other<00:01:02.660> other

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
these little clamps and some other other

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.560 
these little clamps and some other other
piece<00:01:03.230> of<00:01:03.440> fuel<00:01:03.739> line<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.309> protect<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.030> powder

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
piece of fuel line to protect the powder

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.749 
piece of fuel line to protect the powder
coat<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:08.210> then<00:01:08.930> just<00:01:09.229> hose<00:01:09.380> clamps<00:01:09.979> so

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
coat and and then just hose clamps so

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.850 
coat and and then just hose clamps so
this<00:01:10.970> thing<00:01:11.180> gives<00:01:11.630> quite<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.259> bit<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.799> just

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
this thing gives quite a bit it just

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.749 
this thing gives quite a bit it just
kind<00:01:13.790> of<00:01:13.850> floats<00:01:14.150> there<00:01:14.530> just<00:01:15.530> work<00:01:16.520> pretty

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
kind of floats there just work pretty

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.330 
kind of floats there just work pretty
good<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:17.299> strobe<00:01:17.630> lights<00:01:17.979> two<00:01:18.979> three<00:01:19.189> years

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
good this strobe lights two three years

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.380 
good this strobe lights two three years
old<00:01:19.670> I've<00:01:20.509> never<00:01:20.720> had<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:20.930> problem<00:01:21.229> with<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:22.390> you

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
old I've never had a problem with it you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.130 
old I've never had a problem with it you
got<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.869> place<00:01:24.259> an<00:01:24.470> inline<00:01:24.799> fuse<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:26.479> forget<00:01:27.049> how

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
got to place an inline fuse I forget how

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.130 
got to place an inline fuse I forget how
many<00:01:27.200> ANSYS<00:01:27.799> fuse<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.579> then<00:01:29.540> I<00:01:29.570> have<00:01:29.810> stake

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
many ANSYS fuse is and then I have stake

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.580 
many ANSYS fuse is and then I have stake
bonds<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.680> again<00:01:30.950> tie<00:01:31.189> wraps<00:01:31.520> but<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:33.020> switch

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
bonds and again tie wraps but the switch

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.100 
bonds and again tie wraps but the switch
is<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.100> this<00:01:34.310> one<00:01:34.670> quarter<00:01:35.540> panel<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.869> cage

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
is on this one quarter panel of the cage

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.100 
is on this one quarter panel of the cage
so<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:40.220> don't<00:01:40.729> have<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.119> cut<00:01:41.390> tie<00:01:41.630> wraps<00:01:41.899> or

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
so that I don't have to cut tie wraps or

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.870 
so that I don't have to cut tie wraps or
anything<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:42.619> just<00:01:42.649> stays<00:01:43.040> there<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.549> pull

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
anything it just stays there when I pull

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.670 
anything it just stays there when I pull
it<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.890> other<00:01:46.040> thing<00:01:46.280> was<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.820> get<00:01:47.030> a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
it the other thing was to get a

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.889 
it the other thing was to get a
rechargeable<00:01:48.680> motor<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.270> have<00:01:50.630> for<00:01:50.869> a

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
rechargeable motor that I have for a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.069 
rechargeable motor that I have for a
thrill<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.759> then<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:53.149> figure<00:01:53.509> out<00:01:53.719> where<00:01:54.049> to

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
thrill and then to figure out where to

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.039 
thrill and then to figure out where to
place<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.469> and<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.790> best<00:01:56.060> place<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.390> I<00:01:56.719> have

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
place it and the best place that I have

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.420 
place it and the best place that I have
found<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:58.180> just<00:01:59.180> like<00:01:59.750> that<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.469> I<00:02:00.590> use<00:02:00.829> velcro

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
found is just like that and I use velcro

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.950 
found is just like that and I use velcro
as<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.840> pad<00:02:02.840> and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.130 

and<00:02:06.860> then<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.550> simply<00:02:07.910> use<00:02:08.270> another<00:02:08.630> velcro

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
and then I simply use another velcro

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.340 
and then I simply use another velcro
strap<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:12.770> hold<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.340> place<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:14.350> it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
strap to to hold that in place and it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.160 
strap to to hold that in place and it
doesn't<00:02:15.680> go<00:02:15.770> anywhere<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.870> fine<00:02:17.870> and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
doesn't go anywhere and it's fine and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.260 
doesn't go anywhere and it's fine and
the<00:02:18.260> battery<00:02:18.560> pack<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:19.010> light<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.940> strobe

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
the battery pack is light and the strobe

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.530 
the battery pack is light and the strobe
light<00:02:20.300> probably<00:02:20.990> run<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:22.150> don't<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:23.209> four

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
light probably run I don't know four

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.340 
light probably run I don't know four
hours<00:02:23.750> three<00:02:24.200> four<00:02:24.440> hours<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.780> all<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.870> did<00:02:27.110> was

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
hours three four hours and all I did was

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.120 
hours three four hours and all I did was
use<00:02:27.890> stake<00:02:28.670> ons<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.660> stab<00:02:30.790> into<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.709> fittings

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
use stake ons to stab into the fittings

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.920 
use stake ons to stab into the fittings
there<00:02:34.459> on<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.720> battery<00:02:36.470> pack<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.930> that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
there on the battery pack so that that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.080 
there on the battery pack so that that
setup<00:02:39.380> works<00:02:39.770> pretty<00:02:40.040> good<00:02:43.000> normally<00:02:44.000> you

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
setup works pretty good normally you

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.140 
setup works pretty good normally you
take<00:02:44.270> off<00:02:44.510> before<00:02:45.489> sundown<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.910> fly

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
take off before sundown and you fly

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.540 
take off before sundown and you fly
around<00:02:47.300> away<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.989> while<00:02:48.500> some<00:02:49.010> people<00:02:49.160> run

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
around away a while some people run

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.180 
around away a while some people run
their<00:02:49.670> strobe<00:02:50.000> lights<00:02:50.300> but<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.320> I<00:02:51.560> thought

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
their strobe lights but I just I thought

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.979 
their strobe lights but I just I thought
it<00:02:52.310> was<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> good<00:02:52.610> idea<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:53.060> put<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.420> switch<00:02:53.780> on

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
it was a good idea to put that switch on

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.720 
it was a good idea to put that switch on
in<00:02:54.230> case<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:56.420> know<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.630> case<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.959> need<00:02:57.230> a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
in case you know in case you need a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.500 
in case you know in case you need a
longer<00:02:58.730> strobe<00:02:59.630> light<00:03:00.489> run<00:03:01.489> best<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.239> delay

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
longer strobe light run best it delay

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.600 
longer strobe light run best it delay
the<00:03:02.720> start<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.650> save<00:03:04.250> save<00:03:05.090> battery<00:03:05.390> so

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
the start of it and save save battery so

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.370 
the start of it and save save battery so
yeah<00:03:07.610> that's<00:03:07.910> pretty<00:03:08.000> much<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.570> install<00:03:09.020> I'll

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
yeah that's pretty much the install I'll

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.740
