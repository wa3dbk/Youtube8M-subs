quite<00:05:52.330> basic<00:05:52.599> not<00:05:53.320> basic<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:53.889> simple<00:05:54.509> so<00:05:55.509> you

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
quite basic not basic but simple so you

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.839 
quite basic not basic but simple so you
click<00:05:55.900> on<00:05:56.020> device<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.770> it's<00:05:57.550> all<00:05:57.639> fuzzy

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
click on device and it's all fuzzy

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.149 
click on device and it's all fuzzy
obviously<00:05:58.620> because<00:05:59.620> you've<00:05:59.830> got<00:06:00.009> nothing

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
obviously because you've got nothing

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.310 
obviously because you've got nothing
connected<00:06:00.699> then<00:06:00.969> you<00:06:01.060> go<00:06:01.180> to<00:06:01.270> inputs<00:06:01.780> and<00:06:02.080> down

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
connected then you go to inputs and down

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.640 
connected then you go to inputs and down
to<00:06:02.500> composite<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:04.930> if<00:06:05.080> it's<00:06:05.229> all<00:06:05.380> connected

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
to composite and if it's all connected

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.589 
to composite and if it's all connected
properly<00:06:05.979> it<00:06:06.280> should<00:06:06.460> work<00:06:06.669> and<00:06:06.940> you<00:06:07.419> should

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
properly it should work and you should
