 just about as fraternal alongside 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.650
 each other and we saw a very weird one 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.880

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.700

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.200
 done to whom he would sit 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.760
 extending boxtel 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.020
 yes but what is in front of me is 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.340
 maybe all weird will be one 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.140
 have seen times what is this 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.220

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.510
 you have to look and this is quite good 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.800
 very cool thing to know what i think about it 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.449
 have we see have new kind of 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.379
 dummy form together so rich or not 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.760
 completely correct 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.780
 I saw after the soul with a demo 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.339
 aries i want to go first this just you know 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.460
 how many seem 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.749
 Soon Mickey Mouse will cancel her 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.370

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.239

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.579
 I do not get him respite me 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.199

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.209
 seat there is a micky mÃ¤use flicker 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.250
 you need minimal but good the smart 

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:06.049
 bluetooth speakers what can that ask 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.310
 then why is he smart after his pair 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.979
 thingies 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.329
 First of all he connects your NFC with you 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.680
 phone for example through your tablet or 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.539
 whatever about smart things 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.670
 if you have blood or you can stop it 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.840
 say a device 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.340
 play michael jackson then you have to 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.899
 not so fast but from the bed 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.579
 but play my production and play this 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.140
 where that goes then call cons of it 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.090
 this bluetooth speaker well when I'm on the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.770
 couch and I need you for yourself 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.210
 you i never got on the couch i am 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.060
 namely always actively engaged correctly 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.439
 on the couch and your cousin only music 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.929
 you just call it 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.920
 device play display the it and he does 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.899
 the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.200
 and you can also use conference call and 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.579
 yet 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.869
 yes indeed you can just like you 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.210
 with low we could phone you 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.439
 Just call it I had in we talk 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.539
 have essentially blood will cheat 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.649
 nowadays where this so I find 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.789
 make him feel a bit plastic 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.770
 paul sorry i 'm a bit faint 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.119
 why I say a plastic but good 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.829
 I still think it's reasonable 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.079
 massive that for me in a row and how it sounds 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.609
 it what i just got a little bit 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.539
 after hearing that i can't really get an impression of it 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.009
 on jesus and you will destroy my 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.010
 how that sounds that can't really be one 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.900
 giving a 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.520
 indicate that will undoubtedly come as 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.080
 Italian market is that we demand 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.970
 which by the way is very tuber type 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.930
 device you really the turbo last 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.970
 as enthusiastic in real life 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.410
 I look like the gram of today 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.290
 what is also very cool is from the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.970
 alarm clock function and if you have a bed and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.500
 ronckes the way except you have let go 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.870
 make work ready for you 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.820
 these are going to go at some point 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 drive then you just get away from it 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.570
 is my wheels so she is under here so 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.710
 you do that you have to walk behind 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.810
 to turn off 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.270
 rolling radio alarm clock that you see you see 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.560
 already on nbc food the netherlands comes 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.180
 not yet clear he goes between the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.030
 three and four hundred whole carbon meters 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.710
 two and 300 euros is what they are 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.120
 but that's not the price 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.980
 we handle the Netherlands seems to be 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.750
 knew something cheaper but it is still a while 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.430
 wait and see if that at all to 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.230
