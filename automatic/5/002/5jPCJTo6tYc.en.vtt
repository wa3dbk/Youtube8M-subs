00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.110
 directors HDblog of damen j 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.820
 again gaming 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.840
 today we show you oddworld stranger's 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.750
 wrath game originally released in the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.489
 2005 for xbox platform that resumes 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.850
 life on ios 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.520
 in this version really well done 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.739
 a title that we tell you right away not 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.340
 offers no content in over 20 hours 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.050
 of play is completely inspired and 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.860
 I would say very similar to the version 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.290
 original 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.750
 you will see it better in the in- game phase than 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.430
 rivera brief but as always we give one 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.469
 look at the settings 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.370
 let's say right away that this is a fps 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:03.420
 in first person of a fantasy character a 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.800
 western fantasy to be more correct 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.080
 there is no part of the settings 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.090
 very much not the game loaded or 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.860
 continue a previous one but there is a 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.960
 very interesting aspect we wanted 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.000
 show you regarding the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.060
 settings is one of the rare times in 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.310
 where we find a section really 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.040
 complete with regard to 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.630
 performance and will understand it very well 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.390
 those who have already purchased it 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.670
 they are trying as they can 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.760
 be all the best you need to be 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.920
 in possession or at least for this 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.330
 first version of adwords that maybe not 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.939
 being completely optimized 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.509
 could improve with later 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.820
 updates 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.409
 however you must be in possession of 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.470
 a latest generation device 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.220
 also on ipad as in this case then 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.869
 an input device last year will not be 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.229
 possible to set everything to maximum or 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.380
 how much less we can do it but we would notice 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.780
 obvious declines in the overall frame rates and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.040
 so what can we go to change 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.829
 in performance as you see the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.960
 resolution rest from visual distance i 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.720
 decorators or all the elements in 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.460
 over the years the scene know propia 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.040
 shadows decide how many 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.470
 and display the effects and activate 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.540
 or less the reflexes look a lot 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.610
 interesting that really made us 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.920
 nice to meet you 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.710
 regarding the controls we can 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.540
 use both those optimized for 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.130
 touch and specially designed devices 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.290
 designed for the ios version but is 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.070
 support immediately available 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.020
 of the controllers m fry then those 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.760
 original or as we did 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.500
 always us 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.200
 as you have also seen in the previous ones 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.320
 recessions using a cydia tweak 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.780
 so on a jailbroken device it is 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.510
 You can use pads, for example 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.130
 of ps3 ps4 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.200
 so let's proceed with the phrase in the game 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.810
 with this brief excerpt of game that 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.810
 we made on ipad raleigh 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.160
 so I would say we can move on to 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.470
 conclusions a really well done title 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.230
 which is very close to the version 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.110
 oddworld stranger's original console 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.640
 wrath can be purchased from the app store at 5 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.380
 euro and 49 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.200
 I would say an appropriate price for the quality 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.410
 indeed very low perhaps if we consider 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.650
 the original cost of a security that 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.980
 however a is not a soul in the mobile sphere 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.590
 brings so many details and lots of it 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.560
 quality both in the storyline and in the 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.300
 general game realization that 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.130
 definitely recommend all 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.750
 owners of devices rather 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.640
 recent 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.520
 so I would say that for this videoprove 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.890
 all adam and j x hdblog greets you there 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.890
 let's see to the next videos hello everybody
