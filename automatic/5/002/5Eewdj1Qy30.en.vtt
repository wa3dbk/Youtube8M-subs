00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.110
 hello welcome today I am going to teach you 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.820
 how to make a bookmark of the book to 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.590
 I love doing them and the truth is that 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.559
 normally to everyone who is 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.300
 I teach he seems very nice to me 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.509
 the leaves usually do with white with 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.490
 beige does not matter if it's a bit dirty 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.650
 because how will it fit into the 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.840
 book covers nothing good 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.210
 we started 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.990
 we knead and heat the juice well 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.990
 the hand to make it a little bit more 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.990
 moderate 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.210
 we leave you there 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.380
 and then let's go the color of the lid 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.190
 of the book that in this case I have chosen 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.190
 this purple 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.320
 I usually do a little churrito because 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.640
 I extend it until 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.210
 the more or less desired length 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.210
 depending on the size 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.510
 once it has been kneaded 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.960
 short in straight 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.970
 more or less 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.000
 in these things of crafts does not 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.090
 lack of that de facto because sometimes what 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.090
 nice is that it is not accurate 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.780
 we leave here a bit apart 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.780
 and with him 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.400
 more or less the edge stays so that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.920
 then it is clear that it is a book 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.420
 a clip I prefer metallic that 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.129
 plastics because if not in the oven it 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.129
 they spoil and 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.730
 we put it then now I just 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.530
 bend a bit to take the measurement 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.530
 and more or less I'm cutting 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.050
 a little more 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.950
 more or less you see it true this would be 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.480
 super simple and now we planted a 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.200
 little details 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 the sewing line of the books 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.770
 and I usually do some points like that 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.550
 there are times that I do like this 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.350
 Y 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.350
 I add a piece of 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.980
 as if holding 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.430
 here you have the book and what is a 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.690
 little bit more valuable you can add some 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.690
 detail for example over here 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.150
 to a drawing or what you want then good 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.970
 this is the book I hope you have 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.680
 liked and I hope to have time to 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.170
 Soon to continue making them more tutorials 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.570
 Thank you very much for the visits and the 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.350
 comments thank you very much until 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.350
