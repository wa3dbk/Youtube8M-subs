00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
plate is very very impressive

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.120 
plate is very very impressive
so<00:01:15.509> knife<00:01:15.930> only<00:01:16.080> Kem<00:01:16.320> strikes<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:16.890> are

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so knife only Kem strikes they are

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.880
