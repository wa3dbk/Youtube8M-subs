can buy an apple for 49 boats and I got
it<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.710> my<00:00:26.010> imac<00:00:28.250> so<00:00:29.539> one<00:00:30.539> reason<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> got

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
it with my imac so one reason that I got

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.280 
it with my imac so one reason that I got
it<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.500> included<00:00:34.500> USB<00:00:35.239> ports

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
it was because of the included USB ports

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.450 
it was because of the included USB ports
which<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.530> backward<00:00:38.010> compatible<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.850> USB

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
which are backward compatible with USB

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.950 
which are backward compatible with USB
1.1<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:42.200> well<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:44.120> USB<00:00:45.120> 2.0<00:00:46.010> um<00:00:47.719> another<00:00:48.719> reason

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
1.1 as well as USB 2.0 um another reason

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
1.1 as well as USB 2.0 um another reason
was<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:50.149> I<00:00:51.170> didn't<00:00:52.170> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:54.980> non<00:00:55.980> Mac

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
was that I didn't want to use a non Mac

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.450 
was that I didn't want to use a non Mac
USB<00:00:57.440> keyboard<00:00:58.699> because<00:00:59.699> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.350> fact<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
USB keyboard because of the fact that it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.570 
USB keyboard because of the fact that it
has<00:01:02.609> these<00:01:02.789> pool<00:01:03.149> controls<00:01:04.010> like<00:01:05.010> my

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
has these pool controls like my

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.270 
has these pool controls like my
brightness<00:01:05.850> controls<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
brightness controls and then out of it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.969 
brightness controls and then out of it
was<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.290> media<00:01:10.560> controls<00:01:11.570> which<00:01:12.979> are

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
was a and the media controls which are

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.179 
was a and the media controls which are
cool<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.439> itunes<00:01:16.860> open
