00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
path of where the path is in the path

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440 
path of where the path is in the path
where<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> path<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.930> yes<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.680> makes<00:01:40.920> sense

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
where the path is yes that makes sense

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.499 
where the path is yes that makes sense
yeah<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:43.020> come<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.360> then<00:01:45.360> the
