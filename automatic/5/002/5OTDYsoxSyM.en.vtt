00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:08.290
 the earth currently seven billion 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.220
 of people inhabit 30 percent of 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.330
 its surface 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.000
 and all of them depend on the other 70% of the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.520
 ocean 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.010
 It is the largest source of sustenance in the world 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.890
 the fish is the main source 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.110
 daily protein for 1200 million 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.840
 people but increasingly with more 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.990
 often fishermen return with 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.390
 the empty networks back off in the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.460
 time some scientists claim that 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.470
 in the last 60 years the populations 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.920
 of large fish have decreased in a 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.040
 90% and alert of the collapse of all 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.180
 species that are caught in less than 50 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.080
 years the cause 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.080
 overfishing 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:59.030
 longline vessels use 1400 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.270
 millions of hooks per year 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.250
 from each of these hooks hangs a 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.250
 slice of fish as bait 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.990
 these trawlers operate with 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.880
 networks that have an opening up 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.880
 23,000 square meters 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.240
 an area equivalent to four fields of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.940
 soccer and with capacity for 13 planes 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.660
 jumbo 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.170
 or more commonly more than 500 tons of 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.720
 fish among these 500 tons there 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.120
 a lot of by-catches 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.090
 they are captured sea creatures 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.240
 incidentally and often in large 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.240
 amounts 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.650
 shrimp trawlers return to the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.790
 sea ​​between 80 and 90 of the creatures 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.790
 captured marine 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.630
 this means that for a kilogram of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.000
 shrimp are caught and wasted until 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.940
 nine kilos of other wildlife species and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.390
 marine flora to relieve the pressure 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.710
 about wild fish stocks on 47 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.360
 percent of our demand 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.200
 seafood products comes from 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.510
 fish farms but far from helping the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.820
 marine aquaculture further aggravates the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.950
 problem many of the species of 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.750
 They are carnivorous fish farms is 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.050
 that feed on other fish more 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.600
 small to produce a kilo of salmon 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.540
 of fish farm 5 kilos of 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.090
 wild fish 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.400
 aquaculture only transforms fish 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.950
 small of little value in fish more 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.459
 big and more valuable do not believe anymore 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.459
 fish 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.170
 Most of the fishery resources 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.660
 Europeans are overexploited the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.620
 fishing quotas exceed the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.620
 scientific recommendations 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.280
 in 2008 the fishing quotas were fixed 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.800
 for the prized bluefin tuna 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.140
 scientists advise not to exceed 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.540
 10,000 tons to repopulate 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.000
 gradually the population 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.909
 but the ub and other fishing nations 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.640
 They decided to set the quota at 29,500 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:17.459
 tons tripling the recommendation 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.680
 of the experts and despite being a 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.220
 already exaggerated limit itself 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.680
 They captured 61 thousand tons 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.900
 this figure exceeds 6 times the limit 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.360
 recommended 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.310
 billions of euros in subsidies 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.400
 publics encourage overfishing 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.849
 if this does not change soon there will be no 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.849
 fishes 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.400
 how can we put an end to overfishing in 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.680
 Brussels politicians must take the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.069
 correct decisions to end the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.069
 overfishing 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.070
 citizens should encourage and support 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.610
 your politicians to take such 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.610
 decisions
