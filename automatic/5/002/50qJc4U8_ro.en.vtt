00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
going to be in the game so what we did

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.920 
going to be in the game so what we did
though<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.149> change<00:01:00.420> things<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
though is that we change things up a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.389 
though is that we change things up a
little<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.010> carbon

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
little bit so it's not just a carbon

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
little bit so it's not just a carbon
