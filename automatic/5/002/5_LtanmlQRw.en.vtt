00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
myself and with patients that diets work

myself and with patients that diets work
usually<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> short<00:00:52.170> while<00:00:52.320> they<00:00:52.980> work<00:00:53.160> when

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
usually for a short while they work when

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.160 
usually for a short while they work when
you're<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.210> sure<00:00:54.780> enough<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> get

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
you're on them and sure enough you get

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
you're on them and sure enough you get
off<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.610> observed<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.449> there's<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
off and and what I observed is there's a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
off and and what I observed is there's a
very<00:00:57.750> interesting<00:00:58.379> phenomenon<00:00:58.859> called<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
very interesting phenomenon called the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.510 
very interesting phenomenon called the
rebound<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.629> many<00:01:01.020> people<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.160> maybe

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
rebound so many people they think maybe

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.130 
rebound so many people they think maybe
it's<00:01:02.640> their<00:01:02.760> imagination<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.600> fewer

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's their imagination that fewer

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.929 
it's their imagination that fewer
calories<00:01:04.350> seem<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.010> farther<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.760> not

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
calories seem to go farther but it's not

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.810 
calories seem to go farther but it's not
their<00:01:06.180> imagination<00:01:07.100> because<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.490> are

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
their imagination because we are

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.890 
their imagination because we are
uniquely<00:01:09.630> designed<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:11.189> survive<00:01:11.900> in

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
uniquely designed to survive in

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.140 
uniquely designed to survive in
situations<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.799> starvation<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.939> any

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
situations of starvation and so any

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749 
situations of starvation and so any
perceived<00:01:15.710> deprivation<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:17.310> drive<00:01:17.549> us<00:01:17.729> there

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
perceived deprivation can drive us there

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.999 
perceived deprivation can drive us there
both<00:01:18.380> physiologically<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.590> terms<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
both physiologically in terms of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.249 
both physiologically in terms of
changing<00:01:20.400> our<00:01:20.869> metabolism<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.020> also

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
changing our metabolism and also

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.590 
changing our metabolism and also
psychologically<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.909> soon<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.210> our<00:01:24.299> back

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
psychologically so as soon as our back

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
psychologically so as soon as our back
is<00:01:24.810> turned<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.380> ourselves<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:26.240> crave

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
is turned on ourselves we crave

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
is turned on ourselves we crave
something<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.020> act<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> knew

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
something and we act it out so I knew

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
something and we act it out so I knew
there<00:01:29.909> had<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.420> different<00:01:30.869> way<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.890> go

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
there had to be a different way to go

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.580 
there had to be a different way to go
about<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.000> I'm<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> longtime<00:01:33.810> meditator

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
about this and I'm a longtime meditator

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.960 
about this and I'm a longtime meditator
right<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> started

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
right right as you know and so I started

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.370 
right right as you know and so I started
to<00:01:39.090> apply<00:01:39.329> some<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> principles<00:01:40.200> that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
to apply some of the principles that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
to apply some of the principles that
have<00:01:40.619> shown<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.700> other<00:01:42.030> areas<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.630> have

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
have shown up in other areas that have

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.800 
have shown up in other areas that have
been<00:01:42.869> researched<00:01:43.399> where<00:01:44.399> mindfulness<00:01:45.090> has

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
been researched where mindfulness has

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.480 
been researched where mindfulness has
been<00:01:46.020> evaluated<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.799> different<00:01:47.310> conditions

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
been evaluated for different conditions

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.810 
been evaluated for different conditions
and<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.420> didn't<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.229> lot<00:01:49.500> about<00:01:50.130> eating<00:01:50.610> but

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and I didn't see a lot about eating but

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.480

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I knew that something had to be there

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.719 
I knew that something had to be there
and<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.759> about<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:55.729> researchers

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and just about then a researchers

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.940 
and just about then a researchers
student<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.540> student<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:58.049> OSU<00:01:58.320> approached<00:01:58.770> me

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
student a student from OSU approached me

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
student a student from OSU approached me
wanting<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.579> collaborate<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.479> research

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
wanting to collaborate on a research

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.929 
wanting to collaborate on a research
project<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.680> thought<00:02:02.009> okay<00:02:02.460> here's<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
project and I thought okay here's the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.090 
project and I thought okay here's the
opportunity<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> created<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.680> series<00:02:04.979> of

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
opportunity so I created this series of

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
opportunity so I created this series of
classes<00:02:05.610> which<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.030> been<00:02:06.180> remarkably

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
classes which have been remarkably

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199 
classes which have been remarkably
effective<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:08.099> ways<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.670> didn't<00:02:09.060> even

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
effective in ways that I didn't even

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.780 
effective in ways that I didn't even
anticipate<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.289> about<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.129> second<00:02:11.550> year

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
anticipate and about the second year

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.199 
anticipate and about the second year
people<00:02:12.239> started<00:02:12.540> asking<00:02:12.720> me

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209
