00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.380

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.919

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.589
 I told him the pt 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:16.530

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.199

 the call 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.119
 an observation 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.409
 in the final minutes 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:26.989
 pedro 29 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.249
 Today we are going to talk about curricula to elaborate a curriculum I do not know, right? 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.250
 It's the lesson that putting 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.370
 and let's start by saying what a resume is not 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.390
 a resume is not an autobiography, it's no use filling up pages and 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.530
 more pages to try to impress 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.760
 bit more luck and goal 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 has a resume size is not document 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.000
 one all 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I want 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
 ef 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.160
 to reach these numbers said 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.100
 by telephone to report 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.149
 a resume is a list in the professional school history of a candidate 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.000
 there are those who preach 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.850
 one provided no part 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.970
 here we deliver 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.970
 Let's throw the rolled up towel. 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.810
 already searching for ip 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.530
 live life and career 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.520
 I'll tell you more 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.560
 two other guests the saulo and today 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 we can only wait 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.299
 Good morning, my pleasure. 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.310
 little loop 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.260
 almost 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.040
 age can make a goal every 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.939
 same 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.469
 know how many years 24 years if a company has already decided that it does not want 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.909
 hire someone above as below a certain one and given in note the 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.640
 candidate is not called 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.640
 not to lose balance and small business 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.179
 because the curriculum is composed of those who 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.239
 two 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.249
 three pages 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.159
 etc. along with the curriculum 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.419
 your mandate the sea letter 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.799
 to show my first impression 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.040
 is the staff you as a human resources professional would find this resume 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.779
 a bit exaggerated 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:29.860
 first thing to solo you have two resumes by no team 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.860
 two pages pt joaquim brito one page 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.340
 why exactly did you decide to do two resumes 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.850
 The curriculum more summarized in 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.560
 delivered in agencies of daily life another resume would be forever 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.660
 will leave the interviewee of this smart measure I would say that this is a 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.709
 chance 'to deal with 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.709
 and as he always wins with two pages he would have to lose 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.679
 he has a very small chance of town 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.889
 with this being the companies being the latest brand older 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.109
 before entering and still says 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.529
 and the conditions of getting a job there, you give a brief description of 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.949
 each of the things you know you have been recovered leads the retention 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:12.589
 payment of current account with what was needed argues the promoter in 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.830
 Open track that listened attentively I have no idea what oliveira prefer 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.339
 You start reading a 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:21.309
 one expected a second line if you do not understand anything you go back to the 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.799
 month turned the registration page 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.829
 I come back as this first turned the magazine page and I think most 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.949
 of people do exactly what I do 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.949
 you should put the salary pretension 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.590
 this will be discussed in an interview 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.569
 now sad the courses you did 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.569
 the first chance 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.289
 especially when you have an up-to-date resume 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.769
 pedro mota soares 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.719
 here at lubango bruno 2 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.400
 in turn they were also installed you are not here it was only here I 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:56.330
 could understand public assessment of what here was a Saturday morning course 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.720
 give yourself two hours break for coffee and cigarettes now 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.929
 the right hour to the right of the treasury 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.239
 table of 1 88 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.809
 I know in some language 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:07.920
 the english max 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.959
 very basic 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.789
 It's not worth putting the basic dilma they want to leave nor has much to 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.629
 the amount can by false loop 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:22.129
 Congratulations your your the basic word here meyong gets very basic 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:23.340
 saying is very bad 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.849
 it's better not to put 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.150
 so as not to risk someone being robbed 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.379
 who takes a chance and gives the one caught 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:31.800
 we want in portuguese 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.910
 is the worst thing that can happen a curriculum there has a Portuguese error 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.210
 It is the very serious who is the governor. 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.930
 there is no problem is the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.449
 always give someone a review in the curriculum so as not to risk 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:46.700
 a word 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.020
 make the wrong impression about you 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.110
 so the audience is read 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.110
 they need to draw the attention of who will read 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.110
 I wanted to be a very important thing in curicó 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.600
 if you are 24 years old 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.750
 you see, not everyone who will print the curriculum is young as if 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.889
 may increase slightly 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.370
 the font size would also be interesting 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.169
 So I wanted to tell you something else before I finished. 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.889
 a personal letter 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.300
 It's a good attraction. 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.430
 a very simple letter and a paragraph 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.560
 It would always be good for you to say something. 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.560
 naturis expertise that has to do with that company 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.349
 if it is a bank why your family has accounted for almost 28 years if not 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.910
 that's why the name of that company was the first word you 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.650
 learned to pronounce 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.909
 before you even say anything 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.059
 united states 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:47.029
 I worked at one of the many points still running but there is no rain forecast 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.579
 is smaller and does not taste anything macau last year 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.580
 a mother of an 11-year-old girl and a 16-year-old child died Sunday afternoon 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.259
 in the maracana 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.150
 Paulo 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.190
 even if you are working hard with your work on the command you have in your 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.010
 curriculum feel accomplished 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.659
 and always very little 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.860
 because you never know when a new opportunity will arise 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:18.360
 and you will find new job of your life before you are called 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.460
 it is unknown 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.960
 declared no more 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.400
 the 100% 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.050
 it was a year 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.610
 simply already in the heading lucas neighborhoods
