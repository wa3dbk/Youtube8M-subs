definitely fishing this for only about 2
weeks<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.709> thought<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.459> was<00:03:09.549> too<00:03:09.730> small<00:03:09.940> after

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
weeks I thought it was too small after

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.990 
weeks I thought it was too small after
then<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:11.590> they<00:03:11.890> quickly<00:03:12.100> will<00:03:12.400> outgrow<00:03:12.580> it

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
then that they quickly will outgrow it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.199 
then that they quickly will outgrow it
and<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:14.830> small<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.459> works<00:03:15.730> but<00:03:16.090> it's

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
and it's it's small it works but it's

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.120 
and it's it's small it works but it's
not<00:03:16.269> ideal<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:20.260> one<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> good<00:03:20.799> thing<00:03:20.980> on<00:03:21.100> a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
not ideal so this one a good thing on a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.460 
not ideal so this one a good thing on a
bass<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:22.090> have<00:03:22.239> these<00:03:22.480> air<00:03:22.690> holes<00:03:22.959> here<00:03:23.170> since

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
bass to have these air holes here since

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.370 
bass to have these air holes here since
they<00:03:23.650> breathe<00:03:23.860> oxygen<00:03:24.190> not<00:03:24.489> water<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:26.320> you

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
they breathe oxygen not water so you

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.080 
they breathe oxygen not water so you
want<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.890> make<00:03:26.980> sure<00:03:27.010> they<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.549> some<00:03:27.760> kind<00:03:27.910> of
