then momento suit gay had an artificial

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.879 
then momento suit gay had an artificial
devil<00:02:32.299> fruit<00:02:32.480> which<00:02:32.719> was<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> dragon<00:02:33.409> now<00:02:33.859> I

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
devil fruit which was a dragon now I

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.170 
devil fruit which was a dragon now I
mean<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.519> don't<00:02:34.579> think<00:02:34.879> that<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.120> is

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
mean I don't think that this is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.449 
mean I don't think that this is
coincidence<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.049> think<00:02:36.079> that<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.950> believe

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
coincidence I think that I I believe

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.979 
coincidence I think that I I believe
that<00:02:37.609> everything<00:02:37.879> that<00:02:38.150> odor<00:02:38.389> does<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.719> for<00:02:38.959> a

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
that everything that odor does is for a

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.830 
that everything that odor does is for a
reason<00:02:39.409> and<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:40.159> believe<00:02:40.219> that<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:41.450> kind<00:02:41.719> of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
reason and I believe that it's kind of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.550 
reason and I believe that it's kind of
to<00:02:41.959> Porsche<00:02:42.319> or<00:02:42.680> kind<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.969> know

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
to Porsche or kind of the you know

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.839 
to Porsche or kind of the you know
makers<00:02:45.560> try<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.859> guess<00:02:46.040> make<00:02:46.340> assumptions

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
makers try and guess make assumptions

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.250 
makers try and guess make assumptions
that<00:02:46.909> maybe<00:02:47.299> Cardos<00:02:47.689> devil<00:02:47.930> foods<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
that maybe Cardos devil foods the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.289 
that maybe Cardos devil foods the
mystical<00:02:48.620> zone<00:02:48.829> type<00:02:49.099> dragon<00:02:49.639> and<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:50.180> would

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
mystical zone type dragon and that would

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.569 
mystical zone type dragon and that would
be<00:02:50.419> amazing<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.019> just<00:02:51.250> imagine<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.340> power

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
be amazing and just imagine the power

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.390 
be amazing and just imagine the power
that<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.909> thing<00:02:53.060> would<00:02:53.209> pack<00:02:53.650> now<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.980> also

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
that that thing would pack now I also

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.189 
that that thing would pack now I also
want<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.760> talk<00:02:55.939> about<00:02:56.090> where<00:02:56.480> kylo<00:02:56.689> ren's<00:02:57.049> with

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
feel like as far as strength goes as far

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.539 
feel like as far as strength goes as far
as<00:03:34.220> strength<00:03:34.519> goes<00:03:34.759> I<00:03:35.560> feel<00:03:36.560> like<00:03:36.799> it's<00:03:37.129> zone

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
as strength goes I feel like it's zone

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.179 
as strength goes I feel like it's zone
type<00:03:37.909> you<00:03:38.569> know<00:03:38.689> zone<00:03:38.930> types<00:03:39.229> right<00:03:39.379> here<00:03:39.650> then

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
type you know zone types right here then

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.789 
type you know zone types right here then
you<00:03:40.340> go<00:03:40.459> Paramecium<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.359> then<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.019> go<00:03:42.199> logia

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
you go Paramecium and then you go logia

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.990 
you go Paramecium and then you go logia
and<00:03:42.949> then<00:03:43.459> hockey

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
and then hockey

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.580 
and then hockey
I<00:03:44.090> believe<00:03:44.419> that<00:03:44.569> hockey<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.019> over<00:03:45.319> everything

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
I believe that hockey is over everything

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.469 
I believe that hockey is over everything
because<00:03:46.040> hockey<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:46.549> counteract<00:03:46.909> logia

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
because hockey can counteract logia

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.920 
because hockey can counteract logia
hockey<00:03:47.959> hockey<00:03:48.889> is<00:03:49.069> just<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.879> you<00:03:50.599> know<00:03:50.720> it's

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
hockey hockey is just the you know it's

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.390 
hockey hockey is just the you know it's
great<00:03:51.139> but<00:03:51.349> we're<00:03:51.680> not<00:03:51.769> talking<00:03:51.919> about<00:03:52.129> that

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
great but we're not talking about that

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.280 
great but we're not talking about that
right<00:03:52.579> now<00:03:52.609> we're<00:03:52.879> talking<00:03:53.150> about<00:03:53.239> 100b<00:03:53.840> skate

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
right now we're talking about 100b skate

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.550 
right now we're talking about 100b skate
oh<00:03:54.319> now<00:03:54.979> I<00:03:55.959> believe<00:03:56.959> that<00:03:56.989> kinda<00:03:57.349> was<00:03:57.469> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
oh now I believe that kinda was the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.349 
oh now I believe that kinda was the
weakest<00:03:57.919> between<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.549> four<00:03:58.729> yonk<00:03:58.969> oh<00:03:59.150> and

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
weakest between the four yonk oh and

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.360 
weakest between the four yonk oh and
that's<00:03:59.719> why<00:03:59.840> Luffy<00:04:00.169> in<00:04:00.290> law<00:04:00.439> decided<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.219> go

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
that's why Luffy in law decided to go

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.009 
that's why Luffy in law decided to go
after<00:04:01.519> him<00:04:01.819> first<00:04:02.090> because<00:04:02.299> you<00:04:02.540> go<00:04:02.659> after<00:04:02.780> the

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
after him first because you go after the

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.809 
after him first because you go after the
weakest<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:03.560> then<00:04:03.919> you<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.459> work<00:04:04.639> your<00:04:04.790> way

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
weakest and then you you work your way

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.990 
weakest and then you you work your way
up<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.090> ladder<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:06.489> that's<00:04:07.489> what<00:04:07.669> I<00:04:07.699> believe

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
up the ladder so that's what I believe

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.270 
up the ladder so that's what I believe
now<00:04:08.419> how<00:04:08.959> Qaeda<00:04:09.349> was<00:04:09.469> gonna<00:04:09.620> get<00:04:09.829> introduced
