00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
far the only thing that's hurting my

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.780 
far the only thing that's hurting my
plants<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> lighting<00:01:29.280> schedule<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
plants is the lighting schedule that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.050 
plants is the lighting schedule that
I've<00:01:29.880> moved<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:32.159> moved<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> two<00:01:32.759> hours

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I've moved to I have moved to two hours

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390 
I've moved to I have moved to two hours
a<00:01:33.090> day<00:01:33.180> while<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.900> medication<00:01:34.400> light

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
a day while on this medication light

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.730 
a day while on this medication light
will<00:01:35.820> break<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.390> Prosecco<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.259> tile<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
will break down Prosecco on tile and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
will break down Prosecco on tile and
make<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> ineffective<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
make it ineffective so you want to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.100 
make it ineffective so you want to
reduce<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> lighting<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.710> much<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> can

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
reduce the lighting as much as you can

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.660 
reduce the lighting as much as you can
even<00:01:43.110> even<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> hundred<00:01:44.100> percent<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.490> time

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
even even a hundred percent of the time

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.770 
even even a hundred percent of the time
would<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.880> okay

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
would be okay

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.120 
would be okay
and<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.409> probably<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.710> okay<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> as

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and that would probably be okay and as

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.260 
and that would probably be okay and as
according<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.790> mean<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.030> want<00:01:48.149> to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.789 
let's see also in the last video I cut
the<00:02:02.909> water<00:02:03.090> down<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.360> 50%<00:02:03.930> before<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> even

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the water down to 50% before I even

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.380 
the water down to 50% before I even
started<00:02:05.310> I'm<00:02:05.460> gonna<00:02:05.549> dip<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.270> little

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
started I'm gonna dip into that a little

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.880 
started I'm gonna dip into that a little
bit<00:02:06.860> now<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.890> reduce<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.640> water<00:02:08.849> level<00:02:09.209> by<00:02:09.360> half

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
bit now I reduce the water level by half

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.650 
bit now I reduce the water level by half
naturally<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> normal<00:02:11.400> water<00:02:11.550> change

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
naturally as a normal water change

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.890 
naturally as a normal water change
and<00:02:12.800> also<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.370> added<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> medication<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.720> that

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and also I added the medication to that

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.370 
and also I added the medication to that
and<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.710> worked<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.310> bath<00:02:17.760> now<00:02:18.420> every<00:02:19.140> fish

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
and that worked as a bath now every fish

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.440 
and that worked as a bath now every fish
in<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:19.740> got<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:19.980> medication<00:02:20.910> bath

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
in here got that medication bath

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.390
