 Perth work grace 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.830
 The ringing tone of this time 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.860
 6. The position to be introduced 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.970
 Waseda University Saito Kilo 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.070
 In order to spread this battle, we will keep 100 million euros 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.370
 It is yesterday 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 Because there is nothing to say 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 I would like to introduce this in the form of sheet metal 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.730
 Well then 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.830
 Subject matter

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.070
 ASICS too 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.300
 It is a practice t-shirt 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.840
 Here is a good cyberedon chance to break through the pace 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.230
 Not say 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.149
 We use as company 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.149
 Eco Othello has the effect that it is difficult to put it so far 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.549
 I will wear the clothes I wore this 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.940
 I think it will be under the sea 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.380
 It is good that there is no country in the upside down state 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.490
 I can play basketball 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.039
 There are several types I want to receive Peko-chan 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.840
 It is called 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.730
 Like this 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.130
 Position is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.180
 I want to be written 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 In part 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 It is a word that was common 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.450
 But one 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.960
 For bus stop players 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.990
 The message was written 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.260
 it's a t-shirt 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.190
 So you have a position and your own 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.110
 Best 16 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.550
 Please try to come in Iran 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.450
 The above is the subject 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.450
 Second stage items 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.490
 The second is this 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.920
 ASICS ci brand new shirt is not here 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.949
 It is called Profit Technology 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.659
 It is made according to the temporary body 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.060
 Serious injuries such as being sent with elasticity 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.899
 I can respond 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.879
 And it is very light but it is easy to move 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.599
 It is said that it is in one country of Taito 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.269
 Another time ago is different from cyber large 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.790
 Feel the ankle joints used here too 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.689
 Karate comfortably 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.579
 Because you can play 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.690
 It was because of the lower negotiation deadline date 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.990
 Expected to represent Japan 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.919
 Bank of Japan 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.899
 Because it is used 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.899
 This function is origami by all means everyone 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.059
 Please come to practice 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.129
 It was the second place 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.129
 Kameda 1 yen 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.859
 Primary 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.719
 It is a horse here 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.449
 so 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.769
 Stabilizers are stable 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.019
 When saying that it is Abe individuality first place 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.680
 It is good with core balance belt here Asics 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.369
 It's a new feature 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:17.359
 Words 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.059
 In stable 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.499
 At Chanpuru 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:21.999
 It is said that support is provided 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.489
 I play a role 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.079
 What's more amazing here 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.079
 It is an experiment actually done by ASICS 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.650
 After entering this white rice, it is an average, but 7 mm 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.139
 Jump ability 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.749
 That there is a city 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.749
 Results are out 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.889
 The ability to jump up is a basket 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.279
 I think it is a dream among people who are 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.749
 I can make that ring 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.669
 Well, actually I 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.669
 I want to want to go here 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:59.939
 White rice 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.939
 I think it would be counterattack 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.509
 On the ceiling 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.859
 We will experiment to see if we can reach 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.209
 Yamashita is saas 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.689
 It is delicious 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.689
 Yes 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.930
 In the meantime 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.960
 Because I would like to travel by opening a mountain junction 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.460
 Horse here 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.629
 I would like to enter 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.909
 It's just whether you think it's totally different 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.499
 I would like to try 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.779
 First part 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.189
 For example 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.189
 Because there is a mess 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.439
 In addition 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.439
 I think if you can play basketball 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.869
 It was lucky to be overwhelmed by ASICS
