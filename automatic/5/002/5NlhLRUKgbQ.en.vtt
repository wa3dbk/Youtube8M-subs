00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.730
 three other soldiers who do not specify yet released 34 aces 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.789
 as always a public expectation the crisis 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.049
 info 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.459
 it's the biggest seriousness until September 22nd 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.419
 certainly free 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.630
 return 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.019
 8:33 p.m. 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 it's a big one 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.319
 his presence Tuesday because in the rubble 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.970
 while his couple 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.189
 11:23 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.189
 in fact 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.640
 reading 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 ap 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.840
 in his article 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.910
 ap 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.550
 I submit myself 30 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.360
 we are on the head 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.120
 be it dry 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.010
 because this scheme applies 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 with what I shelter 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.680
 low cost companies 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.909
 no problem 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.580
 I imagine sure we 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.420
 I promised myself 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 This folder 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.310
 at 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 the Court of Auditors 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.780
 perhaps 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.700
 in a press release 4 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.100
 his disappearance more than a year ago he will not be able 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.090
 extracts 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090
 It's certain 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 I can not stand his status anymore 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.430
 2 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.109
 baroin 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.240
 it's him 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 AQIM 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.930
 the agreement years 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 varin 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.379
 unsurprisingly 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.750
 the words of m 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.750
 Sadly 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.960
 was studied the most 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.169
 Moon 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.829
 like what 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.899
 which 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.399
 and for good reason 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.329
 I watch 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.230
 dupont for an obligation more than the cost of borrowing on what 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.960
 relapse fight 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.959
 concretely the group 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.009
 Julian pauline 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.099
 hard blow for m 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.439
 decisive 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.439
 she 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.149
 which is not a sinecure 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.419
 for example 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.379
 I thank for buying traffic 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.079
 a fishing stop
