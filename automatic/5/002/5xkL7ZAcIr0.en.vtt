00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
engine if someone tells you this is the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.800 
engine if someone tells you this is the
same<00:02:19.040> engine<00:02:19.190> as<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.489> Micra<00:02:20.000> they're<00:02:20.360> lying

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
same engine as a Micra they're lying

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.380 
same engine as a Micra they're lying
it's<00:02:21.050> not<00:02:21.700> fortunately<00:02:22.700> these<00:02:22.880> engines<00:02:23.270> are

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's not fortunately these engines are

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.090 
it's not fortunately these engines are
very<00:02:23.450> reliable<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.590> obvious<00:02:24.920> way<00:02:25.070> to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
very reliable and the obvious way to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.890 
very reliable and the obvious way to
check<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.790> start<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.420> up<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.690> actually

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
check it is to start it up and actually

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.890 
check it is to start it up and actually
listen<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.830> now<00:02:31.239> figural<00:02:32.239> engines<00:02:32.630> are

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
listen to it now figural engines are

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.600 
listen to it now figural engines are
quite<00:02:33.350> roughly<00:02:33.650> because<00:02:34.220> they're<00:02:34.370> made<00:02:34.519> of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
quite roughly because they're made of

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.000 
quite roughly because they're made of
all<00:02:34.730> aluminium<00:02:34.940> if<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.320> get<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> car<00:02:36.769> up<00:02:36.860> to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
all aluminium if you get the car up to

all aluminium if you get the car up to
working<00:02:37.220> temperature<00:02:37.730> look<00:02:38.209> out<00:02:38.360> for<00:02:38.510> smoke

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
working temperature look out for smoke

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.120 
working temperature look out for smoke
if<00:02:39.080> there's<00:02:39.260> blue<00:02:39.410> smoke<00:02:39.680> coming<00:02:39.950> out<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
if there's blue smoke coming out the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.979 
if there's blue smoke coming out the
exhaust<00:02:40.190> then<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.180> know<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.420> turbo<00:02:41.750> charge

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
exhaust then you know the turbo charge

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.140 
exhaust then you know the turbo charge
is<00:02:42.140> probably<00:02:42.560> gone<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.220> new<00:02:43.250> turbo<00:02:43.760> fitted

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
is probably gone and a new turbo fitted

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.430 
is probably gone and a new turbo fitted
is<00:02:44.239> going<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.450> cost<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.780> six<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.170> seven

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
is going to cost you six to seven

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.880 
is going to cost you six to seven
hundred<00:02:45.500> quid<00:02:45.920> bit<00:02:46.580> scary
