 that you have a little moisture stored and that is all taste 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.419

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.469
 investigate 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.019
 and then we stand 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.379
 first the is supported 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.379

 we are going to finish the straight path always uses pre-heated plates 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.969
