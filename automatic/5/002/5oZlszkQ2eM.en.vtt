 intellectualoid lifestyle and you

 Maybe it says there you have to read 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 literature really you have to read the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.980
 books for men you have to read the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.980
 plastics you have to read borges 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.180
 in matters of literary genres 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.400
 we have to know how to call everything by 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.280
 his name to not put everything in one 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.290
 same pot on the one hand we have hard 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.989
 classic on the other hand we have a 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.820
 creature for young adults team 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.950
 academic on the other hand we had a 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.800
 juvenile system and on the other hand we had 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.660
 unsaturated child would be gone another 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.990
 example that for a child would know 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.210
 that you obviously remember the child does not 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.920
 will be able to access that kind of 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.560
 literature if you do not put some 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.830
 steps in the case of the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.140
 juvenile literature look we have believe 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.340
 right now a great variety of works a 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.860
 number of books that lit the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.170
 tram come out in recent years were 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.970
 last two years the last two last 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.920
 decades has been in vogue the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.680
 books for young people that are bulky 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.410
 and more have in every feeling also 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.259
 it seems to me I hope you tell us something 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.330
 global because this is encouraging and 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.720
 is motivating new readers and the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.430
 is moving away from that evil 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.030
 the previous ones in this case my 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.510
 generation that is television and thing 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.250
 it's good 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.800
 what is evil what I do not 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.110
 It's up to me to say it but I'm going to 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.660
 based on historical examples for example 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.360
 let's see the case of July verne the case of 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.240
 artur conan doyle the case of agatha 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.340
 christie the case of stevenson and two 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.590
 subscribers who soon considered themselves 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.810
 vulgar because they distribute their works 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.450
 by the newspapers because they are focused on 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.200
 a public in a very literate suddenly 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.120
 based on youthful tone which to which 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.470
 was approaching with much more language 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 simple that that of the servers of the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.640
 epoch then all these names that I have 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.440
 mentioned right now are writers 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.540
 classic those actors 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.670
 I hope very respected whose work 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.770
 only valid until the day of 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.150
 today they have also created school and are 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.130
 taken by reference by many 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.380
 writers today maybe 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.680
 It is also talking about more recent cases 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.420
 as is the case with jk rowling of which 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.069
 I remember when he first appeared 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.140
 his saga of books by harry potter 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.409
 He had a lot of interest and many people 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.569
 could but already with the but look what 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.129
 is now converted and respectable 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.430
 that is something there are many people who say that 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.930
 there is an evolution and that the first 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.420
 books although they were very simple and very 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.790
 oriented for juvenile literature these 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.030
 last were masterly works of 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.030
 art 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.060
 but with a simple person allows 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.579
 have an opinion on this 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.819
 phenomenon the humble opinion have perished 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.340
 also rescue the objective of the subject and 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.019
 is that this type of works or indirect 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.079
 they are only generating the connectors 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.659
 but it is also encouraging that in 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.310
 these same advances between tura and the 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.549
 ever more complicated forest 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.620
 they will also be generating a lot of criticism 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.510
 literary many retreats artistic and this 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.790
 we do not see for example in the chemical 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.799
 institute regarding the miners has 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.049
 criticized to talk about a calf 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.909
 book and the comparison that this has 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.190
 point in front of others or in front of the 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.960
 movie are commonly based 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.960
 as we have seen in two of them in the 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.180
 work in question seems much more 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.250
 recommended a little more natural if you 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.320
 wants to recommend that kind of orchestra 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.150
 of bookstores just for the fact 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.190
 the boys read something and stop 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.410
 doing strange things on the computer 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.840
 but because of the fact that the boys 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.880
 discover the pleasure of sharing ideas 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.130
 around the book as projectors that 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.959
 at this moment there is a not only for 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.090
 the theme of fashion but also power 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.489
 create that habit of discussing works 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.110
 artistic, which is done very little and 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.750
 many times in current generations in 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.580
 which 5% embarrassed because it forms 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.980
 part as I repeat it during action that 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.720
 it was sent with blessing to transcend in 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.000
 this video I would like to summarize everything 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.890
 said under the following idea you know 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.750
 to a boy who is choosing some of 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.730
 these sagas that right now is in default 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.700
 Well I would like that instead of 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.310
 criticize it or destroy it to me logistics 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.980
 in greasy and suddenly suggest 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.140
 books a little more complex and banic the 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.210
 art field the necessary work goes 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.470
 to be much easier in excess of these 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.470
 young people have a base 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.530
 of starvation the chicken books of thrones 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.660
 that a base only based on 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.330
 television and audiovisual a lot 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.490
 easier and I say it with all would be like this 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.099
 ends the video in this week of 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:17.319
 salgado and they liked this the 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:19.380
 tracking more product networks 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.380
 social
