00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.360
 [Music] 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.709
 [Applause] 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.690
 for years a drama with the was not before 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.730
 speech series part disadvantage is getting worse 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.110
 and the series was around him 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.550
 fortunately scriptures are redemption 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.199
 the shift series is realistic you drive 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.480
 nice there 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.560
 and really gets a lot to offer therefore 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 game from us are 8 plus 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.270
 is 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.350
 if you want the feeling to look from 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.850
 a real driver, then of course you won't go 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.989
 like a sissy with the camera behind the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.160
 hang old ones 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.290
 real heroes go for the most 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.610
 interest experience and thereby on the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.789
 cockpit fell was no other 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.789
 [Music] 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.840
 thanks to the enormous detail of the cockpit 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.100
 it seems like you are actually in the car 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 there is a very good feeling for it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.340
 speed in this view you can almost get the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.580
 exhaust fumes from the opponent 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.980
 to smell 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.980
 [Music] 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 the most beautiful circuit in the world 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.759
 And we don't just say that because we 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.170
 of the fries from Flanders is in need 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.979
 for speed shift 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.659
 we are of course talking about it 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.520
 beautiful spa francorchamps 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.259
 in belgium the circuit is on one 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.659
 fantastic way about it and offers 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.159
 a wonderful challenge in the face of a daze 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.990
 a bend that sets the men apart 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.039
 the sissies we heard about is up to the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.119
 last category 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.119
 because we are just putting her on the brakes 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.409
 but praising collin mcrae dirt 2 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.000
 were about the multitude system it is 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.860
 girl sad 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.960
 you can drive your bonnet off and on 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.399
 it is possible to get fun in it 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.840
 but for that you have to do your utmost 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.700
 do best 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.259
 at reason for the joke with 200 kilometers 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.689
 against a concrete wall per hour 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.460
 and how about you not even a crack 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.929
 in the forward 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.590
 carglass otherwise not happy like this 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:14.550
 in reality it would also be that way 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.550
 there instead 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.440
 need for speed shift is absolutely none 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.180
 gran turismo were discussed 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.340
 but is wide enough to last you long 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.200
 entertain there are about 80 different ones 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.490
 to find cars in the game from famous ones 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.810
 brands like with a leg not pregnant 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.760
 audi 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.290
 every car drives a little differently and again 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.730
 are visual to your taste 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.900
 area to adjust 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.460
 for example you can do a huge one 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.390
 put the rear wing on your box to 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.390
 compensate for something else 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.129
 [Music] 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.990
 but 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.030
 there are a lot of nice beautiful ones in the game 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.140
 but drifting is not there 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.400
 below 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.140
 it totally does not match the new one 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.610
 realistic settings of the game and is 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.420
 to make matters worse 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.420
 I must be ridiculous 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.049
 You need your car at the perfect point 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.030
 keep balance as you go through the 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.159
 turn goes but soon you go over this 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.200
 point out and panties away from the bend 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.790
 precious points and there is nothing else to it 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.319
 then restart 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.319
 so avoid this misery like the plague 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.079
 shift has watched very secretly 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.730
 gotham racing project and the qudo system 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.140
 taken over 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.890
 you get a shirt with everything you do 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.599
 points 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.400
 these are divided and good deeds such as 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.019
 driving a perfect line or 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.450
 just as bad break away from the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.310
 opponent with enough 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.750
 put points in your levels and play 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.040
 new content free 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.599
 it's a nice addition to you 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.950
 challenges you to go again and again 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.950
 to get such new points 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.310
 press two open the racing season on one 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.840
 beautiful manner and shift indicates good 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.430
 consequence 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.560
 there are a few annoying downsides 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.710
 but one thing is definitely not for spit 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.939
 live again
