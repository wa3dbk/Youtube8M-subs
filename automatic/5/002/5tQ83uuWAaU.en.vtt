 studio talk learn more about 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.180
 health fitness wellness and 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.119

 Every week, the expert talk is over 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.990
 fit and healthy 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.860
 the sports physician dr fernando ios 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.840
 Berlin is my guest today 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.460
 Welcome to study you 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.869
 I also run a marathon and have myself 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.270
 Before the show you said you are one 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.829
 marathon in 2 hours 19 minutes 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.719
 that's almost 90 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.219
 kilometer This is my best time 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.960
 that is right way are so as 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.519
 Hobby runner I dream we have 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.679
 yes a young woman is looking up 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.909
 prepared her first marathon 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.269
 because in the training everything right 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.129
 made 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.229
 this will be on Sunday afternoon 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.659
 can say after the race because 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.549
 marathon are 42 kilometer the most 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.379
 People take along such a route 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.479
 I do not like the car back because it's so far 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.889
 is gone and she can walk and it can 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.929
 many things happen to be all that 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:03.369
 all it will be a very warm up there to 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.530
 it does not have an example around itself 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.670
 prepared or she drinks too much or 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.280
 too little on the way 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.080
 she runs too fast or too slow 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.430
 In fact, a lot can happen 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.540
 so that only after the race no 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.610
 make lists 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.290
 they did everything right and they did it 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.670
 next time learn something from it 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.070
 who should be such a one 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.490
 challenge marathon and we 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.580
 Not 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.920
 Who is not just not people 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.340
 the complaints are healthy 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.470
 sport the problems before with the heart 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 especially with the cycle had the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.600
 are not trained enough 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.580
 that will never often enough emphasized this 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.690
 people should do that with the marathon 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.060
 put off 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.160
 the prerequisites for a marathon 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.470
 at least one year to participate 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.290
 rather two years trained to drive 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.659
 regularly and about 30 to 40 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.920
 kilometer the week in the last 12 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.650
 weeks before the marathon you have to 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.510
 able to be 70 kilometers per week in 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.240
 to complete three sessions, for example 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.850
 10 15 miles on the track to run and 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.470
 plus 30 kilometers without problems 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.000
 to cover are very nice 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.110
 training problem the problem is yes 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.700
 you do not train enough that you do 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.509
 maybe not a problem arrives 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.760
 but it can also be that one 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.859
 damage to health is borne by us 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.480
 has a facebook audience question is enough 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.150
 from michaeli fair asked me how can 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.799
 one at one 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.629
 actually prevent people from doing so 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.659
 collapse and just collapse 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.400
 you can not prevent that because that 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.780
 It can happen anywhere in the cinema 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.819
 it can be based on your outing 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.250
 This is really happening and marathon 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.370
 a physical challenge 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.510
 you can reduce the risk by the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.700
 only people 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.769
 for the participation allows the healthy 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.260
 are who have trained enough and 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.730
 no complaints have another 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.250
 if you are unsure if you are 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.510
 I do not know if you have enough training 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.129
 you go a certain risk 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.139
 which investigation should now be 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.970
 run by the doctor before 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.349
 he is a marathon, the first one 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.940
 examine just with the healthy 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.530
 I 'm in the know 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.750
 stand the marathon training too 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.489
 I graduate in the 42nd 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.769
 kilometers to walk 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.750
 if not, I should comply 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.730
 either start me on it 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.040
 prepare or something completely different 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.209
 If I say yes, I can do that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.750
 I want to do that 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.810
 then men aged 45+ are women 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.760
 from 50 an examination on around heart and 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.250
 exclude circulatory diseases 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.510
 other people in an elevated 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.030
 for example, people have a risk 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.010
 smoked the problems with the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.019
 Blood sugar with the blood pressure with the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.720
 steering cables should definitely be 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.790
 Apart from the old age , to the doctor 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.379
 to get pre-approved participation 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.090
 but how do you actually start now? 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.449
 with the run has with the first 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.180
 step 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:43.310
 it is a very natural way of moving 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.810
 and everyone should not start 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.400
 at different intensities 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.349
 surely everyone should be with the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.109
 can start running and what are they 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.389
 typical mistakes make the beginner so 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.069
 ambitious all the way to 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.560
 try progressing too fast 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.290
 It takes all the time it costs to get it done 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.479
 effort quality comes only from the qual 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.760
 so you have to take the time and already 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.530
 if you think 25 years ago in the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.409
 School of 16 kilometer run on the piece 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.019
 and today 25 years without sport maybe 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.849
 robbed overweight put right there 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.590
 go where I left off 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.239
 it will not work so too 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.130
 much ambition way too fast 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.289
 want to see progress and wrong 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.000
 aims to sit down then there is the 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.949
 People they generally advise against 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.659
 would leak as I think 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.580
 For example, to patients with a 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:29.230
 dysmenorrhoea david also wants that 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.090
 warner 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.610
 from Tanzania like to not know at 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.750
 the physical activity is one of them it 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.190
 is just a normal one 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.020
 physical function 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.730
 some people can not walk because 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.680
 for example, complaints to the 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.450
 have a knee or because they are one 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.340
 but they are overweight too 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.350
 do not ask other sports for 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.050
 For example, you can go fast so 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.150
 tomorrow because of sport absolute 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.470
 definitely not by might run into 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.240
 some cases already and are 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.660
 aching too with the reason 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.000
 to stop running pain always prepares 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.800
 There is something wrong with the body 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.140
 the request any structure 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.450
 is just going down or broken 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.640
 that's why with pain stop yourself 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.980
 consider what happens there exactly and when 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.280
 the pain persists to the doctor 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.050
 go 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.370
 that means they would say so too 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.170
 if you can not jog anymore 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.730
 because that hurts but running works 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.040
 that is also a good method 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.940
 to exercise with it 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.710
 possibly something in any case 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.690
 good method is for example cycling 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.280
 or swim alternative 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.880
 sports where you do not 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.980
 has complaints 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.390
 what is the minimum for one 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.100
 Effective running training why do you have to 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.430
 So what does the whole thing do? 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.600
 Recommendations are both in america as well 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.120
 also in europe from the 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.330
 professional organizations about three times the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.220
 week at least 30 minutes and that 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.810
 means a stint of about two 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.000
 hours around the week 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.770
 whoever is more may be the more 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.600
 can create from the body 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.640
 so much the better and that 's especially good 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.930
 in such an optimal pulse range too 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.640
 train that also has this 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.470
 Pulse clocks what is now one 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.450
 optimal training pulse range one 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.580
 Optimal training bulls means that 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.590
 the body is at maximum 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.690
 loads do not adjust visor 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.490
 leak out and totally surrender 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.380
 the body does not adapt to the will 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.150
 not better but worse the 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.370
 optimal adaptation takes place in one 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.920
 range of about 80 percent of 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.070
 maximum load capacity city therefore 80 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.570
 percent of the maximum pulse can be because 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.320
 have a similar effect as the 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.700
 if you run in a 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.740
 Gym goes and for example 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.090
 on a crosstrainer that trains 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.770
 We want our facebook friend 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.920
 According to Fed, I like to travel from New Zealand 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.330
 know even better effects than on 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.430
 You also train with the crosstrainer 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.410
 the orca she for the audience that 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.350
 does not know because of the legs as well 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.540
 at the third 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.190
 rise and the poor parallel to it 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.110
 against one of these was training 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.880
 she with the whole body and that can 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.650
 indeed be more effective than just 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.540
 run and it is also a gentler 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.130
 Just what else is this movement 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.750
 abkupfern regards to kneel is 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.880
 So the best underground to tapering 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.370
 best floor a natural ground to 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.370
 example in the forest because that's just that 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.990
 the optimal background underground sand 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.180
 for example is also very good if it is 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.760
 very dry so it is very soft 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.960
 again unsuitable because the joints 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.690
 So you can hurt yourself 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.670
 asphalt is better if you walk at night 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.330
 because you turn tight you can not 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.310
 slip 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.350
 in winter it is quieter again 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.950
 a combination is always the best 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.330
 solution 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.160
 wonderful and easy with the first one 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.450
 Thank you very much 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.450
 today thank you
