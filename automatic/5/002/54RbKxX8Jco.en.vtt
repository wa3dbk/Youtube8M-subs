compass<00:00:12.550> built<00:00:12.700> in<00:00:12.910> and<00:00:13.120> let's<00:00:13.270> just<00:00:13.420> have<00:00:13.510> a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
compass built in and let's just have a

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.970 
compass built in and let's just have a
look<00:00:13.690> at<00:00:13.750> what<00:00:13.840> this<00:00:13.930> enables<00:00:14.260> you<00:00:14.320> to<00:00:14.380> do<00:00:14.530> so

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
look at what this enables you to do so

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.289 
look at what this enables you to do so
the<00:00:15.130> first<00:00:15.250> thing<00:00:15.430> we're<00:00:15.519> gonna<00:00:15.580> do<00:00:15.820> is<00:00:16.029> tell

the first thing we're gonna do is tell

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.640 
the first thing we're gonna do is tell
the<00:00:16.420> phone<00:00:16.600> to<00:00:16.689> find<00:00:16.840> out<00:00:17.079> where<00:00:17.349> we<00:00:17.470> are

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
the phone to find out where we are

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.909 
the phone to find out where we are
so<00:00:18.220> Dan<00:00:18.519> just<00:00:18.759> pressures<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:19.779> zero<00:00:20.589> button

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
so Dan just pressures this zero button

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.679 
so Dan just pressures this zero button
here<00:00:21.099> and<00:00:21.189> as<00:00:21.249> you<00:00:21.339> can<00:00:21.490> see<00:00:21.730> in<00:00:22.029> on<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.300> map<00:00:22.509> on

here and as you can see in on the map on
the<00:00:22.810> phone<00:00:22.990> screen<00:00:23.439> we're<00:00:23.949> getting<00:00:24.159> a<00:00:24.220> little

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
the phone screen we're getting a little

the phone screen we're getting a little
red<00:00:24.609> dot<00:00:24.640> pop<00:00:25.390> up<00:00:25.599> now<00:00:26.019> the<00:00:26.380> magic<00:00:26.710> is<00:00:26.829> that

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
red dot pop up now the magic is that

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.540 
red dot pop up now the magic is that
went<00:00:27.159> down<00:00:27.310> moves<00:00:27.669> his<00:00:28.119> hand<00:00:28.419> around<00:00:29.399> you<00:00:30.399> can

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
went down moves his hand around you can

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.660 
went down moves his hand around you can
begin<00:00:30.789> to<00:00:30.999> see<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.779> screen<00:00:32.140> change<00:00:32.670> depending

begin to see the screen change depending
on<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:33.940> orientation<00:00:34.090> of<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.630> phone<00:00:35.220> so<00:00:36.220> here

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
on the orientation of the phone so here

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.590 
on the orientation of the phone so here
we<00:00:36.430> can<00:00:36.580> see<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.850> San<00:00:37.000> Francisco<00:00:37.390> Bay<00:00:37.570> Area

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
and just alongside that is the location

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.730 
and just alongside that is the location

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
is now Dan show us how this looks in

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.720 
is now Dan show us how this looks in
Satellite<00:00:44.710> merged<00:00:45.310> so<00:00:45.460> that's<00:00:45.610> obviously

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
Satellite merged so that's obviously

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.020 
Satellite merged so that's obviously
looking<00:00:46.270> at<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.680> image<00:00:47.920> as<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.100> map<00:00:48.370> if<00:00:48.700> then

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
looking at the image as a map if then

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.360 
looking at the image as a map if then
changes<00:00:49.810> the<00:00:49.960> mode<00:00:50.170> so<00:00:50.740> you<00:00:50.800> can<00:00:50.920> see<00:00:50.950> here<00:00:51.280> we

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
changes the mode so you can see here we

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.580 
changes the mode so you can see here we
can<00:00:51.400> choose<00:00:51.670> satellite<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:52.570> then<00:00:53.230> what<00:00:53.440> we'll

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
can choose satellite and then what we'll

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.190 
can choose satellite and then what we'll
have<00:00:53.830> is<00:00:54.130> a<00:00:54.190> photograph<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.270> area<00:00:55.600> that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
have is a photograph of the area that

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.840 
have is a photograph of the area that
come<00:00:56.470> up<00:00:56.590> it's<00:00:56.770> just<00:00:56.980> loading<00:00:57.370> it's<00:00:57.700> just

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
come up it's just loading it's just

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.160 
come up it's just loading it's just
going<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.000> load<00:00:58.180> now<00:00:58.360> you<00:00:58.420> can<00:00:58.660> see<00:00:58.810> this<00:00:58.930> area

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
going to load now you can see this area

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.680 
going to load now you can see this area
on<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.470> left<00:00:59.680> is<00:01:00.070> San<00:01:00.340> Francisco<00:01:00.760> Bay<00:01:00.970> and<00:01:01.270> as

on the left is San Francisco Bay and as

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.180 
on the left is San Francisco Bay and as
he<00:01:01.810> zooms<00:01:02.050> in<00:01:02.290> even<00:01:03.190> further<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:05.650> can<00:01:05.770> see<00:01:06.010> the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
he zooms in even further we can see the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.430 
he zooms in even further we can see the
exact<00:01:06.550> location<00:01:07.180> which<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.510> just<00:01:07.690> Red<00:01:07.960> Sea

application<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:14.170> this<00:01:14.380> technology<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:15.159> going

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
application of this technology is going

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.640 
application of this technology is going
to<00:01:15.640> be<00:01:15.790> when<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:16.060> create<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.390> hybrid<00:01:16.720> image<00:01:17.500> now

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
to be when you create a hybrid image now

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.990 
to be when you create a hybrid image now
that<00:01:17.800> is<00:01:17.890> going<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.100> show<00:01:18.310> us<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.670> street

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
that is going to show us the street

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.760 
that is going to show us the street
names<00:01:19.240> alongside<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:22.140> photo<00:01:23.140> images<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.680> we

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
names alongside the photo images that we

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.620 
names alongside the photo images that we
can<00:01:23.920> see<00:01:24.100> from<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.520> satellite<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:25.270> as<00:01:25.510> he

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
can see from the satellite so as he

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.600 
can see from the satellite so as he
zooms<00:01:25.840> in<00:01:26.020> again<00:01:26.229> now<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.070> see<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.400> phone

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
zooms in again now you can see the phone

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.120 
zooms in again now you can see the phone
pull<00:01:30.940> up<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.180> street<00:01:31.450> names<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.950> give

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
pull up the street names and then give

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.500 
pull up the street names and then give
us<00:01:33.220> an<00:01:33.310> idea<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.670> kind<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:33.970> application

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
us an idea of the kind of application

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.450 
us an idea of the kind of application
that<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.690> can<00:01:34.720> see<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.170> working<00:01:35.890> for<00:01:36.250> you're
