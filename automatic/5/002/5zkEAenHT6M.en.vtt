00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and since we're talking about care 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.000
 the environment and search for 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.950
 sustainability 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 today we will show the second part of 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 agroecological garden series 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.500
 you will learn how to maintain a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.719
 beautiful and healthy production 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 looking at different beds 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.880
 of the calls plants vegetables 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.560
 companions and spontaneous plants are 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.529
 very important and have 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:35.370
 Essential side by side one ends up 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:38.129
 protecting the other in agroecology 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.340
 diversification of natural and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.649
 cultivated is a point of balance is 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.980
 need to know the characteristics of 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.430
 each one to know how to grow the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.579
 in the same area for example the cultivation of 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.969
 companion plants is welcome since 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 one ends up protecting the other 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.409
 we have here for example two cultures 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.760
 two species of very distinct families 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.330
 the beet and lettuce the consortium he 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.010
 benefits both cultures 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.060
 insect attacking for example 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.330
 the beet 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.909
 he is not he does not attack lettuce so a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.290
 plant is a companion to another plant 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.439
 protects the other 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.110
 addition to this advantage given the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.430
 libido from the attack of certain insects 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.659
 also the cultural consortium is 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.640
 enjoy the advantage of cultures 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.250
 better the nutrients in the soil because 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.009
 explore different layers of soil 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.829
 different depths and another 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.619
 advantage of the reconciliation of cultures is 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.570
 which provides a higher yield per 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.000
 unit area 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.060
 other important care in the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.899
 agroecological production is the rotation of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.969
 vegetable crops of the same family 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.659
 should never be planted 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.610
 on the same site 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.640
 here we have, for example, the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.240
 carrots in the next crop of vegetables 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.220
 we hypothesis some 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.560
 we can enter with a culture of 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.370
 same carrot family citing a 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.090
 example to seasonings handle the mandioquinha 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.070
 salsa are from the same carrot family we 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.110
 we can not continue in the next cycle 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.700
 so we have to go to other 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.010
 other crops such as 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.180
 cabbage that a family totally 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.660
 different 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.610
 the very culture of lettuce and beet 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.360
 so they are different cultures and this is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.900
 important to break the cycle of 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.320
 mainly fungi of soil is 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.900
 so we set out for another 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.360
 family we will be decreasing the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.430
 incidence of certain attacks 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.500
 certain diseases, and so and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.180
 species of insects that caused 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:07.910
 some losses for the production of 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:10.850
 vegetables in an agro-ecological garden 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.860
 important to maintain such an environment. 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.739
 diversified with cultivated plants and 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.260
 others that are born spontaneously and that 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.450
 a lot of people call it incense 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.310
 but here they also have value 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.739
 normally there is a production 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.190
 of agro-ecological vegetables 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.430
 people care and how to do 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.610
 to handle calls in your 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.430
 which we call spontaneous plants 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.769
 Of course we learned from our parents and 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.350
 of our grandparents that a garden has to 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.600
 be all clean can not have the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.970
 presence of any type of weeds 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.530
 but within agroecology we have to 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.890
 change this concept 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.880
 why do these plants have 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.690
 important function is to protect the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.720
 is also in the management of 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.700
 certain insects because some insects 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.200
 which attacks our culture 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.760
 he has a food here on this plant 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.830
 spontaneous or as it is known 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.900
 so instead of attacking the 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.630
 culture it attacks our plant 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.370
 then it is important to 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.250
 presence of these plants in a given 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.130
 moment of culture a vegetable garden 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.290
 does not only offer 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.080
 healthy and nutritious vegetables but 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.410
 also does not pollute the environment and 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.060
 protects the life of plants and animals 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:46.620
 and who produces these foods in addition to 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.419
 external appearance they have a value is 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.389
 higher than the conventional product 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.610
 they have more vitamins and minerals 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.620
 that conventional products 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.560
 that we have several jobs in 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.229
 that demonstrate this because 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.039
 these plants are grown 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:08.800
 is with organic fertilization and they have 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.530
 normal growth the cycle is not 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.850
 accelerated when such as the use 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.460
 of chemicals such as fertilizers 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.440
 fertilizers then we have 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.210
 more dry matter 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.340
 in these foods that naturally they 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.740
 will have more vitamins and minerals 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.729
 then it is our consumer when she 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.729
 go to the fair free 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.610
 the search for an organic product is 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.160
 motivated usually because he thinks 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.470
 which is a waste free product 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.270
 chemical and actually he's right he 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.220
 no chemical waste 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.930
 But that's not all. 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.240
 buying a superior quality 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.570
 or a food with more vitamins and 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.570
 mineral salts 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.560
 after that step by step is until 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.600
 easy to grow an agro-ecological garden 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.180
 it's worth taking the test and experimenting 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.400
 the organic crop and of course if they appear 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.580
 the doubts consult the epagri of your 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.580
 County
