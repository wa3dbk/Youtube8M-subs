00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.679 
just add a few pieces of tinfoil to fill
up<00:02:05.770> any<00:02:05.950> extra<00:02:06.310> space<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:07.239> glue<00:02:07.450> another

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
up any extra space and I glue another

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:18.210 
up any extra space and I glue another
nickel<00:02:07.989> to<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.319> top<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.590> see<00:02:17.769> when<00:02:18.069> we

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
nickel to the top you can see when we

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.650 
nickel to the top you can see when we
measure<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.519> voltage<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.150> comes<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:19.510> and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
measure the voltage it comes in and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.509 
measure the voltage it comes in and
around<00:02:19.810> six<00:02:20.079> volts<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.980> should<00:02:21.220> be<00:02:21.310> enough

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
around six volts that should be enough

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.570 
around six volts that should be enough
to<00:02:21.640> light<00:02:21.790> up<00:02:21.910> an<00:02:22.030> LED

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.940 

okay<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:48.720> next<00:02:48.930> method<00:02:49.140> you're<00:02:49.739> gonna

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
okay for this next method you're gonna

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.620 
okay for this next method you're gonna
need<00:02:50.130> some<00:02:50.310> citrus<00:02:50.670> fruit<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.209> some<00:02:51.540> more

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
need some citrus fruit and some more

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.500 
need some citrus fruit and some more
pennies<00:02:52.069> this<00:02:53.069> time<00:02:53.310> send<00:02:53.640> out<00:02:53.790> both<00:02:54.000> sides<00:02:54.330> of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
pennies this time send out both sides of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.940 
pennies this time send out both sides of
one<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> pennies<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.590> you're<00:02:55.709> left<00:02:55.830> with

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
one of the pennies so you're left with

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.180 
one of the pennies so you're left with
pure<00:02:56.280> zinc<00:02:56.310> metal<00:02:57.140> then<00:02:58.140> cut<00:02:58.650> two<00:02:58.800> slits<00:02:59.010> in

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
pure zinc metal then cut two slits in

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.860 
pure zinc metal then cut two slits in
the<00:02:59.280> fruit<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.670> put<00:03:00.060> our<00:03:00.209> normal<00:03:00.510> penny<00:03:00.690> in

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
the fruit and put our normal penny in

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.460 
the fruit and put our normal penny in
one<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.860> sanded<00:03:02.220> penny<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.730> other

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.600 

when<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:07.620> measure<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:08.040> with<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.370> voltmeter

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
when we measure this with the voltmeter

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.150 
when we measure this with the voltmeter
it<00:03:09.150> comes<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.540> around<00:03:09.900> half<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> bowl<00:03:13.069> for<00:03:14.069> this

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
it comes in around half a bowl for this

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.800 
it comes in around half a bowl for this
final<00:03:14.519> method<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:15.000> grab<00:03:15.180> some<00:03:15.390> salt<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
final method just grab some salt and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.130 
final method just grab some salt and
water<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:16.590> mix<00:03:16.739> them<00:03:16.920> together<00:03:18.140> now

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
water and then mix them together now

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.750 
water and then mix them together now
grab<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.470> penny<00:03:19.860> that's<00:03:20.069> sanded<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:20.550> those

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
grab that penny that's sanded on those

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.090 
grab that penny that's sanded on those
sides<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.480> normal<00:03:21.750> penny<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.620> dip<00:03:22.920> them

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
sides and a normal penny and dip them

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.580 
sides and a normal penny and dip them
partway<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.640> mixture<00:03:24.140> as<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.319> can<00:03:25.440> see

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
partway in the mixture as you can see

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.229 
partway in the mixture as you can see
this<00:03:25.830> also<00:03:26.069> gives<00:03:26.400> off<00:03:26.549> some<00:03:26.700> voltage<00:03:29.239> instead

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
this also gives off some voltage instead

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.120 
this also gives off some voltage instead
of<00:03:30.330> saltwater<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.200> can<00:03:31.350> also<00:03:31.470> use<00:03:31.739> coca-cola

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
of saltwater you can also use coca-cola

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.750 
of saltwater you can also use coca-cola
or<00:03:32.730> anything<00:03:33.120> else<00:03:33.360> that<00:03:33.480> contains<00:03:33.900> acid<00:03:34.760> if

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
or anything else that contains acid if
