00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.849
 and hi the friends is Savoyard farming 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.949
 how are you going to end up 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.899
 today still for a little tutorial 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.850
 you simply know how 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.100
 that on the channel I had everything 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.000
 just a new banner so I 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.620
 will just show you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.550
 how I realized this banner 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.269
 free with the sidp enzo ide 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.399
 android.com you type on google 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.220
 android points like and it was happening to you 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.309
 so on 7 on this site there you press 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.140
 on all you press bach gander 3 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.780
 and you have the opportunity all 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.439
 simply create your banner 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.420
 Youtube 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:02.189
 so it's simple you use a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.570
 template or not huh so there me never 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.400
 simply used this one where 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.270
 I may have recognized that but 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.070
 you have the opportunity to choose 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.790
 others there is no problem is to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.950
 burberry 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.360
 left that parade you can leave 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.220
 also of a white background there is no 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.720
 worry I will do as if I were doing 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.370
 mine simply we will go 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.860
 on basic then there you have the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.990
 opportunity to make a banner 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.300
 youtube be an avatar channel or a 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.810
 only mail is from twitter on facebook 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.010
 etc etc etc 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.870
 in the best number one you go 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.990
 choose in fact the color of the pallets 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.920
 of your your base so I'm going to do 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.780
 as if we did not do mine 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.520
 I had chosen yellow simply 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.790
 hop we stayed on the colors become 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.460
 which were the original colors of the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.229
 chain hop we'll go on glass but 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.810
 at john deere anyway that's after 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.850
 like that here you simply know 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.410
 press here hold back and wright and 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.880
 it will scroll you here in 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.979
 pressing by supporting his offered of 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.050
 nets a little bit all the all 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.759
 shapes as possible and unimaginable you 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.290
 have simply supported the 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.780
 when you want 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.610
 when that's when you like it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.259
 is about google just go to that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.190
 do a little too much we'll try some 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.590
 not so ugly thing 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.660
 I had come across something 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.100
 a priori not too bad anyway 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.500
 I liked it that's the principle to 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.980
 the test is not too bad on the lay 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.360
 in number 2 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.129
 soldiers say what to return 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.720
 here I have not done we will put a background 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.530
 White 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.570
 the most practical here is on the best 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.860
 number two then you can that of 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.140
 images etc 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.030
 I was not too far in there I am 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.530
 familiar look that the channel 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.230
 shadows think that shadow is 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.000
 normally the translation is the shadow 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.769
 I have not been further so here is bottom 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.599
 line r you see it looked like it cost 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.269
 in quotation marks it's a gradient on 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.299
 down here it makes you a gradient between 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.650
 quotes a little rounded and here it 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.090
 you do one of the ranks simply in 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.650
 the angles go together to put 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.290
 anything but I'm safer and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.360
 messaoud not on the come here so 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.680
 number one sprite actually is the text 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.450
 that you have here panzo reid 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.620
 then me simply for the form 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.260
 among Savoyard no more complicated than that 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.090
 here 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.360
 choose below 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.610
 the basic character font here 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.520
 and then you have the roofs because the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.740
 color 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.350
 the choice here is to become the size 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.830
 years centers and you have the choice of 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.810
 put or not shade 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.820
 I think to remove a number not 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.440
 seems he may be milbourne 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.090
 so here you are quiet 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.530
 then you can do 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.020
 add a second text 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.680
 so as you can see on my 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.090
 chain to me 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.660
 so here I put like this we go here m 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.860
 simulation do the same thing 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.480
 simulation and gaming here is impeccable 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.550
 you also choose the font from 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.330
 characters then I enjoy immunity 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.330
 hotter as 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.489
 except for example why not two 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.489
 ok and we also see the same 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.780
 without that so you normally go 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.890
 find here behind that we're going to see ourselves 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.950
 put in black colors 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.950
 this wood on our do too much 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.130
 color up punished us if you put some 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.389
 black you go there if you put ok not 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.579
 more complicated than that look 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.840
 simulation is cured 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.240
 see 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.310
 then I have today 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.199
 a partnership anyway and demonic 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.330
 when I put the little advertisement in 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.770
 top right and then with affine 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.180
 he simply asked me to do 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.320
 to appear things assures my banner 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.730
 once you're done 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.950
 it's something that leads you 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.290
 you simply do here in our 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.390
 life in background you do download 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.750
 and it's not more complicated than that 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.120
 three seconds you have your banner 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.540
 here's up to download them you can 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.580
 to close 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.900
 you close and if it does you 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.610
 please do not you of course stay this 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.930
 page there and you can change bring 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.450
 changes and save a 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.350
 two three four five six banners and 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.270
 then you will choose everything 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.220
 just the one that suits you 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.020
