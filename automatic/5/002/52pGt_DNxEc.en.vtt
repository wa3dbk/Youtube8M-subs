00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.359

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.679

 not always owned for the year does not exist 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.129
 and I think that Christmas began to see 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.170
 bad depression when you 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.260
 discovered that Santa did not exist 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.019
 because it's because when you were there that the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.010
 queen so will you write those 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.800

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.070
 eat to understand but writes asking 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.070

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:11.049
 that's where your parents came from and it's not something 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.670
 how did you find out that dad does not exist 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.130
 This is over because the time you 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.549
 ask your parents we will not stick with a 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.470
 washcloth you do that by creating the 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.710
 box bank that had decoration of 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.600

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.800
 that he is from the demanding plan that goes 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.409
 You got over it and now you're calm. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.150

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:40.030

 all the logics have a Christmas song 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.930
 I think it's very depressing but I like it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.430
 of the climate around the profile of the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.160
 15 christmas and a good jingle bell rezinha 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.920
 The music she sold on you goes in there. 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:50.580
 Where is the question you want? 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.090
 Yes, I do want the whole store but 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.090
 I do not have money 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.970

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.550

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.410
 food could be normal but not 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.270
 It can not be normal. 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.630
 She has to get along with something. 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.430
 because the food has to be like you 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.030
 it seems that a lot of people have to do 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.250
 kind of a lot of food and there is not much 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.340

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.040
