00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 And what hello to you all if you already 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.620
 You know I do not say things long ago 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.240
 you know that I always repeat it only 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.070
 two weeks are missing and since I already do 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.570
 I'll start uploading videos that you have 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.610
 seen that I have activated a kind of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 stop to put my channel fund and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.029
 all that but how good to be a video 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 minecraft not know if you remember ago 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.529
 some time I went up a kind of video 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.689
 with constructions and this time it's going to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.699
 have the anguish that we have is a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.019
 kind of temple you do not remember but 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.269
 in the last video also a temple 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.009
 let's see what happens here this 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.350
 construction is quite simple 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.270
 consists of tuba sitting in a temple not 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.950
 so quiet you see there in the back a chest 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.980
 with many diamonds you will see that there 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.190
 many diamonds are not good days 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.960
 I'm going global I do not fowl it and what's up 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.430
 when you see it, that guns come out 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 button sides pull you and then it's 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.539
 impossible to get out the next trap that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.969
 we have to trap us the excuse is a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.559
 lift elevator with pistons with 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.390
 plates with lots of things but that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.340
 it works quite well now you are going to see 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.170
 that we are going to approach 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.430
 to be a little bit like these plates and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.210
 you are going to see how they are going to go up 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.710
 up with a pretty high speed 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.390
 elevated 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.710
 and what else to say about this one of this 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.180
 construction is quite simple if 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.630
 you want after studying explain 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.659
 how they do the following is a code 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 it's a kind of machine a kind of 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.280
 construction that what it does is catch 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.420
 Stand by know that we are going 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 we give a button I know you can 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.960
 perfect much more I know it is very 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.119
 simple all the lessons that I am going to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.759
 teaching today are simple but I had 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.149
 eager to upload something entertaining voucher 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.560
 because as I have not played games either 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.850
 since I went to pc will not play either 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.190
 play does not even make sense like 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.800
 two months telling us and that's why 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.420
 same I asked a friend my brother already 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.039
 a friend that I made is some 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.750
 constructions and here I have the 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.670
 I'm going to present and later on comets 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.440
 my uncles like it we're going to see the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.780
 next construction that you are going to see is 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.210
 pretty cool this construction with a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.590
 trap that is invisible to baixa because 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.590
 because what we are going to do is 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.670
 get into this kind of tunnel and go 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 at the moment that we are going to go through a 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.030
 site that nobody knows how that after me 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.100
 yes that explains in the next video 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.869
 that a trap is activated and we fall and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.890
 we moved is similar to the temple but a 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.350
 little different 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.360
 this is very simple that I know that a lot 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.190
 people know how to do but we wanted to 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.230
 teach now because for example I'm cool 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.810
 a lot because you give him and I started shooting 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.940
 and to shoot and do not get tired you know until 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.650
 that have chips to shoot this me 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.720
 I like it a lot and that's why I want to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.170
 upload this is my part worth 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.270
 we like it and the next and last one 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.670
 you all know do not say nobody 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.070
 know how to make it a catapult is a 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.739
 cannon better said we activated it and what 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.170
 does we have the c4 back it explodes and we 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.730
 shoot the cava this is simple I do not think 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.820
 that nobody has we can do it and I do not know 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.650
 if we have taught alone and they are already here 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.780
 last to the one before the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.220
 last excuse this here works 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.080
 the following way we have a 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.720
 disc we put the music box and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.880
 he only knows a back door after 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.680
 that we've federally released the cd and 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.600
 we put another one back and so 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.410
 successively 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.410
 and nothing more 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.730
 today
