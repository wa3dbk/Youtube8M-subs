 despite being a drawing games 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.879
 There are horrible things that occur 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.350
 to play 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.599
 do not do this at school or anywhere 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.759
 and ask it is then your parents or me 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.420
