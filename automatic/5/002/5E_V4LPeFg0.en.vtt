00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.330
 recording 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.740
 best 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.740
 you have to talk to over there 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.610
 as well as that of leo 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.210
 so wait for them to be fulfilled so that 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.210
 we can 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.559
 as in this concentration 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.110
 yes 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 do not 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 he is also talking 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.790
 we take one of those spatulas 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.790
 what's that fable called 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.330
 you can find 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:21.080
 in which it closes and thanks to our 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.080
 friends of the obvious 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.130
 two 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.940
 we look carefully 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.940
 in the other cities 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.760
 that's what we were doing making cigarettes 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.439
 and we are pulling 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.439
 to that wave 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.670
 and we are shooting more beautiful 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.530
 for practice 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.090
 the firmer face 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.340
 t 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.670
 excellent now you take it out all the love 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670
 of the world 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.220
 carefully 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.720
 it is cleaned to the transferable obviously 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.720
 I could win great relief 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.500
 at a level 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.370
 but things we can do on TV 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.370
 listen to children 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.890
 of the night 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.599
 it's a cigar 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.599
 why citizens 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.090
 the appetite 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:19.260
 that no longer serves the same serves to 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.260
 decorating it today is no longer useful 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.670
 already 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.000
 let's continue it's wrong, there's only one that 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.810
 put it there because you have to wait 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.810
 schalke in innovations 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.209
 well she wanted to do something and social to 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.209
 best 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.370
 the chocolate curls are called that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.370
 he 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.030
 Biscuit 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.560
 I already saw it 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.680
 that can not be opened because if you do not 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:03.670
 What's that name, Miss Karla? 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:07.170
 with the dessert, lower the moon and that little dot 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.170
 black that has some balls 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.360
 I do not have to make another cigar 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.360
 and this is going to go up
