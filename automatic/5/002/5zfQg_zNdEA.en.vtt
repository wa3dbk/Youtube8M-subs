we're<00:00:41.870> going<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.020> need<00:00:42.170> two<00:00:42.380> characters<00:00:42.950> as

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
we're going to need two characters as

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.040 
we're going to need two characters as
well<00:00:43.190> currently<00:00:43.670> we<00:00:43.880> have<00:00:44.000> one<00:00:44.329> character<00:00:44.870> and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
well currently we have one character and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.110 
well currently we have one character and
in<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.200> multiplayer<00:00:45.649> game<00:00:45.890> if<00:00:46.550> both<00:00:46.880> players

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
in a multiplayer game if both players

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.180 
in a multiplayer game if both players
have<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.570> character<00:00:48.200> that<00:00:48.230> looks<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.770> same<00:00:48.980> it

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
have a character that looks the same it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.740 
have a character that looks the same it
can<00:00:49.340> be<00:00:49.460> difficult<00:00:49.670> for<00:00:50.180> them<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.329> tell<00:00:50.630> the

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
can be difficult for them to tell the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.319 
can be difficult for them to tell the
character<00:00:51.200> apart<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.910> way<00:00:53.030> we're<00:00:53.210> going

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
character apart so the way we're going

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.180 
character apart so the way we're going
to<00:00:53.390> create<00:00:53.600> our<00:00:53.780> second<00:00:54.230> character<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.920> we're

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
to create our second character is we're

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.889 
to create our second character is we're
simply<00:00:55.550> going<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.790> take<00:00:56.090> our<00:00:56.300> existing

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
simply going to take our existing

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.510 
simply going to take our existing
construction<00:00:57.110> worker<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.190> we're<00:00:58.309> going<00:00:58.430> to

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
construction worker and we're going to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.430 
construction worker and we're going to
remove<00:00:58.790> his<00:00:59.030> construction<00:00:59.600> hat<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.290> we'll

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
remove his construction hat so we'll

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.049 
remove his construction hat so we'll
have<00:01:00.590> our<00:01:00.710> construction<00:01:01.340> worker<00:01:01.550> with<00:01:01.879> his

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
have our construction worker with his

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.880 
have our construction worker with his
hat<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.570> we'll<00:01:03.050> have<00:01:03.110> our<00:01:03.289> construction

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
hat and we'll have our construction

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.679 
hat and we'll have our construction
worker<00:01:04.100> without<00:01:04.489> his<00:01:04.670> hat<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.089> that's<00:01:05.149> how

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
worker without his hat and that's how

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.630 
worker without his hat and that's how
our<00:01:05.840> players<00:01:06.140> are<00:01:06.380> going<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.619> determine<00:01:06.950> which

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
our players are going to determine which

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.820 
our players are going to determine which
player<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.329> them<00:01:08.540> in<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.080> game<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:09.560> they<00:01:09.680> can

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
player is them in the game so they can

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.399 
player is them in the game so they can
recognize<00:01:10.430> their<00:01:10.729> main<00:01:11.000> character<00:01:11.659> to<00:01:12.320> do

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
recognize their main character to do

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.039 
recognize their main character to do
that<00:01:12.590> let's<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.070> quickly<00:01:13.250> grab<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.909> mesh<00:01:14.150> we

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
that let's just quickly grab the mesh we

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.649 
that let's just quickly grab the mesh we
can<00:01:15.200> do<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.470> by<00:01:15.650> selecting<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.400> prefab<00:01:17.000> then

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
can do that by selecting the prefab then

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.280 
can do that by selecting the prefab then
coming<00:01:18.020> down<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.409> selecting<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.190> controller

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
coming down and selecting the controller

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.860 
coming down and selecting the controller
and<00:01:21.410> down<00:01:22.160> here<00:01:22.520> inside<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.970> sources<00:01:23.570> will

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
and down here inside the sources will

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.180 
and down here inside the sources will
find<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.290> mesh

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
find the mesh

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.400 
find the mesh
now<00:01:26.880> I've<00:01:27.060> already<00:01:27.210> taken<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.780> time<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.230> make

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
now I've already taken the time to make

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.530 
now I've already taken the time to make
a<00:01:28.440> second<00:01:28.950> one<00:01:29.070> which<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.370> no<00:01:29.700> hat<00:01:29.940> if<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a second one which is no hat if we just

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.690 
a second one which is no hat if we just
quickly<00:01:30.780> open<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.429 

and<00:01:33.789> see<00:01:33.939> that<00:01:34.119> I<00:01:34.149> removed<00:01:34.570> his<00:01:34.780> hat<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.289> way<00:01:35.409> I

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
and see that I removed his hat the way I

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.050 
and see that I removed his hat the way I
did<00:01:35.590> that<00:01:35.920> was<00:01:36.219> just<00:01:36.460> by<00:01:36.579> making<00:01:36.759> this

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
did that was just by making this

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.300 
did that was just by making this
character<00:01:37.600> editable<00:01:38.189> selecting<00:01:39.189> the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
character editable selecting the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.140 
character editable selecting the
vertices<00:01:39.640> in<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.119> Hat<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:40.539> deleting<00:01:41.229> them

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
vertices in the Hat and deleting them

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.760 
vertices in the Hat and deleting them
so<00:01:43.540> now<00:01:43.660> we<00:01:43.720> can<00:01:43.930> take<00:01:44.110> this<00:01:44.290> third-person

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
so now we can take this third-person

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.410 
so now we can take this third-person
controller<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.730> we<00:01:45.820> can<00:01:45.970> make<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.150> duplicate

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
controller and we can make a duplicate

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.410 
controller and we can make a duplicate
of<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:48.010> we<00:01:48.580> can<00:01:48.700> call<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.030> third-person

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
of it and we can call it third-person

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.540 
of it and we can call it third-person
controller<00:01:49.990> no<00:01:50.230> hat

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
controller no hat

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.250 
controller no hat
let's<00:01:52.210> make<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.420> visible<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.050> scene<00:01:53.230> just

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
let's make it visible in the scene just

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.810 
let's make it visible in the scene just
so<00:01:53.680> things<00:01:53.890> are<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.100> little<00:01:54.190> easier<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.670> work

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
so things are a little easier to work

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.910 
so things are a little easier to work
with<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.300> what<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.110> want<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.380> do<00:01:56.470> is<00:01:56.620> drill

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
with and what we want to do is drill

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.740 
with and what we want to do is drill
down<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.370> here<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.730> find<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.030> mash<00:01:58.270> which<00:01:58.600> is

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
down in here and find the mash which is

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.560 
down in here and find the mash which is
on<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:58.990> pelvis<00:01:59.440> this<00:01:59.800> is<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.100> mesh<00:02:00.310> here<00:02:00.730> and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
on the pelvis this is the mesh here and

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.150 
on the pelvis this is the mesh here and
we're<00:02:01.690> going<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.870> take<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.260> mash<00:02:02.620> the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
we're going to take this mash the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.830 
we're going to take this mash the
construction<00:02:03.730> working<00:02:04.030> without<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.300> hat<00:02:04.600> and

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
construction working without a hat and

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.140 
construction working without a hat and
put<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.500> there<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:06.700> if<00:02:06.850> we<00:02:06.910> take<00:02:07.000> a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
put that in there now if we take a

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.330 
put that in there now if we take a
closer<00:02:07.450> look<00:02:07.630> at<00:02:07.930> this<00:02:08.050> character<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:09.160> can

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
closer look at this character you can

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.140 
closer look at this character you can
see<00:02:09.960> we<00:02:10.960> have<00:02:10.990> our<00:02:11.140> construction<00:02:11.890> worker

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
see we have our construction worker

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.800 
see we have our construction worker
without<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> hat

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
without a hat

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.540 
without a hat
so<00:02:15.410> I'm<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.860> rearrange<00:02:16.130> these

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
so I'm just going to rearrange these

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.190 
so I'm just going to rearrange these
prefabs<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.300> little<00:02:17.540> bit<00:02:17.690> i'm<00:02:17.870> going<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.080> move

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
prefabs a little bit i'm going to move

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.660 
prefabs a little bit i'm going to move
them<00:02:18.319> up<00:02:18.410> with<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.709> other<00:02:18.920> profile<00:02:19.489> i'm

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
them up with this other profile i'm

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.350 
them up with this other profile i'm
going<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:19.970> create<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.239> new<00:02:20.420> folder<00:02:20.660> in<00:02:21.020> here

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
going to create a new folder in here

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.160 
going to create a new folder in here
and<00:02:22.630> I'm<00:02:23.050> going<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.260> call<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.470> main<00:02:23.710> characters

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
and I'm going to call it main characters

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.839 
and I'm going to call it main characters
and<00:02:26.770> I'm<00:02:26.890> going<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.069> take<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.400> existing

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
and I'm going to take the existing

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.900 
and I'm going to take the existing
prefab<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.630> drag<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.050> up<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.319> there

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
prefab and drag it up in there

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.460 
prefab and drag it up in there
and<00:02:31.030> now<00:02:31.390> I'm<00:02:31.540> going<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> take<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.080> new<00:02:32.290> one

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
and now I'm going to take this new one

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.950 
and now I'm going to take this new one
that<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:32.710> created<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:34.540> make<00:02:34.690> another

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
that we just created to make another

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.230 
that we just created to make another
prefab<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:36.160> by<00:02:36.280> dragging<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.850> into<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
prefab just by dragging it into the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.320 
prefab just by dragging it into the
folder<00:02:37.600> from<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.810> hierarchy<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.820> that<00:02:40.150> gives

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
folder from the hierarchy so that gives

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.270 
folder from the hierarchy so that gives
us<00:02:40.480> our<00:02:40.660> two<00:02:40.840> characters<00:02:41.380> now<00:02:41.830> we<00:02:41.890> don't<00:02:42.070> need

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
us our two characters now we don't need

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.590 
us our two characters now we don't need
that<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.610> hierarchy<00:02:42.820> anymore<00:02:43.450> they<00:02:43.570> don't

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
that in the hierarchy anymore they don't

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.730 
that in the hierarchy anymore they don't
need<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.990> be<00:02:44.140> here<00:02:44.170> we're<00:02:44.530> going<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
need to be here we're going to

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.070 
need to be here we're going to
instantiate<00:02:45.100> them<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.540> long<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.960> the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
instantiate them so so long to the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.530 
instantiate them so so long to the
static<00:02:47.500> versions<00:02:47.980> now<00:02:48.880> how<00:02:49.120> are<00:02:49.240> we<00:02:49.300> going<00:02:49.450> to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
static versions now how are we going to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.120 
static versions now how are we going to
instantiate<00:02:49.810> them<00:02:50.350> well<00:02:50.530> we<00:02:50.650> need<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.920> create

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
instantiate them well we need to create

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.430 
instantiate them well we need to create
some<00:02:51.490> spawn<00:02:51.820> points<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:52.660> let's<00:02:52.990> start<00:02:53.260> the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
some spawn points so let's start the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.140 
some spawn points so let's start the
three<00:02:53.710> new<00:02:53.830> game<00:02:54.070> objects

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.369 

the<00:02:57.209> first<00:02:57.420> one<00:02:57.599> we're<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.900> call<00:02:58.049> spawn

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
the first one we're going to call spawn

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.280 
the first one we're going to call spawn
points

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.600 

second<00:03:01.650> one<00:03:01.769> will<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:01.950> player<00:03:02.280> one

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.050 

and<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.300> third<00:03:06.540> one<00:03:06.750> will<00:03:06.900> be<00:03:06.930> player<00:03:07.260> 2

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.850 

now<00:03:11.630> we're<00:03:11.810> going<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.959> position<00:03:12.140> these<00:03:12.530> spawn

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
now we're going to position these spawn

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.350 
now we're going to position these spawn
points<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.489> scene<00:03:13.700> but<00:03:13.880> before<00:03:14.150> we<00:03:14.239> do

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
points in the scene but before we do

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.820 
points in the scene but before we do
that<00:03:14.390> we're<00:03:14.720> going<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.900> apply<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.230> gizmo<00:03:15.800> to

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
that we're going to apply a gizmo to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.589 
that we're going to apply a gizmo to
them<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.310> we<00:03:16.400> can<00:03:16.580> drag<00:03:16.940> them<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.239> little<00:03:17.450> bit

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
them so we can drag them a little bit

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.300 
them so we can drag them a little bit
easier<00:03:17.810> just<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.530> little<00:03:18.680> red<00:03:18.920> gizmo

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
easier just a little red gizmo

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.339 
easier just a little red gizmo
alright<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.060> now<00:03:22.180> let's<00:03:22.390> take<00:03:22.540> player<00:03:22.840> one<00:03:23.110> and

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
alright so now let's take player one and

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.260 
alright so now let's take player one and
put<00:03:23.800> player<00:03:24.040> one<00:03:24.280> where<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.580> want<00:03:24.790> player<00:03:25.030> one

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
put player one where we want player one

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.390 
put player one where we want player one
to<00:03:25.420> spawn<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.050> scene<00:03:26.319> we'll<00:03:26.920> just<00:03:27.130> move<00:03:27.250> it

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
to spawn in the scene we'll just move it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.300 
to spawn in the scene we'll just move it
over<00:03:27.459> here<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.819> little<00:03:27.970> bit<00:03:28.709> maybe<00:03:29.709> drag<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.220> up

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
over here a little bit maybe drag it up

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.430 
over here a little bit maybe drag it up
a<00:03:30.459> bit<00:03:30.489> so<00:03:30.849> player<00:03:31.090> 1<00:03:31.330> will<00:03:31.480> sort<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.750> drop<00:03:32.050> into

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
a bit so player 1 will sort of drop into

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.240 
a bit so player 1 will sort of drop into
the<00:03:32.470> scene

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
the scene

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.910 
the scene
and<00:03:34.340> then<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.910> same<00:03:35.120> with<00:03:35.270> player<00:03:35.480> 2

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.740 

I<00:03:39.040> might<00:03:39.490> adjust<00:03:39.610> these<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.060> little<00:03:40.390> bit<00:03:40.510> later

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
I might adjust these a little bit later

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.930 
I might adjust these a little bit later
but<00:03:41.050> for<00:03:41.500> now<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:42.220> should<00:03:42.459> be<00:03:42.580> good<00:03:42.730> enough

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
but for now this should be good enough

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.699 
but for now this should be good enough
just<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.360> get<00:03:43.480> something<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.290> scene<00:03:44.530> that

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
just to get something in the scene that

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.570 
just to get something in the scene that
we<00:03:44.830> can<00:03:45.010> use<00:03:45.040> as<00:03:45.550> a<00:03:45.610> spawn<00:03:46.090> point<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.950> our<00:03:48.220> spawn

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
we can use as a spawn point so our spawn

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.220 
we can use as a spawn point so our spawn
points<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.060> going<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.330> need<00:03:49.450> some<00:03:49.510> kind<00:03:50.080> of

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
points is going to need some kind of

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.790 
points is going to need some kind of
behavior<00:03:50.800> so<00:03:51.430> let's<00:03:51.730> create<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.060> script<00:03:52.800> call

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
behavior so let's create a script call

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.500 
behavior so let's create a script call
it<00:03:53.920> spawn<00:03:54.220> points

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.220 

and<00:03:58.930> attach<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.680> game<00:03:59.860> object<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.989> now

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
and attach it to the game object and now

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.710 
and attach it to the game object and now
let's<00:04:02.439> edit<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:02.890> script

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
let's edit this script

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.510 
let's edit this script
ok<00:04:05.170> so<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.620> script<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.010> going<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.310> have<00:04:06.430> an

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
ok so this script is going to have an

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.460 
ok so this script is going to have an
array<00:04:06.820> of<00:04:06.850> spawn<00:04:07.270> points<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:07.990> it's<00:04:08.230> going<00:04:08.410> to

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
array of spawn points and it's going to

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.960 
array of spawn points and it's going to
get<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.800> array<00:04:09.100> by<00:04:09.370> looking<00:04:09.730> at<00:04:09.790> its

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
get that array by looking at its

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.420 
get that array by looking at its
children<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.630> populating<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.350> array<00:04:11.770> but

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
children and populating the array but

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.980 
children and populating the array but
the<00:04:12.550> first<00:04:12.760> thing<00:04:12.940> we<00:04:13.060> need<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.240> do<00:04:13.450> is<00:04:13.750> create

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
the first thing we need to do is create

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.940 
the first thing we need to do is create
the<00:04:14.290> array

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.130 

so<00:04:18.520> there<00:04:18.850> it<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.450> a<00:04:19.510> private<00:04:19.900> array

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
so there it is just a private array

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.590 
so there it is just a private array
where<00:04:20.380> we<00:04:20.470> could<00:04:20.650> store<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.160> spawn<00:04:21.400> points

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.480 

okay<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.530> we<00:04:26.650> have<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.920> array<00:04:27.100> of<00:04:27.130> spawn

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
okay so we have the array of spawn

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.050 
okay so we have the array of spawn
points

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
points

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.280 
points
now<00:04:29.419> we're<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:29.600> going<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.930> create<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.139> little

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
now we're just going to create a little

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.990 
now we're just going to create a little
piece<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.620> code<00:04:30.889> which<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:31.400> going<00:04:31.700> to<00:04:31.760> iterate

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
piece of code which is going to iterate

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.180 
piece of code which is going to iterate
over<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.840> children<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.590> spawn<00:04:33.860> point

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
over the children of the spawn point

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.250 
over the children of the spawn point
object<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.910> populate<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.630> array<00:04:35.900> with<00:04:36.139> the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
object and populate the array with the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.290 
object and populate the array with the
transform<00:04:36.950> so<00:04:37.160> it's<00:04:37.310> going<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.520> find<00:04:37.760> player<00:04:38.030> 1

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
transform so it's going to find player 1

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.330 
transform so it's going to find player 1
and<00:04:38.330> player<00:04:38.600> 2<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.380> put<00:04:39.860> them<00:04:40.010> into<00:04:40.160> this

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
and player 2 and put them into this

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.270 
and player 2 and put them into this
array

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.060 

a<00:04:45.340> very<00:04:45.790> simple<00:04:46.180> single<00:04:46.570> line<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.780> code

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.760 

so<00:04:50.670> we<00:04:50.850> created<00:04:51.240> two<00:04:51.570> player<00:04:51.840> prefabs<00:04:52.470> and

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
so we created two player prefabs and

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.960 
so we created two player prefabs and
we're<00:04:52.860> going<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.070> assign<00:04:53.370> those<00:04:53.640> player

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
we're going to assign those player

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.630 
we're going to assign those player
prefabs<00:04:54.750> as<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.350> players<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.980> spawn<00:04:56.280> at<00:04:56.520> the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
prefabs as the players to spawn at the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.390 
prefabs as the players to spawn at the
spawn<00:04:56.910> points<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:58.710> we're<00:04:58.860> going<00:04:58.950> to<00:04:59.040> create<00:04:59.310> an

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
spawn points so we're going to create an

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.119 
spawn points so we're going to create an
array<00:04:59.640> of<00:04:59.670> default<00:05:00.240> characters

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
array of default characters

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.300 
array of default characters
come<00:05:02.429> back<00:05:02.639> into<00:05:02.969> unity

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
come back into unity

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.940 
come back into unity
for<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.580> script<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.880> compile<00:05:06.620> say<00:05:07.620> there<00:05:07.830> are

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
for the script to compile say there are

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.360 
for the script to compile say there are
two<00:05:08.310> characters<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.740> they<00:05:10.740> are<00:05:10.920> our<00:05:11.100> third

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
two characters and they are our third

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.910 
two characters and they are our third
person<00:05:11.820> controller<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.630> our<00:05:13.260> third<00:05:13.500> person

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
person controller and our third person

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.490 
person controller and our third person
controller<00:05:14.400> without<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:14.970> hat

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
controller without a hat

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.870 
controller without a hat
now<00:05:16.800> we're<00:05:17.100> going<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.280> need<00:05:17.370> one<00:05:17.430> other<00:05:17.730> little

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
now we're going to need one other little

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.640 
now we're going to need one other little
piece<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.300> code<00:05:18.480> well<00:05:19.290> we're<00:05:19.410> going<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.590> need

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
piece of code well we're going to need

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.930 
piece of code well we're going to need
many<00:05:19.920> up<00:05:20.070> there<00:05:20.190> little<00:05:20.400> pieces<00:05:20.550> of<00:05:20.670> code

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
many up there little pieces of code

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.559 
many up there little pieces of code
we're<00:05:21.150> going<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.360> need<00:05:21.450> one<00:05:21.510> right<00:05:21.840> now

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
we're going to need one right now

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.209 
we're going to need one right now
now<00:05:23.960> what<00:05:24.110> this<00:05:24.229> piece<00:05:24.439> of<00:05:24.589> code<00:05:24.770> is<00:05:24.979> going<00:05:25.129> to

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 
now what this piece of code is going to

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.459 
now what this piece of code is going to
do<00:05:25.309> is<00:05:25.460> it's<00:05:25.490> going<00:05:25.789> to<00:05:25.879> find<00:05:26.179> using<00:05:26.809> an<00:05:26.929> index

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
do is it's going to find using an index

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.350 
do is it's going to find using an index
the<00:05:27.770> spawn<00:05:28.069> point<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.759> reason<00:05:29.119> we're<00:05:29.240> doing

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
the spawn point the reason we're doing

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.029 
the spawn point the reason we're doing
this<00:05:29.509> is<00:05:29.689> because<00:05:29.990> later<00:05:30.499> when<00:05:30.770> we<00:05:30.860> have<00:05:30.889> a

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
this is because later when we have a

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.549 
this is because later when we have a
network<00:05:31.429> version<00:05:31.879> of<00:05:32.179> the<00:05:32.300> game<00:05:32.509> each<00:05:33.139> of<00:05:33.439> the

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:33.559 
network version of the game each of the

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.230 
network version of the game each of the
network<00:05:34.069> players<00:05:34.429> is<00:05:34.759> going<00:05:34.939> to<00:05:34.999> have<00:05:35.149> an

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
network players is going to have an
