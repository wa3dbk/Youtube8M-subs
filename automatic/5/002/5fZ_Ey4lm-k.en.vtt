00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.480
 And then people are big here that this is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.349
 our sixth video of how to solve the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.389
 Magic cube 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.849
 in this video, why are we going to do it? 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.500
 complete the yellow side 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.539
 and to do that we will use 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 only new movement 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.609
 Let's see how to do this in this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.199
 In particular, we usually leave the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.820
 white underneath 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.330
 in this particular step we will go 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.149
 let the yellow below the yellow 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.120
 our base and we have to leave behind 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.210
 of the amaral at our base a swimming pool with 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.520
 the wrong corner on our right then the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.270
 the base and a camera in our 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.829
 right 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.399
 besides, there is something else that you 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.170
 need to try to put that position 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.120
 You will not be able to change the club. 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.910
 position you will not be able to generate it 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.460
 I always felt that letting that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.859
 position then three things personal let 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.660
 I love below what is wrong but subject 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.489
 and never changed positions do not see why 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 starting this way we will apply 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.229
 always on the move one in paris where 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.600
 applied twice and won the right 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.500
 If you do not give us two more 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.509
 it will work 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:23.630
 Let's see how it works, who is wrong. 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.630
 here move one twice a time 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.700
 twice here on the right thigh 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.770
 Normann said then we'll do it. 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.770
 once more took twice more 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.640
 here in the house on the right 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.070
 now she cleaned up how I told you if you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.450
 repair the tub that he has broken all over 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.580
 but there's no problem in the end it goes 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.740
 and that's why you have to 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.160
 leave him in that position and we will 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.770
 generate our base until there is another 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.530
 wrong king here on our right 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 this is right still generate another 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 time is right yet again this 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.990
 land there doing the same thing we apply 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.990
 a movement two more times 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.310
 Doha Piece Packed Motorcycle at the Club 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.720
 in this position we will see if there is more 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:30.190
 Pieces to fix it right here. 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.310
 certain and sure as it is all right 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.030
 You will see the cube here ready your side. 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.340
 yellow 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.830
 that's it folks remember the yellow side 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.480
 below that is wrong on the right and never 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.060
 we change positions 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.990
 this our sixth step I hope you 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.990
 we next videos
