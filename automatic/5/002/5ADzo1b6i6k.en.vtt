that that's got a little sticky surface

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.340 
that that's got a little sticky surface
on<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:25.830> guess<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.190> it'll<00:02:26.400> hold<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
on it I guess so it'll hold on to the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.730 
on it I guess so it'll hold on to the
nexus<00:02:28.680> 4<00:02:28.890> little<00:02:29.760> friction<00:02:30.330> there<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
nexus 4 little friction there and the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.760 
nexus 4 little friction there and the
back<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.600> there's<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:33.990> one<00:02:34.230> port<00:02:34.500> for

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
back is there's just this one port for

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.190 
back is there's just this one port for
your<00:02:34.920> micro<00:02:35.280> USB<00:02:35.310> charger<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.209> also<00:02:36.870> some

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
your micro USB charger and also some

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.070 
your micro USB charger and also some
more<00:02:37.380> friction<00:02:38.070> as<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.280> rubber<00:02:38.780> or<00:02:39.780> place

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
more friction as a rubber or place

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.590 
more friction as a rubber or place
holder<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> bottom<00:02:40.860> there<00:02:41.270> but<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.450> can

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
holder on the bottom there but you can

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.320 
holder on the bottom there but you can
just<00:02:42.750> toss<00:02:43.380> your<00:02:43.590> nexus<00:02:43.890> 4<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.520> it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
just toss your nexus 4 on it and it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.979 
just toss your nexus 4 on it and it
stays<00:02:45.630> sort<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.770> there<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.340> go

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
stays sort of there we go

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.630 
stays sort of there we go
so<00:02:48.989> let's<00:02:49.320> get<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:49.680> thing<00:02:49.920> plugged<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.459> and

it but it does feel very high quality
like<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.410> said<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.709> friction<00:03:50.040> pad<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.430> very

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
like I said the friction pad is very

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.979 
like I said the friction pad is very
tacky<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.420> don't<00:03:51.570> have<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.750> worry<00:03:51.900> about

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
tacky and you don't have to worry about

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.020 
tacky and you don't have to worry about
sitting<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.440> device<00:03:52.680> on<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.190> pad<00:03:53.370> just<00:03:53.400> right

sitting the device on the pad just right

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.430 
sitting the device on the pad just right
you<00:03:54.239> don't<00:03:54.390> have<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.570> line<00:03:54.750> anything<00:03:55.140> up<00:03:55.260> it

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
you don't have to line anything up it

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.650 
you don't have to line anything up it
just<00:03:55.680> works<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.489> real<00:03:56.700> question<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.209> how<00:03:57.269> fast

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
just works the real question is how fast

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.420 
just works the real question is how fast
does<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.079> thing<00:03:58.260> actually<00:03:58.470> charged<00:03:59.070> since

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
does this thing actually charged since

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.680 
does this thing actually charged since
that's<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.730> only<00:03:59.970> thing<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.239> really<00:04:00.269> does

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
that's the only thing it really does

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.780 
that's the only thing it really does
I've<00:04:00.930> been<00:04:01.290> charging<00:04:01.799> for<00:04:01.829> less<00:04:02.250> than<00:04:02.400> an<00:04:02.579> hour

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
I've been charging for less than an hour

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.850 
I've been charging for less than an hour
and<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.239> percentage<00:04:03.750> has<00:04:03.870> jumped<00:04:04.200> from<00:04:04.230> 58%

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
and the percentage has jumped from 58%

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.150 
and the percentage has jumped from 58%
to<00:04:05.480> 84%<00:04:06.480> that's<00:04:06.900> pretty<00:04:07.079> fast<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.769> DC<00:04:08.130> output

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
to 84% that's pretty fast the DC output

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.060 
to 84% that's pretty fast the DC output
is<00:04:08.790> 1<00:04:09.150> amp<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.989> Google<00:04:10.350> Play<00:04:10.380> Store<00:04:10.560> lists

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
is 1 amp and the Google Play Store lists

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.789 
is 1 amp and the Google Play Store lists
the<00:04:11.280> average<00:04:11.730> charge<00:04:12.060> time<00:04:12.299> about<00:04:12.570> 4<00:04:12.930> hours<00:04:13.140> so

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
the average charge time about 4 hours so

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.860 
the average charge time about 4 hours so
it's<00:04:13.920> not<00:04:14.010> super<00:04:14.220> fast<00:04:14.579> not<00:04:15.030> slow<00:04:15.390> another

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
it's not super fast not slow another

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.539 
it's not super fast not slow another
important<00:04:16.320> tidbit<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.890> that<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> works<00:04:17.430> really

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
important tidbit is that it works really

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.210 
important tidbit is that it works really
well<00:04:17.820> with<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> bumper<00:04:18.660> case<00:04:18.870> or<00:04:19.140> even<00:04:20.039> if<00:04:20.130> you

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
well with a bumper case or even if you

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.500 
well with a bumper case or even if you
have<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.370> skin<00:04:20.669> on<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.849> back<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.269> stuff

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
have a skin on the back that stuff

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.240 
have a skin on the back that stuff
doesn't<00:04:21.750> really<00:04:21.989> bother<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.470> at<00:04:22.590> all

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
doesn't really bother it at all

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.670 
doesn't really bother it at all
it<00:04:23.340> still<00:04:23.610> sits<00:04:23.790> perfectly<00:04:24.150> on<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.930> orb<00:04:25.230> the

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
it still sits perfectly on the orb the

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.320 
it still sits perfectly on the orb the
question<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.370> this<00:04:26.580> thing<00:04:26.820> really<00:04:27.030> worth

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
question is is this thing really worth

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.570 
question is is this thing really worth
the<00:04:27.540> money<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:28.050> retails<00:04:28.440> for<00:04:28.530> $60<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.340> it's<00:04:29.490> not

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
the money it retails for $60 so it's not

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.850 
the money it retails for $60 so it's not
exactly<00:04:29.730> cheap<00:04:30.270> but<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.170> really<00:04:31.440> cool<00:04:31.590> and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
exactly cheap but it is really cool and

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.920 
exactly cheap but it is really cool and
it<00:04:32.070> props<00:04:32.280> up<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.580> device<00:04:32.820> for<00:04:33.390> me<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.810> will

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
it props up the device for me it will

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.230 
it props up the device for me it will
probably<00:04:34.410> remain<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.980> device<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.520> my<00:04:35.730> personal

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240
