professional work environment it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.800 
professional work environment it
definitely<00:01:49.880> carries<00:01:50.209> a<00:01:50.240> lot<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.509> clout

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
definitely carries a lot of clout

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.469 
definitely carries a lot of clout
however<00:01:51.619> if<00:01:51.770> they<00:01:51.860> know<00:01:52.039> them<00:01:52.330> from<00:01:53.330> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
however if they know them from a

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.900 
however if they know them from a
distance<00:01:53.509> maybe<00:01:54.140> they<00:01:54.410> are<00:01:54.979> working<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> same

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
distance maybe they are working the same

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.609 
distance maybe they are working the same
company<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.869> they<00:01:56.959> know<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.170> my<00:01:57.410> very

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
company and they know that my very

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.040 
company and they know that my very
social<00:01:58.009> level<00:01:58.310> we<00:01:58.849> still<00:01:59.090> take<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.810> into

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
social level we still take that into

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.719

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.610 
alumni know the type of person who's
going<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.459> succeed<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.299> program<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:40.260> think

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
going to succeed in the program I think

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.069 
going to succeed in the program I think
students<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.280> want<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.549> stay<00:03:41.700> away<00:03:41.970> from

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
students really want to stay away from

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.599 
students really want to stay away from
personal<00:03:43.079> recommendations<00:03:44.040> though<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> think

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
personal recommendations though I think

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.240 
personal recommendations though I think
that<00:03:44.760> those<00:03:45.500> tempted<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.650> not<00:03:46.680> be<00:03:47.069> as<00:03:47.220> strong

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
that those tempted to not be as strong

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.800 
that those tempted to not be as strong
and<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:47.879> I<00:03:47.910> think<00:03:48.030> it's<00:03:48.269> really<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and so I think it's really the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.920 
and so I think it's really the
relationship<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.889> with<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.430> alumni<00:03:50.930> that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
relationship that with the alumni that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.640 
relationship that with the alumni that
is<00:03:52.139> more<00:03:52.319> important<00:03:52.859> than<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:54.500> title<00:03:55.500> itself

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
is more important than the title itself

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.490 
is more important than the title itself
a<00:03:56.269> recommendation<00:03:57.269> from<00:03:57.750> an<00:03:57.900> alumni<00:03:58.319> is

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
a recommendation from an alumni is

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.229 
a recommendation from an alumni is
always<00:03:58.769> important<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.280> us<00:03:59.489> because<00:03:59.519> it's<00:04:00.090> nice

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
always important to us because it's nice

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.610 
always important to us because it's nice
first<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.750> all<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.049> alumni<00:04:01.260> still

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
first of all that alumni still

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.900 
first of all that alumni still
interested<00:04:02.099> in<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.280> school<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.699> they<00:04:02.849> think

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
interested in the school that they think

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.890 
interested in the school that they think
enough<00:04:03.269> about

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
to say this is someone that I think is

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.520 
to say this is someone that I think is
going<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.480> do<00:04:06.569> really<00:04:06.810> really<00:04:07.260> good<00:04:07.409> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
going to do really really good the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.899 
going to do really really good the
program<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.129> it's<00:04:08.250> always<00:04:08.459> nice<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.700> have<00:04:08.849> a

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
program so it's always nice to have a

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.240 
program so it's always nice to have a
recommendation<00:04:09.209> for<00:04:09.689> my<00:04:09.810> long<00:04:09.959> life<00:04:10.140> it's<00:04:11.040> not

going to get someone in if the rest of

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.500 
going to get someone in if the rest of
the<00:04:12.900> replication<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.590> horrible<00:04:14.040> but<00:04:14.299> it<00:04:15.299> does

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
the replication is horrible but it does

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.150 
the replication is horrible but it does
give<00:04:15.810> us<00:04:15.930> something<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.530> look<00:04:16.680> at<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:16.889> we<00:04:17.009> do
