00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
stabilizer and it's pretty much pretty

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.140 
stabilizer and it's pretty much pretty
much<00:00:19.230> all<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> same<00:00:19.859> thing<00:00:20.189> now<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> probably

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
much all the same thing now you probably

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.710 
much all the same thing now you probably
coordinate<00:00:21.630> your<00:00:21.900> pool<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.720> unstabilized

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
coordinate your pool with a unstabilized

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.220 
coordinate your pool with a unstabilized
form<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.170> chlorine<00:00:25.560> liquid<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.310> granular<00:00:27.230> the

form of chlorine liquid or granular the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.560 
form of chlorine liquid or granular the
stabilizer<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.340> helps<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:31.520> chlorine<00:00:32.570> become

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
stabilizer it helps the chlorine become

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.049 
stabilizer it helps the chlorine become
active<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.380> an<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> longer<00:00:35.460> period<00:00:35.489> of

time because of Sun and the heat and use

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
time because of Sun and the heat and use
of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> pool<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:39.239> chew<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> chlorine

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
of the pool can chew up the chlorine

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
of the pool can chew up the chlorine
very<00:00:40.379> very<00:00:40.649> quickly<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> need<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.969> get

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
very very quickly so you need to get

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.930 
very very quickly so you need to get
some<00:00:42.390> stabilizer<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.399> rain

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
some stabilizer in there now the rain

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.680 
some stabilizer in there now the rain
for<00:00:45.180> cyanuric<00:00:45.480> acid<00:00:45.770> is<00:00:46.770> 30<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.579> 50<00:00:47.940> parts<00:00:48.629> per

what happens if the cyanuric acid gets
too<00:02:17.840> high<00:02:18.200> well<00:02:18.830> ty<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:19.910> my<00:02:20.090> opinion<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:20.600> when

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
too high well ty in my opinion is when

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.600 
too high well ty in my opinion is when
when<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.170> start<00:02:21.410> getting<00:02:21.620> into<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.860> 8090

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610

hundred<00:02:23.030> mark<00:02:23.209> especially<00:02:23.750> over<00:02:24.260> 100<00:02:25.190> that's

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
hundred mark especially over 100 that's

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.210 
hundred mark especially over 100 that's
that's<00:02:26.480> really<00:02:27.080> really<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.560> breaking<00:02:27.980> point

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
that's really really the breaking point

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.060 
that's really really the breaking point
you<00:02:28.670> need<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.930> either<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.380> partial<00:02:30.650> or

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
you need to do this either in partial or

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.449 
you need to do this either in partial or
full<00:02:31.280> drain<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.660> refill<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.440> what<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.190> does

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
full drain and refill and what that does

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.320 
full drain and refill and what that does
is<00:02:35.500> by<00:02:36.500> draining<00:02:37.070> your<00:02:37.550> pool<00:02:37.790> water<00:02:37.970> and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
is by draining your pool water and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.479 
is by draining your pool water and
refilling<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.989> with<00:02:39.050> fresh<00:02:39.410> water<00:02:39.680> you're

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
refilling it with fresh water you're

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.060 
refilling it with fresh water you're
you're<00:02:40.910> leaving<00:02:41.480> maybe<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:42.890> bit<00:02:42.980> of

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
you're leaving maybe a little bit of

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.310 
you're leaving maybe a little bit of
sign<00:02:43.280> arek<00:02:43.519> acid<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.150> there<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.959> then<00:02:45.170> you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
sign arek acid in there and then you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.199 
sign arek acid in there and then you
refill<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:45.950> obviously<00:02:46.430> with<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.730> fresh<00:02:46.940> water

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
refill it obviously with the fresh water

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.330 
refill it obviously with the fresh water
that<00:02:47.420> doesn't<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:48.200> any<00:02:48.560> chlorine<00:02:48.920> or

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that doesn't have any chlorine or

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.840 
that doesn't have any chlorine or
stabilizer<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.300> there<00:02:51.040> after<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.160> do<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.819> the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
stabilizer in there after you do the the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.569 
stabilizer in there after you do the the
partial<00:02:53.660> or<00:02:53.750> full<00:02:53.780> drain<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.380> refill<00:02:54.579> allow

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
partial or full drain and refill allow

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.690 
partial or full drain and refill allow
the<00:02:55.640> filter<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.480> go<00:02:56.600> for<00:02:56.870> about<00:02:56.989> 10<00:02:57.320> hours

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
the filter to go for about 10 hours

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.430 
the filter to go for about 10 hours
retest<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.910> then<00:02:59.390> start<00:02:59.780> making<00:03:00.140> your

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
retest and then start making your

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.020 
retest and then start making your
adjustments<00:03:01.100> so<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.519> about<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.820> only

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
adjustments so this is about the only

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.680 
adjustments so this is about the only
way<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:03.170> handle<00:03:03.470> an<00:03:03.890> over<00:03:04.579> statewide<00:03:04.850> pool<00:03:05.390> is

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
way to handle an over statewide pool is

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.229 
way to handle an over statewide pool is
to<00:03:05.870> do<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.049> partial<00:03:06.380> or<00:03:06.680> full<00:03:06.860> drain<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.640> refill

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
to do a partial or full drain and refill

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.180 
to do a partial or full drain and refill
