 it is 10 o'clock 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.650
 I feel like it's 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.079
 the time of the break and ben is stylish 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.910
 here it looks nice anyway hi 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.239
 it's you live margot needs a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.670
 guide 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.440
 I'm here apparently we're going to a 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.850
 strategic location 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.620
 marion tell me that high school fashion 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.180
 it's an institution that is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.890
 a center of excellence for 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.379
 fashion trades where everyone can 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.449
 find his training adapted to his 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.910
 personal project at the forefront of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.100
 technologies open to the world 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.539
 recognized by the profession I'm told 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.760
 that we can enjoy an insertion 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.320
 professional fast either by a 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.420
 classical schooling either in 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.430
 learning with its many 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 partnerships and networks it would offer 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.439
 even mobility opportunities to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.409
 the international has I think we are 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.540
 arrived here fabrice souletie the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.479
 teacher of applied arts they me 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.930
 speak of kaledo what is it at 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.360
 just 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.070
 ah okay it's thanks to this software 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 that we can see the birth of a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.390
 product 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.619
 seduced for example excellent there know it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.130
 you see it's a drawing software 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.060
 vector that allows that is used 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.320
 their technical drawings but we 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.210
 use to make figurines so there 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.070
 you can the lips can do his 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.229
 work and she'll be able to really 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430
 visualize his idea so there an idea 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 that she could do in sketches but there 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.079
 she can choose her fabrics and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.240
 place on 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.799
 so we really see what it gives 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.600
 always has a specification that 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.860
 imposed on us a company and so he 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.329
 will have to really try to answer this 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.710
 specifications and so that's it 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.710
 we try to do in applied arts 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.950
 veronique after the software I believe 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.020
 that we will join the universe that makes me 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.380
 dreaming 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.799
 the workshop she is the teacher 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.599
 workshop 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.520
 it's been more than twenty years since 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.620
 works here from what she tells us 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.849
 said we can even hope to work in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.580
 luxury and high-end 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.620
 huge by the way we can do a lot of 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.129
 internships in beautiful companies by 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.620
 example 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.379
 yes like for example in this polo 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.879
 face-to-face or sefa actually these 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.860
 companies work for very 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.989
 big brands these companies actually 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.300
 are at the forefront of technology 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.090
 at the moment of the realization of the patterns 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.900
 and again for the actual cutting 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.480
 clothes 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.849
 there are also many hand items 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.530
 to actually tend towards luxury we 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.750
 so here in fact we are in a 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.269
 workshop where the students actually manufactures 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.780
 all stages of the realization of 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.750
 the juve 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.060
 they follow an operating range not to 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.900
 not she obviously they control 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.790
 their work 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.920
 and then then they will show it in 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.129
 done to their teachers and then more 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.190
 later we look at the well-being of the skirt 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.360
 one so that's nice there we're in the process of 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.500
 to make the jules that you had everything to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.650
 the time on the computer 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.060
 it requires precision of sound and 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.489
 rigor 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.019
 it's a question of quality ok a 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.550
 priori it also takes a lot of 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.140
 motivation one of the keys to success 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.060
 in these trades 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.510
 until then it's okay I think I have the right 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.400
 profile 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.330
 it's still a real chance 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.370
 can learn in such 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.750
 conditions when we see everything he 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.330
 there in their supply store 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.730
 they also have a super cdi with heaps 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.650
 of books trendy notebooks of the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.670
 international documentation and 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.670
 even products 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.620
 I love I crossed hills that took me 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.090
 besides, well convinced once 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.190
 you came back here really have to give 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.900
 the best of you to stay me 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.790
 i was in london for a year internship 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.230
 last in a luxury business and 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.239
 that you can really far in his cv 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.129
 finally I wonder if it takes 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.810
 stop at the baccalaureate pro he also offers 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.920
 bts dies in the garment but 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.700
 also for leather work 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.010
 leather goods 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.530
 it's really great to be able to create at 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.290
 from materials 6 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.290
 rank soon margot very soon
