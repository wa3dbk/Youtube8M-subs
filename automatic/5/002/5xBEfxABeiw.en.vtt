00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello my name is Ivan, I continued 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.150
 do tutorials on gta samp in the past 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.500
 I told the video body + c 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.970
 there will be no cat rolls for eggs and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.920
 consider each tank in each 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.080
 release I will try to tell about all 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 known to me about gods with weapons gta samp 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 by the way now i'm on the main 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.289
 street weiss city but this is off topic 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.240
 video so the first boxing weapon is 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.220
 fast reload and reef arrow dates 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.840
 there is such a bug that when changing weapons 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.640
 the level of ammo in the cage increases to 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.439
 this standard is rich with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.390
 and possibly a developer bug which 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 will benefit us you just shoot 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 stigma change it to another trunk and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.329
 Change me and put on all the cartridges 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.920
 recovered next bug is a bug with 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.600
 with a knife he allows to kill the enemy 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.540
 which watch your side with a knife 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.730
 literally two seconds but also tobacco 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 is one of the most difficult in general 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.180
 run on the enemy with a print holding the pkm 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.010
 as soon as you reached him 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 turn the camera around so that it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 looked at his back and sky you warehouse n 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.570
 sprint key ie swallowed or shift 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.219
 at first you may fail but through 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.590
 five ten here you can easily cut 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.510
 its entire next tank is designed to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.400
 shotgun it is called double shit 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.229
 the whole point is to shoot a shotgun 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.970
 a little fast-fire but with such 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 shooting is not visible sight to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 repeat gave shock you let go of sight 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.900
 after shot and re-enter sight and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 wag again this you reset the timer 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.950
 and insert with aging the next bug 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.110
 called slip it is used 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.299
 to quickly move around the location and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.250
 as one of the duel tactics, but with such 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.979
 fast walking you can shoot but not 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.259
 you can stop here how it is done 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.140
 you sit down and simultaneously press 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.000
 w3c sprint key is not releasing after 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.159
 I will add this in the end expressed faster 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.170
 than with the sprint and we can still shoot 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.270
 again run only can 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.640
 the tower so this has its drawbacks 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.380
 by the way max fast recharge very 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.750
 convenient to use on trim well 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.920
 Shoots of two cartridges 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.710
 switch to another weapon and then 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.970
 again cut and so on to infinity 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.100
 rate of fire will increase significantly 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.200
 Well, the last for today tank and tobacco 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.360
 bend when we sunbathe there and supposedly not 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.250
 can actually shoot the enemy sees 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.110
 you are not set on fire and the damage passes 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.850
 and you shoot without reloading 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.350
 Confi which is very comfortable with a rim 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.629
 see what your opponent looks like 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 which bug to use well and finally 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.710
 few notes first 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 many bodies are forbidden on sulfur 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.910
 honors and that these bugs are allowed 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.500
 rules before you knit them 2 advise 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.040
 practice with a friend on your own 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.170
 server 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.660
 these mages may fail from 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.250
 Management 4 if you have questions on 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.320
