00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.440
 one by one 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.220
 there are all the beings all together 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.010

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.160
 they will do is download 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.990

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.300
 to have downloaded what they were is to open 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.950
 the folder they give is to bring here to 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.080
 desk or wherever they want that 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.110

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.659
 [Music] 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.680
 once they install what they are going to do is 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.590
 go to a folder of a crystal like this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.960

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.570
