here level up when you fight he will get

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.569 
here level up when you fight he will get
stronger<00:01:27.420> there's<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.619> really<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.100> else

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
stronger there's not really a lot else

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.420 
stronger there's not really a lot else
to<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> box<00:01:30.750> apart<00:01:31.170> from<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.680> he

to see on the box apart from that he

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
to see on the box apart from that he
probably<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.240> compatible<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
probably will be compatible with the

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.080 
for it looks like maybe these parts were
molded<00:03:32.410> separately<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.100> they<00:03:33.280> were<00:03:33.340> glued<00:03:33.760> on

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
molded separately and they were glued on

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.810 
molded separately and they were glued on
that's<00:03:35.020> not<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.470> smoothest<00:03:36.160> of<00:03:36.370> jobs<00:03:36.610> that

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
that's not the smoothest of jobs that

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.460 
that's not the smoothest of jobs that
I've<00:03:36.940> ever<00:03:37.120> seen<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.900> think<00:03:38.170> they<00:03:38.260> could

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
I've ever seen it I think they could

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.010 
I've ever seen it I think they could
have<00:03:38.500> done<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:39.160> little<00:03:39.670> better<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.810> in

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
have done that a little better but in

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.890 
have done that a little better but in
general<00:03:41.590> he<00:03:41.800> looks<00:03:42.040> pretty<00:03:42.459> pretty<00:03:43.150> good<00:03:43.630> he

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
general he looks pretty pretty good he

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.810 
general he looks pretty pretty good he
does<00:03:44.050> look<00:03:44.230> like<00:03:44.260> he's<00:03:44.500> got<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.800> lot<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.040> dynamic

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
does look like he's got a lot of dynamic

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.970 
does look like he's got a lot of dynamic
motion<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.630> him<00:03:46.900> I'm<00:03:47.170> just<00:03:47.410> gonna<00:03:47.500> bring<00:03:47.740> over

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
motion to him I'm just gonna bring over

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.760 
motion to him I'm just gonna bring over
the<00:03:48.940> Meta<00:03:49.300> Knight<00:03:49.420> one<00:03:49.780> for<00:03:50.110> comparison<00:03:50.740> just

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
run Mario off the stage so that he's out

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.040 
run Mario off the stage so that he's out
of<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:18.790> way<00:06:18.940> and

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
of the way and

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.939 
of the way and
oh<00:06:22.360> wow<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.629> was<00:06:23.780> really<00:06:23.810> fast<00:06:24.229> so<00:06:24.650> that<00:06:24.860> was

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
oh wow that was really fast so that was

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.300 
oh wow that was really fast so that was
a<00:06:24.979> one-hit<00:06:25.610> ko<00:06:25.879> and<00:06:26.389> yeah<00:06:27.080> that<00:06:27.919> was<00:06:28.039> a<00:06:28.069> lot

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
a one-hit ko and yeah that was a lot

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.860 
a one-hit ko and yeah that was a lot
faster<00:06:28.819> than<00:06:28.940> I<00:06:29.090> was<00:06:29.240> expecting

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
faster than I was expecting

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.050 
faster than I was expecting
and<00:06:30.050> it<00:06:30.349> looks<00:06:30.530> like<00:06:30.590> Koopa<00:06:31.129> is<00:06:31.460> the<00:06:31.819> winner

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
and it looks like Koopa is the winner

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.869 
and it looks like Koopa is the winner
maybe<00:06:33.050> I<00:06:33.289> shouldn't<00:06:33.800> be<00:06:33.889> doing<00:06:34.220> these<00:06:34.310> matches

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:34.879 
maybe I shouldn't be doing these matches

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.550 
maybe I shouldn't be doing these matches
with<00:06:35.090> double<00:06:35.690> power

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
with double power

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.589 
with double power
I<00:06:36.740> guess<00:06:37.370> maybe<00:06:37.639> that<00:06:37.970> is<00:06:38.090> making<00:06:38.479> these

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
I guess maybe that is making these

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.869 
I guess maybe that is making these
characters<00:06:39.110> a<00:06:39.229> little<00:06:39.530> bit<00:06:39.770> too<00:06:39.979> strong<00:06:40.430> um

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
characters a little bit too strong um

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.480 
characters a little bit too strong um
but<00:06:41.720> at<00:06:41.900> least<00:06:42.139> you<00:06:42.289> know<00:06:42.440> we<00:06:42.620> can't<00:06:42.860> see<00:06:43.129> in<00:06:43.370> a

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
but at least you know we can't see in a

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.939 
but at least you know we can't see in a
sort<00:06:43.669> of<00:06:43.699> sudden-death<00:06:44.180> kind<00:06:45.020> of<00:06:45.139> way<00:06:45.379> who<00:06:45.919> is

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
sort of sudden-death kind of way who is

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.430 
sort of sudden-death kind of way who is
the<00:06:46.400> strongest<00:06:46.849> I<00:06:47.270> had<00:06:47.750> forgotten<00:06:48.110> I<00:06:48.259> think

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
the strongest I had forgotten I think

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.379 
the strongest I had forgotten I think
maybe<00:06:48.590> in<00:06:48.800> previous<00:06:49.190> videos<00:06:49.550> I<00:06:49.789> had<00:06:50.120> done<00:06:50.270> it

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
maybe in previous videos I had done it

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.749 
maybe in previous videos I had done it
with<00:06:50.539> a<00:06:50.569> weaker<00:06:50.960> power<00:06:51.199> setting<00:06:51.710> but<00:06:52.069> in<00:06:52.490> any

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
with a weaker power setting but in any

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.089 
with a weaker power setting but in any
case<00:06:53.030> it<00:06:53.360> looks<00:06:53.569> like<00:06:53.750> the<00:06:53.870> real<00:06:54.110> Koopa<00:06:54.680> was

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
case it looks like the real Koopa was

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.279 
case it looks like the real Koopa was
stronger<00:06:55.699> than<00:06:55.729> Cooper<00:06:56.270> this<00:06:56.690> time<00:06:56.960> that's<00:06:57.169> a

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
stronger than Cooper this time that's a

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.499 
stronger than Cooper this time that's a
little<00:06:57.500> bit<00:06:57.710> of<00:06:57.860> a<00:06:57.919> shame<00:06:58.190> but<00:06:58.219> I'm<00:06:58.610> sure<00:06:58.940> that

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
little bit of a shame but I'm sure that

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.020 
little bit of a shame but I'm sure that
he<00:06:59.659> will<00:06:59.900> be<00:07:00.020> able<00:07:00.199> to<00:07:00.560> get<00:07:01.190> his<00:07:01.370> own<00:07:01.580> back<00:07:01.819> in

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
he will be able to get his own back in

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.700 
he will be able to get his own back in
future<00:07:02.449> battles<00:07:02.870> that's<00:07:03.199> all<00:07:03.289> I<00:07:03.349> have<00:07:03.469> to<00:07:03.560> time

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
future battles that's all I have to time

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.140 
future battles that's all I have to time
for<00:07:03.889> showing<00:07:04.129> you<00:07:04.190> for<00:07:04.430> now<00:07:04.639> so<00:07:04.909> don't<00:07:05.030> forget
