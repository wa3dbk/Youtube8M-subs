00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello to all and welcome our 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 show received 5 out of 5 I have the huge 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.630
 pleasure to welcome patrick you join 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 by my side patrick good day for every 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.379
 french good day we will study 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.550
 Sunday set in deauville 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.960
 it's the price of art is for 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.180
 horses 4 years and over on distance 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.410
 from 2000 meters 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.760
 patrick is what this phase was 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.279
 proven easy to decipher or not 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 obviously not like every year 10 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.840
 because they are very difficult to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.489
 decipher and there is a risk of having a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.960
 change of terrain because of them 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.329
 rains that are announced between this 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.680
 Saturday and this Sunday 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.690
 so we can maybe count on a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.670
 well flexible terrain which can modify 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 gives it for some horses we listen 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 immediately at selection in michaud 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.590
 so I put the number two in the lead 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.579
 best times in front of the new 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.640
 iron spirit 13 sisyphe the this atom 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.030
 bone in front of the astral deserves 15 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.420
 gentlemen the 6th mosquito morges is and 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.370
 finally number 10 rue Pommereul at the head of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.899
 the selection you have passed number 2 bis 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.610
 fouad we will immediately understand 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.650
 why looking at the images of his 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.970
 last race is saint patrick him 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.340
 which you can see you can follow 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.460
 his orange jacket he is completely 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.020
 the igd tied up within the bunch and he does not 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.909
 will be able to express itself only in the whole 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.180
 final phase to take the third 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.740
 square 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.759
 and no doubt that if he had had the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.430
 they would have imposed themselves 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.259
 in addition it is the training of françois 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.119
 rault wifo will have soro that is 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 really realized realized a meeting 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.040
 superb and every time he runs 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.650
 almost he wins so here we have to him 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.670
 trust my opinion on next 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.829
 number 9 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.229
 iron spirit it was great on the palms 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.360
 of compiegne yes he had returned from 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.369
 the rear guard and on the racecourse of 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.680
 compiegne was rarely evident from the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.420
 do it and he had done so riding in 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.579
 full possession of his means his 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 choice that start had succeeded on 700 m 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.240
 2 the two millimeters of the appropriate 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 so we have to wait for a good one 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.110
 behavior here i think with alexis 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.820
 badel who in great shape 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.070
 we must trust him then 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.320
 number 13 sisyphus then sisyphus I'm going 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.759
 listen carefully because I did not 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.200
 nothing seen for a very long time 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.000
 yes gentlemen appointed because he did not 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.500
 ran since May yes but before 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.060
 if they had not shown much 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.980
 yes but then you have to know that it does not 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 could never in his land it's 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.120
 a horse exclusively from the field 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 very flexible it will be I hope the case this 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.760
 Sunday 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.950
 let's not forget that the gnagna he had 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.820
 removed two quintés it was at each 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.220
 times on well flexible tracks is 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.480
 arrived in value 41 years and a half 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 today it has come down in value 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.070
 34 and a half and I think if the teeth 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.430
 good provisions it will be 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.290
 the arrival 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.790
 this is patrick's poker game 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.690
 Note the Vosges on your shelves the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 number 13 sisyphus 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.640
 I put pressure 4th and I believe in it but 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.739
 provided that you are a care for him to 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.110
 the cei opens the umbrella print 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.980
 but that's it but I folds because 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.860
 I was hoping for a very flexible terrain 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.910
 then go to the number 7 atomos good he 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.980
 is hyper regular we can nothing him 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.900
 blame yes so be aware that he 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.000
 had a blank year in 2014 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.110
 but since his return and well he is doing 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 fire of all woods he is really in 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.850
 full form and he just fine 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.160
 run on the deauville racecourse on 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.930
 the ps is it more bridge-the bishop nothing 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.520
 to blame him right now so we 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.060
 must hear him still successful a beautiful 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.360
 performance 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.370
 then this astral merit and j ointment 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.670
 Florent manniez took the phone and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.590
 the costs right away for to my book 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.930
 you are breastfeeding astral deserves in the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.090
 Sunday quinté in deauville 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.209
 what did you think of his last 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.760
 benefits in 42 of value that's good 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.280
 because I had always competitive 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:41.900
 so no I was working Australian 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.150
 for the first time I found that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.150
 motivated just to finish he's not a 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.640
 guingamp monster which remains a beautiful state 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.380
 so is it these courses are 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.930
 outright it needed a little more 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:05.190
 but hey it will be right to the cause in 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.750
 the world a slight shortfall is 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.570
 super regular this year we can nothing 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.489
 blame him now that say races 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.489
 I think it'll call them 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.880
 the Australian blinders it's without 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.919
 doubt what made the difference 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.299
 moment of his choice patrick yes because 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.280
 that maybe I have them put a 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.040
 a little lower if there had not been this 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.070
 artifice it was a filly who had 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.960
 who had won his big handicap at 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.370
 spring and despite three pounds and a half 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.350
 of penalization and well she proved 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.600
 that it is a competitive contest but 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.770
 always being fifth so that 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.110
 proves that she was a little fair 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.900
 so wearing Australian blinds 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.970
 may motivate her further and 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.200
 so we can hope once again 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.630
 very nice performance from him 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.010
 we can not leave without the 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.479
 patrick vosgiens chocolate have the 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.050
 elbows right away with attention 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:56.410
 so I chose the 602 alex my boy 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.880
 it was this package win over 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.560
 the longchamp racecourse the most 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.690
 barbeville very convincingly 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.430
 it was a group iii here well in the 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.200
 soap and kergorlay I think he can 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.700
 still make the difference 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.280
 many parents have realized that 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.510
 aggravate a scanner yes 6 but hey I 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.840
 think it's the right choice of the 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.820
 race 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.160
 thank you patrick thank you all for having followed 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.169
 we leave with your game board is 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.210
 to selection we wish you a good 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.080
 Sunday and we'll meet again soon 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.080
 thank you
