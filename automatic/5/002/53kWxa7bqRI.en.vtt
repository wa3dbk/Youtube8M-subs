00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
i think it's pretty good and the only

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.229 
i think it's pretty good and the only
it's<00:01:01.100> basically<00:01:02.100> no<00:01:02.309> complaints<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.000> then

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it's basically no complaints are then

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.560 
it's basically no complaints are then

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
there is like a little room that that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.440 
there is like a little room that that
the<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.560> move<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> down<00:01:08.640> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the that you can move up and down so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.440 
the that you can move up and down so
