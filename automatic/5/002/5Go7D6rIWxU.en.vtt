00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
you notice it skips destination select

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.060 
you notice it skips destination select
because<00:01:27.830> this<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.990> an<00:01:29.990> Apple<00:01:30.620> Mac<00:01:30.800> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
because this is a an Apple Mac and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.070 
because this is a an Apple Mac and
therefore<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.880> can't<00:01:32.180> dictate<00:01:32.360> where<00:01:32.870> is

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
therefore you can't dictate where is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.860 
therefore you can't dictate where is
going<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.500> be<00:01:33.620> installed<00:01:34.510> installation<00:01:35.510> type

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
going to be installed installation type

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.470 
going to be installed installation type
just<00:01:36.470> tells<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.980> how<00:01:37.610> much<00:01:37.820> space<00:01:38.120> is<00:01:38.300> going

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
just tells you how much space is going

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.040 
just tells you how much space is going
to<00:01:38.630> use<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.230> we're<00:01:40.070> going<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.460> click<00:01:40.700> on

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
to use and we're going to click on

to use and we're going to click on
install<00:01:44.710> ok<00:01:45.710> it's<00:01:45.860> pretty<00:01:45.950> quick<00:01:46.370> in

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
install ok it's pretty quick in

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:56.950 
install ok it's pretty quick in
installing<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:53.770> we're<00:01:54.770> all<00:01:54.920> done<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:56.510> next

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
installing and we're all done the next

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.830 
installing and we're all done the next
step<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.680> show<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:57.950> how<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.310> use<00:01:58.730> Java<00:01:59.480> and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
step is to show you how to use Java and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.000 
step is to show you how to use Java and
we<00:02:00.530> will<00:02:00.710> do<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.160> in<00:02:01.400> another<00:02:01.730> video
