00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.870 
again now we become higher risk so

I think<00:02:14.280> that's<00:02:14.459> what<00:02:14.670> will<00:02:14.819> happen<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.510> they

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
I think that's what will happen but they

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.360 
I think that's what will happen but they
don't<00:02:15.810> know<00:02:15.959> because<00:02:16.409> it's<00:02:16.709> never<00:02:16.920> happened

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370
