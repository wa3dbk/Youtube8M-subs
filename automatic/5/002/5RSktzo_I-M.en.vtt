-<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> mean<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.660> fact<00:02:16.020> I'm<00:02:16.140> almost<00:02:16.290> certain

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
- I mean in fact I'm almost certain

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.640 
- I mean in fact I'm almost certain
fancy<00:02:17.430> study<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:18.510> mum<00:02:18.720> alternation<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.380> a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
fancy study it's my mum alternation up a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.820 
fancy study it's my mum alternation up a
bit<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> heart<00:02:20.070> attack<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.520> be<00:02:20.640> obvious<00:02:20.850> and

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
bit of a heart attack to be obvious and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.960 
bit of a heart attack to be obvious and
so<00:02:22.830> it's<00:02:23.070> probably<00:02:23.190> best<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.820> this

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
so it's probably best that it's this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.520 
so it's probably best that it's this
good<00:02:24.180> that's<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.540> my<00:02:24.630> house<00:02:24.810> well<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.410> hope
