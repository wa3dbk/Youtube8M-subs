00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.960 

one<00:00:03.440> of<00:00:03.500> the<00:00:03.560> most<00:00:03.740> commonly<00:00:04.189> asked<00:00:04.460> questions

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
one of the most commonly asked questions

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.900 
one of the most commonly asked questions
we<00:00:05.149> get<00:00:05.420> is<00:00:05.630> what<00:00:06.290> does<00:00:06.440> the<00:00:06.560> canard<00:00:06.920> do<00:00:07.100> the

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
we get is what does the canard do the

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.879 
we get is what does the canard do the
canard<00:00:08.299> improves<00:00:08.780> the<00:00:09.080> performance<00:00:09.740> and

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
canard improves the performance and

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.830 
canard improves the performance and
safety<00:00:10.280> the<00:00:10.400> airplane<00:00:10.820> in<00:00:10.969> a<00:00:11.030> number<00:00:11.330> of<00:00:11.360> areas

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
safety the airplane in a number of areas

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.900 
safety the airplane in a number of areas
the<00:00:12.559> first<00:00:12.830> thing<00:00:13.100> is<00:00:13.279> the<00:00:13.430> canard<00:00:13.730> is<00:00:13.879> a

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
the first thing is the canard is a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.209 
the first thing is the canard is a
lifting<00:00:14.330> surface<00:00:14.360> it<00:00:14.779> generates<00:00:15.199> lift<00:00:15.500> that

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
lifting surface it generates lift that

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.000 
lifting surface it generates lift that
lift<00:00:16.550> augments<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.270> wing<00:00:17.449> lift<00:00:17.690> in<00:00:18.110> turn<00:00:18.440> that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
lift augments the wing lift in turn that

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.100 
lift augments the wing lift in turn that
lowers<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.520> stall<00:00:19.760> speed<00:00:19.910> reduces<00:00:20.870> to<00:00:20.930> take

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
lowers the stall speed reduces to take

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.110 
lowers the stall speed reduces to take
off<00:00:21.290> and<00:00:21.470> landing<00:00:21.710> distances<00:00:22.220> but<00:00:22.790> it's<00:00:22.940> also

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
off and landing distances but it's also

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.970 
off and landing distances but it's also
important<00:00:23.750> as<00:00:23.870> to<00:00:24.050> where<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:24.470> canard<00:00:24.800> is

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
important as to where the canard is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.340 
important as to where the canard is
lifting<00:00:25.430> its<00:00:25.550> location<00:00:26.180> because<00:00:26.840> an<00:00:26.960> airplane

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
lifting its location because an airplane

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.440 
lifting its location because an airplane
and<00:00:27.560> level<00:00:27.830> flight<00:00:27.950> has<00:00:28.789> a<00:00:29.180> lot<00:00:29.420> of

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
and level flight has a lot of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.300 
and level flight has a lot of
aerodynamic<00:00:30.140> down<00:00:30.410> load<00:00:30.680> pushing<00:00:31.070> down<00:00:31.280> on

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
aerodynamic down load pushing down on

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.860 
aerodynamic down load pushing down on
the<00:00:31.550> horizontal<00:00:32.029> stabilizer<00:00:32.449> and<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.660> tail

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
the horizontal stabilizer and the tail

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.530 
the horizontal stabilizer and the tail
to<00:00:32.899> balance<00:00:33.379> the<00:00:33.469> airplane<00:00:33.970> flat<00:00:34.970> down<00:00:35.210> load

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
to balance the airplane flat down load

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.810 
to balance the airplane flat down load
on<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.810> tail<00:00:36.020> is<00:00:36.350> also<00:00:36.950> dead<00:00:37.310> weight<00:00:37.520> that<00:00:37.700> the

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
on the tail is also dead weight that the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.639 
on the tail is also dead weight that the
wings<00:00:37.970> have<00:00:38.180> to<00:00:38.329> support<00:00:38.720> so<00:00:39.290> consequently

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
wings have to support so consequently

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.069 
wings have to support so consequently
when<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.160> canard<00:00:40.460> lifts<00:00:40.880> it's<00:00:41.030> good<00:00:41.270> but<00:00:41.930> as

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
when the canard lifts it's good but as

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.810 
when the canard lifts it's good but as
it<00:00:42.290> lifts<00:00:42.590> on<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.829> nose<00:00:43.040> it<00:00:43.460> takes<00:00:43.700> a

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
it lifts on the nose it takes a

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.520 
it lifts on the nose it takes a
corresponding<00:00:44.480> amount<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.840> down<00:00:45.050> load<00:00:45.290> off

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
corresponding amount of down load off

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.229 
corresponding amount of down load off
the<00:00:45.800> tail<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:46.220> it<00:00:46.309> really<00:00:46.489> doubles<00:00:46.940> up<00:00:47.090> the

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
the tail so it really doubles up the

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.389 
the tail so it really doubles up the
lift<00:00:47.450> coefficient<00:00:47.630> and<00:00:48.230> now<00:00:48.800> you've<00:00:48.950> got<00:00:49.130> more

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
lift coefficient and now you've got more

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.400 
lift coefficient and now you've got more
lift<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:50.090> do<00:00:50.210> something<00:00:50.899> productive<00:00:51.050> with

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
lift to do something productive with

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.470 
lift to do something productive with
like<00:00:51.770> slower<00:00:52.280> takeoff<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:52.850> landing<00:00:53.149> shorter

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
like slower takeoff and landing shorter

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.479 
like slower takeoff and landing shorter
distances<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.649> other<00:00:54.770> thing<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.130> canard

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
distances the other thing the canard

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.880 
distances the other thing the canard
does<00:00:55.760> is<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:56.510> allows<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:56.989> fly<00:00:57.200> slow<00:00:57.620> and

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
does is it allows you to fly slow and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.740 
does is it allows you to fly slow and
stay<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.370> very<00:00:58.399> very<00:00:58.700> safe<00:00:59.030> flat<00:00:59.300> attitude

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
stay in a very very safe flat attitude

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.569 
stay in a very very safe flat attitude
it's<00:01:00.230> not<00:01:00.440> like<00:01:00.620> other<00:01:00.770> aircraft<00:01:01.340> that<00:01:01.430> are

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
it's not like other aircraft that are

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.040 
it's not like other aircraft that are
way<00:01:01.730> behind<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.149> power<00:01:02.329> curve<00:01:02.480> with<00:01:02.870> high

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
way behind the power curve with high

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.980 
way behind the power curve with high
angles<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.500> attack<00:01:04.119> if<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:05.299> look<00:01:05.479> at<00:01:05.600> our<00:01:05.749> our

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
angles of attack if you look at our our

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.929 
angles of attack if you look at our our
some<00:01:06.859> of<00:01:06.950> our<00:01:07.069> videos<00:01:07.459> you'll<00:01:07.639> see<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
some of our videos you'll see the

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.489 
some of our videos you'll see the
airplanes<00:01:08.359> coming<00:01:08.630> off<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.020> ground<00:01:09.259> saying

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
airplanes coming off the ground saying

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:12.219 
airplanes coming off the ground saying
the<00:01:09.649> low<00:01:09.770> 30-knot<00:01:10.249> range<00:01:10.549> usually<00:01:10.929> as<00:01:11.929> soon<00:01:12.139> as

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
the low 30-knot range usually as soon as

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.169 
the low 30-knot range usually as soon as
you<00:01:12.319> come<00:01:12.469> off<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.770> ground<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.639> just<00:01:13.880> simply

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
you come off the ground you just simply

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.330 
you come off the ground you just simply
release<00:01:14.569> a<00:01:14.600> little<00:01:14.899> back<00:01:15.139> pressure<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.799> the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
release a little back pressure and the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.550 
release a little back pressure and the
airplane<00:01:16.729> will<00:01:16.880> just<00:01:17.090> automatically<00:01:18.020> rotate

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
airplane will just automatically rotate

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.440 
airplane will just automatically rotate
to<00:01:18.740> kind<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:19.009> a<00:01:19.069> nice<00:01:19.249> safe<00:01:19.579> flat<00:01:19.850> attitude<00:01:20.329> at

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
to kind of a nice safe flat attitude at

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.769 
to kind of a nice safe flat attitude at
about<00:01:20.689> 45<00:01:21.229> knots<00:01:21.549> well<00:01:22.549> at<00:01:22.700> 45<00:01:23.209> knots<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.749> a

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
about 45 knots well at 45 knots and a

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:25.330 
about 45 knots well at 45 knots and a
flat<00:01:24.020> attitude<00:01:24.499> a<00:01:24.649> whole<00:01:24.829> bunch<00:01:25.039> of<00:01:25.189> things

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
flat attitude a whole bunch of things

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.879 
flat attitude a whole bunch of things
occur<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:26.450> first<00:01:26.689> thing<00:01:26.929> is<00:01:27.170> is<00:01:27.319> that<00:01:27.380> 45

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
occur the first thing is is that 45

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.499 
occur the first thing is is that 45
knots<00:01:28.100> if<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.429> have<00:01:28.579> an<00:01:28.670> engine<00:01:28.999> failure<00:01:29.209> you

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
knots if you have an engine failure you

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.330 
knots if you have an engine failure you
can<00:01:29.630> make<00:01:29.779> a<00:01:29.810> safe<00:01:30.109> landing<00:01:30.259> because<00:01:31.189> you're

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
can make a safe landing because you're

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.399 
can make a safe landing because you're
ahead<00:01:31.429> of<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.639> power<00:01:31.849> curve<00:01:32.109> another<00:01:33.109> thing

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
ahead of the power curve another thing

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.499 
ahead of the power curve another thing
that<00:01:33.529> happens<00:01:33.889> is<00:01:34.009> because<00:01:34.369> you're<00:01:34.549> flat<00:01:34.849> the

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
that happens is because you're flat the

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.760 
that happens is because you're flat the
stalling<00:01:35.779> angle<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.319> attack<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.740> still

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
stalling angle the attack is still

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.609 
stalling angle the attack is still
relatively<00:01:37.670> high<00:01:37.939> at<00:01:37.999> about<00:01:38.329> 18<00:01:38.689> degrees<00:01:39.049> so

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
relatively high at about 18 degrees so

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.050 
relatively high at about 18 degrees so
you've<00:01:39.740> got<00:01:39.889> a<00:01:39.920> tremendous<00:01:40.159> amount<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.789> stall

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
you've got a tremendous amount of stall

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.489 
you've got a tremendous amount of stall
resistance<00:01:41.659> in<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.899> airplane

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
resistance in the airplane

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.529 
resistance in the airplane
another<00:01:43.219> thing<00:01:43.459> that<00:01:43.639> occurs<00:01:43.939> is<00:01:44.209> because

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
another thing that occurs is because

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.029 
another thing that occurs is because
you're<00:01:44.719> flat<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.229> air<00:01:45.349> over<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.560> top<00:01:45.649> of<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
you're flat the air over the top of the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.929 
you're flat the air over the top of the
wing<00:01:46.219> is<00:01:46.369> clean

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
wing is clean

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.819 
wing is clean
so<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.450> ailerons<00:01:47.869> work<00:01:48.079> really<00:01:48.319> well<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.709> you

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
so the ailerons work really well and you

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.800 
so the ailerons work really well and you
can<00:01:48.950> maneuver<00:01:49.219> all<00:01:49.729> thing<00:01:50.240> these<00:01:50.509> things

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
can maneuver all thing these things

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.199 
can maneuver all thing these things
occur<00:01:51.139> because<00:01:51.499> of<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.709> canard<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.880> we<00:01:52.999> also

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
occur because of the canard and we also

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.870 
occur because of the canard and we also
found<00:01:53.599> that<00:01:53.779> on<00:01:53.959> Windtunnel<00:01:54.439> testing<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
found that on Windtunnel testing the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.149 
found that on Windtunnel testing the
canard<00:01:56.240> generates<00:01:56.779> as<00:01:56.959> much<00:01:56.990> pitch<00:01:57.529> authority

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
canard generates as much pitch authority

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.889 
canard generates as much pitch authority
as<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.579> elevator<00:01:58.999> on<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.299> tail<00:01:59.509> at<00:01:59.779> an

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
as the elevator on the tail at an

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.379 
as the elevator on the tail at an
approach<00:02:00.200> speed<00:02:00.469> of<00:02:00.560> 45<00:02:00.859> knots<00:02:01.249> so<00:02:02.119> we<00:02:02.239> all

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
approach speed of 45 knots so we all

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.909 
approach speed of 45 knots so we all
know<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.689> sky<00:02:02.929> lanes<00:02:03.169> have<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.409> tendency<00:02:03.889> to

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:03.919 
know the sky lanes have a tendency to

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:05.919 
know the sky lanes have a tendency to
bang<00:02:04.159> up<00:02:04.369> those<00:02:04.609> gears<00:02:04.969> because<00:02:05.209> the<00:02:05.539> elevator

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
bang up those gears because the elevator

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.839 
bang up those gears because the elevator
is<00:02:06.049> relatively<00:02:06.499> ineffective<00:02:06.979> at<00:02:07.249> slow<00:02:07.459> speeds

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
is relatively ineffective at slow speeds

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.760 
is relatively ineffective at slow speeds
this<00:02:08.360> kind<00:02:08.630> of<00:02:08.660> addresses<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.200> issue<00:02:09.560> this

this kind of addresses that issue this

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.500 
this kind of addresses that issue this
gives<00:02:10.040> us<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.280> lot<00:02:10.520> more<00:02:10.550> pitch<00:02:10.910> Authority<00:02:11.420> at

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
gives us a lot more pitch Authority at

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.780 
gives us a lot more pitch Authority at
slow<00:02:11.690> speed<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.800> danger<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.250> banging<00:02:13.610> up<00:02:13.700> a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
slow speed so the danger of banging up a

control wheel pressures are kind of

two-thirds of the pressure required in

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
the flare so for 1/3 the pressure you're

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.729 
the flare so for 1/3 the pressure you're
getting<00:02:38.299> about<00:02:38.480> twice<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.019> pitch<00:02:39.200> Authority

getting about twice the pitch Authority
and<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:39.920> allows<00:02:40.609> you<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.909> fly<00:02:41.090> with<00:02:41.120> your

fingers rather than your arms gives you

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.050

a<00:02:43.010> lot<00:02:43.189> more<00:02:43.220> finesse

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
a lot more finesse

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.470 
a lot more finesse
another<00:02:44.930> area<00:02:45.319> of<00:02:45.409> improvement<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:46.480> the

another area of improvement is the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.330 
another area of improvement is the
canard<00:02:47.840> removes<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.500> lot<00:02:48.769> of<00:02:48.889> the<00:02:48.980> weight<00:02:49.129> from

canard removes a lot of the weight from
the<00:02:49.430> nose<00:02:49.609> gear<00:02:49.849> so<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.569> allows<00:02:50.810> us<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.170> go<00:02:51.290> in

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
the nose gear so it allows us to go in

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.869 
the nose gear so it allows us to go in
