00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
entire ex metal line so now if you go if

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.660 
entire ex metal line so now if you go if
you<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> store<00:01:07.920> you'll<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.490> little

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you go to the store you'll see a little

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
you go to the store you'll see a little
bit<00:01:08.790> different<00:01:09.150> looking<00:01:09.360> box<00:01:09.570> um<00:01:09.900> awkward

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
bit different looking box um awkward

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.500 
bit different looking box um awkward
something<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> box<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.400> awesome<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> opens

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
something the box is awesome it opens

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.249 
something the box is awesome it opens
from<00:01:13.260> both<00:01:13.470> sides<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> then

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
from both sides like this so then

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140 
from both sides like this so then
there's<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:16.650> piece<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.040> box<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
there's one piece of the box which is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
there's one piece of the box which is
pretty<00:01:18.450> cool<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.710> side<00:01:19.890> four<00:01:20.189> ball

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
pretty cool and in this side four ball

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.160 
pretty cool and in this side four ball
so<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> actually<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:21.689> separate<00:01:22.020> pieces

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
so you actually have two separate pieces

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.410 
so you actually have two separate pieces
of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> box<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:24.270> really

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
people don't like this line because they

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.459 
people don't like this line because they
tend<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> fit<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> little<00:02:02.280> tight<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:02.820> head

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
out a little bit but not too much but

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.400

actually the X medals being from the
nose<00:04:22.650> piece<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.550> if<00:04:23.850> you<00:04:24.000> watch<00:04:24.180> closely<00:04:24.419> you

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720

cool
the<00:04:31.390> disadvantage<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.170> is<00:04:32.380> that<00:04:32.560> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
the disadvantage of this is that the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.130 
the disadvantage of this is that the
rivets<00:04:33.130> inside<00:04:33.520> over<00:04:33.790> time<00:04:34.150> will<00:04:35.020> eventually

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
rivets inside over time will eventually

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.170 
rivets inside over time will eventually
start<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.740> wear<00:04:35.890> down<00:04:35.920> and<00:04:36.460> I've<00:04:36.880> seen<00:04:37.060> people

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
start to wear down and I've seen people

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.820 
start to wear down and I've seen people
come<00:04:37.450> in<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.690> store<00:04:37.930> who<00:04:38.350> have<00:04:38.530> had<00:04:38.650> their

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
you can pick them up and just like this

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.960 
you can pick them up and just like this
and<00:04:44.050> they'll<00:04:44.410> almost<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:45.040> arms<00:04:45.370> almost<00:04:45.610> tap

together so but the good thing about

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.370 
together so but the good thing about
another<00:04:49.120> good<00:04:49.510> thing<00:04:49.540> about<00:04:49.690> was<00:04:50.050> spending<00:04:50.320> a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
another good thing about was spending a

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.750 
another good thing about was spending a
little<00:04:50.440> bit<00:04:50.560> more<00:04:50.650> money<00:04:50.980> on<00:04:51.130> getting<00:04:51.700> these

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
little bit more money on getting these

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.870 
little bit more money on getting these

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
after five or six years I think

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.040 
after five or six years I think
overcharged<00:04:57.280> like<00:04:57.520> 40<00:04:57.910> bucks<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.510> they

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
overcharged like 40 bucks and they

that<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:14.260> do<00:05:14.500> lose<00:05:14.710> your<00:05:14.740> frame<00:05:15.130> and<00:05:15.430> in<00:05:15.790> the

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
that you do lose your frame and in the

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.550 
that you do lose your frame and in the
earlier<00:05:16.270> Juliet's<00:05:16.780> they<00:05:17.020> actually<00:05:17.350> came<00:05:17.500> out
