in TDM when i'm going for stuff because

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.209 
in TDM when i'm going for stuff because
a<00:00:39.210> lot<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> people<00:00:39.570> don't<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:41.100> was

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
a lot of people don't do it and it was

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.740 
a lot of people don't do it and it was
people<00:00:41.550> willing<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.850> stay<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.120> search<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
people willing to stay in search and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.510 
people willing to stay in search and
they<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.500> don't<00:00:43.530> hit<00:00:43.770> tedium<00:00:44.070> shots<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
they really don't hit tedium shots that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090 
they really don't hit tedium shots that
much<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.600> definitely<00:00:46.079> definitely<00:00:46.530> prefer

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
much but I definitely definitely prefer

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.430 
much but I definitely definitely prefer
it<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.940> there's<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> couple<00:00:49.289> reasons

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it and there's actually a couple reasons

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.369 
it and there's actually a couple reasons
why<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.640> first<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.239> cousin<00:00:51.750> tedium<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.170> really

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
why the first is cousin tedium I really

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
why the first is cousin tedium I really
think<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.770> control<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.370> game<00:00:53.550> more

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
think you can control the game more

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.200 
think you can control the game more
honestly<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.989> search<00:00:55.350> um<00:00:56.000> if<00:00:57.000> you're

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
honestly like in search um if you're

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.790 
honestly like in search um if you're
going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> take<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> risk<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.620> try

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
going to go out and take a risk to try

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.459 
going to go out and take a risk to try
and<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.280> last<00:00:59.550> person<00:01:00.000> alive<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.660> lot

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
with still kind of pays off another

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.890 
with still kind of pays off another
reason<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.270> trick<00:01:33.630> shots

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
reason I really like to do trick shots

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
reason I really like to do trick shots
is<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:35.340> know<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.670> really

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
is because I don't know you can really

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.109 
is because I don't know you can really
kind<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.210> control<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.439> game<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> uh<00:01:38.729> where

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
you're on another thing is in TDM like I

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.130 
you're on another thing is in TDM like I
was<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.030> saying<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.390> really<00:02:34.540> don't<00:02:34.959> have<00:02:35.050> to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
was just saying you really don't have to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.470 
was just saying you really don't have to
worry<00:02:35.380> about<00:02:35.470> people<00:02:35.739> setting<00:02:36.220> up<00:02:36.340> at<00:02:36.489> all<00:02:36.580> if

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
worry about people setting up at all if

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.540 
worry about people setting up at all if
you<00:02:37.600> get<00:02:37.750> your<00:02:37.900> last<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.440> search<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.070> there's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
you get your last and search and there's

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.460 
you get your last and search and there's
kids<00:02:39.820> setting<00:02:40.180> up<00:02:40.300> or<00:02:40.450> something<00:02:40.810> it

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
kids setting up or something it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.380 
kids setting up or something it
basically<00:02:41.769> just<00:02:42.130> ruins<00:02:42.550> all<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> work<00:02:43.209> that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
basically just ruins all the work that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.990 
basically just ruins all the work that
you<00:02:43.450> put<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.080> get<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.709> round<00:02:45.040> or<00:02:45.370> get

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
you put in to get to that round or get

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.620 
you put in to get to that round or get
to<00:02:46.120> last<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.600> round<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.769> TDM<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.910> lot<00:02:49.540> of

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
to last that round in TDM a lot of

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.400 
to last that round in TDM a lot of
people<00:02:49.840> don't<00:02:49.989> even<00:02:50.080> know<00:02:50.290> what

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
people don't even know what

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.750 
people don't even know what
trickshotting<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:51.040> you're<00:02:51.310> not<00:02:51.459> really<00:02:51.610> gonna

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
trickshotting is you're not really gonna

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.490 
trickshotting is you're not really gonna
run<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.060> risk<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.450> somebody<00:02:52.810> setting<00:02:53.080> up<00:02:53.319> and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
run a risk of somebody setting up and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.650 
run a risk of somebody setting up and
the<00:02:54.069> best<00:02:54.190> part<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.640> if<00:02:54.790> somebody<00:02:55.000> does<00:02:55.330> do

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the best part is if somebody does do

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.710 
the best part is if somebody does do
something<00:02:56.019> stupid<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.440> sets<00:02:56.739> up<00:02:57.150> then<00:02:58.150> you

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
something stupid and sets up then you

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.240 
something stupid and sets up then you
obviously<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.440> just<00:02:59.620> go<00:02:59.769> for<00:02:59.950> one<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.190> the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
obviously can just go for one of the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.620 
obviously can just go for one of the
other<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.580> four<00:03:00.850> people<00:03:01.209> it's<00:03:01.360> gonna<00:03:01.480> be

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
other like four people it's gonna be

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.780 
other like four people it's gonna be
shooting<00:03:01.900> with<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.140> at<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> end<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.610> really

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
shooting with you at the end so really

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.640 
shooting with you at the end so really
there's<00:03:04.030> just<00:03:04.269> less<00:03:04.690> BS<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.110> can<00:03:05.470> mess<00:03:05.620> up

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
there's just less BS that can mess up

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.140 
there's just less BS that can mess up
your<00:03:05.830> chances<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.400> hitting<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.700> shot<00:03:06.730> at<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
your chances of hitting a shot at the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.710 
your chances of hitting a shot at the
end<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:09.549> kids<00:03:09.760> are<00:03:09.880> all<00:03:09.970> going<00:03:10.150> trihard

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
end and the kids are all going trihard

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.170 
end and the kids are all going trihard
just<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.370> when<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.489> hit<00:03:12.549> your<00:03:12.700> shot<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.060> looks

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
just so when you hit your shot it looks

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.780 
just so when you hit your shot it looks
that<00:03:13.420> much<00:03:13.450> sicker<00:03:14.010> yet<00:03:15.010> another<00:03:15.220> reason<00:03:15.340> is

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
that much sicker yet another reason is

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.199 
that much sicker yet another reason is
that<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:16.120> really<00:03:17.110> have<00:03:17.400> control<00:03:18.400> over<00:03:18.820> how

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
that you really have control over how

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.750 
that you really have control over how
much<00:03:19.390> time<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.870> get<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.400> actually<00:03:21.400> get<00:03:21.730> your

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
much time you get to actually get your

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.449 
much time you get to actually get your
shot<00:03:22.090> off<00:03:22.299> if<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:23.380> can<00:03:23.560> manage<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.070> go<00:03:24.250> into<00:03:24.370> a

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
shot off if you can manage to go into a

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.640 
shot off if you can manage to go into a
TDM<00:03:24.880> work<00:03:25.180> honestly<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.930> lot<00:03:26.049> of<00:03:26.200> people<00:03:26.470> are<00:03:26.560> a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
TDM work honestly a lot of people are a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.910 
TDM work honestly a lot of people are a
lot<00:03:26.769> worse<00:03:26.829> than<00:03:27.010> search<00:03:27.640> but<00:03:28.480> if<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.989> can<00:03:29.200> get

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
lot worse than search but if you can get

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.479 
lot worse than search but if you can get
74<00:03:30.670> in<00:03:30.940> less<00:03:31.900> than<00:03:32.079> five<00:03:32.560> minutes<00:03:32.590> or<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.280> and

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
74 in less than five minutes or so and

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.400 
74 in less than five minutes or so and
if<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.600> can<00:03:34.750> do<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:34.870> you're<00:03:35.109> obviously

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
if you can do that you're obviously

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.039 
if you can do that you're obviously
dominating<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.250> other<00:03:36.370> teams<00:03:36.670> so<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.900> you've

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
dominating the other teams so so you've

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.979 
dominating the other teams so so you've
got<00:03:38.079> like<00:03:38.380> five<00:03:38.739> minutes<00:03:39.100> straight<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.989> like

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
got like five minutes straight and like

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.170 
got like five minutes straight and like
a<00:03:41.019> 30<00:03:41.380> kill<00:03:41.680> leave<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.579> basically<00:03:42.940> leaves

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
a 30 kill leave that basically leaves

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.000 
a 30 kill leave that basically leaves
you<00:03:43.420> with<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:43.989> much<00:03:44.290> more<00:03:44.590> time<00:03:44.799> than<00:03:44.829> you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
you with so much more time than you

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.490 
you with so much more time than you
could<00:03:45.190> possibly<00:03:45.220> get<00:03:45.850> in<00:03:46.000> search<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:47.320> lets

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
could possibly get in search and it lets

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.099 
could possibly get in search and it lets
you<00:03:47.590> try<00:03:47.920> out<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.100> ton<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.430> new<00:03:48.670> things<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.450> a
