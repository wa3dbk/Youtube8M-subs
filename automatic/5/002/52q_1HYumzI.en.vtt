00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
up which will raise up all the library

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.060 
up which will raise up all the library
books<00:00:18.510> now<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> reason<00:00:19.529> you'd<00:00:19.650> want<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.980> is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
books now the reason you'd want that is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.880 
books now the reason you'd want that is
because<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.630> now<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:22.260> adjust<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because you so now we can adjust the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.439 
because you so now we can adjust the
enchantment<00:00:23.400> level<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.789> right<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.330> got

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
enchantment level so right there you got

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
enchantment level so right there you got
level<00:00:24.720> 30<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.260> then<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.920> course<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.279> down<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
level 30 and then of course all down and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700 
level 30 and then of course all down and
you<00:00:26.880> can't<00:00:27.150> enchant<00:00:27.480> anything<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.230> maybe<00:00:28.500> if

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you can't enchant anything so maybe if

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.200 
you can't enchant anything so maybe if
you're<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.369> map<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.699> could<00:00:29.820> hide<00:00:30.000> those

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
you're in a map you could hide those

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.540 
you're in a map you could hide those
buttons<00:00:30.539> somewhere<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.740> anyways<00:00:32.070> um<00:00:32.309> what's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
buttons somewhere but anyways um what's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.400 
buttons somewhere but anyways um what's
special<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.630> took<00:00:34.170> me<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
special about this one that took me the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
special about this one that took me the
most<00:00:34.559> time<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.980> make<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.570> put<00:00:36.600> down

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
most time to make is a you can put down

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
most time to make is a you can put down
one<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> library<00:00:38.219> shelves<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> time

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
one of the library shelves at a time

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.729 
one of the library shelves at a time
it's<00:00:39.660> kind<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.899> weird<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.230> does<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> there

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
it's kind of weird how it does it there

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.369 
it's kind of weird how it does it there
but<00:00:40.890> yeah<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.430> how<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.670> does<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.030> so

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
but yeah you can see how it does that so

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.229 
but yeah you can see how it does that so
now<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.710> set<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.010> block<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
now you can just set that block and you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.700 
now you can just set that block and you
can<00:00:45.390> adjust<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> whatever<00:00:46.110> level<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.680> want

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
can adjust it to whatever level you want

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.549 
can adjust it to whatever level you want
so<00:00:47.280> let's<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.940> say<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.239> um<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
so let's just say your um one of the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
so let's just say your um one of the
reasons<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.950> did<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.640> let's<00:00:50.879> say

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
reasons I did this is like let's say

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.840 
reasons I did this is like let's say
you're<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> little<00:00:51.559> 24<00:00:52.559> 28<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.430> something<00:00:53.730> high

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
20s you won't be able to enchant

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.900 
20s you won't be able to enchant
anything<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> when<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
anything just because the when it's a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.900 
anything just because the when it's a
full<00:01:00.289> enchanting<00:01:01.289> table<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.890> max<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.309> 30<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
full enchanting table the max is 30 and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.770 
full enchanting table the max is 30 and
there<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.080> aren't<00:01:04.379> any<00:01:04.619> 20s<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
there really aren't any 20s in the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.660 
there really aren't any 20s in the
options<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> now

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
options so what you can do with this now

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.289 
options so what you can do with this now
is<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.170> adjust<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.729> level<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.850> people<00:01:12.000> can

is a adjust the level that people can
enchant<00:01:12.710> or<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.920> could<00:01:14.070> put<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.549> an

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
enchant or you could put this on an

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
enchant or you could put this on an
adventure<00:01:14.970> map<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> maybe<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.140> where

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
adventure map and maybe have it where

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.249 
adventure map and maybe have it where
like<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.390> players<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:19.049> more

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
like I don't know as players get more

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
like I don't know as players get more
and<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.619> things<00:01:20.159> done<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.670> more<00:01:20.820> progress

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and more things done and more progress

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.960 
and more things done and more progress
on<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> map<00:01:21.799> like<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> main<00:01:23.700> craft

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
on the map like this is the main craft

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
on the map like this is the main craft
the<00:01:24.360> main<00:01:24.600> enchantment<00:01:25.140> table<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> will

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the main enchantment table and it will

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.340 
the main enchantment table and it will
unlock<00:01:26.100> more<00:01:26.689> powerful<00:01:27.689> enchantment<00:01:27.810> for

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
unlock more powerful enchantment for

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
unlock more powerful enchantment for
them<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.090> kind<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
them as they go and then it's kind of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.420 
them as they go and then it's kind of
laggy<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.920> button<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.310> if

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
laggy just because that's a button so if

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.679 
laggy just because that's a button so if
you<00:01:32.490> want<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> speed<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.479> just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
you want to speed it up you can just

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
you want to speed it up you can just
have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.259> lever<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> flick<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
have a little lever that you flick and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700 
have a little lever that you flick and
it'll<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> bit<00:01:36.000> faster<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it'll be a bit faster so then now you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.960 
it'll be a bit faster so then now you
can<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> stand<00:01:38.909> here

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
can see you can just going to stand here

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.080 
can see you can just going to stand here
flick<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> lever<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.880> lower<00:01:41.880> them

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
flick the lever and it will lower them

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
flick the lever and it will lower them
down<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.770> alright<00:01:43.770> well<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
down for you alright well I'm going to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.859 
down for you alright well I'm going to
strip<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.820> down<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.509> show<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.689> guys

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
strip this down so I can show you guys

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.550 
strip this down so I can show you guys
how<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> works

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
how it works

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.210 
how it works
all<00:01:47.369> right<00:01:47.820> here<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.320> stripped

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
all right here is the kind of stripped

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.679 
all right here is the kind of stripped
down<00:01:50.280> version<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> still<00:01:51.630> has

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
down version so you can see it still has

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
down version so you can see it still has
the<00:01:51.960> same<00:01:52.140> basic<00:01:52.350> controls<00:01:52.799> back<00:01:52.979> here<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.399> in

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the same basic controls back here all in

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.260 
the same basic controls back here all in
this<00:01:54.240> jumbled<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.140> redstone<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.579> anyways<00:01:57.030> on

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
this jumbled up redstone so anyways on

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630 
this jumbled up redstone so anyways on
this<00:01:57.509> little<00:01:57.899> part<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.950> master

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
this little part here this is the master

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.969 
this little part here this is the master
of<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.259> backbone<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of this is the you know backbone of the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.670 
of this is the you know backbone of the
whole<00:02:02.130> setup<00:02:02.570> what<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
whole setup what this is it's it's a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.210 
whole setup what this is it's it's a
little<00:02:05.329> well<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.479> let<00:02:06.630> me<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.840> show<00:02:06.930> you

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
little well here let me just show you

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.070 
little well here let me just show you
you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.369> start<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.720> contain

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
you can start it up and it will contain

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.330 
you can start it up and it will contain
like<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.649> signal<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.610> some<00:02:12.000> power<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.110> we

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
like a signal of some power and then we

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.830 
like a signal of some power and then we
you<00:02:13.370> can<00:02:13.519> do<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.879> when<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.269> flip<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.660> switch

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
you can do is when you flip this switch

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.540 
you can do is when you flip this switch
it<00:02:15.230> will<00:02:15.319> send<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.590> little<00:02:15.800> pulse<00:02:15.980> into<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.400> and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
it will send a little pulse into it and

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.479 
it will send a little pulse into it and
decrease<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.599> circuits<00:02:18.200> power<00:02:18.470> like<00:02:19.099> it's<00:02:19.310> a

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
decrease that circuits power like it's a

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.759 
decrease that circuits power like it's a
signal<00:02:19.849> strength<00:02:20.120> by<00:02:20.300> one<00:02:20.569> so<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.650> just

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
signal strength by one so you can just

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.979 
signal strength by one so you can just
keep<00:02:21.950> doing<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.700> you'll<00:02:23.660> see<00:02:23.870> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
keep doing this and you'll see the

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.930 
keep doing this and you'll see the
redstone<00:02:24.440> there<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:24.950> getting<00:02:25.160> kind<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.580> darker

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
redstone there is getting kind of darker

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.940 
redstone there is getting kind of darker
so<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.840> from<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.170> weakening<00:02:27.739> and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
so that's just from it weakening and

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.699 
so that's just from it weakening and
then<00:02:28.730> right<00:02:28.940> here<00:02:28.970> what<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.810> does<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.560> goes

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
then right here what it does is it goes

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.920 
then right here what it does is it goes
into<00:02:30.739> this<00:02:31.209> comparator<00:02:32.209> right<00:02:32.360> here<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.690> cuts

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
into this comparator right here and cuts

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.780 
into this comparator right here and cuts
off<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.319> loop<00:02:33.560> that's<00:02:34.040> going<00:02:34.459> on<00:02:34.549> right<00:02:34.610> now

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
off the loop that's going on right now

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.210 
off the loop that's going on right now
and<00:02:35.319> causes<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.799> turn<00:02:36.950> everything

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
and causes it to just turn everything

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.770 
and causes it to just turn everything
off<00:02:38.290> all<00:02:39.290> right<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.940> about<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.360> main

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
off all right so it's about the main

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.780 
off all right so it's about the main
guts<00:02:42.019> of<00:02:42.200> how<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.470> thing<00:02:42.650> works<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.280> now

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
guts of how this thing works so now

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.030 
guts of how this thing works so now
let's<00:02:44.030> build<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.530> right<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.680> you're<00:02:45.829> going<00:02:45.950> to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
let's build it right so you're going to

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.000 
let's build it right so you're going to
start<00:02:46.280> out<00:02:46.430> with<00:02:46.780> 15<00:02:47.780> Pistons<00:02:48.349> in<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.799> kind

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
start out with 15 Pistons in this kind

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.309 
start out with 15 Pistons in this kind
of<00:02:49.130> shape<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:49.670> five<00:02:50.180> across<00:02:50.450> up<00:02:50.750> here<00:02:51.019> then

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
of shape so five across up here then

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.470 
of shape so five across up here then
five<00:02:51.799> across<00:02:52.069> on<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.459> side<00:02:52.670> five<00:02:52.910> across<00:02:53.209> and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
five across on that side five across and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.020 
five across on that side five across and
then<00:02:53.599> just<00:02:54.560> leave<00:02:54.709> one<00:02:54.980> open<00:02:55.160> right<00:02:55.519> here<00:02:55.760> is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
then just leave one open right here is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.339 
then just leave one open right here is
that's<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.540> because<00:02:56.690> we<00:02:56.840> don't<00:02:56.989> need<00:02:57.170> that

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
that's just because we don't need that

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.890 
that's just because we don't need that
one<00:02:57.530> anyways<00:02:57.739> then<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:58.489> place<00:02:58.970> library<00:02:59.450> or

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
one anyways then just place library or

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.390 
one anyways then just place library or
bookshelves<00:03:00.500> whatever<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.010> want<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.250> call

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
bookshelves whatever you want to call

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.780 
bookshelves whatever you want to call
them<00:03:01.459> on<00:03:01.640> top<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.629> Pistons<00:03:03.019> here<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.790> hold

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
them on top of the Pistons here and hold

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.890 
them on top of the Pistons here and hold
up<00:03:04.910> let<00:03:05.060> me<00:03:05.120> just<00:03:05.269> set<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.480> time<00:03:05.629> today<00:03:05.810> for

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
up let me just set the time today for

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.500 
up let me just set the time today for
you<00:03:06.140> guys<00:03:06.610> right<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.790> then<00:03:08.000> now<00:03:08.209> what<00:03:08.360> we're

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
you guys right and then now what we're

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.940 
you guys right and then now what we're
going<00:03:08.629> to<00:03:08.660> do<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:09.140> we're<00:03:09.379> just<00:03:09.530> kind<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.829> going

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
going to do is we're just kind of going

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.770 
going to do is we're just kind of going
to<00:03:10.160> UM<00:03:12.040> create<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.480> circuitry<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.569> powers

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
to UM create the circuitry that powers

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.860 
to UM create the circuitry that powers
these<00:03:15.260> things<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.940> signal<00:03:17.329> strength<00:03:17.630> of

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
these things so the signal strength of

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.629 
these things so the signal strength of
the<00:03:18.139> of<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.889> wire<00:03:19.069> we're<00:03:19.310> going<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.489> have

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
the of the wire we're going to have

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.670 
the of the wire we're going to have
running<00:03:19.940> around<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.239> whole<00:03:20.480> thing<00:03:20.840> has<00:03:21.440> to

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
running around this whole thing has to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.830 
running around this whole thing has to
be<00:03:21.769> able<00:03:21.859> to<00:03:22.010> decrease<00:03:22.609> as<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:23.030> go<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.630> can't

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
be able to decrease as it go so it can't

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.690 
be able to decrease as it go so it can't
be<00:03:23.959> renewed<00:03:24.319> by<00:03:24.530> repeaters<00:03:25.069> if<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.519> makes

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
be renewed by repeaters if that makes

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.190 
be renewed by repeaters if that makes
sense

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
sense

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.710 
sense
so<00:03:27.200> what<00:03:27.470> we're<00:03:27.560> going<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.709> do<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.160> um<00:03:28.720> first

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
so what we're going to do is um first

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.440 
so what we're going to do is um first
put<00:03:30.079> a<00:03:30.260> repeater<00:03:30.950> into<00:03:31.430> each<00:03:31.609> oh<00:03:31.910> whoops<00:03:32.209> I'm

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
put a repeater into each oh whoops I'm

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.259 
put a repeater into each oh whoops I'm
this<00:03:32.720> up<00:03:32.930> okay<00:03:33.549> just<00:03:34.549> have<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.730> brain<00:03:35.090> fart

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
this up okay just have a brain fart

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.550 
this up okay just have a brain fart
there<00:03:35.540> anyway<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:35.989> you're<00:03:36.230> going<00:03:36.349> to<00:03:36.410> put<00:03:36.530> a

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
there anyway so you're going to put a

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.140 
there anyway so you're going to put a
repeater<00:03:36.799> into<00:03:37.069> each<00:03:37.220> one<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.489> these<00:03:37.700> Pistons

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
repeater into each one of these Pistons

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.059 
repeater into each one of these Pistons
here<00:03:38.299> I'll<00:03:38.510> just<00:03:38.540> do<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:39.019> off<00:03:39.260> camera<00:03:39.319> real

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
here I'll just do that off camera real

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.030 
here I'll just do that off camera real
quick<00:03:40.340> like<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:41.810> there's<00:03:42.139> the<00:03:42.319> repeaters<00:03:42.769> so

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
quick like so there's the repeaters so

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.680 
quick like so there's the repeaters so
you<00:03:43.489> can<00:03:43.609> see<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.819> got<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.209> know<00:03:44.299> four<00:03:44.569> on

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
you can see you got you know four on

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.500 
you can see you got you know four on
each<00:03:44.840> side<00:03:45.109> and<00:03:45.470> then<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.790> keep<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.180> bit

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
each side and then to just keep it a bit

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.930 
each side and then to just keep it a bit
more<00:03:47.720> calm<00:03:47.930> compact<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.919> did<00:03:49.069> a<00:03:49.099> this<00:03:49.549> on<00:03:49.760> this

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
more calm compact I did a this on this

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.520 
more calm compact I did a this on this
side<00:03:50.180> where<00:03:50.389> instead<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:50.959> having<00:03:51.109> a<00:03:51.230> repeater

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
side where instead of having a repeater

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.949 
side where instead of having a repeater
right<00:03:51.739> here<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.160> have<00:03:52.880> two<00:03:53.150> repeaters<00:03:53.569> facing

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
right here I have two repeaters facing

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.259 
right here I have two repeaters facing
into<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.230> block<00:03:54.500> there<00:03:54.709> I'm<00:03:55.639> sure<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.150> make

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
into a block there I'm sure you can make

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.599 
into a block there I'm sure you can make
this<00:03:56.419> design<00:03:56.750> way<00:03:56.959> more<00:03:57.169> compact<00:03:57.620> if<00:03:57.919> you<00:03:58.099> took

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
this design way more compact if you took

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.069 
this design way more compact if you took
the<00:03:58.760> time<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.120> but<00:03:59.359> I'm<00:03:59.540> just<00:03:59.900> kind<00:04:00.049> of

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
the time to but I'm just kind of

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.900 
the time to but I'm just kind of
focusing<00:04:00.530> on<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.799> main<00:04:00.980> efficiency<00:04:01.639> of<00:04:01.760> it

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
focusing on the main efficiency of it

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.000 
focusing on the main efficiency of it
but<00:04:02.150> anyways<00:04:03.049> once<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.650> have<00:04:03.769> all<00:04:03.889> that

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
but anyways once you have all that

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.589 
but anyways once you have all that
you're<00:04:04.940> going<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.120> bring<00:04:05.269> some<00:04:05.419> redstone

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
you're going to bring some redstone

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.240 
you're going to bring some redstone
around<00:04:06.049> we're<00:04:06.260> going<00:04:06.349> to<00:04:06.440> mess<00:04:06.980> with<00:04:07.130> this

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
around we're going to mess with this

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.220 
around we're going to mess with this
redstone<00:04:07.609> a<00:04:07.730> little<00:04:08.060> bit<00:04:08.209> more<00:04:08.419> so<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.930> isn't

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
redstone a little bit more so this isn't

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.280 
redstone a little bit more so this isn't
going<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.410> be<00:04:09.500> permanent<00:04:10.040> at<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.310> moment<00:04:11.290> okay

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
going to be permanent at the moment okay

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.309 
going to be permanent at the moment okay
once<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.560> have<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:13.359> destroy<00:04:14.359> three<00:04:14.989> blocks

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
once you have that destroy three blocks

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.900 
once you have that destroy three blocks
there<00:04:15.560> at<00:04:15.799> each<00:04:15.950> corner<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.519> what<00:04:16.789> you're

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
there at each corner and what you're

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.520 
there at each corner and what you're
going<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.090> do<00:04:17.269> is<00:04:17.450> put<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.780> two<00:04:18.049> comparators

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
going to do is put in two comparators

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.789 
going to do is put in two comparators
and<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:19.489> block<00:04:19.789> like<00:04:20.090> so<00:04:20.389> so<00:04:21.320> what<00:04:21.440> that's<00:04:21.560> going

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
and a block like so so what that's going

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.680 
and a block like so so what that's going
to<00:04:21.859> do<00:04:22.039> is<00:04:22.310> it's<00:04:22.580> going<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.789> stop<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.360> signal

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
to do is it's going to stop the signal

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.770 
to do is it's going to stop the signal
strength<00:04:24.110> from<00:04:24.260> weak<00:04:24.560> and

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
strength from weak and

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.560 
strength from weak and
when<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.350> goes<00:04:25.560> around<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.920> corners<00:04:26.280> here<00:04:26.570> so

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
when it goes around the corners here so

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.629 
when it goes around the corners here so
obviously<00:04:27.930> from<00:04:28.170> right<00:04:28.320> here<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.620> right<00:04:28.830> here

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
obviously from right here to right here

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.180 
obviously from right here to right here
we<00:04:29.850> only<00:04:29.970> want<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.420> weaken<00:04:30.690> by<00:04:30.840> one<00:04:31.170> I<00:04:31.410> don't

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
we only want it to weaken by one I don't

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.070 
we only want it to weaken by one I don't
really<00:04:32.310> know<00:04:32.610> what<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.970> unit<00:04:33.660> is<00:04:33.750> for

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
really know what the unit is for

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.400 
really know what the unit is for
redstone<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:34.710> just<00:04:35.160> signal<00:04:35.610> strength<00:04:36.200> is<00:04:37.200> this

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
redstone so just signal strength is this

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.320 
redstone so just signal strength is this
once<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:37.950> got<00:04:38.130> all<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.400> you're<00:04:38.700> you're<00:04:39.210> kind

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
once you got all that you're you're kind

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.659 
once you got all that you're you're kind
of<00:04:39.450> already<00:04:39.870> almost<00:04:40.080> done<00:04:40.320> what<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:41.340> you

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
of already almost done what you you

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.550 
of already almost done what you you
could<00:04:41.880> do<00:04:42.030> at<00:04:42.300> this<00:04:42.510> point<00:04:42.720> just<00:04:42.930> kind<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.200> have

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
could do at this point just kind of have

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.830 
could do at this point just kind of have
a<00:04:43.620> line<00:04:44.580> of<00:04:44.610> redstone<00:04:45.000> going<00:04:45.419> out<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.810> just

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
a line of redstone going out and just

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.379 
a line of redstone going out and just
put<00:04:46.800> levers<00:04:47.400> all<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.790> way<00:04:47.880> around<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.300> you

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
put levers all the way around and you

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.270 
put levers all the way around and you
see<00:04:48.510> this<00:04:48.660> one<00:04:48.840> powers<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.200> up<00:04:49.350> that<00:04:49.770> much<00:04:49.980> and

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
see this one powers it up that much and

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.950 
see this one powers it up that much and
then<00:04:50.370> if<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.550> put<00:04:50.760> one<00:04:50.940> all<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.270> way<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.690> the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
then if I put one all the way in the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.720 
then if I put one all the way in the
center<00:04:52.260> here<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.830> will<00:04:52.950> power<00:04:53.160> everything<00:04:53.490> up

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
center here it will power everything up

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.080 
center here it will power everything up
oh<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:55.860> then<00:04:55.950> of<00:04:56.070> course<00:04:56.130> you're<00:04:56.940> going<00:04:57.030> to

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
oh and then of course you're going to

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.210 
oh and then of course you're going to
want<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.330> put<00:04:57.480> your<00:04:57.690> enchanting<00:04:58.680> table<00:04:58.890> right

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
want to put your enchanting table right

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.659 
want to put your enchanting table right
here<00:04:59.460> so<00:04:59.790> one<00:05:00.060> layer<00:05:00.210> above<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.570> bookshelves

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
here so one layer above the bookshelves

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.580 
here so one layer above the bookshelves
well<00:05:02.669> anyways<00:05:02.970> now<00:05:03.180> it's<00:05:03.930> time<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.110> actually

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
well anyways now it's time to actually

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.060 
well anyways now it's time to actually
build<00:05:05.040> our<00:05:05.900> signal<00:05:06.900> strength<00:05:07.200> mechanism<00:05:07.800> so

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
build our signal strength mechanism so

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.760 
build our signal strength mechanism so
start<00:05:08.760> out<00:05:08.820> with<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.230> comparator<00:05:10.230> facing<00:05:10.590> this

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
start out with a comparator facing this

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.030 
start out with a comparator facing this
way<00:05:10.980> and<00:05:11.310> this<00:05:12.210> way<00:05:12.450> then<00:05:13.200> a<00:05:13.230> block<00:05:13.620> up<00:05:13.830> right

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
way and this way then a block up right

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.140 
way and this way then a block up right
there<00:05:15.020> redstone<00:05:16.020> here<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.410> here<00:05:16.910> then<00:05:17.910> we<00:05:18.120> are

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
there redstone here and here then we are

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.600 
there redstone here and here then we are
going<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.479> have<00:05:18.860> comparator<00:05:19.860> there<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.370> there

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
going to have comparator there and there

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.730 
going to have comparator there and there
this<00:05:21.030> one<00:05:21.330> need<00:05:21.630> to<00:05:21.780> click<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.140> it<00:05:22.410> in<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.710> a

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
this one need to click it it in to a

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.840 
this one need to click it it in to a
subtraction<00:05:23.280> mode<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:24.350> walk<00:05:25.350> there<00:05:25.850> redstone

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
subtraction mode and walk there redstone

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.870 
subtraction mode and walk there redstone
and<00:05:27.030> redstone<00:05:27.680> alright<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:28.919> there<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.669> go<00:05:29.850> so

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
and redstone alright so there you go so

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.969 
and redstone alright so there you go so
right<00:05:30.360> here<00:05:30.690> this<00:05:30.930> block<00:05:31.380> right<00:05:31.560> here<00:05:31.620> is<00:05:31.860> the

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
right here this block right here is the

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.520 
right here this block right here is the
one<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.190> need<00:05:32.460> to<00:05:32.580> power<00:05:32.790> up<00:05:33.090> in<00:05:33.690> order<00:05:34.290> to

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
one you need to power up in order to

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.320 
one you need to power up in order to
turn<00:05:34.770> everything<00:05:35.130> on<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:35.729> you<00:05:35.790> can<00:05:36.000> see<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.150> can

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
turn everything on so you can see I can

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.560 
turn everything on so you can see I can
power<00:05:36.570> that<00:05:36.780> up<00:05:36.900> there<00:05:37.110> there<00:05:37.590> it<00:05:37.710> goes<00:05:37.860> and

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
power that up there there it goes and

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.540 
power that up there there it goes and
then<00:05:39.570> this<00:05:41.210> line<00:05:42.210> right<00:05:42.419> here<00:05:42.479> is<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:44.370> one<00:05:44.520> you

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
then this line right here is the one you

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.029 
then this line right here is the one you
need<00:05:44.880> to<00:05:45.330> power<00:05:45.690> up<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.140> turn<00:05:46.289> everything<00:05:46.710> off

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
need to power up to turn everything off

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.029 
need to power up to turn everything off
like<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:48.260> all<00:05:49.260> right<00:05:49.350> and<00:05:49.500> then<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.890> little

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
like so all right and then that little

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.010 
like so all right and then that little
decreasing<00:05:51.000> thing<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.390> made<00:05:51.660> for<00:05:51.960> the

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
decreasing thing that I made for the

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.990 
decreasing thing that I made for the
other<00:05:52.110> one<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:53.010> way<00:05:53.130> you<00:05:53.190> do<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.580> is<00:05:53.820> we're

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
other one the way you do that is we're

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.330 
other one the way you do that is we're
going<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.150> make<00:05:54.240> a<00:05:54.300> monostable<00:05:54.840> circuit<00:05:55.500> so<00:05:55.710> in

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
going to make a monostable circuit so in

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.800 
going to make a monostable circuit so in
English<00:05:56.700> that<00:05:56.910> just<00:05:57.120> means<00:05:57.300> something<00:05:57.570> that

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
English that just means something that

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.710 
English that just means something that
releases<00:05:58.260> a<00:05:58.289> redstone<00:05:58.680> pulse<00:05:59.360> so<00:06:00.360> place<00:06:00.570> down

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
releases a redstone pulse so place down

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.779 
releases a redstone pulse so place down
repeaters<00:06:01.169> in<00:06:01.200> this<00:06:01.440> configuration<00:06:02.190> set<00:06:02.610> that

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
repeaters in this configuration set that

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.610 
repeaters in this configuration set that
one<00:06:02.970> to<00:06:03.180> two<00:06:03.330> tick<00:06:03.539> delay<00:06:03.660> put<00:06:04.320> some<00:06:04.470> redstone

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
one to two tick delay put some redstone

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.190 
one to two tick delay put some redstone
here<00:06:05.130> and<00:06:05.310> then<00:06:05.460> this<00:06:06.060> is<00:06:06.390> going<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.870> be<00:06:06.990> your

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
here and then this is going to be your

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.230 
here and then this is going to be your
little<00:06:07.460> decrement<00:06:08.460> or<00:06:08.610> so<00:06:08.729> when<00:06:08.880> we<00:06:08.970> turn<00:06:09.090> it

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
little decrement or so when we turn it

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.830 
little decrement or so when we turn it
on<00:06:09.330> and<00:06:10.820> then<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:11.850> can<00:06:12.300> see<00:06:12.450> you<00:06:12.570> can<00:06:12.690> just

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
on and then you can see you can just

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.469 
on and then you can see you can just
flick<00:06:13.020> this<00:06:13.229> and<00:06:13.470> it<00:06:13.650> will<00:06:13.850> lower<00:06:14.850> one<00:06:15.150> of<00:06:15.180> them

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
flick this and it will lower one of them

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.170 
flick this and it will lower one of them
it<00:06:16.440> kind<00:06:16.530> of<00:06:16.620> Louis<00:06:16.860> -<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:17.280> then<00:06:17.400> pops<00:06:17.729> one<00:06:18.090> of

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
it kind of Louis - and then pops one of

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.810 
it kind of Louis - and then pops one of
them<00:06:18.330> back<00:06:18.479> up<00:06:18.690> but<00:06:18.930> still<00:06:19.260> works<00:06:19.440> just<00:06:19.500> fine

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
them back up but still works just fine

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.860 
them back up but still works just fine
all<00:06:20.820> right<00:06:20.850> well<00:06:21.120> that's<00:06:21.360> about<00:06:21.600> all<00:06:21.780> I<00:06:21.810> got
