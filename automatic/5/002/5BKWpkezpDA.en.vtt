00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.110
 bit late as the video I'm going 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.660

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.410
 publishers' partnership during the month of 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.960
 January 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.900
 this same book publisher can 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.650
 take the story to the question she has a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.260
 very very special affection for the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 diagramming books it public 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.820
 and can take a very very good book 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 even already have his password on the blog is 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.380
 a book full of cute illustrations with 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.219
 more story had no story 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.620
 a very beautiful life lesson and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.980
 to know the intrinsic history of the book 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.930
 circle in this book even though he 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.120
 It is not exaggerating the blog but 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.460
 a very very good level 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.309
 The story is fascinating to full of 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.469
 mystery is complex is a book that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.469
 You can not even give up. 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.960
 the one breathed while reading 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.369
 not to mention that his recording is very 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.360
 very well done even on the cover against 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.509
 cover has one of the maps 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 I'm very very anxious to 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.920
 continuation of this book 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.070
 very worth the mega recommended 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.229
 also of the intrinsic history of 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.130
 continuation of the kingdom made form 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.540
 bone following it's blood day 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.610
 and stars 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.409
 I have not read the first book yet 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.450
 I asked the second because I know that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.909
 usually when these books are 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.340
 part of a trilogy you read the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.920
 first you already want the second then already 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.540
 I requested the second I started reading the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.329
 first I'm really enjoying the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.799
 So I guess I will not go. 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.670
 disappointed with the book says and I 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.259
 you from an Italian writer 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.380
 the book is very good another book that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.740
 I already read but I have not received the blog yet 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.509
 beyond the cover when you look at 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.360
 to appear you think the book is a 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.510
 story is a novel but when you 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.420
 begin to read the story you realize that 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.880
 will not 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.880
 much more than a novel in reality is 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.670
 a complex book with characters who 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.760
 end up captivating you in some way 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.830
 so it 's an exciting beautiful story 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.830
 very beautiful and it's a book that I 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.630
 I devoured in three hours. 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.150
 time I got stuck in the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.770
 Sao Paulo , this book is the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.739
 this recommendation mainly because it is 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.989
 very fine to receive from the lighthouse publisher 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.260
 literary the book that was very 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.970
 anxious to read that the fragmented 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.560
 fragmented reboot continuation 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.160
 which is already been reviewed in the blog 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.680
 started is a fantastic story 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.489
 Wonderful, I think it's one of mine. 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.040
 Favorites of the year and I was without much 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.319
 very anxious to read fragmented and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.860
 now it is probably already reading 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.730
 confirmed the following February 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.660
 3 more three most part series 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.580
 Girl loves a boy who has a total 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.160
 six books five books I do not have 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.590
 sure I played two books in the series is 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.480
 the third in a very light series 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.549
 fun about teens and their 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.739
 their problems their high and 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.370
 for those who love stories 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.310
 and the recommendation of the story I want 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.070
 I only listened to two books books I sang 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.590
 I was not anxious but I was curious 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.359
 to check one of them is the first 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.310
 book of a trilogy that conquered 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.570
 many readers in the literary universe 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.540
 what the hell is gabriel 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.730
 I was always curious about this. 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.609
 story but I never felt like it 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.090
 I bought it until I decided to ask the 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.530
 first book by the publisher and I should 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.450
 reading this book I fell in love with 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.560
 story I was delighted with the 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.049
 characters 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.000
 I'm practically running through 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.769
 bookstore buy the other two 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.350
 The good thing is that this trilogy has already been 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.510
 then you do not have that issue 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.590
 waiting for the launch of the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.070
 continuation 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.820
 It's super recommendation for those who like it 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.820
 those not so childish those novels 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.910
 calientes adult novels is 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.780
 recommendation 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.980
 and finally request 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.720
 infected is also the first book of 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.680
 a trilogy if I'm not mistaken of a 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.270
 new series launched by archer publisher 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.730
 and the first thing that called me to 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.500
 attention on this link was the cover very well 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.320
 done you can feel the whim of 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.480
 publisher ends the story seems to be 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.220
 very good start in this book in 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.380
 January but I had to stop then 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.160
 probably now in February back 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.730
 read it 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.470
 But I'm going to have to start all of it. 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.780
 because I no longer remember the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.790
 first chapters but to be a 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.220
