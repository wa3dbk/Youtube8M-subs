00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.789
 we are not here in half an hour of the road 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.789
 it's 12 hours 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.860
 5 minutes to start the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.720
 match between america and tigers and all 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.180
 these people who made the trip from new 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.070
 lion does not have access to tickets anymore 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.260
 they are here they are already in the Aztec stadium 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.640
 in Europe they charge that to see the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.309
 barcelona is an injustice 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.720
 come down we travel 14 hours to be here 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.489
 because they have us here is an injustice 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.020
 I'm seeing the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.260
 cooperation to get the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.260
 goals 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:11.840
 they are here the fake tickets are 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.840
 they sold tickets to 400 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.210
 good because because this is very hard 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.280
 you are very courageous what we bring 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.979
 because I tell you it's 12 hours on the road 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 they gave us a lot of spin in the state of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.040
 Mexico 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 We were all hours traveling to 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.030
 get here and tell us it's fake 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.740
 all these people that can be seen here 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.750
 tigers who have traveled 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.640
 from a new lion they are outside the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 stadium I reiterate the match and started and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 these people are out here without having a 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.330
 ticket to access we will do 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.000

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.070
 Accreditation lend me your ticket I already say 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.960

 I'll return it to you for if it's false 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.450

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.550
 courage 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.970

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.970
