00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.100
 good friends of youtube you work them that 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.950
 continue to do the third part of the 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.320
 microcredit as you will see I'm going to 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.930
 question that is this and I already have 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.670
 torches 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.670
 I found this 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.220
 that's finding charcoal 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:27.070
 and a coal can be then 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.070
 and now that we are already enlightened 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.410
 well obviously there can not be 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.790
 parts were complicated by a failure of 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.160
 edit and average so 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.370
 so everything found so I 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.649
 liked nothing more 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.309
 so things can tell me 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.309
 his hands 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.820
 in a while bastards 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.820
 I'm going to create a trap 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.030
 that's I have one for success for 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.020
 I'm going to create a spade for that meeting 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.020
 something 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 I think it happened what the hell 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.210
 but what the hell game 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.340
 motherfucker 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.530
 to see that I'm also going to start looking 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.220
 a blue track 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.840
 and it 's okay now blue to create the one of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.780
 the nation 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.210
 the truth that I am not inventing 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.359
 objectives because this series has some 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.359
 sense 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.260
 good if they saw the garden 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.870
 and well I also found the air 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.119
 all right 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.410
 and he is doing at night with 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.819
 if the night 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.879
 drug light 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.879
 it is not necessarily working 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.060
 to see if I find something 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.700
 nothing nothing more than a poet 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.800
 well I also found meters 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.120
 also a broke 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.540
 good another that was a title 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.430
 since the new looks again 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.630
 do not do two picks 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.130
 and the same 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.130
 and we, my girlfriend, need 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.760
 there was no need to demolish 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.450
 good and 1 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.230
 cool 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.090
 I think we do not find anything 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.090
 We are short of materials 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.150
 this is where I go to 10 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.019
 if you are interested to watch minecraft videos 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:19.959
 Well, I recommend a channel called 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:22.060
 silver more with the one I have and I'm 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.910
 making a guide to generators 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.420
 minecraft to find all the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.020
 generators species that exist 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.600
 until now and the battery work like this 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:41.790
 Good thing if you're interested, I'll leave 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:45.150
 in clear destruction afterwards if 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.360
 they want to see it, it's good and I 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.360
 I recommend 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.969
 A) Yes 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:59.269
 another is also Carlos 0 123 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.700
 upload some videos of files things 

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:04.960
 funny 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.940
 and then if they keep laughing a while and I'm in 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.490
 visit him 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.370
 it's never late 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.990
 and good because now they saw that I broke 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.030
 more coal 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.340
 what does it mean that there is no more 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.840
 torches I'm going to 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.230
 let's see if I can find something 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.060
 Diamond 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.230
 obviously not to have it because if 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.240
 our upholstered stoves are going to more 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.690
 that is already so to speak 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.969
 let's go some net with a lapis lazuli 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.739
 many things 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.739
 let's never bring something like that 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:49.120
 so I still good 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:52.000
 in exchange for the world just to try now 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.250
 that the truth is not a little the world 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.180
 from minecraft potter edition that are 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.880
 small as that could happen so 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.760
 I'm going to vary worlds 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.680
 you can also put in the humidity those 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.680
 here no longer 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:20.160
 you can not tell how is the 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.710
 coal stone so already this 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.220
 It helps to find what I got to me with 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.220
 two episodes 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.490
 good 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.310
 here I say goodbye now to do the long 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:41.120
 you already know mission in the channels that 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.120
 recommended and see you later goodbye
