videos for iTunes in mp4 format this is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.290 
videos for iTunes in mp4 format this is
a<00:00:18.539> video<00:00:19.100> specifically<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.789> edit<00:00:21.029> the

a video specifically on how to edit the
metadata<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.710> more<00:00:23.300> efficient<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.420> quicker

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
metadata in a more efficient and quicker

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.050 
metadata in a more efficient and quicker
manner<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.160> may<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.400> been<00:00:26.609> doing<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
manner that you may have been doing the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.660 
manner that you may have been doing the
floor<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.800> we'll<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.980> doing<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
floor and we'll be doing that with the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.840 
floor and we'll be doing that with the
program<00:00:30.090> called<00:00:30.330> meta<00:00:30.660> X<00:00:31.189> meta<00:00:32.189> X<00:00:32.460> was

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
program called meta X meta X was

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.540 
program called meta X meta X was
originally<00:00:33.450> designed<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.590> Macintosh

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
originally designed for the Macintosh

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.860 
originally designed for the Macintosh
platform<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.620> they've<00:00:37.860> also<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.879> made<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
platform but they've also now made a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.930 
platform but they've also now made a
meta<00:00:40.710> X<00:00:40.920> version<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> Windows<00:00:42.360> PC<00:00:43.940> this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
meta X version for the Windows PC this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.840 
meta X version for the Windows PC this
program<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.480> free<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:47.039> works<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
program is free and it works on the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.869 
program is free and it works on the
Windows<00:00:48.180> 2000<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.039> tutorial<00:00:50.250> I'll<00:00:50.850> be

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
Windows 2000 up in this tutorial I'll be

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.479 
Windows 2000 up in this tutorial I'll be
using<00:00:51.059> meta<00:00:51.870> X<00:00:52.430> with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> Windows<00:00:53.940> 7<00:00:54.239> 64<00:00:54.960> bit

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
using meta X with the Windows 7 64 bit

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.029 
using meta X with the Windows 7 64 bit
so<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.640> program<00:00:56.879> has<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.829> lot<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
so this program has a lot of

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.700 
so this program has a lot of
compatibility<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.870> gonna<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.199> ahead<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
compatibility so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.670 
compatibility so I'm gonna go ahead and
switch<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.520> interface<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.870> I'll<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
switch to the interface and I'll have a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.100 
switch to the interface and I'll have a
downloads<00:01:05.220> link<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> description<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:06.990> you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
downloads link in the description or you

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.050 
downloads link in the description or you
can<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.350> ahead<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.680> click<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:07.920> download<00:01:08.400> now

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.670 

alright<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.570> interface<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
alright so this is the interface for the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.780 
alright so this is the interface for the
meta<00:01:13.860> X<00:01:14.100> program<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:16.080> add<00:01:16.470> files<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
meta X program to add files to it and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
meta X program to add files to it and
add<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.540> queue<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.869> add<00:01:21.869> tags

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
add it to your queue so you can add tags

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.080 
add it to your queue so you can add tags
all<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.890> them<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.220> would<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.490> ahead<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.759> click

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
all of them you would go ahead and click

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.429 
all of them you would go ahead and click

video files need to be mp4 or m4v for

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.960 
video files need to be mp4 or m4v for
the<00:01:45.770> tagging<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.430> able<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.670> work

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the tagging to be to be able to work

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.359 
the tagging to be to be able to work
with<00:01:48.659> meta<00:01:49.020> X<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.159> play<00:01:50.340> in

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
with meta X and for them to play in

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.080 
with meta X and for them to play in
iTunes

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
iTunes

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.770 
iTunes
regardless<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:52.110> click<00:01:52.320> open<00:01:53.659> they're<00:01:54.659> all

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
regardless they click open they're all

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.730 
regardless they click open they're all
TV<00:01:55.140> shows<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> would<00:01:57.840> click<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.590> all

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
TV shows so you would click use for all

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.480 
TV shows so you would click use for all
currently<00:01:59.130> selected<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.790> hit<00:02:00.000> OK

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.430 

so<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.820> how<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:07.060> looks<00:02:07.300> inside<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:08.200> iTunes

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
so this is how it looks inside of iTunes

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.570 
so this is how it looks inside of iTunes
as<00:02:09.070> you<00:02:09.789> can<00:02:09.970> see<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:10.899> I've<00:02:11.350> already<00:02:12.010> added

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
as you can see that I've already added

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.040 
as you can see that I've already added
the<00:02:12.700> square<00:02:13.000> artwork<00:02:13.420> instead<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.900> the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
the square artwork instead of the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.440 
the square artwork instead of the
rectangular<00:02:14.560> artwork<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.490> MedX<00:02:16.000> gives<00:02:16.300> you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
rectangular artwork that MedX gives you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.630 
rectangular artwork that MedX gives you
and<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.560> little<00:02:17.680> while<00:02:17.860> I'll<00:02:18.190> show<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.520> how

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
and in a little while I'll show you how

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.480 
and in a little while I'll show you how
to<00:02:18.700> get<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:20.380> we<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.770> inside<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
to get that so if we go inside all the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.190 
to get that so if we go inside all the
information<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.209> added<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.750> show<00:02:25.990> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
information is added the show the
