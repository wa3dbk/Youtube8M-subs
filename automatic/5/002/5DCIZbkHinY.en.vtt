00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.049
 Hi I am someone of mine who TuS points marriage and here in the lounge tons on 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.769
 this Filmpalast in Munich has there he is his new products 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.710
 presented and we are looking to have 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 what was there to see 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.060
 among other things there was also the it is now presented at 56 10 a 23 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.939
 Inch front of systems 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.939
 optionally with Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Quad processor 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.690
 and ATI HD Damon 40 70 graphics solution 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.760
 To make the whole thing even more interesting for the end customer became here 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.920
 Of course, a multi-touch screen built-in 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.200
 which is finally supported by Windows 7 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.370
 we can see 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.940
 paint for me with two fingers 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.290
 or write down 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.160
 Microsoft has been thinking about Windows 7 though 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.510
 which make the two programs a bit of multitabs punches 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.180
 that's how it looks here in 2007 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.080
 you just with one 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 Fingers can zoom in or out similarly 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.800
 And you just do not need glasses anymore because you can see how you can 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.610
 enlarge yourself 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.330
 if something wants to work 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 and then like the arbitrarily zoom out 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.930
 this effect looks through the whole of the street so we have Aksel here 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.620
 2007 and can also through this movement the individual workbooks 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.460
 zoom in or out 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 to be able to see more details 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.150
 of course, the scope of supply of the Euro Mansystems is also a keyboard 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370
 and a mouse 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 can not see what he is doing here 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.740
 one more on the top right 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 Volume control 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.430
 he also makes himself felt in system as you can see 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.449
 and then the mouse 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.739
 Let's get to the ports where we could win 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.899
 to Bio SP 2 0 connections 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.899
 and on the right side 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.299
 For a purchase value as you can see a slot in the drive 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.420
 then still the connections are missing headphones the microphone a card reader 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419
 and the on-off switch below 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:46.079
 and of course we have most of the services behind the back 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.819
 USB-2 0 connections 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.309
 then the whole audio ports tower on 5 019 to allow the lan connection 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.070
 eSATA 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.350
 and a connection which a cable for the TV Thiemel
