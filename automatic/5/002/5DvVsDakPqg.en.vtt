piece of plastic off you don't try to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.580 
piece of plastic off you don't try to
rip<00:02:55.299> this<00:02:55.450> part<00:02:55.750> as<00:02:55.840> well<00:02:56.019> because<00:02:56.349> this<00:02:56.530> is

sitting<00:02:57.069> right<00:02:57.099> behind<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.670> grill<00:02:57.910> now<00:02:58.569> when

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
sitting right behind the grill now when

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.199 
sitting right behind the grill now when
I<00:02:59.200> installed<00:02:59.709> this<00:02:59.980> grill<00:03:00.370> my<00:03:00.700> black<00:03:01.000> roll

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
I installed this grill my black roll

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.369 
I installed this grill my black roll
that<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> ordered<00:03:01.870> from<00:03:02.019> ebay<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.870> t-bar

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
that I ordered from ebay the t-bar

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.350 
that I ordered from ebay the t-bar
actually<00:03:05.829> would<00:03:06.069> not<00:03:06.220> be<00:03:06.370> able<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.670> would<00:03:07.209> not

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
actually would not be able to would not

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.940 
actually would not be able to would not
fit<00:03:07.660> into<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.989> because<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.500> designed

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
fit into it because this is designed

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.479 
fit into it because this is designed
only<00:03:09.129> for<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.459> OEM<00:03:09.989> grill<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.260> my<00:03:11.680> grill<00:03:12.010> this

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
only for the OEM grill so my grill this

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.729 
only for the OEM grill so my grill this
black<00:03:13.030> one<00:03:13.239> did<00:03:13.810> not<00:03:13.959> fit<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.319> this<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:14.680> I

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
black one did not fit with this so I

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.819 
black one did not fit with this so I
have<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.920> take<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.310> out<00:03:15.400> altogether<00:03:16.829> just

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
have to take it out altogether just

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.460 
have to take it out altogether just
wasn't<00:03:18.190> really<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.400> big<00:03:18.609> problem<00:03:18.940> for<00:03:18.970> me<00:03:19.239> but

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
wasn't really a big problem for me but

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.050 
wasn't really a big problem for me but
you<00:03:20.470> know<00:03:20.560> that's<00:03:20.799> why<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.160> all<00:03:21.430> loose<00:03:21.819> all

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
you know that's why it's all loose all

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.800 
you know that's why it's all loose all
the<00:03:22.180> time<00:03:22.389> here

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the time here

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.569 
the time here
there's<00:03:23.200> nothing<00:03:23.530> sitting<00:03:24.069> underneath<00:03:24.310> this

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
there's nothing sitting underneath this

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.349 
there's nothing sitting underneath this
so<00:03:25.829> that's<00:03:26.829> that's<00:03:27.310> how<00:03:27.639> you<00:03:27.700> do<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:27.970> and

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
so that's that's how you do that and

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.199 
so that's that's how you do that and
then<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:29.130> pop<00:03:30.130> out<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.489> grill<00:03:30.700> all<00:03:30.849> you<00:03:30.970> got<00:03:31.120> to

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
then to pop out the grill all you got to

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.629 
then to pop out the grill all you got to
do<00:03:31.329> is<00:03:31.540> get<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.319> any<00:03:32.470> edge<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.340> start

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
do is get to any edge and just start

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.339 
do is get to any edge and just start
pushing<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.660> just<00:03:34.810> give<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.079> a<00:03:35.170> little

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
pushing and you just give it a little

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.839 
pushing and you just give it a little
bit<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.650> pressure<00:03:35.859> you're<00:03:36.160> going<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.400> feel<00:03:36.609> all

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
bit of pressure you're going to feel all

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.479 
bit of pressure you're going to feel all
the<00:03:37.000> clips<00:03:37.299> go<00:03:37.510> down<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.930> all<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.980> clips<00:03:39.220> come

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
the clips go down and all the clips come

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.849 
the clips go down and all the clips come
all<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.790> way<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.680> all<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.799> way

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
all the way like this and all the way

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.890 
all the way like this and all the way
around<00:03:42.160> till<00:03:42.430> about<00:03:42.700> here<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.180> there's<00:03:43.690> also

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
around till about here and there's also

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.659 
around till about here and there's also
two<00:03:44.230> points<00:03:44.650> where<00:03:44.799> they<00:03:44.919> actually<00:03:45.190> slip<00:03:45.489> in

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
two points where they actually slip in

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.159 
two points where they actually slip in
on<00:03:46.120> both<00:03:46.359> sides<00:03:46.660> here<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.790> here<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:49.599> once<00:03:50.049> you

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
on both sides here and here so once you

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.110 
on both sides here and here so once you
unclip<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.590> just<00:03:51.069> slide<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.549> out<00:03:51.639> it'll<00:03:51.910> come

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
unclip it just slide it out it'll come

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.940 
unclip it just slide it out it'll come
out<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.389> this<00:03:52.480> little<00:03:52.660> port<00:03:52.989> on<00:03:53.319> both<00:03:53.650> sides

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
out of this little port on both sides

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.159 
out of this little port on both sides
and<00:03:54.190> then<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.760> replace<00:03:55.510> your<00:03:55.660> grill<00:03:55.870> just<00:03:56.019> do

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
and then to replace your grill just do

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.900 
and then to replace your grill just do
exactly<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.680> same<00:03:56.709> thing<00:03:57.099> start<00:03:57.700> with<00:03:57.819> the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
exactly the same thing start with the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.449 
exactly the same thing start with the
two<00:03:58.090> ports<00:03:58.480> fit<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.410> in<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.739> then<00:03:59.950> slowly

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
two ports fit it in and then slowly

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.030 
two ports fit it in and then slowly
start<00:04:00.700> clipping<00:04:01.150> in<00:04:01.419> each<00:04:01.660> one<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.079> clips

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
start clipping in each one of the clips
