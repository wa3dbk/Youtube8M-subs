new we bought it used its put together
really<00:00:11.340> well<00:00:12.710> guy<00:00:13.710> told<00:00:14.009> me<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.250> had<00:00:14.309> fuelly

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
really well guy told me it had fuelly

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.900 
really well guy told me it had fuelly
heads<00:00:15.260> camel<00:00:16.260> humps<00:00:16.710> double<00:00:17.250> homes<00:00:17.430> whatever

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
heads camel humps double homes whatever

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.450 
heads camel humps double homes whatever
the<00:00:18.000> hell<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.210> want<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> call<00:00:18.510> them<00:00:19.460> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the hell you want to call them and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.380 
the hell you want to call them and
actually<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.390> does<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.550> casting<00:00:24.060> number

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
actually it does the casting number

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.880 
actually it does the casting number
which<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.750> won't<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.980> able<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.849> read<00:00:28.039> CH<00:00:30.890> is

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
which you won't be able to read CH is

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.420 
which you won't be able to read CH is
down<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:35.480> there<00:00:36.739> if<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.860> look<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> last

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
down and there if you look at the last

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.520 
down and there if you look at the last
one<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.000> says<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.750> looks<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.170> an<00:00:40.290> eight<00:00:40.410> but

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
one it says it looks like an eight but

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.080 
one it says it looks like an eight but
it's<00:00:40.710> actually<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.100> six<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.700> that's<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it's actually a six and that's the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.279 
it's actually a six and that's the
difference<00:00:42.710> aight<00:00:43.710> where<00:00:44.149> 327<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:46.140> in

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
difference aight where 327 like in

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.270 
difference aight where 327 like in
paddle<00:00:46.559> heads<00:00:46.800> shitty<00:00:47.399> flow<00:00:48.020> 74c<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.280> these

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
paddle heads shitty flow 74c see these

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.950 
paddle heads shitty flow 74c see these
are<00:00:50.489> 64<00:00:51.210> cec<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.620> means<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:53.100> i<00:00:53.719> got<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
are 64 cec so that means there i got and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.590 
are 64 cec so that means there i got and
it's<00:00:55.610> double<00:00:56.610> hump<00:00:56.670> heads<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.239> doesn't<00:00:57.510> have

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
it's double hump heads it doesn't have

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
it's double hump heads it doesn't have
the<00:00:57.660> 202<00:00:58.140> valves<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.770> most<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.250> don't

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the 202 valves like most of them don't

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.119 
the 202 valves like most of them don't
it's<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.510> 190<00:01:00.989> force<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:01.770> fine<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it's got 190 force but that's fine this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
it's got 190 force but that's fine this
is<00:01:02.280> Street<00:01:02.520> motor<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.629> got<00:01:03.809> comp<00:01:04.140> cams<00:01:06.680> push

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
is Street motor it's got comp cams push

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
is Street motor it's got comp cams push
rod<00:01:07.920> guides<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> head<00:01:09.780> has<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.049> be

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
rod guides on it so the head has to be

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.980 
rod guides on it so the head has to be
milled<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.770> those<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:12.119> got<00:01:12.270> screwin<00:01:12.780> studs

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
milled for those it's got screwin studs

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.730 
milled for those it's got screwin studs
on<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:14.490> got<00:01:17.090> upgraded<00:01:18.090> valve<00:01:19.049> springs<00:01:19.500> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
on it it's got upgraded valve springs I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.510 
on it it's got upgraded valve springs I
don't<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> weight<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.580> those

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
don't know what the weight is on those

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.800 
don't know what the weight is on those
well<00:01:23.520> yeah<00:01:23.670> they<00:01:23.880> look<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.119> they're<00:01:24.330> rebuild

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
well yeah they look like they're rebuild

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
well yeah they look like they're rebuild
this<00:01:25.290> motor<00:01:25.380> supposedly<00:01:25.979> built<00:01:26.159> 10<00:01:26.400> years<00:01:26.610> ago

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
this motor supposedly built 10 years ago

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.840 
this motor supposedly built 10 years ago
so<00:01:27.619> pale<00:01:28.619> click<00:01:28.860> they're<00:01:29.040> probably<00:01:29.310> about<00:01:29.579> 10

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so pale click they're probably about 10

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.270 
so pale click they're probably about 10
years<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.659> lot<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.350> carbon<00:01:31.680> buildup<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
years on a lot of carbon buildup on the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.359 
years on a lot of carbon buildup on the
pistons<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.439> on<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> inside<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.890> cylinder

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
pistons and on the inside of cylinder

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.210 
pistons and on the inside of cylinder
because<00:01:35.700> they're<00:01:35.909> running<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.329> 750<00:01:37.220> Holley

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
because they're running a 750 Holley

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.760 
because they're running a 750 Holley
double<00:01:38.460> pump<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.229> which<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.590> way<00:01:40.710> too

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
double pump on it which is just way too

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
double pump on it which is just way too
much<00:01:41.009> car<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.640> motor<00:01:41.909> also<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:42.899> didn't

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
much car for this motor also they didn't

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.609 
much car for this motor also they didn't
use<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> right<00:01:43.710> gasket<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> intake

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
use the right gasket on the intake

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.690 
use the right gasket on the intake
between<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> carbon<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> intake<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.579> it's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
between the carbon the intake so it's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.560 
between the carbon the intake so it's
probably<00:01:49.130> led<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.310> its<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.549> spread<00:01:50.939> bore<00:01:51.149> intake

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
probably led to its a spread bore intake

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
probably led to its a spread bore intake
and<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.200> square<00:01:52.409> bore<00:01:52.649> carb<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> they

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and it's a square bore carb and they

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.219 
and it's a square bore carb and they
didn't<00:01:54.119> use<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> adapter<00:01:54.570> plate<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.200> i

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
didn't use the adapter plate so i

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
didn't use the adapter plate so i
probably<00:01:55.439> had<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> vacuum<00:01:56.100> leak<00:01:56.130> pretty<00:01:56.549> bad<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
probably had a vacuum leak pretty bad so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
probably had a vacuum leak pretty bad so
they<00:01:57.329> probably<00:01:58.040> we're<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> little<00:01:59.219> bit<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.549> of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
they probably we're a little bit out of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.359 
they probably we're a little bit out of
tune<00:01:59.820> hei<00:02:00.780> distributor<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.740> piece<00:02:02.009> rear<00:02:02.340> main

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
tune hei distributor one piece rear main

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.740

seal<00:02:03.500> 5.7<00:02:04.500> liter<00:02:04.680> block<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.570> than<00:02:06.600> likely

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
seal 5.7 liter block so more than likely

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.619 
seal 5.7 liter block so more than likely
this<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.500> probably<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.250> crate<00:02:08.610> short<00:02:08.940> block<00:02:09.239> is

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
this is probably a crate short block is

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.500 
this is probably a crate short block is
what<00:02:10.110> i'm<00:02:10.200> guessing<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.670> truck<00:02:11.849> was<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.120> 82

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
what i'm guessing the truck was in 82

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.170 
what i'm guessing the truck was in 82
they<00:02:12.900> didn't

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
they didn't

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.209 
they didn't

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
told that this is this is pretty similar

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.110 
told that this is this is pretty similar
to<00:02:20.290> an<00:02:20.379> 87<00:02:20.920> blocks<00:02:21.189> so<00:02:21.489> it's<00:02:21.640> most<00:02:22.030> likely

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
to an 87 blocks so it's most likely

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.179

create the short block it's what I would

it'll turn three grand on the highway
nice<00:04:39.759> and<00:04:39.970> happily<00:04:40.360> but<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:43.270> know<00:04:43.419> kind<00:04:43.900> of
