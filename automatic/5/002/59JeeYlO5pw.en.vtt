00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.800 

this<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.929> what<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.200> ordered<00:00:05.160> as<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:06.060> notice<00:00:06.420> I

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
this is what I ordered as you notice I

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.560 
this is what I ordered as you notice I
didn't<00:00:07.500> not<00:00:08.130> only<00:00:08.340> order<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:08.910> gigs<00:00:09.210> Iran

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
didn't not only order for gigs Iran

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.700 
didn't not only order for gigs Iran
thinking<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.260> could<00:00:10.320> use<00:00:10.679> readyboost<00:00:12.200> to<00:00:13.200> try

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
thinking I could use readyboost to try

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.220 
thinking I could use readyboost to try
to<00:00:13.769> be<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> cheapskate<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> since<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.199> was

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
to be a cheapskate out of it since I was

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
to be a cheapskate out of it since I was
already<00:00:16.500> over<00:00:16.710> my<00:00:16.920> budget<00:00:17.210> but<00:00:19.130> turns<00:00:20.130> out

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
already over my budget but turns out

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.089 
already over my budget but turns out
readyboost<00:00:20.939> needs<00:00:23.510> prefetch<00:00:24.510> services<00:00:25.500> ran

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
readyboost needs prefetch services ran

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.060 
readyboost needs prefetch services ran
and<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.730> shouldn't<00:00:27.029> run<00:00:27.140> préfet<00:00:28.140> services<00:00:28.769> on

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
and you shouldn't run préfet services on

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.569 
and you shouldn't run préfet services on
a<00:00:29.900> SSD<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> unfortunately<00:00:34.739> i<00:00:35.100> work<00:00:35.340> out

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
a SSD so unfortunately i work out

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.470 
a SSD so unfortunately i work out
hopefully<00:00:37.129> i'll<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:38.579> ram<00:00:38.790> down<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
hopefully i'll get some ram down the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.709 
hopefully i'll get some ram down the
road<00:00:40.370> i<00:00:41.960> chose<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.230> put<00:00:43.440> stalker<00:00:44.480> call<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
something or other I got it a while back

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.209 
something or other I got it a while back
on<00:00:50.670> my<00:00:50.820> steam<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:51.870> crazy<00:00:52.320> cheap<00:00:52.710> I'm

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
on my steam when it was crazy cheap I'm

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
on my steam when it was crazy cheap I'm
not<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:53.820> his<00:00:54.000> laptop<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.719> games

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
not going to use his laptop for games

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.610 
not going to use his laptop for games
but<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> figured<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.360> lot<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.480> people<00:00:57.750> were

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
but I figured a lot of people were

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.250 
but I figured a lot of people were
interested<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.030> make<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> video

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
interested in that so I make a video

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.439 
interested in that so I make a video
about<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.430> who<00:01:02.609> i'm<00:01:02.640> changing

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
about it to see who i'm changing

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.830 
about it to see who i'm changing
everything<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:06.170> full<00:01:07.170> resolution<00:01:09.290> max<00:01:11.840> I'm

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
everything up to full resolution max I'm

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
everything up to full resolution max I'm
not<00:01:12.990> much<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.530> hardcore<00:01:14.070> gamer<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.760> i<00:01:14.790> don't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
not much of a hardcore gamer so i don't

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.060 
not much of a hardcore gamer so i don't
i'm<00:01:15.240> sure<00:01:17.570> there<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.689> probably

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
i'm sure there was probably

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.899 
i'm sure there was probably
anti-aliasing<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.310> stuff<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
anti-aliasing and stuff like that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.480 
anti-aliasing and stuff like that
options<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.530> could<00:01:23.340> have

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
options in there that I could have

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.960 
options in there that I could have
bumped<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.090> also<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.560> ran<00:01:25.920> fine<00:01:25.950> why<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
bumped up also it it ran fine why I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.319

the game I'm not going to use the
computer<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.909> typically<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.119> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
computer like that typically this is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.719 
computer like that typically this is
more<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.750> work<00:01:51.960> computer<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.649> me<00:01:54.170> but<00:01:55.729> there

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
more of a work computer for me but there

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.959 
more of a work computer for me but there
that's<00:01:57.420> what<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.590> hot<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.189> saw

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that's what you see they get hot I saw

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.510 
that's what you see they get hot I saw
get<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.810> 80<00:02:01.229> degrees<00:02:01.759> Celsius

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
get all the way up to 80 degrees Celsius

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.729 
get all the way up to 80 degrees Celsius
which<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.880> my<00:02:06.000> tower<00:02:07.000> computer<00:02:07.750> never<00:02:08.500> gets

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
which is my tower computer never gets

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.500 
which is my tower computer never gets
that<00:02:08.830> hot<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.459> have<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> 480<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.450> there<00:02:10.690> so
