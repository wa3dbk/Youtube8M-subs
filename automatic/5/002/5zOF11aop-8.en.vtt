00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 but 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.650
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.840
 we find ourselves for a small video 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 annex of the last video that I have 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.770
 put that allows you to achieve your 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.320
 own soft lures but as I have 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.480
 says there are always imperfections on 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.290
 the top of a lure like this by 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.940
 example making forgiveness there are some 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.790
 small imperfections of small defects 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.980
 small dust that is stuck etc 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.199
 so he's not he is not very 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 pretty and they know all these little 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.830
 imperfections make points of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.809
 fragility to a fish attack they 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.430
 could tear for example so 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.120
 we will correct all these small 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.190
 imperfections 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.760
 for that he'll just have to have a 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.019
 metal model and what to heat 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.549
 we 'll start right now 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.549
 turn on the gas stove 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.460
 b it's a bit like this 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.530
 now we are going to heat 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.530
 gently the little metal chopsticks 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:25.220
 with their heat and plastic 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.789
 will soften and we will be able to work 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.789
 is easily 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.619
 here I am heating it is going to be 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.310
 quite fast 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.310
 it heats up fast 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.040
 here we will be able to start 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.890
 improve theirs like this 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.880
 for example there are imperfections here 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.940
 we will be able to the lycÃ©es very slowly 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.170
 like these it cools pretty quickly 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.140
 but it's enough for him to continue to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.390
 heat up and continue 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.650
 the operation 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.840
 you can even give the end that you 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.289
 want for example you can depressed 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.240
 the metal rod in the lure for him 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.060
 make a point a little more flexible by 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.970
 example by pressing the tail by 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.750
 example like these up by doing 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.820
 the same on the other side you create a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.820
 very simple articulation 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.400
 there you have a place where theirs is 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.400
 more where we will continue to heat 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.860
 and we will finish correcting these 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.239
 imperfections here to be able to get to 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.200
 the time they are perfect for the 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.819
 fishing than any time 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.920
 fishing whether it's in the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.110
 carnivorous because when you 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.620
 manufacture yours must always be able 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.209
 but create as you want you more 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.910
 do absolutely anything you want 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.030
 see a very simple articulation very 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.989
 fast to have a softer lure 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.900
 for example here is theirs once 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.150
 finished with the joints on the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.630
 tail for them to have a swim more 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.170
 fluid so this video ends you
