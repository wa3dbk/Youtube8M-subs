00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.420 
at having RBF I don't have that problem
not<00:04:30.599> to<00:04:30.750> get<00:04:30.840> too<00:04:30.990> personal<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.620> going<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
not to get too personal of going to the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.800 
not to get too personal of going to the
bathroom<00:04:32.580> because<00:04:33.000> my<00:04:33.210> stomach<00:04:33.389> is<00:04:33.690> so

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
bathroom because my stomach is so

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.379 
bathroom because my stomach is so
sensitive<00:04:34.110> that<00:04:34.759> that's<00:04:35.759> just<00:04:35.849> what<00:04:36.030> happens

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
sensitive that that's just what happens

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.360 
sensitive that that's just what happens
so<00:04:36.599> I<00:04:36.630> didn't<00:04:36.960> need<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.169> cleanse<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.889> cleanse

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
so I didn't need the cleanse to cleanse

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.110 
so I didn't need the cleanse to cleanse
out<00:04:38.840> um<00:04:40.069> whatever<00:04:41.069> was<00:04:41.370> in<00:04:41.460> there<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.849> was<00:04:42.060> just

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
out um whatever was in there I was just

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.240 
out um whatever was in there I was just
hoping<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.509> it<00:04:42.750> would<00:04:42.930> help<00:04:43.500> my<00:04:43.740> stomach<00:04:44.190> a

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
hoping that it would help my stomach a

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.670 
hoping that it would help my stomach a
little<00:04:44.280> bit<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:44.789> I<00:04:44.940> like<00:04:45.660> i<00:04:45.810> said<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.349> juices

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
little bit and I like i said the juices

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.920 
little bit and I like i said the juices
are<00:04:46.830> great<00:04:47.039> I<00:04:47.340> think<00:04:47.759> this<00:04:48.000> cleanse<00:04:48.300> is<00:04:48.539> good

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
are great I think this cleanse is good

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.129 
are great I think this cleanse is good
for<00:04:49.229> someone<00:04:49.470> who<00:04:49.889> is<00:04:50.069> looking<00:04:50.280> to

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
for someone who is looking to

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.409 
for someone who is looking to
incorporate<00:04:52.220> more<00:04:53.220> fruit<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.789> vegetables

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
incorporate more fruit and vegetables

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.450 
incorporate more fruit and vegetables
into<00:04:54.660> their<00:04:55.080> diet<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.740> try<00:04:56.009> and<00:04:56.039> start

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
into their diet and to try and start

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.899 
into their diet and to try and start
over<00:04:56.729> start<00:04:56.909> fresh<00:04:57.150> I<00:04:57.690> do<00:04:58.560> think<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.430> helps<00:04:59.759> if

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
over start fresh I do think it helps if

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.420 
over start fresh I do think it helps if
you<00:05:00.090> think<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.419> works<00:05:00.630> just<00:05:00.930> for<00:05:01.830> me<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.280> my

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
you think it works just for me and my

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.120 
you think it works just for me and my
body<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:03.750> just<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:05.060> stopped<00:05:06.060> otherwise<00:05:06.659> I<00:05:07.130> just

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
body I just I stopped otherwise I just

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.879 
body I just I stopped otherwise I just
don't<00:05:08.310> think<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.580> would<00:05:08.789> have<00:05:08.819> survived<00:05:09.860> well<00:05:10.860> I

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
don't think I would have survived well I

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.820 
don't think I would have survived well I
think<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.220> feel<00:05:11.610> like<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.789> failure<00:05:12.710> maybe<00:05:13.710> a
