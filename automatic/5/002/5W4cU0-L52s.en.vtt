00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
going to be doing it in first step is

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.639 
going to be doing it in first step is
we're<00:01:18.580> going<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.820> remove<00:01:19.540> these<00:01:19.870> two<00:01:19.930> allen

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
we're going to remove these two allen

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.340 
we're going to remove these two allen
head<00:01:20.799> screws<00:01:21.219> and<00:01:21.520> remove<00:01:22.299> this<00:01:22.570> cover<00:01:22.840> pull

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
head screws and remove this cover pull

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.319 
head screws and remove this cover pull
out<00:01:23.469> some<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.920> fluid<00:01:24.250> from<00:01:25.119> this

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
out some of the fluid from this

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.560 
out some of the fluid from this
reservoir<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:27.009> when<00:01:27.189> we<00:01:27.310> remove<00:01:27.790> the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
reservoir because when we remove the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.870 
reservoir because when we remove the
brake<00:01:29.020> pads<00:01:29.290> we're<00:01:30.040> going<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.280> compress<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
brake pads we're going to compress the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.350 
brake pads we're going to compress the
calipers<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.880> fluid<00:01:34.180> will

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
calipers so that some fluid will

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.230 
calipers so that some fluid will
basically<00:01:34.539> rise<00:01:34.990> up<00:01:35.259> in<00:01:35.439> this<00:01:35.890> reservoir<00:01:36.520> so

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
basically rise up in this reservoir so

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.730 
basically rise up in this reservoir so
you<00:01:37.270> don't<00:01:37.509> want<00:01:37.659> it<00:01:37.780> overflowing<00:01:38.289> so<00:01:38.560> that's

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
you don't want it overflowing so that's

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.020 
you don't want it overflowing so that's
the<00:01:38.860> first<00:01:39.070> step<00:01:39.250> we're<00:01:39.430> gonna<00:01:39.549> remove<00:01:39.850> these

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
the first step we're gonna remove these

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.539 
the first step we're gonna remove these
and<00:01:40.270> take<00:01:40.689> some<00:01:40.869> fluid<00:01:41.020> out<00:01:41.259> then<00:01:42.250> I'm<00:01:42.369> going

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
and take some fluid out then I'm going

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.029 
and take some fluid out then I'm going
to<00:01:42.579> go<00:01:42.700> ahead<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.060> open<00:01:43.299> up<00:01:43.360> these<00:01:44.039> 12

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
to go ahead and open up these 12

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.700 
to go ahead and open up these 12
millimeter<00:01:45.399> sockets<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.060> remove<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.200> caliper

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
millimeter sockets I remove this caliper

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.190 
millimeter sockets I remove this caliper
and<00:01:47.890> take<00:01:48.460> out<00:01:48.609> the<00:01:48.700> brake<00:01:48.850> pads<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:49.810> let's<00:01:50.109> get

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
and take out the brake pads so let's get

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:59.310 
and take out the brake pads so let's get
to<00:01:50.350> work

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:03:07.650 

you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:19.780
