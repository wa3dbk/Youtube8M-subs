batteries or expandable storage think

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.520 
batteries or expandable storage think
about<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> fact<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
great games and watching movies but the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.950 
great games and watching movies but the
fact<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.760> can't<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.060> expand<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
fact that you can't really expand it to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240 
fact that you can't really expand it to
take<00:01:07.110> advantage<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
take advantage of that because the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.850 
take advantage of that because the
battery<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.760> die<00:01:08.909> after<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.210> first<00:01:09.510> flick

number<00:01:10.860> four<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.369> better<00:01:11.400> tablets<00:01:12.270> finally

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
number four is better tablets finally

number four is better tablets finally
until<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.350> year<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.010> some<00:01:14.220> decent

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
until this year we see some decent

until this year we see some decent
tablets<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.119> Samsung<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:16.080> every

tablets from Samsung but then every

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
other OEM hasn't really figured it out

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240 
other OEM hasn't really figured it out
as<00:01:18.930> Suze<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.259> doing<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> good<00:01:19.680> job<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:20.040> some

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
tablets not all of them and then we get

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.260 
tablets not all of them and then we get
other<00:01:22.470> tablet<00:01:22.979> OEMs<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.580> Acer<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> do

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
other tablet OEMs like Acer the do

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.179 
other tablet OEMs like Acer the do
terrible<00:01:24.840> jobs<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.409> tablets<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.950> people

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
terrible jobs with tablets and people

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.950 
terrible jobs with tablets and people
actually<00:01:26.280> pay<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.759> these<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.630> biggest

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
actually pay for these the biggest

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.330 
actually pay for these the biggest
problem<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> people<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.130> don't

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
problem is that people out there don't

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
problem is that people out there don't
know<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.479> killing<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
know and this is really killing the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
know and this is really killing the
reputation<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> OEM<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.880> fact<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
reputation of the OEM the fact that a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.760 
reputation of the OEM the fact that a
lot<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> Samsung<00:01:34.229> tablets<00:01:34.619> aren't

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
lot of the Samsung tablets aren't

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.350 
lot of the Samsung tablets aren't
available<00:01:35.100> everywhere<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.939> ones<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.270> are

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
available everywhere the ones that are

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
available everywhere the ones that are
good<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.659> least<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> ipad

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
good at least and then we have the ipad

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.740 
good at least and then we have the ipad
that's<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.700> doing<00:01:38.909> everything<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.479> even

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that's just doing everything right even

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.300 
that's just doing everything right even
if<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.140> better<00:01:40.439> than<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.799> tablets

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
if it's not better than these tablets

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.580 
if it's not better than these tablets
again<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.060> need<00:01:42.270> better<00:01:42.570> tablets<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.140> better<00:01:43.350> UI

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
again we need better tablets a better UI

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
again we need better tablets a better UI
probably<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> flick<00:01:44.909> down<00:01:45.149> thing<00:01:45.540> we

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
probably not the flick down thing we

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.840 
probably not the flick down thing we
have<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:45.899> tablets<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.640> buns

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
have on tablets right now or the buns

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
have on tablets right now or the buns
where<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.659> used<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.170> great<00:01:49.470> on

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
where they are it used to be great on

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.859 
where they are it used to be great on
honeycomb<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.520> least<00:01:50.759> when<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.000> worked<00:01:51.509> well

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
honeycomb at least when it worked well

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.420 
honeycomb at least when it worked well
which<00:01:52.140> wasn't<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> time<00:01:53.280> but

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
which wasn't really all the time but

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
which wasn't really all the time but
again<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.149> honeycomb<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> wasn't<00:01:55.170> really

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
again the honeycomb you I wasn't really

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.840 
again the honeycomb you I wasn't really
that<00:01:55.590> bad<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.979> should<00:01:56.130> probably<00:01:56.430> consider<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
that bad you should probably consider it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.510 
that bad you should probably consider it
again<00:01:57.090> number<00:01:57.960> three<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.380> better<00:01:58.890> standards

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
again number three is better standards

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.219 
again number three is better standards
for<00:01:59.670> accessories<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.170> the

for accessories and this is one of the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749 
for accessories and this is one of the

trend<00:02:13.260> with<00:02:13.379> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
trend with a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.870 
trend with a
android<00:02:13.800> products<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> reason<00:02:14.730> why<00:02:14.850> is

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
android products and the reason why is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.570 
android products and the reason why is
because<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> big<00:02:16.350> diversity<00:02:17.310> of

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
because there is a big diversity of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.430 
because there is a big diversity of
Android<00:02:18.000> products<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.600> there<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.080> then

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
Android products out there and then

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.720 
Android products out there and then
there<00:02:19.590> are<00:02:19.620> problems<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.520> for<00:02:20.670> example

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
there are problems here like for example

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.390 
there are problems here like for example
not<00:02:21.180> every<00:02:21.569> Android<00:02:21.930> phone<00:02:22.170> has<00:02:22.350> NFC<00:02:22.680> not

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
not every Android phone has NFC not

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.040 
not every Android phone has NFC not
every<00:02:23.670> Android<00:02:24.000> phone<00:02:24.240> includes<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.720> lot<00:02:24.930> of

every Android phone includes a lot of

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.840 
every Android phone includes a lot of
the<00:02:25.110> things<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:26.069> other<00:02:26.220> android

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
the things that some other android

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.580 
the things that some other android
phones<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.300> are<00:02:27.420> good<00:02:27.690> include<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
phones that are good include so this is

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.110 
phones that are good include so this is
one<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.890> biggest<00:02:29.069> issues<00:02:29.550> with<00:02:29.730> Android

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
one of the biggest issues with Android

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.850 
one of the biggest issues with Android
the<00:02:30.540> lack<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.750> standards<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.410> see<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.709> with

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
the lack of standards you see this with

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.040 
the lack of standards you see this with
Windows<00:02:32.220> Phone<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:33.000> with<00:02:33.120> iOS<00:02:33.540> so

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
Windows Phone you see this with iOS so

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.650 
Windows Phone you see this with iOS so
I'm<00:02:34.140> sure<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.470> there<00:02:34.739> should<00:02:35.069> be<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> way<00:02:35.400> for

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
I'm sure that there should be a way for

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.030 
I'm sure that there should be a way for
Google<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.840> standardize<00:02:37.410> certain<00:02:37.739> things

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
Google to standardize certain things

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.740 
Google to standardize certain things
that<00:02:38.580> will<00:02:38.730> allow<00:02:38.910> us<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.239> be<00:02:39.330> able<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.569> buy

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
that will allow us to be able to buy

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.350 
that will allow us to be able to buy
better<00:02:40.110> accessories<00:02:40.709> again<00:02:40.980> number<00:02:41.970> two<00:02:42.209> is

better accessories again number two is

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.780 
better accessories again number two is

for<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.790> reason<00:02:47.820> why<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.330> because

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
for this and the reason why is because

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.870 
for this and the reason why is because
the<00:02:48.840> Moto<00:02:49.019> X<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> very<00:02:49.800> interesting<00:02:50.160> concept

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the Moto X is a very interesting concept

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
but forget about the customization this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.670 
but forget about the customization this
is<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.480> phone<00:02:54.630> that's<00:02:54.810> not<00:02:54.959> too<00:02:55.170> big<00:02:55.440> not<00:02:55.470> too

not<00:02:57.900> really<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.650> powerful<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.400> paper<00:02:59.700> but

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
not really that powerful on paper but

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.880 
not really that powerful on paper but
that<00:03:00.060> performs<00:03:00.540> great<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.410> get<00:03:01.560> immediate

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
that performs great you get immediate

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.860 
that performs great you get immediate
software<00:03:02.519> updates<00:03:02.940> from<00:03:03.060> Android<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.720> get

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
software updates from Android you get

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.720 
software updates from Android you get
things<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.319> actually<00:03:04.410> make<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.130> unique<00:03:05.519> like

things that actually make it unique like

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.800 
things that actually make it unique like
for<00:03:05.910> example<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.330> way<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.480> could<00:03:06.600> call

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
for example the way you could call

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900 
for example the way you could call
Google<00:03:07.170> now<00:03:07.380> which<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:07.980> greater<00:03:08.370> Motorola

assist<00:03:09.330> these<00:03:09.510> are<00:03:09.660> really<00:03:10.019> unique<00:03:10.200> features

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.979 
assist these are really unique features
that<00:03:10.950> are<00:03:11.069> actually<00:03:11.340> useful<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.750> biggest

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
that are actually useful the biggest

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.960 
that are actually useful the biggest
problem<00:03:13.319> with<00:03:13.560> Android<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.280> bloat<00:03:14.760> of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
problem with Android is this bloat of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.910 
problem with Android is this bloat of
features<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.569> people<00:03:15.840> don't<00:03:16.110> really<00:03:16.590> use

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
features that people don't really use

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.770 
features that people don't really use
and<00:03:17.340> again<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.850> cool<00:03:18.060> thing<00:03:18.239> about<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.570> Moto

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
and again the cool thing about the Moto

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.930 
and again the cool thing about the Moto
X<00:03:19.049> is<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.410> everything<00:03:20.010> about<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.250> phone<00:03:20.700> is

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
X is that everything about this phone is

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.509 
X is that everything about this phone is
actually<00:03:21.570> cool<00:03:21.900> we<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.410> wish<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.130> camera

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
actually cool we just wish the camera

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.520 
actually cool we just wish the camera
was<00:03:23.640> better<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.120> again<00:03:24.180> there<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.079> lot<00:03:25.500> of

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
was better but again there is a lot of

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.289 
was better but again there is a lot of
room<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.430> grow<00:03:26.730> when<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:26.970> comes<00:03:27.150> to

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
room here to grow when it comes to

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.729 
room here to grow when it comes to
android<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.870> fact<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.140> we<00:03:28.290> need<00:03:28.440> more

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
android the fact that we need more

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.920 
android the fact that we need more
reliable<00:03:29.310> features<00:03:29.850> from<00:03:30.180> better<00:03:30.480> phones

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
reliable features from better phones

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.810 
reliable features from better phones
because<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.860> problem<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.310> obviously<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
because the problem is obviously the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.580 
because the problem is obviously the
Moto<00:03:33.060> X<00:03:33.329> hasn't<00:03:33.630> really<00:03:33.840> become<00:03:34.260> as<00:03:34.380> popular

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
Moto X hasn't really become as popular

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.530 
Moto X hasn't really become as popular
as<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:34.950> should<00:03:35.340> be<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.610> again<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:36.000> know<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.420> get

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
as it should be but again I know you get

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.090 
as it should be but again I know you get
my<00:03:36.690> point<00:03:36.959> there<00:03:37.170> are<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.290> lot<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.470> things<00:03:37.769> that

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
my point there are a lot of things that

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.770 
my point there are a lot of things that
could<00:03:38.370> be<00:03:38.579> learned<00:03:38.880> from<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.269> Moto<00:03:39.450> X

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
could be learned from the Moto X

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.620 
could be learned from the Moto X
especially<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.890> customization<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.820> finally

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
especially the customization and finally

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.240 
especially the customization and finally
the<00:03:42.750> top<00:03:42.989> number<00:03:43.200> one<00:03:43.500> thing<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:44.010> wish

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
the top number one thing that we wish

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.729 
the top number one thing that we wish
would<00:03:44.489> improve<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.420> Android<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:45.930> 2042

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
would improve for Android and 2042

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.949 
would improve for Android and 2042
software<00:03:47.430> updates<00:03:47.940> they<00:03:48.359> need<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.600> figure<00:03:48.750> out

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
software updates they need to figure out

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.300 
software updates they need to figure out
a<00:03:48.989> better<00:03:49.140> strategy<00:03:49.500> we've<00:03:49.890> been<00:03:50.040> talking

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
a better strategy we've been talking

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.340 
a better strategy we've been talking
about<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:50.880> year<00:03:51.209> last<00:03:51.690> year<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.170> year

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
about this this year last year the year

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.810 
about this this year last year the year
before<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.890> they<00:03:52.980> haven't<00:03:53.280> figured<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.670> out

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
before and they haven't figured it out

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.220 
before and they haven't figured it out
the<00:03:54.299> biggest<00:03:54.450> problem<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:54.989> everything

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the biggest problem is that everything

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.349 
the biggest problem is that everything
is<00:03:55.530> left<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.890> OEMs<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.670> this<00:03:56.820> is<00:03:56.940> really<00:03:57.120> not

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
is left to OEMs and this is really not

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.580 
is left to OEMs and this is really not
fair<00:03:57.630> Google<00:03:58.019> should<00:03:58.140> take<00:03:58.320> more

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
fair Google should take more

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.319 
fair Google should take more
