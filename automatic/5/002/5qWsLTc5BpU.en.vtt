Charlie was so weak when you actually
rescued<00:01:16.930> her<00:01:17.080> I'm<00:01:17.230> guessing<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.860> end

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
rescued her I'm guessing that the end

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.070 
rescued her I'm guessing that the end
processes<00:01:18.970> that<00:01:19.180> we're<00:01:19.720> going<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.870> re-home

her<00:01:20.530> now<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:20.770> would<00:01:21.010> imagine<00:01:21.190> that<00:01:21.400> was<00:01:21.670> is<00:01:21.850> a

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
her now I would imagine that was is a

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.460 
her now I would imagine that was is a
very<00:01:22.150> long<00:01:22.360> process<00:01:22.660> can<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.110> tell<00:01:23.320> us<00:01:23.350> a

for<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.020> horse<00:01:29.230> like<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.620> is<00:01:29.800> quite<00:01:29.980> a<00:01:30.100> long

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
for a horse like this is quite a long

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.120

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
one she was too weak obviously to stand

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.770 
one she was too weak obviously to stand
without<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.910> aid<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.270> sling

without the aid of a sling

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.320 
without the aid of a sling
when<00:01:35.200> we<00:01:35.350> first<00:01:35.620> rescued<00:01:36.370> her<00:01:36.580> and<00:01:36.850> although

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
when we first rescued her and although

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.200 
when we first rescued her and although
today<00:01:37.870> she<00:01:38.170> looks<00:01:38.410> like<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> completely<00:01:39.700> normal

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
today she looks like a completely normal

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.030 
today she looks like a completely normal
perfectly<00:01:40.570> healthy<00:01:40.990> horse<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:41.620> still<00:01:41.830> have

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
perfectly healthy horse we still have

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.850 
perfectly healthy horse we still have
quite<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.670> lot<00:01:42.910> of<00:01:42.940> work<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.510> do<00:01:43.660> she's<00:01:44.650> still

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
quite a lot of work to do she's still

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.190 
quite a lot of work to do she's still
incredibly<00:01:45.460> weak<00:01:45.640> ultimately<00:01:46.600> we<00:01:46.840> would<00:01:47.020> like

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
incredibly weak ultimately we would like

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.620 
incredibly weak ultimately we would like
to<00:01:47.230> rehome<00:01:47.770> her<00:01:47.980> as<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.130> riding<00:01:48.580> horse<00:01:48.610> but<00:01:49.450> at

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
to rehome her as a riding horse but at

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.690 
to rehome her as a riding horse but at
the<00:01:49.720> moment<00:01:49.900> she<00:01:50.170> needs<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.710> relearn<00:01:51.130> how<00:01:51.430> to

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
the moment she needs to relearn how to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.940 
the moment she needs to relearn how to
use<00:01:52.060> her<00:01:52.240> postural<00:01:52.780> muscles<00:01:52.810> correct<00:01:53.500> me<00:01:53.710> and

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
use her postural muscles correct me and

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.160 
use her postural muscles correct me and
so<00:01:54.640> eventually<00:01:54.880> hopefully<00:01:55.570> she<00:01:55.930> will<00:01:56.020> be
