wound<00:00:08.220> healing<00:00:08.490> can<00:00:09.180> occur<00:00:09.269> by<00:00:10.250> regeneration

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
wound healing can occur by regeneration

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.740 
wound healing can occur by regeneration
or<00:00:12.140> fibrosis<00:00:13.460> with<00:00:14.460> fibrosis<00:00:15.240> we're<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.660> to

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
or fibrosis with fibrosis we're going to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.230 
or fibrosis with fibrosis we're going to
get<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.019> formation<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:17.210> granulation<00:00:18.210> tissue

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
get the formation of granulation tissue

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.239 
get the formation of granulation tissue
and<00:00:19.099> fibrotic<00:00:20.099> scar<00:00:20.669> tissue<00:00:21.829> that<00:00:22.829> acts<00:00:23.039> as<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:23.249 
and fibrotic scar tissue that acts as a

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.409 
and fibrotic scar tissue that acts as a
patch<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:24.029> concealed<00:00:24.570> over<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.169> damaged<00:00:25.829> area

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
patch it concealed over the damaged area

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.470 
patch it concealed over the damaged area
with<00:00:27.419> regeneration<00:00:28.279> we<00:00:29.279> get<00:00:29.519> regeneration<00:00:30.239> of

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
with regeneration we get regeneration of

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.350 
with regeneration we get regeneration of
the<00:00:30.539> damaged<00:00:30.960> tissues<00:00:31.759> because<00:00:32.759> what<00:00:32.940> happens

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the damaged tissues because what happens

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.400 
the damaged tissues because what happens
in<00:00:33.510> regeneration<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.560> there<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.220> mitosis<00:00:36.060> of

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
in regeneration is there is mitosis of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.980 
in regeneration is there is mitosis of
adjacent<00:00:37.410> cells<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:38.370> migrate<00:00:39.060> to<00:00:39.750> heal

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990 
adjacent cells that then migrate to heal

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.650 
adjacent cells that then migrate to heal
the<00:00:40.200> damaged<00:00:40.560> tissue<00:00:40.880> so<00:00:41.880> in<00:00:42.060> regeneration

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the damaged tissue so in regeneration

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.860 
the damaged tissue so in regeneration
the<00:00:43.350> tissues<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.920> replaced<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.810> were

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the tissues are replaced as they were

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.940 
the tissues are replaced as they were
before<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.530> injury

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
before the injury

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
before the injury
there's<00:00:47.160> replacement<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> tissues

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
there's replacement of the tissues

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.010 
there's replacement of the tissues
rather<00:00:49.020> than<00:00:49.260> scar<00:00:49.590> tissue<00:00:49.800> formation<00:00:50.310> and

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
rather than scar tissue formation and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.970 
rather than scar tissue formation and
sometimes<00:00:52.020> there's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.380> of<00:00:52.530> both<00:00:52.710> there

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
sometimes there's a bit of both there

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
sometimes there's a bit of both there
can<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.130> some<00:00:53.430> regeneration<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:54.450> some

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
can be some regeneration with some

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.100 
can be some regeneration with some
fibrosis<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> how<00:00:57.150> do<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> various<00:00:57.420> tissues

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
fibrosis so how do the various tissues

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.710 
fibrosis so how do the various tissues
of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.290> body<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.340> regards<00:01:00.330> to<00:01:00.420> their

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
of the body do in regards to their

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.950 
of the body do in regards to their
ability<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.320> regenerate<00:01:02.060> in<00:01:03.060> their<00:01:03.390> ability

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
ability to regenerate in their ability

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.620 
ability to regenerate in their ability
to<00:01:03.990> undergo<00:01:04.890> mitotic<00:01:05.610> regeneration<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to undergo mitotic regeneration of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.600 
to undergo mitotic regeneration of
adjacent<00:01:07.110> adjacent<00:01:07.740> healthy<00:01:08.100> cells<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
adjacent adjacent healthy cells and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.140 
adjacent adjacent healthy cells and
migration<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.840> those<00:01:10.020> cells

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
migration of those cells

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.760 
migration of those cells
well<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> epidermis<00:01:13.050> is<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> very<00:01:13.470> good

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
well the epidermis is a very good

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
well the epidermis is a very good
regenerator<00:01:14.480> so<00:01:15.480> as<00:01:15.630> long<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.960> you've<00:01:16.080> got

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
regenerator so as long as you've got

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.830 
regenerator so as long as you've got
preserved<00:01:16.740> epidermis<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.659> get

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
preserved epidermis then you can get

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
preserved epidermis then you can get
regeneration<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> epidermis<00:01:20.520> without

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
regeneration of the epidermis without

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.260 
regeneration of the epidermis without
scar<00:01:21.600> tissue<00:01:21.840> formation<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.310> epidermal<00:01:24.030> cells

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
scar tissue formation so epidermal cells

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.860 
scar tissue formation so epidermal cells
can<00:01:24.540> regenerate<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.530> quite<00:01:25.740> well<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
can regenerate really quite well and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.420 
can regenerate really quite well and
perhaps<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.170> absolutely<00:01:28.740> best<00:01:29.040> healing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
perhaps the absolutely best healing

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310 
perhaps the absolutely best healing
tissue<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.120> body<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
tissue in the body what do you think it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
tissue in the body what do you think it
is<00:01:31.460> what<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.580> think's<00:01:32.790> probably<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> best

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
is what do you think's probably the best

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.240 
is what do you think's probably the best
healing<00:01:33.750> tissue<00:01:34.080> in<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> body<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.890> takes<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
healing tissue in the body it takes a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.500 
healing tissue in the body it takes a
long<00:01:35.400> time<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> does<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.150> make<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> good

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
long time but it does not make a good

heals<00:01:40.979> absolutely<00:01:41.640> superbly<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:43.020> someone

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
heals absolutely superbly if someone

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.410 
heals absolutely superbly if someone
breaks<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.890> bone<00:01:44.100> after<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.610> previous<00:01:44.909> fracture

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
breaks a bone after a previous fracture

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.990 
breaks a bone after a previous fracture
then<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> normally<00:01:46.979> doesn't<00:01:47.159> occur<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.850> the

then it normally doesn't occur at the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
then it normally doesn't occur at the
same<00:01:48.270> fracture<00:01:48.900> line<00:01:49.080> as<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.440> previous

same fracture line as the previous

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.789 
same fracture line as the previous
fracture<00:01:50.330> because<00:01:51.330> it<00:01:51.450> heals<00:01:51.780> very<00:01:52.470> very

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
fracture because it heals very very

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.250 
fracture because it heals very very
completely<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.760> can<00:01:53.940> take<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> long<00:01:54.360> time<00:01:54.570> but

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
completely it can take a long time but

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.289 
completely it can take a long time but
you<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.500> excellent<00:01:56.159> excellent<00:01:56.760> healing<00:01:57.210> in

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you get excellent excellent healing in

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.010 
you get excellent excellent healing in
bone<00:01:57.510> by<00:01:58.170> regeneration<00:01:59.010> and<00:02:00.020> reorganization

bone by regeneration and reorganization

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.050 
bone by regeneration and reorganization
of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.439> structure<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:03.119> tissues<00:02:03.619> and

another<00:02:06.060> very<00:02:06.570> good<00:02:06.869> regenerator<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
another very good regenerator is the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.660 
another very good regenerator is the
liver<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:09.390> hepatocytes<00:02:09.799> are<00:02:10.799> capable<00:02:11.550> of

liver the hepatocytes are capable of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.570 
liver the hepatocytes are capable of
ongoing<00:02:12.030> mitosis<00:02:12.900> throughout<00:02:13.290> life<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.520> you

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
ongoing mitosis throughout life so you

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.940 
ongoing mitosis throughout life so you
can<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:14.940> quite<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.240> significant<00:02:16.050> liver<00:02:16.230> in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
can have quite a significant liver in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.559 
can have quite a significant liver in
for<00:02:17.100> example<00:02:17.430> someone<00:02:17.819> might<00:02:17.970> drink<00:02:18.300> an<00:02:18.480> awful

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
for example someone might drink an awful

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.809 
for example someone might drink an awful
lot<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.900> alcohol<00:02:19.410> or<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.220> might<00:02:20.370> suffer<00:02:20.640> from

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
lot of alcohol or they might suffer from

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.420 
lot of alcohol or they might suffer from
viral<00:02:21.209> hepatitis<00:02:21.860> but<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.010> liver<00:02:23.190> can

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
viral hepatitis but the liver can

tolerating chronic insults so if someone

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.620 
tolerating chronic insults so if someone

regenerate<00:04:37.139> quite<00:04:37.650> well<00:04:37.919> from<00:04:38.159> acute<00:04:38.520> insults

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
regenerate quite well from acute insults

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.300 
regenerate quite well from acute insults
but<00:04:39.930> if<00:04:40.020> there's<00:04:40.199> an<00:04:40.259> ongoing<00:04:40.439> insult<00:04:41.159> they

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
but if there's an ongoing insult they

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.600 
but if there's an ongoing insult they

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
can't keep on regenerating forever so

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.490 
can't keep on regenerating forever so
for<00:04:44.759> example<00:04:45.090> in<00:04:45.210> chronic<00:04:45.539> bronchitis<00:04:45.750> you

for example in chronic bronchitis you

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.700 
for example in chronic bronchitis you
can<00:04:46.650> get<00:04:46.830> fibrosis<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.819> smaller<00:04:48.150> Airways

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
can get fibrosis of the smaller Airways

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.320 
can get fibrosis of the smaller Airways
well<00:04:49.710> if<00:04:49.800> someone<00:04:50.189> smokes<00:04:50.639> you<00:04:50.909> can<00:04:51.120> get<00:04:51.300> a

restore the strength of the muscle

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.409 
restore the strength of the muscle
somewhat<00:05:34.440> but<00:05:35.339> the<00:05:35.460> individual<00:05:35.909> cells<00:05:36.180> don't

mitotically<00:05:37.110> regenerate<00:05:37.860> unfortunately<00:05:38.639> and

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
mitotically regenerate unfortunately and

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.059 
mitotically regenerate unfortunately and
that's<00:05:39.599> particularly<00:05:40.169> true<00:05:40.620> if<00:05:40.830> there's<00:05:41.009> a

that's particularly true if there's a

myocardial infarction and the myocardial

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.240 
myocardial infarction and the myocardial
cells<00:05:44.940> die<00:05:45.330> there'll<00:05:46.289> be<00:05:46.349> granulation<00:05:47.099> and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.879 
cells die there'll be granulation and
fibrosis<00:05:47.699> but<00:05:48.349> unfortunately<00:05:49.349> there<00:05:49.620> won't

fibrosis but unfortunately there won't

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.550

be<00:05:50.270> regeneration<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.539> myocardial<00:05:51.900> cells

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
be regeneration of the myocardial cells

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.369 
be regeneration of the myocardial cells
and<00:05:53.069> that<00:05:53.729> means<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.180> can<00:05:54.360> lose<00:05:54.629> a<00:05:54.659> degree<00:05:55.349> of

and that means you can lose a degree of

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.100 
and that means you can lose a degree of
contractility<00:05:56.300> because<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.449> fibrous<00:05:57.870> tissue

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
contractility because the fibrous tissue

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.959 
contractility because the fibrous tissue
won't<00:05:58.589> contract<00:05:59.099> in<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.580> way<00:05:59.699> that<00:05:59.909> the

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
take over the damaged function so you

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.929 
take over the damaged function so you
can<00:07:00.180> get<00:07:00.569> some<00:07:00.780> regeneration<00:07:01.310> but<00:07:02.310> it's<00:07:02.460> often
