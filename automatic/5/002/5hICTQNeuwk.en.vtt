there's<00:00:06.470> a<00:00:06.560> lot<00:00:06.799> of<00:00:06.830> work<00:00:07.220> in<00:00:08.210> the<00:00:08.389> scientific

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
there's a lot of work in the scientific

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.379 
there's a lot of work in the scientific
literature<00:00:09.230> on<00:00:09.620> the<00:00:10.190> brain<00:00:10.549> mechanisms<00:00:11.240> that

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
literature on the brain mechanisms that

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.720 
literature on the brain mechanisms that
underlie<00:00:11.780> different<00:00:12.230> kinds<00:00:12.469> of<00:00:12.530> emotions<00:00:13.240> and

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
underlie different kinds of emotions and

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.160 
underlie different kinds of emotions and
compassion<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:18.430> love<00:00:19.430> and<00:00:20.060> loving<00:00:20.570> kindness

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
compassion and love and loving kindness

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.739 
compassion and love and loving kindness
and<00:00:21.650> forgiveness<00:00:22.599> each<00:00:24.220> include<00:00:25.220> at<00:00:25.609> least

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
and forgiveness each include at least

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.739 
and forgiveness each include at least
components<00:00:26.749> of<00:00:26.869> emotion<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.650> so<00:00:28.449> you<00:00:29.449> might

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:29.749 
components of emotion and so you might

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.069 
components of emotion and so you might
think<00:00:30.109> of<00:00:30.289> these<00:00:31.090> values<00:00:32.090> or<00:00:32.270> qualities<00:00:32.780> as

anxiety and disgust were the ones that

and with that as a framework we can then

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.710 
and with that as a framework we can then
approach<00:02:17.860> these<00:02:18.400> positive<00:02:19.180> qualities<00:02:19.690> of

approach these positive qualities of

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.600 
approach these positive qualities of
mind<00:02:20.170> as<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.760> end<00:02:22.390> product<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.320> skills<00:02:23.860> which

mind as the end product of skills which
can<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:25.090> cultivated<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:26.050> trained<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
can be cultivated and trained and so the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.570 
can be cultivated and trained and so the
notion<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:29.080> person<00:02:29.440> has<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.860> fixed<00:02:30.310> level

about the brain but we as a culture have

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.540 
about the brain but we as a culture have

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
these qualities can be cultivated but

chess it's our view that even among
people<00:02:57.910> who<00:02:58.690> report<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.590> they<00:02:59.769> have

people who report that they have
relatively<00:03:00.880> little<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.390> these<00:03:01.600> qualities

each of us is born with the potential

each of us is born with the potential
for<00:03:06.459> all<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.209> these<00:03:07.329> qualities<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.430> it's

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
for all of these qualities and it's

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.729 
for all of these qualities and it's
something<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.360> through<00:03:10.690> training<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.590> be

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
something that through training can be

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.789 
something that through training can be
cultivated<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.760> many<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.019> world's<00:03:14.500> great

cultivate these positive human qualities
and<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.730> we've<00:03:27.730> been<00:03:28.030> extremely<00:03:28.780> interested

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
and so we've been extremely interested

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.100 
and so we've been extremely interested
in<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.980> use<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.640> meditation<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.600> other<00:03:31.720> kinds
