a<00:00:19.770> little<00:00:20.070> bit<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.220> cobble<00:00:20.580> just<00:00:21.510> up<00:00:21.750> there<00:00:21.990> let

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
a little bit of cobble just up there let

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.830 
a little bit of cobble just up there let
me<00:00:22.769> see<00:00:22.920> if<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.340> back<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.730> some<00:00:24.510> cobble

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
me see if I get it back for some cobble

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.689 
me see if I get it back for some cobble
up<00:00:24.900> there<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> bedrock<00:00:25.650> there's<00:00:26.519> some

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
up there on the bedrock there's some

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.240 
up there on the bedrock there's some
little<00:00:26.849> deposits<00:00:30.470> table<00:00:31.470> 10<00:00:31.650> bit<00:00:31.859> wrong<00:00:32.009> low

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
little deposits table 10 bit wrong low

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
little deposits table 10 bit wrong low
deposits<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.030> sand<00:00:38.300> great<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.570> hole<00:00:39.719> down

there

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.340 
there
I've<00:00:41.700> heard<00:00:42.090> people<00:00:42.270> finding<00:00:42.719> cracks<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
I've heard people finding cracks in this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.869 
I've heard people finding cracks in this
bedrock<00:00:43.770> where<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.250> see<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
bedrock where they can just see the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.850 
bedrock where they can just see the
flakes<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.270> gold<00:00:45.300> tape<00:00:45.809> taking<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> bottom<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
flakes of gold tape taking the bottom of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.819 
flakes of gold tape taking the bottom of
them<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> let's<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.200> find<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> nice

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
them so let's see if I can find it nice

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
them so let's see if I can find it nice
waterfall<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.030> coming<00:00:51.300> into<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
waterfall just up there coming into the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.939 
waterfall just up there coming into the
Creek<00:00:51.930> Creek<00:00:53.210> just<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:54.570> creep<00:00:54.949> freezer

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
Creek Creek just little creep freezer

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.630 
Creek Creek just little creep freezer
with<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:57.890> right<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> middle<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> claim

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
with it right in the middle of the claim

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.319 
with it right in the middle of the claim
right<00:00:59.850> now<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.359> hang<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.840> more<00:01:01.020> downstream

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
right now so hang you up more downstream

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.399 
right now so hang you up more downstream
kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.480> point<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:04.140> I'm<00:01:04.290> gonna

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
kind of on point so I think I'm gonna

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
kind of on point so I think I'm gonna
check<00:01:04.680> downstream<00:01:05.280> okay<00:01:05.489> let's<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> can

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
check downstream okay let's see if I can

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.359 
check downstream okay let's see if I can
find<00:01:06.119> something<00:01:06.659> nice<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> pause<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.100> around

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
find something nice to pause it around

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.940 
find something nice to pause it around
the<00:01:08.460> backside<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> point<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.799> some

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the backside of the point and do some

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.300 
the backside of the point and do some
sampling<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.490> crazy

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
sampling this is crazy

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.170 
sampling this is crazy
everything<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> Fraser<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
everything on the Fraser is just a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
everything on the Fraser is just a
bigger<00:01:18.420> scale<00:01:18.920> unfortunately<00:01:19.920> that's<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
bigger scale unfortunately that's the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
bigger scale unfortunately that's the
hill<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> come<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.479> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
hill you have to come down it's not that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.179 
hill you have to come down it's not that
bad<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> nice<00:01:22.380> foot<00:01:22.740> trail<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
bad there's a nice foot trail all the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.340 
bad there's a nice foot trail all the
way<00:01:23.340> down<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.359 

we'll<00:01:30.350> come<00:01:30.500> back<00:01:30.530> once<00:01:30.829> I've<00:01:31.040> done<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.189> bit

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
we'll come back once I've done a bit

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.399 
we'll come back once I've done a bit
sampling<00:01:31.759> see<00:01:32.090> what<00:01:32.210> reflects<00:01:32.420> gold<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:36.320> it

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
sampling see what reflects gold so it

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.600 
sampling see what reflects gold so it
took<00:01:36.500> me<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.649> few<00:01:36.680> pans<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.250> figure<00:01:37.430> out<00:01:37.490> where

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
took me a few pans to figure out where

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.399 
took me a few pans to figure out where
the<00:01:37.670> gold<00:01:37.790> was<00:01:37.970> hiding<00:01:38.330> here<00:01:38.509> but<00:01:38.720> definitely

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
the gold was hiding here but definitely

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.530 
the gold was hiding here but definitely
found<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.740> went<00:01:40.310> upstream<00:01:40.790> rather<00:01:41.149> than<00:01:41.330> down

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
found it went upstream rather than down

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.149 
found it went upstream rather than down
first<00:01:41.930> went<00:01:42.140> downstream<00:01:42.470> couldn't<00:01:42.799> find<00:01:42.979> much

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
first went downstream couldn't find much

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.820 
first went downstream couldn't find much
there<00:01:43.399> went<00:01:44.210> upstream<00:01:44.539> found<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.170> broken<00:01:45.710> up

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
there went upstream found the broken up

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.649 
there went upstream found the broken up
shale<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.399> was<00:01:46.520> holding<00:01:46.789> lots<00:01:47.119> of<00:01:47.420> river

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
shale that was holding lots of river

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.020 
shale that was holding lots of river
gravels<00:01:48.080> in<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.500> dug<00:01:49.369> into<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.670> shale<00:01:49.880> as

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
gravels in it and dug into the shale as

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.940 
gravels in it and dug into the shale as
I<00:01:50.090> said<00:01:50.240> quite<00:01:50.390> easy<00:01:50.570> digging<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.140> sure

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
I said quite easy digging and sure

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.149 
I said quite easy digging and sure
enough<00:01:53.140> there's<00:01:54.140> just<00:01:54.380> my<00:01:54.500> first<00:01:54.710> pan<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.039> that

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
enough there's just my first pan in that

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.880 
enough there's just my first pan in that
shale<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.909> there's<00:01:56.270> ten<00:01:56.929> good-sized<00:01:57.470> pieces

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
shale and there's ten good-sized pieces

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.669 
shale and there's ten good-sized pieces
in<00:01:58.009> here<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.200> like<00:02:03.470> it

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
in here so I like it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.160 
in here so I like it
bedrock<00:02:04.490> does<00:02:04.759> hold<00:02:04.970> gold<00:02:05.240> we<00:02:05.720> go<00:02:05.840> back<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.110> do

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
bedrock does hold gold we go back and do

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.570 
bedrock does hold gold we go back and do
a<00:02:06.200> few<00:02:06.350> more<00:02:06.440> pans<00:02:06.679> from<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.009> one<00:02:07.159> spot<00:02:07.429> and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
a few more pans from that one spot and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.949 
a few more pans from that one spot and
then<00:02:07.729> maybe<00:02:07.970> look<00:02:08.179> over<00:02:08.479> at<00:02:08.630> some<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.899> this

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
then maybe look over at some of this

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.559 
then maybe look over at some of this
other<00:02:09.110> bedrock<00:02:09.880> there's<00:02:10.880> some<00:02:11.030> really<00:02:11.209> flat

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
other bedrock there's some really flat

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.270 
other bedrock there's some really flat
areas<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.440> come<00:02:12.830> out<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.100> water

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
areas that just come out of the water

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.660 
areas that just come out of the water
and<00:02:14.049> as<00:02:15.049> I<00:02:15.170> said<00:02:15.230> before<00:02:15.350> I've<00:02:15.890> heard<00:02:16.220> stories

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
and as I said before I've heard stories

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.250 
and as I said before I've heard stories
of<00:02:16.700> people<00:02:17.090> looking<00:02:17.330> down<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.720> cracked<00:02:17.989> some

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
of people looking down and cracked some

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.229 
of people looking down and cracked some
whole<00:02:18.440> flat<00:02:18.680> areas<00:02:18.980> like<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:20.000> you'll

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
whole flat areas like that and you'll

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.120 
whole flat areas like that and you'll
see<00:02:20.269> gold<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:23.019> there<00:02:24.019> are<00:02:24.140> tons<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.920> little

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
see gold in it there are tons of little

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.220 
see gold in it there are tons of little
cracks<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.790> crevices<00:02:25.880> around<00:02:26.390> here<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.080> can

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
cracks and crevices around here that can

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.580 
cracks and crevices around here that can
catch<00:02:27.470> gold<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.160> want<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:28.970> see<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> piece<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.810> the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
catch gold I want to see a piece on the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.500 
catch gold I want to see a piece on the
surface

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
surface

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.809 
surface
you<00:02:33.019> know<00:02:33.110> we<00:02:33.470> got<00:02:33.620> both<00:02:33.769> here<00:02:36.549> okay<00:02:37.549> well<00:02:37.790> I

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
you know we got both here okay well I

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.430 
you know we got both here okay well I
managed<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.450> dig<00:02:38.780> out<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.140> pause<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.319> bit

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
managed to dig out that to pause a bit

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.710 
managed to dig out that to pause a bit
more<00:02:39.739> got<00:02:40.489> down<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.760> where<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.360> bedrock

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
more got down to where the bedrock

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.960 
more got down to where the bedrock
flattened<00:02:42.200> off<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.650> serve<00:02:42.799> smooth<00:02:43.280> off<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.940> I

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
flattened off and serve smooth off and I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.369 
flattened off and serve smooth off and I
could<00:02:44.120> actually<00:02:44.269> just<00:02:44.420> scrape<00:02:44.870> straight

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
could actually just scrape straight

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.350 
could actually just scrape straight
bedrock<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.250> yeah

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
bedrock and yeah

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.570 
bedrock and yeah
got<00:02:47.510> much<00:02:47.750> better<00:02:47.989> results<00:02:48.769> yeah<00:02:49.340> lungs

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
got much better results yeah lungs

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.390 
got much better results yeah lungs
bedrock<00:02:52.000> lots<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.180> gold

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
bedrock lots of gold

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.089 
bedrock lots of gold
so<00:02:55.660> very<00:02:56.660> nice<00:02:56.810> claim<00:02:57.349> let<00:02:57.560> me<00:02:57.620> go<00:02:57.709> check<00:02:57.860> check

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
so very nice claim let me go check check

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.199 
so very nice claim let me go check check
out<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.280> other<00:02:58.430> two<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.730> see<00:02:58.879> what<00:02:58.970> they<00:02:59.060> look

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
out the other two and see what they look

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.970 
out the other two and see what they look
like<00:02:59.239> and<00:03:00.549> make<00:03:01.549> some<00:03:01.670> decision<00:03:02.000> from<00:03:02.090> there

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
like and make some decision from there

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.250 
like and make some decision from there
so<00:03:03.980> far<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:04.819> is<00:03:04.879> the<00:03:05.000> best<00:03:05.269> but<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.110> also

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
so far this is the best but it's also

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.350 
so far this is the best but it's also
the<00:03:06.410> first<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.250> we'll<00:03:07.910> go<00:03:08.060> through<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.269> though

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
the first so we'll go through it though

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.910 
the first so we'll go through it though
that<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.540> look<00:03:08.660> like<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:10.340> good<00:03:10.579> anyone
