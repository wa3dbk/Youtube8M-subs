00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 and if you are fans of formula 1 euros if you are simply 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.700
 Curious like me, you are already wondering what effect it has 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.610
 can do to ride in this kind of gear so we know that some 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.030
 companies offer small tricks in formula 1 but it still costs 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.759
 quite expensive and then we are not in race conditions and well you go 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.289
 see that there is another embedded solution in another simulator of 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.260
 formula 1 as for planes and it is in France on the side of Lyon that it is 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.489
 past 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.759
 but a single-seater car race tempts you but you've cheated 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.980
 you are not reassured as to the speed increases but you should have 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.360
 Formula 1 champion 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.360
 within ten years the possible and now within your reach 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.590
 so she in a few minutes you'll take a seat inside of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.120
 formula 1 with 150 hp engine power for an approximate weight of 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 650 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.650
 18 car racing simulators are at your disposal offering you 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.130
 driving sensations is very real 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.070
 if by mistake six rallies and if endurance prototype how do you in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.840
 to show all the colors 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.930
 how thanks to a technology out of the ordinary especially for the army 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.200
 a real car of formula 1 is installed on a platform this is the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.570
 first green party 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.399
 when to the real 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.470
 the land is being sold alone 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.590
 but once the machine is launched they can go up until now from 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.600
 centimeters eidos that transports us to more than two meters from the ground 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.300
 thanks to its climbs and descents these drifts left and right the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.070
 driving sensation is impressive 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.190
 we will transcribe from 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.110
 two movements the first what we did this feeling of being 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.050
 boarded forward so the senator 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.420
 to embark forwards 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.000
 except that when you will do in a real car 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.380
 % damon and flora 150 200 meters to brake and we have not 150 and 200 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.910
 meters ahead we do not have a meter in the front to put in the back by 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.480
 against 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.300
 to hold this braking at a distance in addition to the movement before the car to 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.900
 tilt 5 mes5 is no longer depending on the braking force and you 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.940
 fitting car you do not realize by the end of his life are you 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.500
 in the process of realizing that your human body is moving forward 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.970
 are harnessed launched what makes that that you requinque and that's it 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.310
 how to get there 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.580
 contacted yesterday is the reverse the car must bow backwards 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.320
 and then if we accelerate strong withdrawal stimulators to indignant 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.559
 the driver is completely glued to his seat 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.029
 not only must work but also the arms wrists it is early 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.260
 all that a Formula 1 driver will make you feel like ten years ago 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.460
 accidents of course 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.180
 but once sitting in these cars a security arsenal but 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.990
 still available to us then we needed a belt 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.059
 after we can have different types of belt 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.259
 the mayor of people in the world of racing for banks 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.809
 we go on really what we find in the car when we are on a 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.419
 four point device you have a central bank it serves for the 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:39.999
 security 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.609
 I also play an important role 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.089
 a f1 without the hum of the engine 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.569
 it's no longer an art form 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.189
 and then the lessons 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.189
 but because we drive a lot of race cars with the 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:50.669
 his 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.459
 and all these technical elements without a computer system necklace but 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.939
 not just any 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.290
 this article is connected to a computer this writing it's towards 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.489
 23:30 it makes us a case that does not alter doubt 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.849
 everything is under the car 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.819
 if you press the accelerator 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.519
 the systems displays on the screen your speed 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.219
 he is ousted 500 million 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.619
 to accentuate the sensation 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.409
 yes synchronizations but that is not because of cramps and is 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:19.019
 made 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.029
 that takes a little bit of all the motion systems the systems 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.399
 visual sense and that is much related to the maneuver is tight 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.129
 simply we have to see that all the machines are connected to each other their 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.819
 plans to what is being conveyed series why 54 reactors that are connected 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.039
 between them they are all connected by a control room which she goes wrong precisely 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.849
 to synchronize between each car starke one is not simply to yield 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.389
 single car but that she knows that her client feels that the principle 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.389
 is that everyone is doing a race against one another 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.539
 too rigid and technicians who serves the simulators there are six screens in front 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.439
 him what exactly matches that every girl to touvois at his 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.310
 race gace return of each senator 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.700
 in addition to the technical part they check all the organs of 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.559
 security are 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.999
 everything was perfectly synchronized it only remains that resulted these 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.120
 future world champions to get amazing results 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.920
 the elysÃ©e 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.949
 it's just that I appreciate you m 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.150
 in 2006 the best place 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.639
 when I crack my heart for example 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.759
 unfortunately you are an ace of the steering wheel on the circuits is not given 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.540
 to everybody 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.459
 but by the way who can drive these cars 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.639
 with mister everybody 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.349
 what did we really not create this project for pilots 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.930
 professionals even though we have more and more four weeks which 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.529
 come here to ride because I see a real interest 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:30.710
 for now in 31 weeks 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.169
 this acquired goal is the general public 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.039
 the only constraint is to be over 18, so you do not have to have the 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:37.770
 allowed 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.099
 this idea is born of young drivers who are not licensed and who conditions 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.300
 very very good 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.840
 the big prices are now at your fingertips 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.460
 you just have to sit in one of these cars and it's right in a 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.280
 virtual wall does not even hurt
