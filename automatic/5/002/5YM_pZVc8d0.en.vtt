00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.050
 hello to all and welcome to the internet we were not counted among the 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.730
 wide call to canala but rather in time we are in portugal for 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.820
 try a brand new product lexus ct 200h this is the first 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.500
 compact and very well to use hybrid motorization a simple question 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 pascal the coz 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.230
 it is not a first that for the hybrid it is also a first 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.440
 for lexus is-f never the Japanese manufacturer has committed to this format 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.510
 so as not to let customers go to European brands 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.190
 exile concentrates all its know-how in less than 4 min 35 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.600
 the om is so new and especially smaller we find what distinguishes 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.520
 a lexus from another car the grille and the telescope 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 rear well encompassing just like on the rx 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.090
 nervous and already predicted the lexus by opposing a rather discrete design without 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.810
 for lack of identity 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.990
 it is worth two hours which is already a big step in fact when we 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.909
 wants to seduce a young clientele 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.710
 as a reminder of the internal organs the lexus hybrids logos are relieved of 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.710
 blue as on a sad fate 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.860
 lexus at the toyota premium brand 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.720
 the ct 200h does not bother the haye whether it is the back as well as the front 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.850
 it's well drawn and well the assembly especially here with 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.040
 the adoption of any news of assizes 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.810
 if not at the level ergonomics it's the weight except the central console that makes a 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.869
 little bit old but that's a matter of taste 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.250
 but as a rule it compensates perfectly three years ago 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.159
 Rule 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.739
 the challenger who was the size of the premises and the role of the recreation center 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.549
 lexus is offered in a rather confined cabin 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.090
 accustomed to grandiloquent last missile and elicit proof of measurement 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.439
 trend morrison everywhere while flattering our eyes 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.299
 beautiful assembly leather and plastic accessories of excellent performance 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.169
 reasoning cormier a little more style otherwise everything is simple no button 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.209
 to prove complicated to master 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.919
 little highlight of the hybrid is its interactivity 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.299
 the screens you spoke about changes color depending on the driving mode 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.959
 honestly it's not in either the lexus ct 200h and misses the 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.829
 coach 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.409
 sall 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.439
 Alas 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.909
 how can we propel the ct 200h 05 - including that of afp 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.099
 the third generation with its advantages and faults it's not 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.069
 a lot of sense making it look like it's not even at all 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.510
 in all-electric mode in 140 kilometers an hour but look we're going 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.469
 do not start 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.949
 we took his right foot 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.390
 some restaurateurs 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.349
 who does not advance 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.759
 it's the world 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.759
 from the 200h side 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.729
 a cvt or how to sabotage a car lexus almost resumes in his 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.769
 completeness the technique of a prius but especially keeps the box to 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.559
 continuous variable transmission 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.889
 this series was very economical and efficient but responsible in these 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.289
 towards lack of character all modes of driving for a car 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.289
 enjoy a very dynamic chassis 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.589
 so it's not exciting for a compact but at the pump you do not win 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:11.399
 normally equipped with 136 horses 200h side can reach a consumption 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.259
 average of 3 4 8 liters per 100 km 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.159
 in addition the battery charging modes are very effective and 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.969
 smart 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.969
 in town you can more often in short term silence 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.599
 a month ago 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.659
 1st price 29 thousand euros our high-end model is 42000 euros 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.089
 but all that is the 2000 euros bonus and where he quoted his age but 

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:36.979
 that 94 grams per kilometer of second zone
