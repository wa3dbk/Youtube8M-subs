00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
gameplay from what I captured on bio lab

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.720 
gameplay from what I captured on bio lab
and<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.710> are<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> pros<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.100> cons<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> prop

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and there are the pros and cons the prop

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.910 
and there are the pros and cons the prop
the<00:00:50.879> big<00:00:51.059> thing<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.140> doesn't<00:00:52.680> have

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the big thing is that it doesn't have

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.459 
the big thing is that it doesn't have
ammo<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:54.000> unlimited<00:00:54.510> ammo<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.379> its

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
ammo it's got unlimited ammo but its

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.080 
ammo it's got unlimited ammo but its
glittering<00:00:55.710> mechanic<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.610> used<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> go

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
glittering mechanic so if you used to go

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.299 
glittering mechanic so if you used to go
on<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.360> too<00:00:57.480> long<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.960> will<00:00:58.050> overheat<00:00:58.620> which

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
on for too long it will overheat which

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.470 
on for too long it will overheat which
means<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.969> wait<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.329> cool

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
means that you have to wait and cool

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
means that you have to wait and cool
down<00:01:00.510> which<00:01:00.870> kind<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.140> works<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.739> same<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
down which kind of works like same as a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.680 
down which kind of works like same as a
reload<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.090> borrowing<00:01:03.480> in

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
reload but if you're borrowing in

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.140 
reload but if you're borrowing in
controlled<00:01:04.080> bursts<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.549> never<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.030> have

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
controlled bursts you never really have

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
controlled bursts you never really have
to<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.869> it'll<00:01:07.020> cool<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.260> itself

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
to do this and it'll cool down itself

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
to do this and it'll cool down itself
which<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.909> which<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.270> neat<00:01:09.659> because

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
which it which is really neat because

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.510 
which it which is really neat because
it's<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.290> taking<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> support<00:01:11.280> role

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it's kind of taking the support role

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's kind of taking the support role
weapon<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> how<00:01:12.570> an<00:01:12.720> lmg<00:01:13.140> supposed<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> lie

lot<00:01:26.340> slow<00:01:26.580> compared<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> other<00:01:27.150> weapons<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
lot slow compared to other weapons and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
lot slow compared to other weapons and
accusing<00:01:28.650> them<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.920> gun<00:01:29.130> across<00:01:29.369> range<00:01:29.759> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
accusing them of this gun across range I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
accusing them of this gun across range I
found<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.049> easy<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.920> lose<00:01:32.070> track<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.369> my

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
found it really easy to lose track of my

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
found it really easy to lose track of my
target<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.000> cuz<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.299> hallett<00:01:33.540> Ironside

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
target just cuz of hallett Ironside

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.469 
target just cuz of hallett Ironside
worked<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.759> couldn't<00:01:35.759> track<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> pop<00:01:36.240> because

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
worked I couldn't track and pop because

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.789 
worked I couldn't track and pop because
the<00:01:36.570> yellow<00:01:36.780> beam<00:01:36.960> will<00:01:37.140> make<00:01:37.229> him<00:01:37.380> lose<00:01:37.530> if

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the yellow beam will make him lose if

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
the yellow beam will make him lose if
they<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.220> dash<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.729> found<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.299> hard<00:01:39.509> which

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
they kind of dash I found it hard which

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.260 
they kind of dash I found it hard which
kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.990> counted<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.590> balance<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
kind of counted and balance out the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.539 
kind of counted and balance out the
likely<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> no<00:01:42.869> recall<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> don't

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
likely that the no recall so I don't

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.859 
likely that the no recall so I don't
think<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.790> gonna<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.939> an<00:01:45.030> overpowered<00:01:45.420> gun<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
think it's gonna be an overpowered gun I

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.120 
think it's gonna be an overpowered gun I
don't<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.350> there's<00:01:46.470> gonna<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.920> many

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
don't think there's gonna be that many

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.530 
don't think there's gonna be that many
people<00:01:47.430> who<00:01:47.579> use<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> Pure<00:01:48.329> Reason

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
people who use it for the Pure Reason

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.200 
people who use it for the Pure Reason
the<00:01:48.869> times<00:01:49.110> kill<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.369> lot<00:01:50.640> slow<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the times kill is a lot slow the one

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.280 
the times kill is a lot slow the one
thing<00:01:51.390> i<00:01:51.479> did<00:01:51.659> find<00:01:51.869> really<00:01:52.170> interesting

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
thing i did find really interesting

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.690 
thing i did find really interesting
which<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.250> why<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.490> doing<00:01:53.579> this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
which I know it's why I was doing this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.959 
which I know it's why I was doing this
if<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.540> look<00:01:54.810> at<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.930> site<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.619> when<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> when<00:01:56.909> I

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
if you look at the site I when I when I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.209 
if you look at the site I when I when I
lock<00:01:57.149> onto<00:01:57.329> an<00:01:57.479> enemy<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.079> turns<00:01:58.530> red<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.070> it's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
lock onto an enemy it turns red so it's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740 
lock onto an enemy it turns red so it's
white<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.790> normal<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
white when it's normal and then the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.240 
white when it's normal and then the
second<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> lock<00:02:01.229> onto<00:02:01.380> an<00:02:01.560> enemy<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.100> turn

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
second I lock onto an enemy it will turn

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.709 
second I lock onto an enemy it will turn
red<00:02:02.520> which<00:02:02.729> would<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.909> really<00:02:03.119> useful<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.630> like

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
red which would be really useful in like

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.260 
red which would be really useful in like
hardcore<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.100> stuff<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.820> like

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
hardcore and stuff like that and like

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.609 
hardcore and stuff like that and like
your<00:02:06.570> turn<00:02:06.780> white<00:02:07.049> when<00:02:07.079> you're<00:02:07.380> over<00:02:07.590> a
