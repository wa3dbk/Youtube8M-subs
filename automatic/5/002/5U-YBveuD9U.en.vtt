this<00:04:14.190> vehicle<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.819> I<00:04:15.780> think<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:16.620> see<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.919> I

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
this vehicle is I think you can see it I

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.979 
this vehicle is I think you can see it I
put<00:04:17.220> another<00:04:17.519> mirror<00:04:17.970> one<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.389> little<00:04:18.660> mirror

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
put another mirror one the little mirror

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.719 
put another mirror one the little mirror
so<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.260> can<00:04:19.289> kind<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.560> get<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.370> kind<00:04:20.639> of

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
so you can kind of get that you kind of

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.409 
so you can kind of get that you kind of
get<00:04:21.599> that<00:04:21.630> blind<00:04:22.049> spot<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.729> lot<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.849> times<00:04:24.060> by

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
little bit encapsulated at first but

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.510 
little bit encapsulated at first but
once<00:04:33.539> you<00:04:33.720> get<00:04:33.870> used<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.380> it's<00:04:35.010> not<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.220> big

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
once you get used to it it's not a big

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.760 
once you get used to it it's not a big
deal<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:36.750> just<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.990> matter<00:04:37.110> getting<00:04:37.440> used<00:04:37.680> to

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
deal it's just a matter getting used to

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.290 
deal it's just a matter getting used to
it<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.039> getting<00:04:38.280> used<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.789> with<00:04:39.150> your

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300
