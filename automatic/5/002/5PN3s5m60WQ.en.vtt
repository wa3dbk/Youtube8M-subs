00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.820
 hi all today come together 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.869
 for a new episode of my series 15 vs 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.070
 karsten heine the series where I compare 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.890
 vehicles that you could see 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.230
 previously on my channel so the jcct 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.380
 wanted to compare two planes this time 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.880
 so that's the titan is the new jet 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.640
 Lapointe joined is no longer too 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.210
 what's his name so I wanted 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.850
 show after anyway here we are 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.210
 place the titan one is the plane 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.620
 military who is behind is the new 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440
 plane this is the one that I 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.629
 protect my soul so we go 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.199
 do three tests with his planes so 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.460
 the first test will therefore be the plane that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.410
 will take off as quickly as this 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.699
 simply 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.460
 so here is the second test will be the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.219
 ground speed which one go the most 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.530
 fast and third and last test 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.519
 will be the speed in the air which one who 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.380
 want the fastest 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.000
 so let's go for the first 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.830
 test but you can see 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.330
 look at it look at the jet of the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.320
 Princess of the poles right away 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.280
 so here I am going to watch everything from 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280
 what's the name of the diet? 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.210
 so we have it here we will go to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.680
 second test so on the second and 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.840
 third thesis or effects at the same 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.830
 time if ground speed and speed 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.830
 in the air in the east immediately 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.270
 so here we are for the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.220
 second and third piece goji 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.950
 find the name called the Midget 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.910
 So here we go to speed 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.910
 on the ground 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.830
 that's it, but I'm waiting for my friend but 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:02.210

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.830
 so here we go we see we are 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.010
 party where there is almost a party 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.010
 time 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.840
 hop there you saw we went in 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.180
 same time and you will see that the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.090
 ground speed and a little bit more 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.460
 strong in the midget and who after us 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.810
