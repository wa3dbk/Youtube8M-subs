00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.369
 min 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.179
 yes 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.099
 When I arrived in Spain 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.399
 lee there was a huge huge victory complex at the time 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.859
 the dictatorship then there was a great complex of cultural inferiority 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.260
 good in in photography exactly the same 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.820
 here everything good was what came from outside had to do as those outside 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.180
 efe 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.360
 ios like 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.410
 actis the trip to the rest 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.390
 in the complex of this type 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.380
 and what I wanted to do precisely Spanish photography 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.990
 but not Spanish 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.650
 in those issues necessarily but in the language itself in something that has already happened 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 in the same way that he and his American colleagues 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
 photographing america and american culture 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
 I did not want to photograph Spain 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.340
 this only almost abandoned black and white causing red mojo 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.490
 because when I started 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.880
 to work 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 associated croatian documentary 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.990
 in it they were always done with the same language ie 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.420
 federer had a standard language to be in command language 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.430
 there were very good photographers inside but you had to look 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.500
 the feet of the few players he had told us 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.250
 because everyone works in the same language 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.050
 so what I was interested in pillaring language is the language itself 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.680
 photographic how 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.960
 he is to build the images more than 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.610
 the content 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 and it was not until I started swimming with color 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
 how it was never done 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.070
 that he suddenly opened the way to the door and children 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.139
 agencies 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
 in my time that is true 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.339
 it was an outlet for documentary photography 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.569
 very clear 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.059
 it was the time a few grams 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:25.859
 with such as 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.999
 that instance from the sea 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.609
 as his heir 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.019
 or even in Spain 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.019
 when he started country, he had great reports 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.909
 all that is disappearing and cables 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.609
 they are already doing 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.609
 in the science of code magazine 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.289
 from the heart but he reiterated 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.289
 for a little bit more pretentious, let's say 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.299
 no longer deceived do not send photographers to cover events 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.259
 we are not soft last big events 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.700
 the emblematic photographs of your area 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.340
 the windy iconic as the remaining photographs of its members 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.209
 that many times are made with 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.209
 amateurs with mobile phones is accepting 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.819
 history history is no longer documented 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.599
 how are we little
