00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I'm gonna be 15 because basically

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.310 
I'm gonna be 15 because basically
there's<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.340> zombies<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.030> obviously<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.840> if

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
there's more zombies but obviously if if

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
there's more zombies but obviously if if
you're<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.859> good<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> gamer<00:00:59.699> or<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.329> go

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
you're not as good as a gamer or you go

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.410 
you're not as good as a gamer or you go
down<00:01:00.719> easily<00:01:01.160> round<00:01:02.160> 10<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> lot<00:01:02.789> easier<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
down easily round 10 is a lot easier and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.119 
down easily round 10 is a lot easier and
also<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.439> headshots<00:01:04.650> quicker

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
also you can get headshots quicker

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.649 
also you can get headshots quicker
because<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> zombies<00:01:06.090> aren't<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.510> powerful

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
because the zombies aren't as powerful

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.230 
because the zombies aren't as powerful
but<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.860> around<00:01:08.010> 15<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.760> come<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> lot

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
but I'm around 15 they come a lot

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.130 
but I'm around 15 they come a lot
quicker<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:10.680> I'm<00:01:10.740> gonna<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.159> that

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
quicker so that's what I'm gonna do that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.100 
quicker so that's what I'm gonna do that
okay<00:01:13.140> anyway<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.970> want<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.360> jogging<00:01:15.930> okay

that's the first thing you want to do to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.359

like that because you need to increase

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.480 
like that because you need to increase
your<00:01:27.240> kill<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.170> ratio<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
your kill to down ratio to get this

your kill to down ratio to get this
shotgun<00:01:29.970> round<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> you're<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.180> open<00:01:33.479> up

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
shotgun round so you're gonna open up

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.749 
shotgun round so you're gonna open up
this<00:01:33.720> door<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.590> these<00:01:34.740> stairs<00:01:35.070> away

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
this door here got these stairs away

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.100 
this door here got these stairs away
from<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> door<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:37.110> Juggernog<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.950> also<00:01:39.110> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
from the door get Juggernog and also the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.069 
from the door get Juggernog and also the
m14<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> really<00:01:41.600> good<00:01:42.600> gun<00:01:42.810> for

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
m14 is actually a really good gun for

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.130 
m14 is actually a really good gun for
headshots<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:44.040> obviously<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:45.140> normal

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
headshots but obviously it's not normal

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.260 
headshots but obviously it's not normal
and<00:01:46.229> 15<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:46.979> round<00:01:47.280> 15<00:01:47.700> zombies<00:01:48.119> are

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and 15 because round 15 zombies are

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.620 
and 15 because round 15 zombies are
quite<00:01:48.450> powerful<00:01:49.070> but<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> get<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> m14

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
quite powerful but if you get the m14

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.620 
quite powerful but if you get the m14
and<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.159> pack<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> punch<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.390> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and then you pack a punch it it is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.289 
and then you pack a punch it it is
actually<00:01:54.840> very<00:01:55.079> good<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.680> headshots<00:01:56.299> but

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
actually very good for headshots but

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.480 
actually very good for headshots but
eventually<00:01:57.600> when<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.710> becomes<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.340> bad

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
eventually when this becomes what bad

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.170 
eventually when this becomes what bad
you<00:01:59.640> want<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> get<00:01:59.939> something<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
machine guns are much better so you just

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.920 
machine guns are much better so you just
want<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> do<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> train<00:02:23.849> here<00:02:24.120> where<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.510> run<00:02:24.720> to

want<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.000> go<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.480> get<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> box<00:04:51.650> from<00:04:52.520> there

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
want to go and get a box from there

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:01.830 
want to go and get a box from there
which<00:04:53.420> I'm<00:04:53.570> gonna<00:04:53.720> do<00:04:54.580> later<00:04:55.580> in<00:04:55.910> this<00:04:56.000> video

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.690 

also<00:05:02.840> just<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.200> tip<00:05:03.470> for<00:05:03.710> this<00:05:03.830> train<00:05:04.160> you<00:05:04.520> don't

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
also just a tip for this train you don't

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.040 
also just a tip for this train you don't
want<00:05:04.880> to<00:05:04.940> run<00:05:05.120> into<00:05:05.360> those<00:05:05.480> quacks<00:05:05.840> you

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
want to run into those quacks you

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.660 
want to run into those quacks you
actually<00:05:06.290> want<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.440> jump<00:05:07.010> over<00:05:07.340> them

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
actually want to jump over them

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.960 
actually want to jump over them
because<00:05:08.480> it<00:05:08.630> slows<00:05:08.930> you<00:05:09.110> down<00:05:09.140> and<00:05:10.100> that<00:05:10.790> was<00:05:10.940> a

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
because it slows you down and that was a

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.600 
because it slows you down and that was a
bit<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.270> a<00:05:11.390> fail<00:05:11.840> there<00:05:12.110> but<00:05:13.100> I<00:05:13.130> just<00:05:13.220> about

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
bit of a fail there but I just about

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.870 
bit of a fail there but I just about
managed<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:14.030> get<00:05:14.120> out<00:05:14.270> was<00:05:14.810> really<00:05:15.020> close<00:05:15.230> that

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
managed to get out was really close that

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.770 
managed to get out was really close that
was<00:05:16.880> really<00:05:17.060> bad<00:05:17.150> shooting<00:05:17.660> as<00:05:17.750> well<00:05:18.160> but

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
was really bad shooting as well but

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.020 
was really bad shooting as well but
don't<00:05:20.780> okay<00:05:21.560> when<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:21.920> do<00:05:22.100> this<00:05:22.280> don't<00:05:22.610> stay

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
don't okay when you do this don't stay

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.820 
don't okay when you do this don't stay
in<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.270> corner<00:05:23.660> for<00:05:23.810> too<00:05:23.930> long<00:05:24.140> kind<00:05:24.470> of<00:05:24.560> just

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
in the corner for too long kind of just

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.530 
in the corner for too long kind of just

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.620 
take about five or six shots and then

watched the other video about how to get
loads<00:06:33.750> of<00:06:33.840> kills<00:06:34.370> then<00:06:35.370> you<00:06:35.820> will<00:06:36.030> know<00:06:36.210> that
