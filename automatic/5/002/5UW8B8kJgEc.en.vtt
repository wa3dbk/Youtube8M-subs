00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.590 
both sides of that are connected if and
make<00:01:59.460> sure<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> they're<00:01:59.969> connected<00:02:00.390> good

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
make sure that they're connected good

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.679 
make sure that they're connected good
like<00:02:00.869> actually<00:02:01.680> connected<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.759> not

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
like actually connected because if not

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.959 
like actually connected because if not
both<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.469> both<00:02:04.950> sides<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.430> those<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:05.820> not

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
both if both sides of those are not

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.279 
both if both sides of those are not
connected<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:08.520> thing<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.060> here

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
connected then this thing right here

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.080 
connected then this thing right here
will<00:02:10.289> not<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:11.039> receiving<00:02:11.370> power<00:02:11.640> from<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
will not be receiving power from the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.280 
will not be receiving power from the
motherboard<00:02:12.330> down<00:02:12.690> bottom

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
motherboard down bottom

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.040 
motherboard down bottom
and<00:02:14.060> therefore<00:02:15.060> your<00:02:15.209> antenna<00:02:15.540> will<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.900> be

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and therefore your antenna will not be

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.059 
and therefore your antenna will not be
receiving<00:02:16.590> any<00:02:16.909> power<00:02:17.909> at<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:22.140> yeah

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
receiving any power at all and so yeah

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.440 
receiving any power at all and so yeah
so<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.400> want<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.730> make<00:02:23.849> sure<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.090> both<00:02:24.239> sides

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
so you want to make sure that both sides

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
so you want to make sure that both sides
of<00:02:24.540> those<00:02:24.659> connected<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.200> internet

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
of those connected for the internet

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.470 
of those connected for the internet
problems<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> controller<00:02:27.090> if

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
problems and for the controller if

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.020 
problems and for the controller if
you're<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.530> once<00:02:29.159> you<00:02:29.400> make<00:02:29.610> sure<00:02:29.790> both<00:02:30.000> of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
you're if if once you make sure both of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.640 
you're if if once you make sure both of
those<00:02:30.269> are<00:02:30.480> connected<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:31.200> controllers

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
those are connected if your controllers

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.600 
those are connected if your controllers
still<00:02:31.890> don't<00:02:32.069> work<00:02:32.720> then<00:02:34.069> lightly<00:02:35.069> press<00:02:35.580> down

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
still don't work then lightly press down

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.520 
still don't work then lightly press down
on<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.390> turn<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.110> bit<00:02:37.319> and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
on this and turn it a little bit and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.309 
on this and turn it a little bit and
that<00:02:38.489> will<00:02:38.640> ensure<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.690> power<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.110> going

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
that will ensure that the power is going

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.289 
that will ensure that the power is going
into<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.829> wire<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.489> over<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.000> antenna

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
into this wire and over to the antenna

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.839 
into this wire and over to the antenna
for<00:02:42.480> your<00:02:42.599> controllers<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.340> that's<00:02:44.340> all<00:02:44.610> that

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
for your controllers and that's all that

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.259 
for your controllers and that's all that
I<00:02:44.879> did<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:46.440> fix<00:02:46.680> my<00:02:46.890> PlayStation<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.790> hope<00:02:48.090> it
