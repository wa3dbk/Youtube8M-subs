they had gone the seed destiny route but

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
they had gone the seed destiny route but
on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> other<00:01:14.820> hand<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.659> duel<00:01:15.869> gundam<00:01:16.110> was

so the fact that they're going right at

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.609 
so the fact that they're going right at
the<00:01:21.390> beginning<00:01:21.509> means<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.290> they're<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.560> to

out its review i think it's great unlike
the<00:02:07.619> master<00:02:08.009> grade<00:02:08.160> where<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.520> an<00:02:08.640> extra

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
the master grade where you get an extra

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.270 
the master grade where you get an extra
strike<00:02:09.599> gundam<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.229> there<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:10.950> went<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
strike gundam in there they went the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.470 
strike gundam in there they went the
perfect<00:02:11.610> great<00:02:11.760> approach<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.300> you're<00:02:12.390> going

more pictures before confirming that one

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.479 
more pictures before confirming that one
of<00:02:40.409> them<00:02:40.500> sure<00:02:40.709> looks<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.069> me<00:02:41.159> like<00:02:41.189> the

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
of them sure looks to me like the

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.280 
of them sure looks to me like the
Banshee<00:02:41.879> and<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.269> Banshee<00:02:42.689> of<00:02:42.840> course<00:02:43.049> being

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
Banshee and the Banshee of course being

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
Banshee and the Banshee of course being
a<00:02:43.409> color<00:02:43.590> variation<00:02:44.159> it<00:02:44.489> would<00:02:44.609> be<00:02:44.730> silly<00:02:44.970> for

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
a color variation it would be silly for

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.670 
a color variation it would be silly for
that<00:02:45.329> not<00:02:45.540> Ferb<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.019> not<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.349> put<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.620> out

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that not Ferb and I not to put that out

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.800 
that not Ferb and I not to put that out
can't<00:02:47.639> wait<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.940> see<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.239> that's<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.720> to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
can't wait to see that that's going to

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.390 
can't wait to see that that's going to
be<00:02:48.840> great<00:02:49.139> they're<00:02:49.650> also<00:02:49.799> going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.069> have<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
be great they're also going to have the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.699 
be great they're also going to have the
base<00:02:50.639> Jabbar<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.450> looks<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.900> an<00:02:52.109> attachment

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
base Jabbar it looks like an attachment

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.490 
base Jabbar it looks like an attachment
and<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.280> wonder<00:02:53.549> if<00:02:53.639> it's<00:02:53.790> going<00:02:53.909> to<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.120> similar

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
and I wonder if it's going to be similar

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.869 
and I wonder if it's going to be similar
