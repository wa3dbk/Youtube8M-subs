of men being portrayed as total idiots I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.940 
of men being portrayed as total idiots I
do<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.020> some<00:01:52.380> validity<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
do think there is some validity to that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.200 
do think there is some validity to that
it's<00:01:53.340> certainly<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> popular<00:01:54.329> culture<00:01:54.360> I

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
it's certainly in the popular culture I

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.280 
it's certainly in the popular culture I
you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.420> television<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.170> those

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
you know in television and those

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.899 
you know in television and those
television<00:01:58.799> shows<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> stupid<00:01:59.430> fathers

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
television shows with the stupid fathers

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.179 
television shows with the stupid fathers
and<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.689> forth<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and and so forth but I do think that

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.889 
and and so forth but I do think that
there's<00:02:02.640> also<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.969> problem<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
there's also a problem I think that a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.499 
there's also a problem I think that a
lot<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> men<00:02:04.500> are<00:02:04.860> refusing<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.790> grow<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
they don't act like man does that mean I

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.600 
they don't act like man does that mean I
should<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.319> married<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.009> happens<00:02:11.430> with
