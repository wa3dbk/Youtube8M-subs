00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.709
 I've been a vegetarian for about six 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.059
 years the first three years I was 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.549
 vegetarian and the last three are 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.070
 become totally bind or ho 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.599
 eliminated dairy consumption of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.599
 eggs and all animal derivatives 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:27.660
 this choice took place only six years 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.309
 does it only six years ago but actually there 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.960
 I had it in mind for a lot longer 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.840
 since adolescence I was trying 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 unfair to having to feed 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.990
 predominantly of proteins of origin 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 animal to survive and to grow 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.440
 in fact growing up over the years I have 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.470
 approached the world to the environment of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.790
 fitness gym I practiced body 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.320
 many sports building has grown mine 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.530
 cultural baggage under the point of 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.570
 nutritional view indeed I came to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.700
 knowledge of the fact that one can live 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.130
 great without using proteins 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.489
 animals and eating only food 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.290
 I plant my nutritional plan 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.219
 consists of a mix of fruit and vegetables 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.759
 of the season among which then there is many 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.759
 Whole grains 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:20.130
 for those who need protein afterwards 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.819
 the most fanatical training is there 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.189
 also vegetable proteins for example le 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.399
 pea proteins treated in a manner 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.579
 natural without alcohol and only with water 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.509
 which are very effective like 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.179
 others by ourselves therefore results if 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.030
 think about 30 years ago 40 years ago 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.179
 it was thought that he did not eat meat 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.890
 he ate animal proteins he could star 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.879
 really hurt to meet the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.829
 death or the like to understand why there 

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:56.489
 these are the doubts about this 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.799
 said power actually goes right 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:02.899
 missing information is missing because 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:06.390
 plant proteins are competing though 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.619
 they say they are said to have some 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.379
 type of profile may have some 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.530
 amino acid in smaller quantities than 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.720
 to the others compared to the animal ones but 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.060
 just balance the power well 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.750
 without even too much effort because 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.989
 just eat cereal at lunch a 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.500
 dinner and green leafy vegetables then ai 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.389
 calcium iron protein vitamins all that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.760
 which he needs and is difficult 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.549
 really that you can go short of 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.859
 something moreover if the power supply 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.290
 it can be really biological 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.690
 natural as possible for me 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.130
 embrace a diet 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.430
 vegetarian was certainly an excellent one 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.260
 choice as well as from the point of view 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.239
 ethical but also for the point of under the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.970
 own performance point of view 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.310
 I'm not just talking about resistance 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.010
 but also of pure strength also 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.950
 because there are many exercises than before 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.410
 I was in the gym for example the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.359
 oarsman with barbell will seem strange 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.629
 but it is true that before becoming 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:13.049
 vegetarian and then I used to use that 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.450
 I know like 80 kg a year later I have 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.989
 changed power was able to 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.540
 also load 140 150 kg of mine 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.519
 advice for people who 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.769
 they want to change power then 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.049
 adhere to a healthier diet ed 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.569
 balanced is that of not having fear 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.819
 because even without taking 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.150
 animal proteins such as derivatives of 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.250
 milk the eggs the meat the fish the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.739
 our body is able to compensate 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.709
 to all the possible shortcomings that 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.390
 it could have nutrients 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.909
 vegetable plant proteins 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.780
 especially fresh ones of origin 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:52.760
 organic you can legumes and vegetables of 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.629
 Season fruit season are in 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.689
 able to give give to our body 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:03.069
 everything you need and many 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.689
 mineral vitamins so I would recommend 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.430
 no doubt not to be afraid 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.340
 of change because this choice 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.680
 will only bring benefits to them 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.319
 health and their physical state because 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.250
 they will find many benefits both of strength 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.250
 that of resistance
