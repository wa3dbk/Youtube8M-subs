 andrea riccardi 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.830
 there is only one thing I can do 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.640
 such as 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.640
 . 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.000
 andrialive what they are 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.070
 then he will then insert the knife 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 and let's see what it tells us 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.890
 23 degrees 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.950
 half 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.650
 so the other time I have almost 24 degrees, so it's going down 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.800
 and among other things towards 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.280
 he looked like a prosecutor, we see how much carbon dioxide comes out 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.630

 very well he is waiting for a moment in rossana 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.000
 I wanted to show what the situation is like 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.150

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.119
 the figs are falling down there is a hat you are a little 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.299
 breaking up 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.629
 I technically said 10 hours of driving to be careful with words 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.560
 because they beat me more and more to see strange things to see horoscope the cure 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 to see how much carbon dioxide comes out 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.750
 it is a little more expeditious than the most beautiful trip 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:36.819
 recipes 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.189
 because you know the harp of the stuff on the fire go to the kitchen kitchens and we have to 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.249

 on the way back up 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.150
 more slowly but still continues back towards 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.159
 at this point we founded and we lose our hat 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.989
 pretty 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.870
 and we're going to lose at what point 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.370
 from an analytical point of view the fermentation in our parish 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.809

 the eagle - working lawn 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.629

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.730
 and from the same torino poet 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.919
 from de belleza you would see it want something like that 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.639

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.819
 while the one next to it looks like water 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.360
 the santanchè wine told me 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.080

 so then things seem to be what they are not 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.279
 because in the glass the blue one should be divine the world is 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:09.620
 and in the test tube what still seems to me water first 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.210
 the world turns upside down 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.210
 this machine for playing lottery games 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.219

 but they are not preparing 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.120

 which means what it means 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.610
 flight confirmation will be that we are finishing fermentation 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:29.919
 then a little bit 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.159
 we can draw texts 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.159

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.320

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.969
 there were grams of sugar 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:54.439

 the juice usually 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:19.749
 so the news is that the fermentation is almost over since 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:22.849
 it contracts severely can be considered almost 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:28.210
 so next time maybe we could do too 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.490
