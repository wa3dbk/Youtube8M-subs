00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.780
 of the parabolic dish is also prepared 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.040
 time of people what you notice 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.510
 and flying allows you to fly but Italian 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.059
 and two variants and it is a sean dylan 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.920
 written can pass us for gigi with 10 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.350
 seconds of advantage but also michelle 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.360
 I don't think he called him michel 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.840
 fabrizio and the folder in pole position 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.260
 The shot is for the 9330 mph 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.300
 repeats biaggi and the maximum speed 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.820
 just the variant historical 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.470
 yes this has stumbled forward together the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.230
 his daughter on the fast curve atom 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.750
 He is finishing a trip or go to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.730
 look for the exit of this lung and yes 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.949
 dance off roger but this one 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.530
 moment real theater gets up but 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.420
 world champion in second place 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.790
 variant folds left again first 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.310
 then to the right his daughter 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.080
 below 45 milliseconds 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.970
 compared to tisci's pole position 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.590
 albrizio and then explains the first 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.480
 of the two curves of bent rebel lesmus 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.890
 then again a handful of gas 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.900
 beware of a hundred pizza you're watching 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.430
 with a smile to your own brands 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.620
 all white this morning microphones 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.979
 of choices he said I rooted 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.260
 for max biaggi and now this should arm themselves 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.990
 small established now we are in the course 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.610
 of evening care 12 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.310
 really scale devolving variant 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:28.060
 Ascari and 4/10 of a second paid 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.610
 the max biaggi record is ready to establish 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 the new track record different in 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.590
 this super compact 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.799
 touch the goatee material 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.020
 opens the gas, makes his daughter vibrate 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.560
 up to the detached of the parabolic yes 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 that is the parabolic and is below 270 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 thousandths of a second 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.560
 the last fold to the last point for the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.840
 corsaro opens the gas in this 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.799
 time to look for the organic that 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.850
 says that max max max biaggi e tim e 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:09.060
 freedom of you the superbikes biaggi 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.920

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.790
 soccer sector has been around a lot 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.950
 good myth 42 2 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.349
 the previous one so it still isn't 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.599
 over then loses loses also the inter is 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.340
 was very fast travel and even 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.689
 four tenths on michel fabrizio then 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.129
 we give them while we are following 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.560
 still max biaggi but there is a trace 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.840
 the english pilot and ebit ante and you see 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.930
 univerde to the mere and now what is what 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.349
 will find they look over their shoulder 82 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.180
 Bellesi fast though much has been 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.920
 very effective travel for his deviations 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.889
 11 minus the time when there will be a 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.500
 tasty and watch the box of 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:52.659
 privative returns the sting title are 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.669
 finish line and is second dry 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.930
 the pole position of the grand prix 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:03:01.379
 of Italy and the first of max biaggi 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.889
 corsaro has left an indelible mark 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:08.019
 new record of monza 1 42121 this is 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.629

 baby her rocket the way we want it 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.840
 to call 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.450
 and right in the noale box while there 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.760
 he calls Fabrizio Galli in the pits 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.060
 practically a kind of south bend and 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.820
 they embrace everything in particular gigi 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.740
 by the igna that kept us company and at 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.050
 all in these great moments 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.150
 tension beautiful joy beautiful satisfaction 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.800
 but absolutely a very great one 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.600
 satisfaction especially for all 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.540

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.800
 very well and I thank them very much 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.470
 resounding 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.470
