00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
AeroGarden

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.590 
AeroGarden
so<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.090> thing<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.240> you're<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.510> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
so the first thing that you're going to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.580 
so the first thing that you're going to
want<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.050> you're<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> want<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
want to do is you're going to want to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
want to do is you're going to want to
determine<00:00:25.949> which<00:00:26.250> phase<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.730> growth<00:00:26.939> your

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
determine which phase of growth your

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.390 
determine which phase of growth your
plants<00:00:27.480> are<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.890> see<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.220> era

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
plants are in as you can see in this era

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.970 
plants are in as you can see in this era
of<00:00:29.460> garden<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.179> plants<00:00:30.599> are<00:00:31.289> no<00:00:31.590> longer<00:00:31.800> in

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
of garden the plants are no longer in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.889 
of garden the plants are no longer in
the<00:00:32.009> seedling<00:00:32.430> phase<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.030> they've<00:00:33.780> been

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the seedling phase and they've been

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.330 
the seedling phase and they've been
growing<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.230> about<00:00:34.410> three<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:34.649> four<00:00:34.829> weeks<00:00:34.860> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
growing for about three or four weeks so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.709 
growing for about three or four weeks so
we're<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> use<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> second<00:00:36.480> phase

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
we're going to use that the second phase

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.459 
we're going to use that the second phase
which<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> general<00:00:37.950> purpose<00:00:38.430> mild<00:00:38.940> phase

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
which is the general purpose mild phase

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.869 
which is the general purpose mild phase
so<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.860> best<00:00:41.070> thing<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> we're<00:00:41.430> gonna<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so the best thing that we're gonna do is

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:42.979 
so the best thing that we're gonna do is
we're<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> look<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.510> chart<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.930> it

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
we're going to look at this chart and it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.529 
we're going to look at this chart and it
tells<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.290> exactly<00:00:43.350> how<00:00:43.800> much<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.460> each<00:00:45.149> type

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
tells you exactly how much of each type

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.119 
tells you exactly how much of each type
of<00:00:45.719> nutrient<00:00:46.140> you're<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> need<00:00:46.620> an

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
of nutrient you're going to need an

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.740 
of nutrient you're going to need an
important<00:00:47.520> thing<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> remember<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.390> using

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
important thing to remember with using

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.150 
important thing to remember with using
the<00:00:48.840> liquid<00:00:49.110> nutrients<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.920> three

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the liquid nutrients is it's a three

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.650 
the liquid nutrients is it's a three
part<00:00:50.399> nutrient<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.090> actually<00:00:51.360> mean<00:00:51.510> all

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
part nutrient you actually mean all

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
part nutrient you actually mean all
three<00:00:51.870> parts<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.350> order<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> work<00:00:53.039> so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
three parts in order for it to work so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
three parts in order for it to work so
we're<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> go<00:00:54.239> ahead<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
we're going to go ahead and use the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.010 
we're going to go ahead and use the
correct<00:00:55.079> amount<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.120> this<00:00:57.120> phase<00:00:57.390> phase<00:00:57.690> two

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
correct amount and this phase phase two

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.590 
correct amount and this phase phase two
it's<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.129> teaspoon<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.910> each<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it's one teaspoon of each of the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
it's one teaspoon of each of the
nutrients<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> we're<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> go<00:01:02.640> ahead<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
nutrients so we're going to go ahead and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
nutrients so we're going to go ahead and
measure<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> teaspoon<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.899> each<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.650> add

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
measure out a teaspoon of each and add

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:19.250 
measure out a teaspoon of each and add
it<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> water

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.270 

since<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.410> do<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.680> we<00:01:20.800> want<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:20.980> make<00:01:21.100> sure

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
since we do that we want to make sure

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.610 
since we do that we want to make sure
that<00:01:21.400> we<00:01:21.520> shake<00:01:21.790> it<00:01:21.900> make<00:01:22.900> sure<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.200> nutrients

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
that we shake it make sure the nutrients

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.220 
that we shake it make sure the nutrients
are<00:01:23.740> mixed<00:01:23.950> up<00:01:24.040> well<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.600> then<00:01:25.750> what<00:01:25.960> you<00:01:26.080> need

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
are mixed up well and then what you need

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.390 
are mixed up well and then what you need
to<00:01:26.320> do<00:01:26.440> is<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.680> need<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.920> empty<00:01:27.070> out<00:01:27.370> your

to do is you need to empty out your

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.070 
to do is you need to empty out your
arrow<00:01:27.820> garden<00:01:28.180> from<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.420> water<00:01:28.660> that<00:01:28.870> was<00:01:28.960> in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
arrow garden from the water that was in

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:40.560 
arrow garden from the water that was in
there<00:01:29.230> before<00:01:38.340> once<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.610> empty<00:01:40.210> out<00:01:40.360> that
