00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
of course and all my other helicopters

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.139 
of course and all my other helicopters
were<00:00:32.669> purchased<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:34.309> just<00:00:35.309> consider<00:00:35.640> great

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
were purchased now I just consider great

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.020 
were purchased now I just consider great
service<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.440> usually<00:00:38.100> find<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
service and I usually find they have the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.369 
service and I usually find they have the
cheapest<00:00:39.660> products<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
cheapest products just because I know I

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
cheapest products just because I know I
guess<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:44.040> don't<00:00:44.760> try<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.030> rip<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.360> off<00:00:45.480> as

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
guess they don't try and rip you off as

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
guess they don't try and rip you off as
much<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.829> because<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.309> shipping<00:00:47.700> might<00:00:47.850> be

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
much just because this shipping might be

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.049 
much just because this shipping might be
an<00:00:48.090> extra<00:00:48.329> ten<00:00:48.510> bucks<00:00:48.539> or<00:00:48.899> whatever<00:00:49.520> but<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.730> got

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059

side to the other

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.640 
side to the other
mostly<00:01:38.549> because<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.540> hundred<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.110> $19

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
mostly because it's a hundred and $19

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.539 
mostly because it's a hundred and $19
helicopter<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:44.070> been<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
best transmitter with it so for example

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.660 
best transmitter with it so for example
if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:49.770> trim<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.220> three<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:50.610> four

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
clicks still left there and then you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.219 
clicks still left there and then you
bump<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.240> goes<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.049> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
two sets of blades so that's eight

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.550 
two sets of blades so that's eight
blades<00:03:03.519> altogether<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.720> got<00:03:04.930> your<00:03:05.110> bottom

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
blades altogether you got your bottom

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.830 
blades altogether you got your bottom
two<00:03:05.890> blades<00:03:06.129> your<00:03:06.370> top<00:03:06.579> two<00:03:06.760> blades<00:03:07.000> your<00:03:07.269> top

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
two blades your top two blades your top

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.479 
two blades your top two blades your top
other<00:03:08.140> two<00:03:08.379> blades<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.829> your<00:03:08.920> bottom<00:03:09.280> blades

other two blades and your bottom blades

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.130 
other two blades and your bottom blades
so<00:03:10.360> that's<00:03:10.720> four<00:03:11.410> B<00:03:11.680> blades<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.310> for<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.730> blades

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
so that's four B blades and for a blades

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.090 
so that's four B blades and for a blades
so<00:03:14.140> that's<00:03:15.040> uh<00:03:16.109> since<00:03:17.109> there<00:03:17.680> are<00:03:17.769> different

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
so that's uh since there are different

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.160 
so that's uh since there are different
shapes<00:03:18.340> for<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:19.060> bottom<00:03:19.359> and<00:03:19.510> top<00:03:19.630> blow

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
shapes for the bottom and top blow

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.569 
shapes for the bottom and top blow
backwards<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.769> guess<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:23.130> usually<00:03:24.130> quick<00:03:24.370> look

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
backwards I guess so usually quick look

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.190 
backwards I guess so usually quick look
at<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.880> helicopter<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.480> bit<00:03:25.660> closer<00:03:25.900> eye

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.960 
can see that motor and the quick look at
the<00:04:04.299> bottom<00:04:05.190> everything's<00:04:06.190> nicely<00:04:06.519> assembled

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
the bottom everything's nicely assembled

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.319 
the bottom everything's nicely assembled
in<00:04:07.299> there<00:04:07.590> your<00:04:08.590> battery<00:04:09.400> trays<00:04:09.730> really<00:04:10.120> cool

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
in there your battery trays really cool

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.289 
in there your battery trays really cool
too<00:04:10.599> it's<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:12.340> holds<00:04:12.609> it<00:04:12.700> in<00:04:12.819> really<00:04:13.090> nice<00:04:13.269> and

too it's it holds it in really nice and
so<00:04:13.690> purse<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.079> battery<00:04:14.410> could<00:04:14.590> follow<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.130> if

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
so purse the battery could follow it if

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.589 
so purse the battery could follow it if
it<00:04:15.370> wasn't<00:04:15.519> gonna<00:04:16.030> wreck<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.570> lot<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.989> stuff

that's<00:05:46.810> made<00:05:47.139> of<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.410> wood<00:05:47.590> so<00:05:48.370> of<00:05:48.970> course<00:05:49.240> I

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
that's made of the wood so of course I

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.070

which is 500 or 550 mhh was only like
eight<00:06:27.370> bucks<00:06:27.550> or<00:06:27.789> whatever<00:06:27.880> so<00:06:28.360> I'll<00:06:29.349> probably

eight bucks or whatever so I'll probably

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.180 
eight bucks or whatever so I'll probably
be<00:06:29.889> around<00:06:30.130> that<00:06:30.310> rage<00:06:30.550> and<00:06:31.770> what<00:06:32.770> else<00:06:32.979> I'd

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
be around that rage and what else I'd

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.940 
be around that rage and what else I'd
get<00:06:33.430> blades<00:06:34.390> you're<00:06:34.960> probably<00:06:35.169> good<00:06:35.469> on<00:06:35.620> I'm

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
get blades you're probably good on I'm

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.040 
get blades you're probably good on I'm
not<00:06:36.190> sure<00:06:36.520> how

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
not sure how

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.749 
not sure how
day<00:06:37.409> break<00:06:37.710> but<00:06:39.590> they<00:06:40.590> probably<00:06:40.979> probably

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
day break but they probably probably

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.240 
day break but they probably probably
won't<00:06:42.000> break<00:06:42.210> that<00:06:42.240> many<00:06:42.919> once<00:06:43.919> these

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
won't break that many once these

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.800 
won't break that many once these
starting<00:06:44.759> to<00:06:44.849> run<00:06:45.000> low<00:06:45.030> like<00:06:45.449> you've<00:06:45.599> got

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
starting to run low like you've got

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.800 
starting to run low like you've got
eight<00:06:46.220> then<00:06:47.220> then<00:06:47.729> you<00:06:47.849> can<00:06:47.970> order<00:06:48.210> some<00:06:48.419> ahead

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
eight then then you can order some ahead

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.869 
eight then then you can order some ahead
of<00:06:48.960> time<00:06:49.110> so<00:06:49.409> you<00:06:49.500> don't<00:06:49.620> have<00:06:49.740> to<00:06:49.889> wait<00:06:50.039> fly

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
of time so you don't have to wait fly

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.740 
of time so you don't have to wait fly
bars<00:06:51.180> I<00:06:51.509> definitely<00:06:52.289> get<00:06:52.409> three<00:06:52.740> or<00:06:52.860> four<00:06:53.750> it's

bars I definitely get three or four it's

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.119 
bars I definitely get three or four it's
definitely<00:06:55.199> worth<00:06:55.319> it<00:06:55.530> so<00:06:55.620> you<00:06:55.740> don't<00:06:55.919> have<00:06:56.039> to

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.129 
definitely worth it so you don't have to

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:57.830 
definitely worth it so you don't have to
wait<00:06:56.280> because<00:06:56.520> those<00:06:57.090> will<00:06:57.330> break<00:06:57.539> they're

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840
