Holman<00:01:06.119> again<00:01:06.510> talking<00:01:06.810> about<00:01:07.100> what<00:01:08.100> happened

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
Holman again talking about what happened

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
Holman again talking about what happened
last<00:01:08.549> week<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> 10th<00:01:09.330> frame<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.869> mean<00:01:10.140> what

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
last week in the 10th frame I mean what

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
last week in the 10th frame I mean what
goes<00:01:10.860> through<00:01:10.920> players<00:01:11.310> mind<00:01:11.640> when<00:01:12.330> something

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
goes through players mind when something

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.679 
goes through players mind when something
like<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.810> happens<00:01:13.189> well<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.000> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
like that happens well I think that you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
like that happens well I think that you
know<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.080> sometimes<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.680> easier<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.310> your

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
know it's sometimes it's easier if your

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
know it's sometimes it's easier if your
first<00:01:17.729> strike<00:01:18.630> than<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.439> throw

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
first strike than if you have to throw

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.020 
first strike than if you have to throw
just<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.979> spare<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.000> all

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
just a spare because you get all

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
just a spare because you get all
protective<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.320> imagining<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.340> what

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
protective and I'm imagining that's what

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.010 
protective and I'm imagining that's what
Lonnie<00:01:23.670> did<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> 10th<00:01:24.360> frame<00:01:24.509> last<00:01:24.750> game

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
Lonnie did in the 10th frame last game

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.469 
Lonnie did in the 10th frame last game
and<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.799> know<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.189> also<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.210> gonna<00:01:27.299> be

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and you know I also think it's gonna be

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
and you know I also think it's gonna be
difficult<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:27.990> Lonnie<00:01:28.170> today<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
difficult for Lonnie today because the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.530 
difficult for Lonnie today because the
way<00:01:29.189> he<00:01:29.340> threw<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> shots<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> ninth<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
way he threw the shots in the ninth and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.420 
way he threw the shots in the ninth and
tenth<00:01:30.720> frame<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.200> his<00:01:31.320> first<00:01:31.619> game<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.159> think

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
tenth frame for his first game I think

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.890 
tenth frame for his first game I think
that's<00:01:32.640> gonna<00:01:32.850> play<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.150> little<00:01:33.180> metal<00:01:33.750> down

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that's gonna play a little metal down

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
that's gonna play a little metal down
behind<00:01:34.380> as<00:01:34.500> well<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.340> need<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
behind as well and you don't need that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.480 
behind as well and you don't need that
ball<00:01:35.820> against<00:01:36.180> Pete<00:01:36.360> Weber<00:01:37.340> need<00:01:38.340> ever

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
ball against Pete Weber need ever

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
ball against Pete Weber need ever
