00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.180
 still well in that 2012 i was not yet 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.519
 collector therefore this collection 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 I collected from the hands that is, you exchanged 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.210
 You may notice that in general now before 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.410
 You have 8 figures, but in general there are 7, that is, 8 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.469
 This house is the house of Patrick Patrick brelochek 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.530
 it seems to me that it is rare though 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.550
 I can not judge because I did not collect them 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.539
 personally let's talk about each little by little 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.450
 Spongebob 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.969

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.460

 A series more to tell you about this 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.240
 a series, in principle, I can say nothing 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.939
 Only one thing is plenty enough 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.229
 fragile parts to these figures therefore 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.439
 be careful with them 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:48.329
