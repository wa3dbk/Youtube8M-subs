time<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:35.010> address<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.880> adjustment<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.720> at

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
time to address the adjustment and at

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.080 
time to address the adjustment and at
that<00:02:38.280> point<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:40.590> check<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:41.069> make<00:02:41.220> sure<00:02:41.489> that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
that point you check to make sure that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.569 
that point you check to make sure that
it's<00:02:42.269> not<00:02:42.389> something<00:02:42.870> else<00:02:43.019> like<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.650> seam<00:02:44.069> open

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
it's not something else like a seam open

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.400 
it's not something else like a seam open
or<00:02:45.060> some<00:02:45.329> other<00:02:45.480> condition<00:02:45.750> which<00:02:46.230> would

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
or some other condition which would

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.620 
or some other condition which would
affect<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.739> sound<00:02:47.010> sometimes<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.239> the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
affect the sound sometimes if the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.750 
affect the sound sometimes if the
instrument<00:02:49.049> becomes<00:02:49.349> unglued<00:02:49.560> down<00:02:50.459> by<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
instrument becomes unglued down by the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.140 
instrument becomes unglued down by the
chin<00:02:51.030> rest<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:52.530> close<00:02:52.799> up<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.190> scene<00:02:53.430> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
chin rest and you close up the scene the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.550 
chin rest and you close up the scene the
sound<00:02:54.419> is<00:02:54.599> back<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.959> normal<00:02:55.319> there's<00:02:55.470> no

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
sound is back to normal there's no

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.759 
sound is back to normal there's no
reason<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:55.889> adjust<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:58.260> instrument<00:02:58.530> is

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
reason to adjust so if the instrument is

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.069 
reason to adjust so if the instrument is
not<00:02:59.209> self-correcting<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.419> it's<00:03:00.870> time<00:03:01.049> to

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
not self-correcting and it's time to

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.449 
not self-correcting and it's time to
make<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.349> signpost<00:03:01.620> adjustment<00:03:03.260> normal

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459
