00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
in Missouri and we had to direct her in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.800 
in Missouri and we had to direct her in
terms<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.369> wanted<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.509> sent<00:01:48.720> her

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
terms of what we wanted so we sent her

the<00:01:48.930> script<00:01:49.290> she<00:01:49.860> recommended<00:01:50.399> some<00:01:50.579> changes

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the script she recommended some changes

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.639 
the script she recommended some changes
because<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.360> are<00:01:51.450> certain<00:01:51.720> words<00:01:52.049> that

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
because there are certain words that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.620 
because there are certain words that
when<00:01:53.250> she<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.490> talking<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.880> fast<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.420> really

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
when she was talking so fast was really

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.940 
when she was talking so fast was really
difficult<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.110> say<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> same<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
difficult to say and same with the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
difficult to say and same with the
numbers<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.850> original<00:01:57.329> script<00:01:57.689> had<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> whole

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
numbers the original script had a whole

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.959 
numbers the original script had a whole
lot<00:01:58.350> more<00:01:58.500> words<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.159> descriptions<00:01:59.700> than

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
lot more words and descriptions than

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.999 
lot more words and descriptions than
numbers<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.110> recommended<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.860> they

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
numbers and I recommended that they

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.100 
numbers and I recommended that they
scale<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.549> back<00:02:02.780> because<00:02:03.780> auctioneers

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
scale that back because auctioneers

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
scale that back because auctioneers
usually<00:02:04.710> work<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.070> numbers<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.689> came<00:02:06.899> up

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
usually work with numbers so we came up

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.469 
usually work with numbers so we came up
with<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.200> script<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.860> was<00:02:08.310> good<00:02:08.670> logical

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
cutting and editing the footage because

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.430 
cutting and editing the footage because

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
but ultimately I thought it landed some

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.960 
but ultimately I thought it landed some
humor<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.440> actual<00:02:49.860> bidding<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.820> was

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
humor to the actual bidding as I was

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.730 
humor to the actual bidding as I was
doing<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.330> voice<00:02:51.480> over<00:02:51.870> work<00:02:52.020> in<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.350> studio

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
I saw number 84 running down the street

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.020 
I saw number 84 running down the street
I'm<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.800> kind<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:55.980> channel<00:02:56.280> John<00:02:56.580> Madden<00:02:56.970> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
I'm just kind of channel John Madden and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.660 
I'm just kind of channel John Madden and
I<00:02:57.150> said<00:02:57.330> wide<00:02:57.510> receiver<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:58.170> long<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:59.190> that

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
I said wide receiver going long so that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.460 
I said wide receiver going long so that
was<00:02:59.820> my<00:02:59.850> little<00:03:00.210> impromptu<00:03:00.600> addition<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.350> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
was my little impromptu addition to the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.380 
was my little impromptu addition to the
script<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:01.890> think<00:03:02.130> it's<00:03:02.250> pretty<00:03:02.340> clever<00:03:02.580> so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
script I think it's pretty clever so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.490 
script I think it's pretty clever so
when<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.570> first<00:03:03.840> found<00:03:03.960> out<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:04.470> were
