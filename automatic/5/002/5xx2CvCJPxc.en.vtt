00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.039
 see that the system is a bit particular 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.740

 because first what you have to do 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.350
 is to bathe characters characters that 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.410
 you want them not to go out in the plow in the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.940
 pray forgiveness in the new for all are 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.100
 saying around here because lux 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.829
 they want it to be a game of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.190
 looks 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.170
 very well 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.000
 they do not want to point to the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.400
 people are tired a little more the price 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.400
 of these champions 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.260
 it does not kill you 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.010
 to go down 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.560
 let's remove someone removed 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.860
 and here is the pussy 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.860
 here is cardboard 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.100
 to all 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:42.689
 because they know I do not know why but not 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.689
 can handle is something off 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.820
 and you can not the warning case when 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.740
 finish the panel 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.050
 very well we have already finished and now you are going 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.580
 to see what hospitalization appears and here the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.620
 people what they are going to do is vote from 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.950
 character that you want to catch then 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.440
 in which three things badly fit then and the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.960
 departure would be bad fitness 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.790
 I think it's right that the departure city 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.640
 of ivory is so let's catch us 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.450

 I do not have rune I have to put on and well 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.190
 this would basically be like 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.800
 as how they collect you and the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.510
 pique system or in 1 for all 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.040
