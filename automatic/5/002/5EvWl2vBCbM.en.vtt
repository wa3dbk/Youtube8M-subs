 The back is such a feeling We want to actually open 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 2 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:44.670
 There is a body on the upper side is still in the cover 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.790
 Te a serial 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.990
 Roast Well 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:53.380
 1 This is a tabletop holder related 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:01:00.490
 It will pass through the wind pink attach men 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:04.570
 This is part of the antenna for your dog's headphones 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:08.320
 And this is a guarantee for a desktop holder 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:13.950
 There are two warranty cards of this a . 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.950
 And this is a instruction manual 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.800
 This is a setup move 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.700
 And 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:28.040
 This is a caveat 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:31.760
 The above thing goes in the box 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:38.150
 Here a charger with a large desktop holder 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:46.100
 It is here I was introduced to connect you Yes earlier attachment called the action 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:48.030
 It's a little tight here , but if you pull it up you can replace it with this 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.400
 When fitting into place 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.540
 I mean 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.750
 Yes 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.200
 And if you want to charge the body of ek 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.370
 There are 8 single species here on this side 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.360
 It also shifted I will bring this to the landscape 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:12.340
 You have this little shifted if the sound in the magnet 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:16.570
 Beneath Yes Yawararen begins with this sound reblogged 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:23.050
 I 'm starting to see this one-segment TV 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:25.630
 I can see the video of youtube, but the clerk's story of that shop 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.350
 According to this charger 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:34.100
 But in the hit to the old hag 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.000
 I was told that I might use the genuine Sony battery charger if there is a risk that I could not get the edge 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.100
 but 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.280
 Even if it is a conventional product like this 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:51.910
 It was a story that there was no problem with the song if the graveyard could be charged 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:55.590
 Well Sony genuine as it is meeting Nde paint products may not be charged it is 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.270
 Please use the charger of 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.320
 Yes it was a tabletop holder 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.569
 And here is the TV antenna cable 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.930
 this 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.530
 If you look closely at here instead of just your TV cable , it will become terminals 4 and 9 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.060
 Ne 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:23.980
 Although this is I insert this if you use the one with the headphones 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.590
 A normal headphone or a good book has 3 terminals for this terminal . 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.910
 By 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.270
 In it's such that only four songs of headphones does not support 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.730
 Connect 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.569
 9 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.000
 ana this too much 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:47.630
 Plug this in 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:51.230
 And there is no sound if you do not plug in 3 earphones or headphones in front of that 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.770
 It's awkward but it looks like this 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:04:01.640
 However with Sony headphones 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:04.880
 If this already has a terminal of 4 songs, it can be inserted as it is 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:10.130
 Well this means that it is not necessary 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:14.760
 Just because this official name is TV antenna cable 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:21.660
 (1) If you want to paint a post-mortem and flower club TV, you must not plug it 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:27.600
 Four corners in the fact that the Yes I'm such that I can not use the Anta a Well in Anta 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:30.650
 Use this for buddy who use headphones that are not compatible with 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.650
 After inserting 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.620
 Hey you 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:40.529
 Ordinary a 2 / usual meeting of the country 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:49.789
 Let's make a sound by plugging in a win 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:49.789
 Yes this is the official name of a Sony Mobile TV Antenna Cable 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:59.210
 Sumy xperia for that 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:03.500

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:09.550
 I, such as how to use it z 3 See you in the future 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.550
