one<00:00:44.080> of<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.230> pro<00:00:44.380> tips<00:00:44.650> I<00:00:44.830> learned<00:00:44.860> was<00:00:45.760> to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
one of the pro tips I learned was to

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.210 
one of the pro tips I learned was to
take<00:00:46.120> cardboard<00:00:46.780> on<00:00:47.020> the<00:00:47.080> top<00:00:47.410> rail<00:00:47.740> and<00:00:47.980> have

take cardboard on the top rail and have

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.130 
take cardboard on the top rail and have
it<00:00:48.340> hanging<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.700> back<00:00:48.880> so<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:49.570> can<00:00:49.750> spray<00:00:49.990> the

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
it hanging the back so I can spray the

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:59.470 
it hanging the back so I can spray the
spindles<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.950> minimizes<00:00:51.610> overspray

what I'm doing is a 3/4 facing 3/4
coverage<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> other

coverage here here and then on the other

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:27.230 
coverage here here and then on the other

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.350 

it's<00:01:53.300> 11:15<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.350> my<00:01:54.590> project<00:01:55.100> is<00:01:55.220> done<00:01:55.460> but<00:01:56.300> a

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
it's 11:15 and my project is done but a

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.790 
it's 11:15 and my project is done but a
lot<00:01:56.540> easier<00:01:56.900> than<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.080> expected

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
lot easier than I expected

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.580 
lot easier than I expected
went<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.370> lot<00:01:58.490> faster<00:01:59.000> than<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.240> expected<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.470> I

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
went a lot faster than I expected and I
