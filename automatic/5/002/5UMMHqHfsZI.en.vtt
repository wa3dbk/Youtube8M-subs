wicked we went on a couple times it's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.300 
wicked we went on a couple times it's
just<00:01:20.030> it's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> 15-second<00:01:21.900> Sloan<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:23.100> go

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
just it's a 15-second Sloan you you go

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
just it's a 15-second Sloan you you go
around<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> shoots<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
around then it shoots you out of like a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.100 
around then it shoots you out of like a
thousand<00:01:25.770> miles<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.070> hour<00:01:26.159> straight<00:01:26.549> up

fucking tired but apparently

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.970 
fucking tired but apparently
um<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:12.630> never<00:02:13.200> had<00:02:13.320> this<00:02:13.410> experience<00:02:13.470> before

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
um I never had this experience before

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.110 
um I never had this experience before
because<00:02:14.400> I've<00:02:14.490> never<00:02:14.610> been<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> roller

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
because I've never been on a roller

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.020 
because I've never been on a roller
coaster<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:16.110> when<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> got<00:02:16.500> home<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.850> tried

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
coaster but when I got home and I tried

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.640 
coaster but when I got home and I tried
to<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.300> sleep<00:02:18.360> every<00:02:18.870> single<00:02:19.170> time<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.350> close

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
to go to sleep every single time I close

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.500 
to go to sleep every single time I close
my<00:02:19.680> eyes<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.190> was<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.580> was<00:02:20.610> doing

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
my eyes it was like I was doing

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.870 
my eyes it was like I was doing
loop-de-loops<00:02:22.290> over<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.770> over<00:02:22.860> again<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:25.880> it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
loop-de-loops over and over again and it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.000 
loop-de-loops over and over again and it
was<00:02:27.120> fucking<00:02:27.450> shitty<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.110> could<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.650> do

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
was fucking shitty I could not do

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.980 
was fucking shitty I could not do
anything<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.150> first<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:30.750> tried<00:02:30.900> to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
anything like I first I just tried to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.050 
anything like I first I just tried to
write<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.590> maybe<00:02:32.520> if<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:32.760> do

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
write it out like maybe if I just do

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.460 
write it out like maybe if I just do
like<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.210> thousand<00:02:33.780> loop-de-loops<00:02:34.200> I'll<00:02:34.320> just

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
like a thousand loop-de-loops I'll just

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.590 
like a thousand loop-de-loops I'll just
get<00:02:34.620> used<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.640> know<00:02:35.670> I'll<00:02:36.540> have

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
get used to it and I you know I'll have

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.980 
get used to it and I you know I'll have
to<00:02:36.810> worry<00:02:36.960> about<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.830> didn't<00:02:38.160> work<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.990> I

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
to worry about it that didn't work and I

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.960 
to worry about it that didn't work and I
thought<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.340> know<00:02:41.430> maybe<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.730> can

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
thought I was all you know maybe I can

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.610 
thought I was all you know maybe I can
like<00:02:42.150> trick<00:02:42.570> my<00:02:42.810> mind<00:02:43.050> into<00:02:43.260> thinking<00:02:43.320> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
like trick my mind into thinking that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.170 
like trick my mind into thinking that
stopped<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.340> was<00:02:44.459> trying<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.910> loopy

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
stopped so I was trying to get the loopy

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.970 
stopped so I was trying to get the loopy
loop<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.450> go<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.080> go<00:02:46.230> straight<00:02:46.740> and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
loop to go and then just go straight and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.430 
loop to go and then just go straight and
then<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.730> come<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> stop<00:02:48.270> but<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.200> didn't

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
then just come to a stop but that didn't

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.640 
then just come to a stop but that didn't
work<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.670> after<00:02:50.670> about<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.850> laying<00:02:51.150> down<00:02:51.420> and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
work so after about a laying down and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.050 
work so after about a laying down and
experimenting<00:02:52.650> different<00:02:52.950> things<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.459> just

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
experimenting different things I just

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.370 
experimenting different things I just
jumped<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.540> started<00:02:54.750> playing<00:02:54.840> some<00:02:55.200> video

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
jumped on and started playing some video

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.040 
jumped on and started playing some video
games<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.790> know<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:56.940> thought<00:02:57.300> maybe<00:02:57.930> my

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
games you know I thought maybe my

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.320 
games you know I thought maybe my
equilibrium<00:02:58.590> will<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.160> calm<00:02:59.520> down<00:02:59.820> by<00:03:00.060> that

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
equilibrium will be calm down by that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.199 
equilibrium will be calm down by that
time<00:03:00.630> an<00:03:01.380> hour<00:03:01.500> goes<00:03:01.650> by<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.040> lay<00:03:02.430> back<00:03:02.670> down<00:03:02.700> and

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
time an hour goes by I lay back down and

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.250 
time an hour goes by I lay back down and
now<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:04.650> kind<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.100> gone<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.670> little<00:03:06.330> bit<00:03:06.630> but

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
now it's kind of gone a little bit but

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.180 
now it's kind of gone a little bit but
like<00:03:07.590> after<00:03:07.890> five<00:03:08.100> minutes<00:03:09.739> it'll<00:03:10.739> just<00:03:10.980> hit

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
like after five minutes it'll just hit

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.979 
like after five minutes it'll just hit
me<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.580> like<00:03:12.120> all<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> sudden<00:03:12.690> it'll<00:03:12.840> feel

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
me and like all of a sudden it'll feel

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.210 
me and like all of a sudden it'll feel
like<00:03:13.020> I'm<00:03:13.230> getting<00:03:13.350> launched<00:03:13.860> out<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.040> that

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.380 
just one part where I had to shed on one
side<00:03:54.900> about<00:03:55.560> one<00:03:56.370> foot<00:03:56.610> gap<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.150> then<00:03:57.269> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
side about one foot gap and then the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.060 
side about one foot gap and then the
wall<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.900> then<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.110> bush<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.769> other<00:03:58.920> side

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
wall and then a bush on the other side

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.680 
wall and then a bush on the other side
