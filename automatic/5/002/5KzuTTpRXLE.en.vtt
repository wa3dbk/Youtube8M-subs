00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
figured out two things with the good

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.430 
figured out two things with the good
other<00:00:48.090> thing<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.660> jump<00:00:48.899> through<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
other thing and you can jump through the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.350 
other thing and you can jump through the
roof<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.370> inside<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
roof you can see what inside of the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.979 
roof you can see what inside of the
building<00:00:51.980> you'd<00:00:52.980> you're<00:00:53.190> right<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.239> need<00:00:54.660> full

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
building you'd you're right I need full

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
building you'd you're right I need full
movement<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.949> jump<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.610> need<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.090> able

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
movement for this jump I need to be able

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
movement for this jump I need to be able
to<00:00:57.239> get<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.629> high<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.379> here's<00:00:59.010> another

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
to get pretty high so here's another

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.410 
to get pretty high so here's another
thing<00:00:59.399> I'm<00:00:59.550> looking<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.879> when<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.180> really

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
thing I'm looking out when it's really

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
thing I'm looking out when it's really
cool<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.930> figured<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.230> its<00:01:01.379> mount<00:01:01.590> myself<00:01:02.129> I'm

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
cool I figured out its mount myself I'm

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
cool I figured out its mount myself I'm
like<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> lion<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.149> jump<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.589> wall

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like a lion you jump right to the wall

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.429 
like a lion you jump right to the wall
and<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.610> you're<00:01:05.939> flying<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> air<00:01:07.080> I

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and it's like you're flying in the air I

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
and it's like you're flying in the air I
don't<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.640> works<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.990> can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
don't know how this works and you can

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
don't know how this works and you can
see<00:01:10.290> how<00:01:10.470> blurry<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.070> goes<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.670> you're

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
see how blurry it goes and if you're

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.359 
see how blurry it goes and if you're
actually<00:01:12.210> falling<00:01:12.720> down<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> building<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
actually falling down a building so you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.700 
actually falling down a building so you
fall<00:01:14.790> eventually<00:01:15.210> into<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.110> other<00:01:16.350> building

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
fall eventually into this other building

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.179 
fall eventually into this other building
you<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> pillars<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.920> top

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you see the pillars and you see the top

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.920 
you see the pillars and you see the top
of<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> building<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.360> looks<00:01:21.600> really

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
of the building and this looks really

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.399 
of the building and this looks really
weird

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
weird

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.170 
weird
and<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> second<00:01:23.460> layer<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> can

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and there is a second layer that you can

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.179 
and there is a second layer that you can
run<00:01:24.479> down<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.200> high<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> can

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
run down if you do as high as you can

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.070 
run down if you do as high as you can
there's<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.880> layer<00:01:27.150> right<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
there's that layer right there and you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.539 
there's that layer right there and you
turn<00:01:28.259> invisible<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> end<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.400> them

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
turn invisible and it's the end of them

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
turn invisible and it's the end of them
up<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.909> he<00:01:30.479> does<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.110> does<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.680> as

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
up and he does what really does he as

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
up and he does what really does he as
you<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:32.070> see<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.299> turn<00:01:33.509> invisible

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you can see and you just turn invisible

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.200 
you can see and you just turn invisible
all<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> time<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:34.590> random<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.549> really

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
all the time that really random I really

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.730 
all the time that really random I really
don't<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.450> how<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.630> clutch<00:01:36.990> work<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.530> free

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
don't know how the clutch work like free

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710 
don't know how the clutch work like free
items<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.520> me<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.060> disappear<00:01:39.600> at

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
items and see me I just disappear at

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.929 
items and see me I just disappear at
times<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.130> actual<00:01:41.369> barrier

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
times you can see the actual barrier

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.590
