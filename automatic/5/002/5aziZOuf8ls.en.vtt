00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
title so real big match and my view on

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.609 
title so real big match and my view on
this<00:00:25.500> -<00:00:25.769> sort<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.460> from<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.180> broad<00:00:27.930> standpoint<00:00:28.470> I

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this - sort of from a broad standpoint I

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.380 
this - sort of from a broad standpoint I
guess<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.859> could<00:00:28.980> say<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.189> think<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:30.210> match

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
guess you could say I think this match

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.290 
guess you could say I think this match
is<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.050> won<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
is really going to be won on the on the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.080 
is really going to be won on the on the
mental<00:00:33.690> level<00:00:33.829> more<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.040> than<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.700> Nexus<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
mental level more so than the Nexus is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.639 
mental level more so than the Nexus is
knows<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.540> got<00:00:36.570> two<00:00:36.719> X's<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.050> O's<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
knows we got two X's and O's in just a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.100 
knows we got two X's and O's in just a
second<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.510> think<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.840> large

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
second but I really think a large

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
second but I really think a large
component<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.800> match<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.280> Murray's

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
component of this match is Murray's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.430 
component of this match is Murray's
ability<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> handle<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> moments<00:00:45.050> both<00:00:46.050> in

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
ability to handle the moments both in

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.850 
ability to handle the moments both in
terms<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.100> keep<00:00:47.460> his<00:00:47.610> cool<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.500> let<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
terms of keep his cool and not let the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.189 
terms of keep his cool and not let the
moment<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.610> him<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.059> also<00:00:51.239> his<00:00:52.170> ability

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
moment get to him but also his ability

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.310 
moment get to him but also his ability
to<00:00:52.829> stay<00:00:53.070> committed<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.690> an<00:00:54.690> aggressive<00:00:55.140> game

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
to stay committed to an aggressive game

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.229 
to stay committed to an aggressive game
plan<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:56.250> i<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.550> gonna<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.760> necessary

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
plan which i think is gonna be necessary

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.319 
plan which i think is gonna be necessary
for<00:00:57.680> for<00:00:58.680> beating<00:00:58.890> Roger<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.309> sort<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> -<00:00:59.789> 2

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
for for beating Roger so sort of - 2

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
for for beating Roger so sort of - 2
separate<00:01:00.780> mental<00:01:01.170> things<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:01.949> right

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
separate mental things that are right

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.160 
separate mental things that are right
the<00:01:02.309> manage<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.420> know<00:01:03.449> handle<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> moment

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the manage you know handle the moment

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
the manage you know handle the moment
and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:04.830> stay<00:01:05.010> committed<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.610> -<00:01:06.000> an

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and then also stay committed to - an

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.359 
and then also stay committed to - an
aggressive<00:01:06.420> game<00:01:06.570> plan<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.049> don't<00:01:07.979> think<00:01:08.040> Roger

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
aggressive game plan I don't think Roger

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.990 
aggressive game plan I don't think Roger
is<00:01:08.760> gonna<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:10.189> too<00:01:11.189> worked<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.580> about<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
is gonna be too worked up about the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.350 
is gonna be too worked up about the
situation<00:01:12.540> he's<00:01:12.720> been<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.200> often<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
situation he's been there so often that

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
situation he's been there so often that
that<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.479> doesn't<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.960> handle<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that he doesn't know how to handle this

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.170 
that he doesn't know how to handle this
stuff<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> think<00:01:16.950> there's<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> big<00:01:17.640> mental

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
stuff so I think there's a big mental

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
stuff so I think there's a big mental
component<00:01:18.750> maybe<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.170> question<00:01:19.470> mark

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
component maybe a little question mark

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.039 
component maybe a little question mark
there<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:21.090> wasn't<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> question<00:01:21.450> mark<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
there that wasn't a question mark that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.620 
there that wasn't a question mark that
is<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.729> reversed<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.270> guess<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
is will that be reversed I guess that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.770 
is will that be reversed I guess that
well<00:01:25.200> anyway<00:01:25.619> figure<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.430> later<00:01:27.090> but

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
well anyway figure that out later but

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.330 
well anyway figure that out later but
but<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> big<00:01:28.590> question<00:01:28.619> mark<00:01:29.159> there

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
but I think the big question mark there

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.719 
but I think the big question mark there
is<00:01:29.579> Murray's<00:01:30.979> mental<00:01:31.979> performance<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
is Murray's mental performance here and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.859 
is Murray's mental performance here and
of<00:01:32.790> course<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> reasons<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
of course that's one of the reasons you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.890 
of course that's one of the reasons you
brought<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.259> Yvan<00:01:35.070> lentil<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.610> guy<00:01:35.790> Lendl<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.540> guy

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
brought in Yvan lentil a guy Lendl a guy

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.130 
brought in Yvan lentil a guy Lendl a guy
who<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> mental<00:01:37.560> Rock<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.000> has<00:01:39.780> shown<00:01:39.960> some

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
who was a mental Rock and has shown some

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
who was a mental Rock and has shown some
positive<00:01:40.590> some<00:01:40.829> positive<00:01:41.220> signs<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:41.970> right

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
positive some positive signs there right

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.840 
positive some positive signs there right
with<00:01:42.390> performance<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> Aussie<00:01:44.189> open<00:01:44.640> and

of course first one will in the final so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.740 
of course first one will in the final so

and O's I think it's pretty

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
make some mistakes I don't think that

works<00:02:03.540> against<00:02:03.840> Roger<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.350> Roger<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:05.250> he

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
works against Roger I think Roger if he

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.059 
works against Roger I think Roger if he
if<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:06.329> gets<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:07.020> Murray<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.560> kind<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> keeps

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
if he gets if Murray just kind of keeps

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.650 
if he gets if Murray just kind of keeps
the<00:02:08.220> ball<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.580> play<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.879> works<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> around<00:02:09.270> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the ball and play and works it around I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.430 
the ball and play and works it around I
think<00:02:09.929> Roger<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.379> gonna<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.340> into<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> groove

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
think Roger is gonna get into a groove

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.810 
think Roger is gonna get into a groove
you<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.590> play<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.010> relatively

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
you know play that relatively

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.700 
you know play that relatively
first-strike<00:02:15.240> tennis<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.410> take<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
first-strike tennis and and take the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.270 
first-strike tennis and and take the
match<00:02:17.840> get<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.960> match<00:02:19.080> under<00:02:19.320> control<00:02:19.740> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
match get the match under control so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.610 
match get the match under control so
what<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.460> think<00:02:20.610> Marie<00:02:20.790> needs<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.660> hammer

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
what I think Marie needs to do is hammer

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.180 
what I think Marie needs to do is hammer
away<00:02:22.770> at

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
away at

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.220 
away at
federer's<00:02:23.850> backhand<00:02:24.390> now<00:02:24.570> Circle<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
federer's backhand now Circle is the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.720 
federer's backhand now Circle is the
player<00:02:25.560> stick<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> side<00:02:26.370> they're<00:02:26.520> hitting

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
player stick as a side they're hitting

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.670 
player stick as a side they're hitting
on<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> backhand<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:28.110> here<00:02:28.500> for

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
on so this is a backhand up here for

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.060 
on so this is a backhand up here for
radius<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> backhand<00:02:29.700> down<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:30.750> for<00:02:31.380> for

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
radius a backhand down here for for

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.990 
radius a backhand down here for for
righty<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.400> well<00:02:32.520> they're<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.790> pinball

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
righty as well they're like pinball

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.630 
righty as well they're like pinball
machine<00:02:33.420> flippers<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.830> terms<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.430> couple

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
machine flippers so in terms of a couple

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.470 
machine flippers so in terms of a couple
exchanges

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
exchanges

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.380 
exchanges
I<00:02:36.710> think<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.010> backhand<00:02:38.460> here<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> cross-court

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
I think the backhand here a cross-court

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.790 
I think the backhand here a cross-court
this<00:02:40.230> primary<00:02:40.830> exchange<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.650> think<00:02:43.650> Marie

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
this primary exchange what I think Marie

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.900 
this primary exchange what I think Marie
needs<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.670> basically<00:02:45.350> hit<00:02:46.350> big<00:02:46.910> stay

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
needs to do is basically hit big stay

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.460 
needs to do is basically hit big stay
away<00:02:48.150> from<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.450> slice<00:02:48.720> for<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.990> most<00:02:49.170> part

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
away from the slice for the most part

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.410 
away from the slice for the most part
and<00:02:49.710> really<00:02:49.980> just<00:02:50.070> go<00:02:50.280> after<00:02:50.520> his<00:02:50.880> backhand

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
and really just go after his backhand

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.160 
and really just go after his backhand
and<00:02:51.720> hammer<00:02:52.350> away<00:02:52.500> at<00:02:53.000> at<00:02:54.000> federer's<00:02:54.780> Andy's

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
and hammer away at at federer's Andy's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.290 
and hammer away at at federer's Andy's
got<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.380> better<00:02:55.680> back<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.310> my<00:02:56.460> view<00:02:56.700> then

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
got a better back in in my view then

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.960 
got a better back in in my view then
Roger<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.800> think<00:02:59.070> if<00:02:59.190> he<00:02:59.310> goes<00:02:59.490> big<00:02:59.730> he

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
Roger and I think if he goes big he

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.770 
Roger and I think if he goes big he
consistently<00:03:01.040> win<00:03:02.040> these<00:03:02.190> exchanges<00:03:02.850> against

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
consistently win these exchanges against

consistently win these exchanges against
Fed<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.710> course<00:03:04.950> what<00:03:05.130> Fed<00:03:05.340> likes<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.700> do

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
Fed and of course what Fed likes to do

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.760 
Fed and of course what Fed likes to do
is<00:03:06.030> kind<00:03:06.210> of<00:03:06.270> alternate<00:03:06.660> topspin<00:03:07.140> slice<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
is kind of alternate topspin slice and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.310 
is kind of alternate topspin slice and
this<00:03:08.370> backhand<00:03:08.880> exchange<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.600> then<00:03:10.080> run

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
this backhand exchange and then run

here<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.489> basically<00:03:24.090> taking<00:03:24.630> as<00:03:24.810> many

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
here I'm basically taking as many

here I'm basically taking as many

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
opportunities as possible sort of my

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.940 
opportunities as possible sort of my
first<00:03:27.390> look<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:30.480> turn<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:31.350> back<00:03:31.590> hand

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
first look to to turn this back hand

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.750 
first look to to turn this back hand
over<00:03:32.250> here<00:03:32.580> into<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:33.720> forehand<00:03:34.650> right<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.250> I

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
over here into a forehand right and I

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.610 
over here into a forehand right and I
probably<00:03:36.030> take<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.630> forehand<00:03:37.170> like<00:03:37.380> this

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
probably take that forehand like this

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.979 
probably take that forehand like this
and<00:03:37.860> then<00:03:38.160> keep<00:03:38.520> hammering<00:03:38.790> away<00:03:39.060> at<00:03:39.450> fed's

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
and then keep hammering away at fed's

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.410 
and then keep hammering away at fed's
back<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.560> until<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.459> really<00:03:41.850> move<00:03:42.000> into<00:03:42.269> the

back in until I can really move into the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.460 
back in until I can really move into the
courts<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:44.430> get<00:03:45.209> some<00:03:45.390> good<00:03:45.600> vertical

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.500 
courts and and get some good vertical
positioning<00:03:46.980> right<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.430> get<00:03:48.030> forwarded<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
positioning right I get forwarded in the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.300 
positioning right I get forwarded in the
court<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:48.930> then<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.050> might<00:03:49.320> go<00:03:49.500> up<00:03:49.769> go<00:03:50.070> into<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
court and then I might go up go into the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.570 
court and then I might go up go into the
open<00:03:50.550> court<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.690> point<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.430> really

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
open court and the point but I really

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.940 
open court and the point but I really
just<00:03:53.880> think<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.750> aggressiveness<00:03:55.500> on<00:03:55.680> the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
just think the the aggressiveness on the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.570 
just think the the aggressiveness on the
backhand<00:03:56.400> there<00:03:56.730> for<00:03:57.360> fed<00:03:57.630> is<00:03:57.900> uh<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.680> key<00:03:58.950> now

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
backhand there for fed is uh is key now

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.860 
backhand there for fed is uh is key now
that<00:04:00.450> doesn't<00:04:00.630> mean<00:04:00.840> Marie<00:04:01.410> shouldn't<00:04:01.920> go<00:04:02.160> at

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
that doesn't mean Marie shouldn't go at

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.930 
that doesn't mean Marie shouldn't go at
feds<00:04:03.870> forehand<00:04:04.590> because<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.489> think<00:04:05.670> he<00:04:05.760> should

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
feds forehand because I think he should

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.540 
feds forehand because I think he should
but<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.810> think<00:04:07.170> when<00:04:07.500> he<00:04:07.530> does<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.340> goal

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
but I think when he does that the goal

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.020 
but I think when he does that the goal
is<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.140> expose<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.530> backhand<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.610> what<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.820> mean

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
is to expose the backhand so what I mean

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.259 
is to expose the backhand so what I mean
by<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:14.550> know<00:04:14.640> let's<00:04:14.880> say<00:04:15.060> there's

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
by that is you know let's say there's

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.240 
by that is you know let's say there's
this<00:04:15.360> cross<00:04:15.630> court<00:04:15.900> backhand<00:04:16.140> exchange<00:04:16.859> here

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
this cross court backhand exchange here

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.320 
this cross court backhand exchange here
if<00:04:18.180> Murray<00:04:18.810> gets<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.730> here<00:04:20.730> either<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.030> back

if Murray gets a a here either the back

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.590 
if Murray gets a a here either the back

the baseline

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.170

you<00:05:19.889> know<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.129> pro<00:05:20.280> level<00:05:20.460> if<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:20.759> get<00:05:20.940> a<00:05:20.969> shot

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
you know the pro level if you get a shot

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.459 
you know the pro level if you get a shot
here<00:05:21.419> you're<00:05:21.629> inside<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:21.900> baseline<00:05:22.139> here<00:05:22.349> and

here you're inside the baseline here and

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:24.890 
here you're inside the baseline here and
when<00:05:22.560> most<00:05:22.740> US<00:05:22.889> points<00:05:23.219> so<00:05:23.599> those<00:05:24.599> are<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.870> the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
working to the point and not be quite as

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.019 
working to the point and not be quite as
defensive<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:43.020> then<00:05:43.529> selectively<00:05:44.069> hitting

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
defensive and then selectively hitting

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.760 
defensive and then selectively hitting
aggressively<00:05:45.479> two<00:05:45.569> feds<00:05:45.779> forehand<00:05:46.199> to<00:05:46.409> to

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
aggressively two feds forehand to to

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.779 
aggressively two feds forehand to to
expose<00:05:47.099> the<00:05:47.219> backhand<00:05:47.750> backhand<00:05:48.750> side<00:05:49.789> other

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
expose the backhand backhand side other

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:51.800 
expose the backhand backhand side other
stuff<00:05:51.150> that<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.330> think<00:05:51.419> is<00:05:51.539> relatively

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
stuff that I think is relatively

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.390 
stuff that I think is relatively
straightforward<00:05:52.199> Murray's<00:05:52.979> got<00:05:53.099> to<00:05:53.219> serve

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
straightforward Murray's got to serve

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.089 
straightforward Murray's got to serve
great<00:05:53.810> he's<00:05:54.810> got<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:55.080> return<00:05:55.379> well<00:05:55.650> Federer

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
great he's got to return well Federer

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:02.510 
great he's got to return well Federer
has<00:05:56.159> been<00:05:56.340> serving<00:05:57.620> excellently<00:05:58.620> and<00:06:00.139> and<00:06:01.520> you

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
has been serving excellently and and you

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.040 
has been serving excellently and and you
know<00:06:02.610> despite<00:06:02.849> somebody<00:06:03.419> like<00:06:03.659> Novak

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
know despite somebody like Novak

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.510 
know despite somebody like Novak
Djokovic<00:06:04.289> who<00:06:04.620> has<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.830> best<00:06:05.009> return<00:06:05.310> maybe

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
Djokovic who has the best return maybe

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.700 
Djokovic who has the best return maybe
you<00:06:05.789> know<00:06:05.879> arguably<00:06:06.240> ever<00:06:06.509> Federer<00:06:07.379> was<00:06:07.560> quite

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
you know arguably ever Federer was quite

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.320 
you know arguably ever Federer was quite
effective<00:06:07.949> with<00:06:08.250> his<00:06:08.370> serve<00:06:08.580> Murray's<00:06:09.060> return

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
effective with his serve Murray's return

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.209 
effective with his serve Murray's return
is<00:06:09.449> great<00:06:09.659> but<00:06:09.900> it's<00:06:10.080> not<00:06:10.259> quite<00:06:10.800> as<00:06:10.949> good<00:06:11.069> as

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
is great but it's not quite as good as

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.379 
is great but it's not quite as good as
Djokovic<00:06:11.699> is<00:06:11.879> so<00:06:12.710> you<00:06:13.710> know<00:06:13.800> I<00:06:13.830> think<00:06:14.639> not<00:06:15.360> only

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
Djokovic is so you know I think not only

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.390 
Djokovic is so you know I think not only
does<00:06:15.629> Murray<00:06:15.840> need<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.110> return<00:06:16.680> well<00:06:16.919> but<00:06:17.219> the

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
does Murray need to return well but the

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.129 
does Murray need to return well but the
the<00:06:17.430> serve<00:06:17.849> really<00:06:18.210> needs<00:06:18.389> to<00:06:18.509> be<00:06:18.659> there<00:06:18.870> for

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
the serve really needs to be there for

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.019 
the serve really needs to be there for
him<00:06:19.229> he<00:06:19.289> needs<00:06:19.469> to<00:06:19.529> win<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.949> lot<00:06:20.370> of<00:06:20.460> free<00:06:20.639> points

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
him he needs to win a lot of free points

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.059 
him he needs to win a lot of free points
and<00:06:21.210> I<00:06:21.599> think<00:06:21.629> it's<00:06:21.930> critical<00:06:22.529> that<00:06:22.740> Murray

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 
and I think it's critical that Murray

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.300 
and I think it's critical that Murray
wins<00:06:23.520> the<00:06:23.879> first<00:06:24.120> set<00:06:24.210> I<00:06:24.930> if<00:06:25.680> we<00:06:25.860> come<00:06:26.039> back<00:06:26.159> to

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
wins the first set I if we come back to

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.860 
wins the first set I if we come back to
this<00:06:26.400> question<00:06:26.580> of<00:06:26.849> the<00:06:26.909> the<00:06:27.210> mental<00:06:27.539> side<00:06:27.810> of

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
this question of the the mental side of

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.559 
this question of the the mental side of
things<00:06:28.229> if<00:06:28.500> Murray<00:06:29.310> can<00:06:29.759> come<00:06:30.150> out<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:30.419> win

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
things if Murray can come out and win

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.320 
things if Murray can come out and win
that<00:06:30.750> first<00:06:31.020> set<00:06:31.289> and<00:06:31.789> maybe<00:06:32.789> calm<00:06:33.180> the

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
that first set and maybe calm the

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.200 
that first set and maybe calm the
butterflies<00:06:33.779> a<00:06:33.810> little<00:06:34.229> bit<00:06:34.349> then<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.279> think<00:06:35.639> he

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
butterflies a little bit then I think he

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.760 
butterflies a little bit then I think he
he's<00:06:36.750> got<00:06:36.899> a<00:06:36.930> good<00:06:37.139> shot<00:06:37.169> at<00:06:37.380> winning<00:06:37.500> this

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
he's got a good shot at winning this

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.090 
he's got a good shot at winning this
match<00:06:38.009> but<00:06:38.219> if<00:06:38.310> he<00:06:38.370> loses<00:06:38.550> that<00:06:38.909> first<00:06:39.149> set

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
match but if he loses that first set

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.630 
match but if he loses that first set
and<00:06:40.390> sort<00:06:41.390> of<00:06:41.450> the<00:06:41.540> Fed<00:06:41.780> you<00:06:42.170> know<00:06:43.010> steamroller

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.640 
and sort of the Fed you know steamroller

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.210 
and sort of the Fed you know steamroller
freight<00:06:44.630> train<00:06:44.930> gets<00:06:45.170> rolling<00:06:45.470> feds<00:06:45.890> a<00:06:46.010> great

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
freight train gets rolling feds a great

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.110 
freight train gets rolling feds a great
front-runner<00:06:46.850> front-runner<00:06:47.600> and<00:06:49.000> you<00:06:50.000> know

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
front-runner front-runner and you know

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.670 
front-runner front-runner and you know
not<00:06:50.330> only<00:06:50.390> would<00:06:50.660> that<00:06:50.690> first<00:06:50.990> said<00:06:51.140> then<00:06:51.320> you

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
not only would that first said then you

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.440 
not only would that first said then you
know<00:06:51.770> you're<00:06:51.890> down<00:06:52.040> a<00:06:52.100> set<00:06:52.430> and<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:52.850> maybe<00:06:53.150> the

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
know you're down a set and and maybe the

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.240 
know you're down a set and and maybe the
the<00:06:53.960> moment<00:06:54.140> starts<00:06:54.560> to<00:06:54.680> get<00:06:54.830> you<00:06:54.980> a<00:06:55.010> little

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
the moment starts to get you a little

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.910 
the moment starts to get you a little
bit<00:06:55.460> so<00:06:56.000> I<00:06:56.030> think<00:06:56.420> that<00:06:56.840> uh<00:06:56.870> that<00:06:57.230> first<00:06:57.560> set<00:06:57.800> is

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
bit so I think that uh that first set is

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.190 
bit so I think that uh that first set is
key<00:06:58.100> for<00:06:58.130> Murray<00:06:58.520> from<00:06:58.820> a<00:06:58.940> from<00:06:59.600> a<00:06:59.750> mental

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
key for Murray from a from a mental

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.970 
key for Murray from a from a mental
emotional<00:07:00.620> standpoint<00:07:00.880> so<00:07:02.140> you<00:07:03.140> know<00:07:03.260> my<00:07:03.470> take

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
emotional standpoint so you know my take

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.740 
emotional standpoint so you know my take
here<00:07:04.250> on<00:07:04.370> this<00:07:04.490> match<00:07:04.670> is<00:07:04.970> that<00:07:05.390> Federer's

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
here on this match is that Federer's

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.880 
here on this match is that Federer's
gonna<00:07:05.900> win<00:07:06.080> it<00:07:06.200> and<00:07:06.320> I<00:07:06.380> think<00:07:06.500> he's<00:07:06.590> gonna<00:07:06.650> win

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
gonna win it and I think he's gonna win

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.500 
gonna win it and I think he's gonna win
it<00:07:06.920> in<00:07:07.100> in<00:07:07.280> four<00:07:07.760> sets

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
it in in four sets

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.270 
it in in four sets
I<00:07:08.540> actually<00:07:09.020> think<00:07:09.440> feds<00:07:09.710> gonna<00:07:09.920> get<00:07:10.130> that

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
I actually think feds gonna get that

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.950 
I actually think feds gonna get that
first<00:07:10.520> set<00:07:10.790> because<00:07:11.180> I<00:07:11.450> think<00:07:11.780> the

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
first set because I think the

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.800 
first set because I think the
butterflies<00:07:12.440> are<00:07:12.740> probably<00:07:13.400> gonna<00:07:13.750> at<00:07:14.750> the

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
butterflies are probably gonna at the

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.790 
butterflies are probably gonna at the
beginning<00:07:15.110> of<00:07:15.140> the<00:07:15.230> match<00:07:15.350> are<00:07:15.530> gonna<00:07:15.650> affect

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
beginning of the match are gonna affect

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.020 
beginning of the match are gonna affect
Murray<00:07:16.250> more<00:07:16.400> than<00:07:16.550> they're<00:07:16.670> gonna<00:07:16.760> affect

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.030 
Murray more than they're gonna affect

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.390 
Murray more than they're gonna affect
fact<00:07:18.190> Federer<00:07:19.190> so<00:07:20.590> fab<00:07:21.590> gets<00:07:21.860> that<00:07:21.950> first<00:07:22.220> set

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
fact Federer so fab gets that first set

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.530 
fact Federer so fab gets that first set
and<00:07:22.490> then<00:07:22.610> I<00:07:22.670> think<00:07:22.850> he<00:07:22.910> ends<00:07:23.000> up<00:07:23.150> winning<00:07:23.300> in

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
and then I think he ends up winning in

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.660 
and then I think he ends up winning in
winning<00:07:23.930> in<00:07:23.960> four<00:07:24.200> so<00:07:24.440> we<00:07:24.980> of<00:07:25.070> course<00:07:25.310> will<00:07:25.430> see

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
winning in four so we of course will see
