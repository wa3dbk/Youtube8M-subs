 This is the latest localization signal 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.830
 of the covenant captain's fleet 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.830

 bored in the spartan capital world 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.960
 here 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.110
 you know that I come here in search of peace and 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.110
 silence 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.830
 does not interrupt the siesta true 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.500
 quite the opposite the show 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.650
 starts at 5 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.540
 we have waited six months we could 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.190
 spend another 48 hours with the teams in 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.130
 the war games the navy disagrees 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.130
 in this case they want them ready 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.310
 ladies and others spartan attention 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.350
 his new destiny is a planet that 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.100
 discovered humanity six months ago 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.200
 called requiem 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.600
 some of the veterans know what 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.750
 awaits them 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.880
 the rest 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.880
 they need to learn something 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.960
 the brains have to establish bases 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.680
 of research 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.060
 but so that they can do it we have to 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.110
 to take out some invaders the young 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.460
 the rulers 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:47.090
 I think this is the home of one of your 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.360
 gods in my opinion 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.810
 If these golds want to see goodbye 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.850
 It is our duty 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.850
 you have to help us 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.860
 and outside the capital space 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.710

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.710

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.259

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.939
 we call valleys 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.939
