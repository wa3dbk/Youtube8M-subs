00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.970
 medical care 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 when they told him about the issue of 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.430
 I organ donation bother me angry 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.220
 and in fact I was very rude with a botox 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.320
 because when I arrived I already 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.670
 They already told me that my son is already from 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.280
 done since I got to Morelia in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.489
 the first insurance they told me that there 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.390
 deceased he already had his brain death 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.430
 Then they told me they are going to send me 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.590
 to see if they had the possibility 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.390
 that he lived then when I 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.800
 I arrived so they saw it and everything and I 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.900
 they did that he had already had him 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.280
 given his brain death he told him a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.490
 doctor who wanted to donate the organs 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.200
 for me it was something annoying or I'm up 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.900
 I was a little rude to the doctor 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.710
 because he was in a situation 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.170
 very very bad and more apathetic I offended 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.240
 then already when they happened to us again 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.330
 again that he had already died 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.570
 here with the doctor was that they passed me and 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.790
 He tried to talk to us and tell us how 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.060
 was the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.610
 about the donation but it was also a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.160
 day of your life a moment of your 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.620
 sufficient existence to pass from 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.690
 crying and pain to reflection for 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.270
 accept that your child will donate their organs 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.820
 to improve or give life to those who 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.650
 they will need knowing that their son juan 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.570
 Manuel would still live in other people 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.520
 that tragic day when death 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.250
 brain announcement that you would lose to your 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.160
 son physically and forever he 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.380
 his son became hope and light 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.310
 it would give many days of life and health to more 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.870
 people 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.860
 then we talk with my relatives 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.890
 that accompanied me we talked and this 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.950
 because this one we saw that it was the best 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.050
 donate to him to take something that no longer 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.320
 Well, practically he was going to 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.370
 bring and he could save lives that's why 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.780
 was that we decided that we talked and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.110
 We decided that while I had the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.870
 possibility of saving because you were 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.470

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.040

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.650
 skin his bones his tendons and his 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.220
 heart in addition to other organs me 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.970
 I feel proud for him because 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.760
 because he is not there we do not have it anymore 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.170
 his body but he is living in other 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.420
 people and I feel proud for him 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.660
 organ donation remains a 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.180
 issue that scares some families but 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.830
 the donation of organs is undoubtedly 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.450
 life expectancy for many 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.890
 people suffering from some disease 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.569
 terminal because they depend precisely on 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.050
 the donation of an organ to follow 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.840
 living understood that Mrs. Maria 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.080

 they will thank you forever 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.650
 If it's a bit difficult to accept, it's very 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.430
 difficult because 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.049
 they are things that one does not expect and at least 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.840
 I had never been told about the 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.430

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.840

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.810

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.939
 surprise then your question then this 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:57.000

 they had the possibility to treat it 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.739
 but close something that because sometimes 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.019
 the people here are very closed to 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.659

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.459
