the speck CandyShell grip case now this

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.490 
the speck CandyShell grip case now this
potential<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.640> grip<00:00:29.939> series<00:00:30.390> from<00:00:30.539> speck<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
potential a grip series from speck so

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.670 
potential a grip series from speck so
well<00:00:31.650> known<00:00:31.890> case<00:00:32.460> series<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.420> have

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
well known case series that they have

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.819 
well known case series that they have
seen<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> 10<00:00:35.880> 20<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.780> phones<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.800> on

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
seen with the 10 20 I phones and so on

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.380 
seen with the 10 20 I phones and so on
and<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.100> forth<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.460> bugs<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> galaxy

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and so forth this bugs well the galaxy

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
and so forth this bugs well the galaxy
is<00:00:39.450> s4<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.920> here's<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.760> HTC<00:00:42.210> One<00:00:43.190> m8

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
is s4 so here's one for the HTC One m8

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.100 
is s4 so here's one for the HTC One m8
so<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.940> case<00:00:45.180> comes<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.600> three<00:00:45.750> calls<00:00:45.960> you've

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so this case comes in three calls you've

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.110 
so this case comes in three calls you've
got<00:00:46.230> white<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.920> black<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.670> you've<00:00:47.879> got

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
got white see what black and you've got

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.020 
got white see what black and you've got
pink<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> grips<00:00:50.340> around<00:00:50.520> so

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
pink and you can see the grips around so

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
pink and you can see the grips around so
basically<00:00:51.329> places<00:00:52.079> where<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.350> hands<00:00:52.559> will

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
on top mic and at the bottom for your

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.980 
on top mic and at the bottom for your
headphone<00:01:10.740> jack<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:13.040> map<00:01:14.040> us<00:01:14.310> before<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
headphone jack and your map us before it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.420 
headphone jack and your map us before it
but<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> top<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.560> power<00:01:16.740> button<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
but the top the power button and of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
but the top the power button and of
course<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> area<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> infrared<00:01:19.049> so

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
course the area for the infrared so

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.600 
course the area for the infrared so
basically<00:01:19.619> infrared<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.189> actually<00:01:20.460> cover

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
basically infrared just actually cover

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.850 
basically infrared just actually cover
the<00:01:20.729> whole<00:01:20.880> thing<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> talked<00:01:21.540> before<00:01:22.110> but

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the whole thing as I talked before but

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.340 
the whole thing as I talked before but
anyway<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.580> ahead<00:01:23.790> slide<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
anyway let's go ahead slide this in you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.570 
anyway let's go ahead slide this in you
shouldn't<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.650> too<00:01:25.799> difficult

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
shouldn't be too difficult

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.649 
shouldn't be too difficult
now<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.780> case<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.200> chose<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.530> $34.99<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
now this case we chose for $34.99 and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.050 
now this case we chose for $34.99 and
you<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> slides<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.380> quite<00:01:31.680> simply<00:01:32.060> it's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you see it slides in quite simply it's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
you see it slides in quite simply it's
actually<00:01:33.570> fairly<00:01:33.869> light<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.650> doesn't<00:01:34.890> add

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
actually fairly light so it doesn't add

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.890 
actually fairly light so it doesn't add
a<00:01:35.100> lot<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.700> device<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.450> gives<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
a lot to your device but gives you a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.050 
a lot to your device but gives you a
nice<00:01:37.380> protection<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.549> grips<00:01:38.850> as

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
nice protection you can see the grips as

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.469 
nice protection you can see the grips as
I<00:01:39.780> hold<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:41.009> drop<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.430> face<00:01:41.729> down<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
I hold it I can drop it face down you

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.410 
I hold it I can drop it face down you
hear<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.899> basically<00:01:43.890> you've<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.399> enough<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
hear that basically you've got enough of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.100 
hear that basically you've got enough of
a<00:01:46.200> bump<00:01:46.530> across<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.460> device<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.600> give<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
a bump across the device to give you

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
a bump across the device to give you
protection<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.189> how<00:01:50.399> how<00:01:51.180> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
protection so you can see how how this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.899 
protection so you can see how how this
is<00:01:51.570> raised<00:01:52.020> all<00:01:52.710> around<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> edges<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
is raised all around the edges there so

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.789 
is raised all around the edges there so
you<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.149> enough<00:01:54.450> protection<00:01:54.619> if<00:01:55.619> your

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
you have enough protection if your

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.679 
you have enough protection if your
device<00:01:55.920> falls<00:01:56.340> face<00:01:56.520> flat<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:57.270> protect<00:01:57.570> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
device falls face flat will protect it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.440 
device falls face flat will protect it
as<00:01:57.869> well<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> back<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.950> side
