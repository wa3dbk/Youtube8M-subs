00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.220
 what's new friends hello and 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.950
 welcome to this our channel today 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.049
 I am going to show what is the best for me 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.579
 deck with which we can play and with the 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.650
 that we can and will win 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:16.249
 we are opening the daily reward to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.249
 see what's up 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.189
 today it's our turn to receive this ticket 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.289
 I honestly do not know what it's for 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.030
 I'm going to fight in tournament mode and I can not 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.530
 use it good let's go 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.580
 and letters 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.580
 the deck manager 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.920
 and here I get into my practice the new 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.350
 of three they bother a lot sincerely in 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.329
 change name or roll these good 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.460
 I am going to show 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.909
 it's not about generally having 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.949
 letters but it's about having letters that 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.870
 have energies that you can use 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.909
 You know you do not have the trouble of hosts 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.589
 that does not find this energy like to 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.829
 where does it come out to me but they are letters 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:03.219
 who are one with many energies of their 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.040
 type that is need energies energies 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.050
 for example colorless like this 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.890
 and have some decent skill 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.690
 for example to change the pokemon 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.700
 have the skills to change the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.260
 pokemon because more normal is that they have 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.000
 powerful attacks but that have few 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.530
 mega evolutions energies are 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.260
 good because they take away the training and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.300
 things about these and for me the letter that 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.740
 you need mainly is a letter 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.950
 as profit and for me the best letter 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.240
 they have taken out and the most warlike and with 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.180
 the energy of every 30 and you can not 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.610
 take away anything 60 with 2 and 53 on top with 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.290
 60 gives you three letters not and then for 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.970
 example we have half place I'm that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.530
 it is magnificent simply magnificent 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.600
 Friends is that milk is the man 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.640
 the man takes you and takes you away with three 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.680
 energies 140 and above takes a letter 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.899
 the rival is deprived of energy they know 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.490
 guys today for example put here this 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.869
 because it brings me an energy in colorado 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.659
 of these arteries and networks these so that 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.700
 confuse the rival and the other letter to 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.619
 my fantastic and great is lies of c's 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.140
 and then simply alexis in better 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.210
 shots seriously is the best had to give 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.739
 in our colorless and here is 40 go 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.319
 those who have good rival is a 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.090
 pokemons with vote it after clear 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.400
 you will say two days they had coach 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.160
 psychic or energies not so good what 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.080
 What I do for example is in letters of 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.850
 trainers one of these 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.140
 because as I have an energy gavel this 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.819
 guy fight well with a bit of luck 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.709
 almost did not go out then methods instead 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.140
 of energy you know then share 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.519
 letters to recover life blame because 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.950
 we have to find exactly the po 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.049
 as I want assassins and on youtube and 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.660
 then every time is not that if they put you 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.069
 one of these pokemon with those who do 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.630
 I do not know if they can not be attacked and not 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.569
 I know how good, with a little luck 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.580
 the bank will have a pokÃ©mon that is not 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.450
 that for example an ex other letter 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.150
 then I take 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.610
 and what I do, guys, is to use the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.330
 lesson and something that that pokemon walked 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.580
 with the other 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.800
 let's imagine for example that for example 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.390
 what this one does not have is a former circle 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.430
 I say sorry a circle and normal the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.620
 basic that makes attacks is not it 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.120
 can attack not a few months then 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.680
 how do I change it because even if they have 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.239
 to solve the programming of no 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.010
 little more be handled jessica i'm fucked 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.780
 or for example with piroval I also do 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.849
 the same thing also not for example with 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.470
 tests if I'm not wrong the mega jkse 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.890
 you want I can attack too I have to 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.920
 this pack where the energies to the ring to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.470
 our young sybarite and also used 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.060
 the jagged helmet you've commented on 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.099
 had to be hit to take me 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.630
 technology then for example after 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.310
 you have the ones that you have the ics 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.959
 and what the ether is but not usually 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.720
 work a lot already but it is that I have 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.760
 in my shuffle 20 22 sweet energies 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.440
 normal you know what happens is that I have a 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.440
 30 percent chance that I 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.210
 go well with a minimum 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.490
 I also have to fuck what I do not 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.740
 may lack more special energies of 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.740
 hypo fight to be bore me 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.360
 and here we think good maybe 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.569
 removes had before also a couple of 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.190
 things like gym the gym type 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.110
 cherry or texts but it must be removed to 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.150
 change the deck a bit because I do not 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.099
 I fit and this is all friends are you my 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.140
 shuffle this is what I play with and 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.030
 for me since it 's the best deck that 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.650
 there are being left 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.330
 and with this friends I say goodbye to you 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.330
 until the next friends
