00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
okay now we're going to go to real fast

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:36.860 
okay now we're going to go to real fast
like<00:03:25.900> let's<00:03:26.500> change<00:03:26.710> just<00:03:27.040> baby<00:03:28.500> 316<00:03:35.490> that<00:03:36.490> is

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
like let's change just baby 316 that is

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.120 
like let's change just baby 316 that is
it<00:03:37.870> gets<00:03:38.050> bigger<00:03:38.260> actually<00:03:38.740> gets<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.010> little

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
it gets bigger actually gets a little

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.560 
it gets bigger actually gets a little
easier<00:03:39.310> because<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.000> holes<00:03:40.240> are<00:03:40.360> really

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
easier because the holes are really

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.390 
easier because the holes are really
drill<00:03:40.840> but<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.620> still<00:03:41.890> got<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.040> start<00:03:42.310> off

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
drill but you still got to start off

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:52.680 
drill but you still got to start off
nice<00:03:42.550> and<00:03:42.610> slow<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:43.660> here<00:03:43.870> we<00:03:43.900> go

almost<00:05:19.919> there<00:05:20.100> almost

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.310 

okay<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.720> should<00:05:37.750> have<00:05:37.990> done<00:05:38.140> it<00:05:40.020> is<00:05:41.020> one

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
okay that should have done it is one

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:51.740 
okay that should have done it is one
more

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:06:01.400 

and<00:05:52.919> there<00:05:53.919> you<00:05:54.099> are<00:05:54.449> one<00:05:55.449> more<00:05:55.660> to<00:05:55.750> go<00:05:57.360> big<00:05:58.360> one

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:08.010 

this<00:06:02.410> is<00:06:02.590> a<00:06:03.180> 516<00:06:04.620> little<00:06:05.620> bit<00:06:05.740> as<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:07.780> said<00:06:07.840> these

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
this is a 516 little bit as I said these

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.219 
this is a 516 little bit as I said these
are<00:06:08.080> carbide<00:06:08.620> tip<00:06:08.919> bits<00:06:09.539> for<00:06:10.539> blass<00:06:10.810> and<00:06:11.050> tile

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
are carbide tip bits for blass and tile

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.159 
are carbide tip bits for blass and tile
you<00:06:11.440> can<00:06:11.590> use<00:06:11.710> diamond<00:06:12.009> tipped<00:06:12.460> as<00:06:12.610> well<00:06:12.759> too

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
you can use diamond tipped as well too

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.650 
you can use diamond tipped as well too
but<00:06:14.169> it<00:06:14.410> can<00:06:14.620> be<00:06:14.770> done<00:06:14.849> and<00:06:15.849> you<00:06:16.240> go<00:06:16.360> to<00:06:16.419> get<00:06:16.569> the

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
but it can be done and you go to get the

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:38.480 
but it can be done and you go to get the
big<00:06:16.810> one

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:48.659 

well<00:06:41.069> right<00:06:42.069> through<00:06:44.849> there<00:06:45.849> are<00:06:47.400> none<00:06:48.400> of<00:06:48.520> you

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
well right through there are none of you

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.559 
well right through there are none of you
are<00:06:48.879> the<00:06:49.330> slow<00:06:49.629> evil<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:51.490> router<00:06:51.849> it<00:06:52.060> gets<00:06:52.300> or

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
are the slow evil the router it gets or

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:53.969 
are the slow evil the router it gets or
you<00:06:52.719> can<00:06:52.840> actually<00:06:53.050> grind<00:06:53.409> it<00:06:53.620> up<00:06:53.710> with<00:06:53.949> a

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
you can actually grind it up with a

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:57.540 
you can actually grind it up with a
grinder<00:06:54.990> but<00:06:55.990> as<00:06:56.439> you<00:06:56.560> can<00:06:56.650> see<00:06:56.919> there's<00:06:57.430> no

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
grinder but as you can see there's no

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.429 
grinder but as you can see there's no
stress<00:06:57.969> and<00:06:58.180> a<00:06:58.270> glass<00:06:58.419> is<00:06:58.689> not<00:06:58.870> the<00:06:59.020> glass<00:06:59.229> is

00:06:59.429 --> 00:06:59.439 
stress and a glass is not the glass is

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.129 
stress and a glass is not the glass is
not<00:06:59.590> broken<00:06:59.889> in<00:07:00.219> any<00:07:00.430> way<00:07:00.639> ok<00:07:01.539> I<00:07:01.689> just<00:07:01.900> went<00:07:02.110> a

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:02.139 
not broken in any way ok I just went a

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.920 
not broken in any way ok I just went a
little<00:07:02.259> fast<00:07:02.560> to<00:07:02.889> speed<00:07:03.159> this<00:07:03.310> up<00:07:03.779> that's<00:07:04.779> why

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
little fast to speed this up that's why

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.689 
little fast to speed this up that's why
it's<00:07:05.110> not<00:07:05.229> perfectly<00:07:05.740> round<00:07:05.830> but<00:07:06.340> it<00:07:06.550> does

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
it's not perfectly round but it does

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:09.779 
it's not perfectly round but it does
come<00:07:06.849> out<00:07:06.999> perfectly<00:07:07.389> round<00:07:08.099> ok<00:07:09.099> and<00:07:09.310> that's

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:09.789 
come out perfectly round ok and that's

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:11.879 
come out perfectly round ok and that's
how<00:07:09.909> you<00:07:09.969> drill<00:07:10.210> a<00:07:10.240> hole<00:07:10.300> through<00:07:10.449> glass<00:07:10.889> so

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
how you drill a hole through glass so

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.689 
how you drill a hole through glass so
the<00:07:12.310> slower<00:07:12.520> you<00:07:12.610> go<00:07:12.669> to<00:07:12.819> better<00:07:13.029> but<00:07:13.389> I<00:07:14.699> hope

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
the slower you go to better but I hope

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:18.959 
the slower you go to better but I hope
it<00:07:16.060> was<00:07:16.180> helpful<00:07:17.099> so<00:07:18.099> make<00:07:18.340> sure<00:07:18.370> it<00:07:18.669> is<00:07:18.729> lots

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:18.969 
it was helpful so make sure it is lots

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:20.909 
it was helpful so make sure it is lots
of<00:07:19.180> water<00:07:19.330> in<00:07:19.569> here<00:07:19.840> to<00:07:20.110> keep<00:07:20.319> everything<00:07:20.650> nice

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 
of water in here to keep everything nice

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:28.200 
of water in here to keep everything nice
and<00:07:23.849> wet<00:07:24.849> so<00:07:25.509> that<00:07:25.659> isn't<00:07:27.120> obviously<00:07:28.120> a

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
and wet so that isn't obviously a

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.369 
and wet so that isn't obviously a
fracture<00:07:29.139> and<00:07:29.319> I<00:07:30.689> hope<00:07:31.689> this<00:07:31.810> was<00:07:31.960> helpful<00:07:31.990> as

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:32.379 
fracture and I hope this was helpful as

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:34.650 
fracture and I hope this was helpful as
I<00:07:32.439> said
