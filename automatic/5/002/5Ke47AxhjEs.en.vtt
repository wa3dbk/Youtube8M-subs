more about the treasure than Tenten does

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.670 
more about the treasure than Tenten does
that<00:00:47.180> makes<00:00:47.360> Tintin<00:00:47.809> our<00:00:47.960> underdog<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:48.559> know

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.900 
that makes Tintin our underdog you know
that's<00:00:48.860> why<00:00:48.950> we're<00:00:49.130> rooting<00:00:49.370> for<00:00:49.400> him<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:49.850> at

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
that's why we're rooting for him and at

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.729 
that's why we're rooting for him and at
a<00:00:49.970> point<00:00:50.270> Tintin<00:00:50.630> runs<00:00:50.870> across<00:00:51.110> Captain

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
a point Tintin runs across Captain

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.260 
a point Tintin runs across Captain
Haddock<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:52.309> now<00:00:52.400> they<00:00:52.610> team<00:00:52.850> up<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.150> they're

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
Haddock and now they team up and they're

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.580 
Haddock and now they team up and they're
going<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.540> find<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:53.900> treasure<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.440> I<00:00:54.470> would

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
going to find this treasure and I would

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.110 
going to find this treasure and I would
argue<00:00:54.770> that<00:00:54.890> Captain<00:00:55.370> Haddock<00:00:55.610> becomes<00:00:55.880> less

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
argue that Captain Haddock becomes less

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.910 
argue that Captain Haddock becomes less
of<00:00:56.270> a<00:00:56.330> secondary<00:00:56.750> sidekick<00:00:57.380> character<00:00:57.560> and

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
of a secondary sidekick character and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.560 
of a secondary sidekick character and
more<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.280> second<00:00:58.700> lead<00:00:58.910> character<00:00:59.390> which<00:00:59.540> is

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
more of a second lead character which is

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.300 
more of a second lead character which is
really<00:00:59.870> cool<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.080> like<00:01:00.350> that<00:01:00.590> they<00:01:00.770> both<00:01:00.950> share

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
really cool I like that they both share

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.010 
really cool I like that they both share
an<00:01:01.490> awesomeness<00:01:02.090> now<00:01:02.240> Captain<00:01:02.660> Haddock<00:01:02.930> is

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
an awesomeness now Captain Haddock is

sometimes the comedy in this movie kind

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.130 
sometimes the comedy in this movie kind
of<00:01:10.160> swung<00:01:10.550> towards<00:01:11.030> some<00:01:11.210> slapstick<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.930> didn't

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
really like that as much like sometimes

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.830 
really like that as much like sometimes
there<00:01:13.820> are<00:01:13.880> things<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.240> happen<00:01:14.630> in<00:01:14.750> this

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
there are things that happen in this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.270 
there are things that happen in this
