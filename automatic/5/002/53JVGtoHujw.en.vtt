00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.790
 A few months I spoke here in the garage. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.820
 about the bmw isetta 600 in this world the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.160
 special model italian micro fte 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.350
 tchinquetchento drew attention to the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:46.140
 style and its full lines and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:48.480
 sympathy sympathy what he has to spare 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.590
 the style immortalized by the cinema brings 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.390
 still wheels with bumper caps 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.630
 stylized in this luxury version and the ceiling 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.630
 solar 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:19.180
 the twin-cylinder engine at 18 horsepower and is 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.180
 known for the economy 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.460
 europe in the period the war was 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.569
 intimidated in various ways 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.899
 then it is well destroyed it was necessary 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.899
 besides rebuilding save enough 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.600
 in this period the microcar 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.200
 we have some nice models 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.050
 such as the bmw isetta 300 of the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.930
 600 that we walked the ps admits 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.000
 which is from the same aircraft factory and 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:23.860
 some other potiguar team one of them 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.860
 150 red came to market in 59 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.340
 the car was meant to be 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.160
 and some lines as I said 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.680
 in the beginning quite nice of the center 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.840
 on the street everyone looks and speaks positive 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.360
 It's whoever changes the friendly 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.730
 maybe because it's also the movie car 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.890
 in drawing cars on children if 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.890
 identify the incredible deal a lot 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:56.430
 ruth coutinho released in the 50's and 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.430
 had some legal versions too 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.620
 all at once the so-called gardener 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.690
 always found really cool is that it has to be 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.690
 a convertible at the time that is more expensive 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.819
 the interior is small but it finishes 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.379
 surprising in several respects 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.670
 You can take four people here. 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.460
 quietly 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.190
 and this none 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.190
 the sunroof of homeless beautiful canvas 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.730
 this noise that we hear in the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.620
 passages is the shell there hits a 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.260
 little on the side 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.819
 the first was not organized then 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.790
 I was able to fully engage the car 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.790
 stopped now we're not going to accelerate here 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.329
 I know 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.280
 we'll see I do not know do not know the truth 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.390
 we do not have 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.390
 importance to stay 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:26.150
 but the maximum speed of 95 or 100 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.340
 miles per hour I found more 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.310
 curious walking in it 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.319
 We came and would file for these streets. 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.750
 large sack of sao paulo on you 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.639
 Can you walk at 70 for now? 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.729
 quietly 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.530
 even to the new marginal now this is the 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.610
 second micro car I have 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.539
 shame of walking 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.819
 Do you remember exeter 600 eta? 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.990
 of it being a car competing with this 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.210
 on here 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.979
 the Czech team sold in almost four 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.370
 millions and all its history 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.370
 18 years of production and one thing that 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.979
 I think it's cool that nuno isetta at bmw 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.509
 Isetta to you has an impression brings 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:11.110
 wheels are and 10 inches that it is 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.990
 much closer to things 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.290
 this one you still with him 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.640
 12 inch wheels 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.640
 the scene comfortably 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:41.090
 It's an interesting guy and four gears. 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.580
 Driveability is quite light 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.590
 both the steering wheel that makes the wheels 12 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.800
 inches is a legal differential in 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.150
 relation to the good does not present 600 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.080
 10 inches that has a credibility 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.080
 quite docile 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.599
 kaka weighing him 4 199 kilograms 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.599
 so he even has a potential, I do not know 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:10.389
 out on the internet always competing with 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.389
 hayabusa engine an incredible deal 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.000
 come back just right to guide you do not have 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.810
 steering wheel clearance 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.810
 Perfect 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.830
 I was going to say that this car wears the 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.000
 driver walked us wearing car 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.000
 you entering it if you already 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:39.600
 we literally bet the matter 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.510
 the delay type red art and other things 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.640
 including plastic and bring 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:50.030
 More classic things person likes very 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.030
 and I also love the reverent 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.059
 to
