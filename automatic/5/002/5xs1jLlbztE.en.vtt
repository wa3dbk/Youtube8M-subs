after most of us forget about them most
people<00:00:39.329> don't<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:39.780> about<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.230> fact<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
people don't think about the fact that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.170 
people don't think about the fact that
there's<00:00:40.800> water<00:00:40.950> underground<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.850> what

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
there's water underground and what

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.779 
there's water underground and what
happens<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.870> rains<00:00:43.610> some<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
happens is when it rains some of that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.520 
happens is when it rains some of that
water<00:00:44.969> infiltrates<00:00:45.660> into<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> surface<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
water infiltrates into the surface and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
water infiltrates into the surface and
some<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.890> makes<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.670> down<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
some it makes it all the way down to the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.920 
some it makes it all the way down to the
water<00:00:49.410> table<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:51.030> water<00:00:51.300> table<00:00:51.690> isn't

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
water table and that water table isn't

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.260 
water table and that water table isn't
static<00:00:52.410> water<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:52.920> moves<00:00:53.489> underground

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
static water actually moves underground

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
static water actually moves underground
and<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.719> that's<00:00:54.960> why<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.469> water<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and so that's why we have water in

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
and so that's why we have water in
creeks<00:00:56.219> water<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.940> flowing<00:00:57.660> underground<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
creeks water is flowing underground and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470 
creeks water is flowing underground and
discharging<00:00:59.129> into<00:00:59.489> creeks<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
discharging into creeks and then it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.229 
discharging into creeks and then it
becomes<00:01:00.750> surface<00:01:01.079> water<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.770> karst<00:01:02.699> aquifers

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
becomes surface water in karst aquifers

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.280 
becomes surface water in karst aquifers
the<00:01:03.570> water<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.170> flowing<00:01:04.530> through<00:01:05.780> spaces<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the water is flowing through spaces that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.830 
the water is flowing through spaces that
have<00:01:07.470> dissolved<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> rock<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.720> we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
have dissolved out of the rock and we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.000 
have dissolved out of the rock and we
don't<00:01:10.020> usually<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.590> rock<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
don't usually think of rock is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
don't usually think of rock is
dissolving<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.729> mean<00:01:11.880> granite<00:01:12.240> doesn't

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
dissolving I mean granite doesn't

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.120 
dissolving I mean granite doesn't
dissolve<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> interesting

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
dissolve and that's the interesting

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.300 
dissolve and that's the interesting
property<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.970> limestone<00:01:15.630> has<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.310> when

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
property that limestone has is that when

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
property that limestone has is that when
it<00:01:17.430> comes<00:01:17.670> into<00:01:17.850> contact<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.540> water<00:01:18.659> that's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it comes into contact with water that's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.260 
it comes into contact with water that's

cars to aqua fur it would just be

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.600 
cars to aqua fur it would just be
funneled<00:02:20.940> or<00:02:21.120> focused<00:02:21.930> into<00:02:22.680> those<00:02:22.860> zones<00:02:23.220> of

so<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.110> karst<00:02:28.440> aquifers<00:02:28.950> there's<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.490> very

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
so in karst aquifers there's this very

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.460 
so in karst aquifers there's this very
important<00:02:32.000> interaction<00:02:33.000> between<00:02:33.320> what<00:02:34.320> goes

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
important interaction between what goes

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.350 
important interaction between what goes
on<00:02:34.620> at<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.860> surface<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.490> what<00:02:36.030> goes<00:02:36.210> on

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
on at the surface and what goes on

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.970 
on at the surface and what goes on
underground<00:02:36.840> because<00:02:37.110> they're<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.680> closely

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
underground because they're so closely

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.610 
underground because they're so closely
connected<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:39.330> really<00:02:39.630> anything<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.380> use

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
connected so really anything that we use

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860

some<00:03:48.390> contaminants<00:03:49.020> that<00:03:49.170> tend<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.890> adhere<00:03:50.130> to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
some contaminants that tend to adhere to

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.520 
some contaminants that tend to adhere to
sediment<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.209> if<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> sediment<00:03:52.350> moves

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
sediment and if the sediment moves

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.840 
sediment and if the sediment moves
through<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.830> system<00:03:53.220> they'll<00:03:53.489> bring<00:03:53.640> those

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
through the system they'll bring those

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.270 
through the system they'll bring those
contaminants<00:03:54.390> with<00:03:54.630> them<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.440> reason<00:03:55.920> that

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
contaminants with them the reason that

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.460 
contaminants with them the reason that
you<00:03:56.760> find<00:03:57.209> them<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.480> karst<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.260> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
you find them in karst is that the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.220 
you find them in karst is that the
openings<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.310> the<00:04:00.120> subsurface<00:04:00.600> are<00:04:00.959> large

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
openings in the subsurface are large

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.650 
openings in the subsurface are large
enough<00:04:01.410> for<00:04:02.150> contaminants<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.270> move<00:04:03.450> on

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
enough for contaminants to move on

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.300 
enough for contaminants to move on
sediment<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.470> move<00:04:04.620> through<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.100> for<00:04:05.250> that

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
sediment to move through and for that

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.160 
sediment to move through and for that
sediment<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.880> not<00:04:06.030> get<00:04:06.270> filtered<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.870> so

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
sediment to not get filtered out so

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.530 
sediment to not get filtered out so
these<00:04:07.770> are<00:04:07.950> contaminants<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.670> sorb<00:04:09.270> two

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
these are contaminants that sorb two

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.840 
these are contaminants that sorb two
solid<00:04:09.989> phases<00:04:10.230> rather<00:04:11.070> than<00:04:11.280> being<00:04:11.430> dissolved

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
solid phases rather than being dissolved
