00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
is the cranberry relish but I kind of

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.570 
is the cranberry relish but I kind of
wanted<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> try<00:00:55.739> something<00:00:56.100> different<00:00:56.129> than

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
wanted to try something different than

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.850 
wanted to try something different than
the<00:00:56.820> regular<00:00:57.000> cranberries<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.019> orange<00:00:58.500> yeah

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
the regular cranberries with orange yeah

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.829 
the regular cranberries with orange yeah
I<00:00:58.979> saw<00:00:59.220> recipe<00:00:59.580> for<00:00:59.760> Chipotle<00:01:00.299> and<00:01:00.449> cranberry

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
I saw recipe for Chipotle and cranberry

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.090 
I saw recipe for Chipotle and cranberry
relish<00:01:01.229> and<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.589> thought<00:01:01.769> that<00:01:01.920> could<00:01:02.040> be

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
relish and I thought that could be

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.469 
relish and I thought that could be
interesting<00:01:02.519> instead<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.940> using<00:01:03.119> a<00:01:03.239> dried

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
interesting instead of using a dried

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.969 
interesting instead of using a dried
chipotle<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> recipe<00:01:04.379> called<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
chipotle like the recipe called for I

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
chipotle like the recipe called for I
used<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.580> chipotle<00:01:06.210> packed<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> dough<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
used a chipotle packed in the dough so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.020 
used a chipotle packed in the dough so
the<00:01:07.020> typical<00:01:07.530> Panda<00:01:08.010> vote<00:01:08.190> right<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.000> I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the typical Panda vote right but I

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
the typical Panda vote right but I
thought<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> smokiness<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
thought that the smokiness that the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
thought that the smokiness that the
adobo<00:01:10.799> would<00:01:10.920> bring<00:01:11.130> went<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> really

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
