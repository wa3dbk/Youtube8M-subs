to emissions inspection since your nose
can't<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:52.110> tell<00:00:52.350> what's<00:00:52.589> coming<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:52.980> of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
can't really tell what's coming out of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
can't really tell what's coming out of
the<00:00:53.160> tailpipe<00:00:53.420> there's<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> few<00:00:54.750> preventative

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the tailpipe there's a few preventative

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.689 
the tailpipe there's a few preventative
measures<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.830> can<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.220> make<00:00:56.370> sure<00:00:56.400> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
measures you can do to make sure it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.390 
measures you can do to make sure it
passes<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.300> emissions<00:00:57.420> testing<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.280> an

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
passes the emissions testing now in an

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.000 
passes the emissions testing now in an
older<00:00:59.699> car<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.150> this<00:01:00.330> 93<00:01:00.930> Celica<00:01:01.500> they

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
older car like this 93 Celica they

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
older car like this 93 Celica they
actually<00:01:02.489> measure<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> gas<00:01:03.150> that<00:01:03.420> comes<00:01:03.659> out

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
actually measure the gas that comes out

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.260 
actually measure the gas that comes out
of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> tailpipe<00:01:04.620> with<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> dynamometer<00:01:05.730> test

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
of the tailpipe with a dynamometer test

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.450 
of the tailpipe with a dynamometer test
so<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.260> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> make<00:01:07.710> sure<00:01:07.890> everything<00:01:08.370> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
so you want to make sure everything is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
so you want to make sure everything is
working<00:01:08.670> fine<00:01:09.120> so<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> gases<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.440> come<00:01:10.620> out

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
working fine so the gases have come out

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
working fine so the gases have come out
of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> pipe<00:01:11.190> are<00:01:11.610> very<00:01:11.970> low<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.300> aren't

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
of the pipe are very low and aren't

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.340 
of the pipe are very low and aren't
polluting<00:01:13.170> much<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> first<00:01:15.450> make<00:01:15.990> sure<00:01:16.229> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
polluting much so first make sure that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.260 
polluting much so first make sure that
the<00:01:16.500> oil<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.860> clean<00:01:17.159> change<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> oil<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the oil is clean change the oil and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.810 
the oil is clean change the oil and
filter<00:01:18.390> before<00:01:18.990> your<00:01:19.200> inspection<00:01:19.800> because<00:01:20.670> if

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
filter before your inspection because if

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.990 
filter before your inspection because if
the<00:01:20.940> oil<00:01:20.970> gets<00:01:21.390> dirty<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:22.350> PCV<00:01:22.979> system<00:01:23.250> can

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the oil gets dirty the PCV system can

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.819 
the oil gets dirty the PCV system can
suck<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> lot<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> those<00:01:24.810> dirty<00:01:25.079> vapors<00:01:25.619> in

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
suck a lot of those dirty vapors in

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.789 
suck a lot of those dirty vapors in
Birnam<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.700> pollute<00:01:27.119> more<00:01:27.439> of<00:01:28.439> course<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
Birnam and pollute more of course you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
Birnam and pollute more of course you
wouldn't<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.100> clean<00:01:29.340> oil<00:01:29.369> anyway<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.570> right

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
wouldn't have clean oil anyway but right

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.780 
wouldn't have clean oil anyway but right
before<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.530> inspection<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> best<00:01:32.520> time

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
before the inspection is the best time

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240 
before the inspection is the best time
to<00:01:32.969> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> cleanest<00:01:33.659> oil<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> next

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to have the cleanest oil and the next

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.950 
to have the cleanest oil and the next
thing<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.850> make<00:01:36.000> sure<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.810> air

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
thing to do is to make sure the air

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.380 
thing to do is to make sure the air
filter<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.469> clean<00:01:37.820> because<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
filter is clean because if you have a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.230 
filter is clean because if you have a
dirty<00:01:39.630> air<00:01:39.780> filter<00:01:40.100> it'll<00:01:41.100> block<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.340> air<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
dirty air filter it'll block the air the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600 
dirty air filter it'll block the air the
Kyl<00:01:42.450> run<00:01:42.780> lean<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.500> it'll<00:01:43.890> pollute<00:01:44.189> too<00:01:44.399> much

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
Kyl run lean and it'll pollute too much

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.060 
Kyl run lean and it'll pollute too much
a<00:01:44.939> lean<00:01:45.570> running<00:01:45.930> car<00:01:46.110> makes<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> engine<00:01:46.740> run

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
a lean running car makes the engine run

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.849 
a lean running car makes the engine run
hotter<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.030> exhaust<00:01:48.359> gas<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.899> hotter<00:01:49.109> puts

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
hotter the exhaust gas get hotter puts

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.649 
hotter the exhaust gas get hotter puts
out<00:01:50.039> more<00:01:50.219> NOx<00:01:50.549> which<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> pollutant<00:01:51.570> they

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
out more NOx which is a pollutant they

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.240 
out more NOx which is a pollutant they
measure<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.350> fail<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> test

gap<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.469> too<00:02:01.649> big<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:02.700> work<00:02:02.909> right

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
gap is too big and they don't work right

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.779 
gap is too big and they don't work right
and<00:02:04.020> even<00:02:04.289> if<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.469> car<00:02:04.679> is<00:02:04.799> running<00:02:04.979> okay<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.670> the

gap<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.030> too<00:02:06.240> big<00:02:06.659> it'll<00:02:07.259> pollute<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
gap is too big it'll pollute more and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.139 
gap is too big it'll pollute more and
you'll<00:02:08.250> fail<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.520> test

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you'll fail the test

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.950 
you'll fail the test
and<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.869> course<00:02:10.140> check<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.649> cooling<00:02:11.009> system

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
and of course check the cooling system

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.390 
and of course check the cooling system
because<00:02:12.960> if<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> coolant<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.710> low<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> top<00:02:14.250> of

because if the coolant is low the top of
the<00:02:14.490> engine<00:02:14.790> will<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:15.000> air<00:02:15.240> in<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.600> make<00:02:16.080> it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the engine will get air in it make it

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.990 
the engine will get air in it make it
run<00:02:16.410> hotter<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.980> it'll<00:02:17.130> pollute<00:02:17.430> more<00:02:17.670> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
run hotter and it'll pollute more and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.940 
run hotter and it'll pollute more and
here<00:02:18.630> again<00:02:18.870> realize<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> engine

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
here again realize that the engine

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.380 
here again realize that the engine

like this fan is spinning because the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.690 
like this fan is spinning because the

if those cooling fans aren't sucking

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.770 
if those cooling fans aren't sucking
there<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.670> engine<00:02:41.970> will<00:02:42.060> run<00:02:42.209> hotter<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.720> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
there the engine will run hotter and it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.199 
there the engine will run hotter and it
can<00:02:42.930> fail<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.349> test<00:02:43.610> now<00:02:44.610> if<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.819> have<00:02:44.939> a<00:02:44.970> more

they<00:02:48.269> don't<00:02:48.450> test<00:02:48.629> them<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.959> dyno<00:02:49.260> they<00:02:49.500> just

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
they don't test them on a dyno they just

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.440 
they don't test them on a dyno they just
plug<00:02:49.980> into<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.370> computer<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.180> there's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
plug into the computer to see if there's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.199 
plug into the computer to see if there's
a<00:02:51.510> problem<00:02:51.989> all<00:02:52.290> cars<00:02:52.590> from<00:02:52.769> 1996<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:53.940> are

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
a problem all cars from 1996 on are

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.349 
a problem all cars from 1996 on are
tested<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.840> way<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.890> if<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.159> have<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> 1996<00:02:57.180> or

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
tested this way so if you have a 1996 or

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.970 
tested this way so if you have a 1996 or
newer<00:02:57.480> car<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:57.989> check<00:02:58.200> engine<00:02:58.379> light<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.739> on

newer car and a check engine light is on

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.130 
newer car and a check engine light is on
you<00:02:59.549> need<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.730> fix<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.209> before<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.629> go<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:00.959> get

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
you need to fix it before you go to get

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.229 
you need to fix it before you go to get
inspected<00:03:01.799> because<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.700> means<00:03:02.940> there's<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
inspected because that means there's a

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
when they inspected their computer will

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.610 
when they inspected their computer will
fail<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.159> the<00:03:08.250> test<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.819> there's<00:03:09.420> over

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
fail it for the test and there's over

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.990 
fail it for the test and there's over
2,000<00:03:10.620> separate<00:03:11.040> trouble<00:03:11.430> codes<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.879> can

solvent<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:37.519> just<00:03:38.519> pour<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> gallon<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.359> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
solvent I just pour a gallon of the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.530 
solvent I just pour a gallon of the
solvent<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:39.989> about<00:03:40.290> half<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.769> tank<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.160> gasoline

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
solvent to about half a tank of gasoline

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.059 
solvent to about half a tank of gasoline
then<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.629> go<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:43.019> highway<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.500> drive<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:44.040> car

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
then I go on a highway and drive the car

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.610 
then I go on a highway and drive the car
at<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.609> maximum<00:03:45.180> speed<00:03:45.480> limit<00:03:45.510> for<00:03:46.349> about

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
at the maximum speed limit for about

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.189 
at the maximum speed limit for about
half<00:03:46.889> an<00:03:47.040> hour<00:03:47.190> or<00:03:47.489> 45<00:03:47.519> minutes<00:03:48.030> I've<00:03:48.930> done

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
half an hour or 45 minutes I've done

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.289 
half an hour or 45 minutes I've done
this<00:03:49.349> on<00:03:49.530> hundreds<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.220> cars<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.849> got<00:03:50.970> them<00:03:51.180> to

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
this on hundreds of cars and got them to

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.720 
this on hundreds of cars and got them to
pass<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.810> emissions<00:03:52.260> test<00:03:52.590> after<00:03:53.250> doing<00:03:53.579> this

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
pass the emissions test after doing this

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.569 
pass the emissions test after doing this
of<00:03:54.690> course<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.319> not<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> magic<00:03:55.829> fix<00:03:56.280> if<00:03:56.489> the

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
of course this is not a magic fix if the

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.670 
of course this is not a magic fix if the
car<00:03:56.760> doesn't<00:03:57.000> run<00:03:57.269> good<00:03:57.569> it's<00:03:57.989> got<00:03:58.169> a<00:03:58.230> serious

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
car doesn't run good it's got a serious

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.170 
car doesn't run good it's got a serious
problem<00:03:58.889> that<00:03:59.069> needs<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.459> be<00:03:59.549> fixed<00:03:59.790> but<00:04:00.060> if

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
problem that needs to be fixed but if

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.240 
problem that needs to be fixed but if
the<00:04:00.269> car<00:04:00.449> runs<00:04:00.720> okay<00:04:01.109> this<00:04:01.349> can<00:04:01.530> often<00:04:01.769> let<00:04:02.129> it

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the car runs okay this can often let it

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.849 
the car runs okay this can often let it
pass<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.699> test<00:04:02.910> because<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.199> solvent<00:04:04.440> burns

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
pass the test because the solvent burns

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.220 
pass the test because the solvent burns
really<00:04:05.160> clean<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.449> gas<00:04:06.629> coming<00:04:07.019> out<00:04:07.109> of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
really clean so the gas coming out of

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.960 
really clean so the gas coming out of
the<00:04:07.290> exhaust<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.949> get<00:04:08.099> cleaner<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.699> cleaner

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
the exhaust can get cleaner and cleaner

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.569 
the exhaust can get cleaner and cleaner
as<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.329> cleans<00:04:09.629> all<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.840> systems<00:04:10.379> out<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.459> if

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
as it cleans all the systems out and if

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.129 
as it cleans all the systems out and if
you<00:04:11.699> have<00:04:11.819> a<00:04:11.849> late<00:04:12.090> model<00:04:12.299> cold<00:04:12.690> with<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> check

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
you have a late model cold with a check

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.869 
you have a late model cold with a check
engine<00:04:13.319> light<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.859> it<00:04:13.949> says<00:04:14.159> inefficient

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
engine light and it says inefficient

catalytic<00:04:15.419> converter<00:04:15.810> try<00:04:16.560> this<00:04:16.620> first<00:04:17.099> cuz

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
catalytic converter try this first cuz

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.159 
catalytic converter try this first cuz
it<00:04:17.549> will<00:04:17.699> often<00:04:17.970> clean<00:04:18.479> them<00:04:18.630> up<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.019> they'll

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
it will often clean them up so they'll

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.149 
it will often clean them up so they'll
pass<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.739> test<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.530> now<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.710> can<00:04:22.949> stop

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
pass the test so now you can stop

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.710 
pass the test so now you can stop
worrying<00:04:23.460> about<00:04:23.639> your<00:04:23.940> car<00:04:24.120> passing<00:04:24.630> the

worrying about your car passing the

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.000 
worrying about your car passing the
emissions<00:04:25.169> test<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.770> do<00:04:26.220> something<00:04:26.699> about<00:04:26.820> it

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
emissions test and do something about it

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.740 
emissions test and do something about it
and<00:04:29.010> remember<00:04:29.280> if<00:04:29.909> your<00:04:30.150> car<00:04:30.389> has<00:04:30.419> any
