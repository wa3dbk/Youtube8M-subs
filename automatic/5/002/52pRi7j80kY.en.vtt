00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
Dreamcast not only because this has an

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.940 
Dreamcast not only because this has an
updated<00:05:26.270> rosters<00:05:26.510> area<00:05:27.020> husband<00:05:27.410> it<00:05:27.560> has<00:05:27.740> more

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
character choices but I think it also

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.159 
character choices but I think it also
plays<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.250> little<00:05:31.400> bit<00:05:31.580> smoother<00:05:31.970> on<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.210> PSP

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169
