gregg<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.470> think<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.310> that's<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
gregg you think that that's in the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
gregg you think that that's in the
future<00:00:24.119> do<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.269> think<00:00:24.480> that's<00:00:24.660> something

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
future do you think that's something

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.259

they<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.320> against<00:00:25.650> Warren<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.189> suppose<00:00:27.060> it

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
they can do against Warren I suppose it

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.839 
they can do against Warren I suppose it
depends<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> matchup<00:00:28.519> Warren<00:00:29.519> has<00:00:29.640> got

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
depends on the matchup Warren has got

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.330 
depends on the matchup Warren has got
some<00:00:30.179> big<00:00:30.359> kids<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> defensive<00:00:31.380> line<00:00:31.439> they

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
some big kids on the defensive line they

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.270 
some big kids on the defensive line they
got<00:00:32.520> big<00:00:33.180> strong<00:00:33.510> safety<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.110> 205<00:00:34.680> pounds<00:00:35.160> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
got big strong safety at 205 pounds of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610 
got big strong safety at 205 pounds of
hits<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.329> sure<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:37.020> really<00:00:37.320> think<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
hits I'm not sure I really think that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.380 
hits I'm not sure I really think that
they<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.250> balance<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.149> want

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
they have the balance the way they want

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.150 
they have the balance the way they want
it<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.690> mean<00:00:40.050> let's<00:00:40.200> face<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.649> Brian<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.040> not

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it I mean let's face it Brian it's not

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
it I mean let's face it Brian it's not
really<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.550> big<00:00:41.790> true<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.420> mean<00:00:42.660> he'd<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
really that big true I mean he'd be the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.110 
really that big true I mean he'd be the
first<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.440> tell<00:00:43.710> he's<00:00:43.860> 165<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.969> that's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
first one to tell he's 165 and that's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.490 
first one to tell he's 165 and that's
you<00:00:45.329> know<00:00:45.360> carrying<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> couple<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> hand

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you know carrying a couple of hand

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.860 
you know carrying a couple of hand
weight<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:48.030> they're<00:00:48.360> doing<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
weight so I think they're doing it the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
weight so I think they're doing it the
right<00:00:49.020> way<00:00:49.079> he<00:00:49.410> had<00:00:49.530> four<00:00:49.800> catches<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.219> 92

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
right way he had four catches for 92

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.650 
right way he had four catches for 92
yards<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.719> think<00:00:52.440> Warren<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.670> actually<00:00:54.390> kind<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
yards I think Warren is actually kind of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.260 
yards I think Warren is actually kind of
a<00:00:54.780> mirror<00:00:55.079> image<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.550> Cardinals<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.090> sure

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.310 
a mirror image of the Cardinals I'm sure
we're<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> talk<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.079> more
