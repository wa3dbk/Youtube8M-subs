00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.020
 Record success on video 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:28.340
 those are about 30 kilo porcini mushrooms 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:37.379
 today is sunday 29 september 2013 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.519
 and for that I have to say for one 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:44.960
 result we are already today 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.510
 spent hours in the forest 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.010
 Unfortunately I can only from the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.100
 Bird's eye view filming because the kitchen 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.100
 so tiny is for so many mushrooms 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 I was not aware of the video camera 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.630
 taken with the forest today around me 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.670
 and completely on the mushroom search too 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 concentrate and beyond had 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.300
 I think that maybe I 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.080
 not he might embarrass namely even 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.080

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.740

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.690
 four 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.490
 and the mushroom day is far from over 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.830
 completed 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.610
 As you can see, there is still a lot of work left 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.289
 We want to clean and eat then 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.300

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.509
 perspective 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:02.670
 I can now zones also have a go 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.870

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.360
 the cleaned ones under a basket 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:14.180
 those are the dirty ones well 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.720
 I have to say our freezer is 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.870
 already up to the stop full because 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.800

 This body is full with about 13 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.800

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:43.120

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.129

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.470

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.440

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.420

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.390

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.600

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.990
 but more and more is added and we 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.350

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.780
 Accommodate those are the finished 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:10.590
