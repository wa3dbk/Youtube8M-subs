00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.310
 or the chaux and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.670
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.050
 big title will be missed 5 of mods and pc 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.300
 it's something that I come to talk about 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.920
 today since it was recently in 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.930
 some forums have been spoken many of 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.000
 these things and there appears something very 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.490
 interesting because the truth if you 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.410
 they want to play big facto 5 I started what 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.260
 more father and pretty in a game of playing 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.060
 I started it is to put mods can not such 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.770
 how can the minecraft game be 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.869
 the game of computer minecraft is 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.610
 characterizes so much by the mods that those 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.340
 we can not find them in the console because 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.320
 are created by amateur users not that 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.600
 they have nothing to do with the company and 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.579
 they do it simply to give a taste and 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.040
 add a new gaming experience 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.079
 to people not also this happens with the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.090
 san andreas and the big car 4 that like 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.680
 you will be able to see maybe seen in the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.960
 miniature put them a big mold for 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.520
 auto 4 this is not something I'm going 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.770
 to speak today because I thought 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.989
 very important and I'm going to tell you a 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.239
 little bit of what all this is going the company 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.039
 again there's a rumor that it's going to 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.110
 work with rockstar games since 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.010
 they have an image they say with whom 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.350
 we are working and he 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.510
 the row appears in the image of 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.400
 rockstar games also the company has 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.440
 said many things that are not 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.060
 affiliates and many other things and that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.640
 rockstar games will not use the system 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.470
 of de rm for what the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.780
 big car 5 although there are many 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.940
 rumors that to play great cars 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.670
 5 you must always have the connection to 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.220
 internet to not allow piracy 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.350
 as games downloaded from websites and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.330
 other things but I really am something 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.670
 according to this I am totally of 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.770
 According to people not download 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.350
 the free game and you have to pay 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.970
 but I think that if you are paying the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.010
 price of what the game is you can 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.200
 Do exactly what you want with him 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.840
 whether you want to modify it or you want 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.760
 do something not maybe what they are going 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.670
 doing the mods like they can be 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.040
 mods menus on the play that the system 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.930
 it has to be pirated to say 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.360
 some way to have money 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.670
 infinite maybe that can penalize a 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.650
 little but those fun ways as 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.200
 what are the hidden weapons will change 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.600
 the characters have ironman power 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.400
 with the big car character 4 yo 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.560
 I think this should not be lost 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.629
 that this is quite fun and it gives you 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.489
 a better game experience because if 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.590
 they abuse a lot of this in the big car 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.629
 online then I'll see if I see a bit of valid 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.760
 the penalty not me I 'm not against 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.579
 of all that in fact to me the opposite 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.200
 I the grand theft auto 4 of pc me 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.909
 I had a lot of fun with him when I 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.790
 put the ironman mold that was mime 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.040
 preferred or the spider-man mold or that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.870
 it was very funny no and you could change 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.510
 many things you could change the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.819
 vehicles to the game was something very 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.639
 fun I remember that instead of 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.200
 have to be me instead of having in this 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.599
 vehicle the inferno is that it was the most 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.849
 fast in all grand theft auto 4 yo what 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.109
 replaced by a lamborghini siesta 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.299
 element there is not something was quite 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.859
 fun and the truth that I had it 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.290
 pretty good I'm totally from 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.819
 agreement that maybe in piracy 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.439
 for people who want to download the 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.780
 free game is a bit penalized 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.010
 but if you want to request a state of 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.379
 connection I think they should 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.959
 ask for a little more time no longer is that 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.329
 if not acting online, let us expose you 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.829
 you have your laptop you have great cars 5 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.780
 it's a laptop that runs very well on you 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.370
 game and you just want to take it 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.180
 to the work in which you want to play 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.000
 a while 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.500
 They should not ask us for the internet or that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.299
 you just go on vacation then 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.709
 there are times you do not have internet and I 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.239
 I think it's something that is not enough 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.620
 well in the same way in the description of 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.150
 this video I will leave the forums 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.760
 for you to read all this for your 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.530
 own eyes and tell me your opinion and I 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.750
 I looked a little forced to this to 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.730
 do it because to me the truth I think 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.739
 buy the big computer point 5 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.659
 I do not know very well yet the requirements 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.430
 but I guess they're going to do something 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.230
 nightmare because if people want is 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.000
 the game will then have to have one with 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.040
 good though I think the requirements 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.950
 are going to be some level given with the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.090
 new games that are coming out 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.250
 currently not how the new one could be 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.599
 call of duty what do I know the far cry 4 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.639
 all these games that are already 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.680
 confirming your requirements I guess that 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.139
 will be somewhat similar to those of the big 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.969
 car 5 but I think that all this of the 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.819
 monkeys will be clarified later 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:13.200
 if I'm not wrong the big point 5 goes 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.000
 be with the forum I say with 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.950
 the steam system and I think it's something 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 that is pretty good and we will be able to 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.459
 do many things you say in 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.950
 your opinion what mods look like 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.600
 I want to hear in the comments your 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.610
 opinion of what they think of the mountains of 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.710
 great fauto that seem to them of 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.450
 convert your character and what is a 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.310
 My favorite mod was the ironman 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.410
 I want to know which one you liked 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.389
 and that of san andreas was that of the broom 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.430
 and the cam and change the truth 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.410
 those were intervened from big point 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.300

 been entertained without more to say to me
