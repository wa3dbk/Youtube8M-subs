00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello and welcome zawi ford metro to a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.400
 new video from our channel where 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.230
 this time we want to show you how 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 configurable are the wine pallets of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.199
 start as well as the different background 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.699
 sizes etc. sure many of 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.039
 you already know these 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 configurations but there will be other 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.240
 people that you use every day 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.230
 windows phone and it can be pretty 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.620
 of help 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.020
 in the start menu we can check how 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.270
 are the different ones you are in the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.420
 which have different sizes we can 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.370
 have a very small size one size 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.390
 that we can say square one size 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.329
 larger or double wide 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.040
 these sizes are configurable and so 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.530
 each of them for example the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.760
 we can 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 change both position simply 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.000
 leaving it pressed with the finger we will see 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.550
 that we can change from one to another 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.680
 and to change its size we will do it 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.990
 through the fichita that we have in the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.880
 bottom part then combines the part 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.270
 small altman at least or double wide 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.250
 so we can do then for 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.250
 practically any of the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 Applications 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.820
 although not for all for example in the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.600
 Store case will only be taken 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.380
 two sizes the smallest size or the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.380
 square size 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.270
 as we have seen it is enough to leave 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.270
 tight and we can set the width 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.200
 by the position of the tile as 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.930
 we want wherever we want 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.460
 of course with the arrival of windows 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.400
 forms 8.11 or for the lumia would be the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.040
 denim case 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.220
 one more step has been taken and what we can 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.430
 create now are folders of such that 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.500
 we can create a folder that we can 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.500
 put a name as easy as 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.420
 click on it 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.530
 and we can change the name we want 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.730
 we can even put even symbolized 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.730
 if we like it 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.310
 with which we can and within the 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.290
 folder we can organize to change 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.650
 different sizes 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.409
 in time or dinner organization 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.180
 we want but how to create a folder 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.560
 Well, the truth is that we have simple 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.640
 you just have to choose a time 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.640
 we drag on another 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.569
 you see 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.730
 and a folder is created 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.159
 how to remove how we undo a folder 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.540
 well dragging all their such out 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.540
 of the folder 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.269
 month 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.450
 apart we can configure more of 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.069
 this menu start good then in those 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.069
 terminals such as this one that is 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.689
 the 920 that have a screen size 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.109
 less than 5 inches 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:29.689
 we can configure the number of columns 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:32.780
 in this we can see that we have 6 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:35.689
 small columns or we can say that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.139
 three large in size squared 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.110
 normal if we go to configuration and 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:44.010
 we are going 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.010
 at the beginning 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.819
 we can choose 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.720
 that there are more or less columns if we take 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.020
 fewer columns 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.730
 we can see that now you are more 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.430
 big 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.209
 occupying the broad name for all the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.209
 screen 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.020
 if we choose 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.020
 all columns 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.600
 we can see that now although that case is 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.230
 to the messy you are not occupying a 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.230
 column minus 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.860
 let's see what else we can configure inside 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:29.650
 from the start menu we can 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.560
 put a background image all this 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.580
 thanks to windows phone 8.1 as we have 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.330
 could see in that the background image 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.349
 You can see the effect 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.759
 moves more little by little in which 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.139
 What is displaced is getting a 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.860
 effect for the truth that is quite 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.990
 striking 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.000
 but there are some people who do not like it 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.509
 So what we can do is remove 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.509
 that fund 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:03.120
 with which we will remain, you are not with the 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.120
 color that we have as emphasis color 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.710
 of course it's color we can 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.710
 change for example put a yellow 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.949
 with which it changes 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:19.459
 totally the aspect of of our 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.459
 start screen 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.610
 and we can also change the color of the 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.070
 background from dark to a light color with 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.400
 which will we have a start with the 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.400
 White background
