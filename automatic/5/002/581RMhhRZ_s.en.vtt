this video I want to go over the issue

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.129 
this video I want to go over the issue
of<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.900> leg<00:00:13.259> press<00:00:13.559> versus<00:00:14.400> squats<00:00:15.269> when<00:00:16.049> it

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
of the leg press versus squats when it

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.200 
of the leg press versus squats when it
comes<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.500> building<00:00:16.740> muscle<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.880> your<00:00:17.910> lower

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210

body<00:00:18.480> both<00:00:18.810> exercises<00:00:19.410> use<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> very<00:00:20.130> similar

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
body both exercises use a very similar

body both exercises use a very similar
movement<00:00:21.630> pattern<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.140> they<00:00:22.199> both<00:00:22.410> allow<00:00:22.710> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
movement pattern and they both allow you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.210 
movement pattern and they both allow you
to<00:00:22.949> effectively<00:00:24.380> overload<00:00:25.380> your<00:00:25.529> leg<00:00:25.769> muscles

most situations for most lifters squats
are<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> most<00:01:11.280> productive<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
them then consistent squatting probably

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640 
them then consistent squatting probably
should<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.000> included<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.630> part<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:37.259> your

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
overall like training approach now that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.910 
overall like training approach now that
said<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.509> the

hardcore bodybuilders and power lifters
out<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.560> probably<00:01:47.549> won't<00:01:47.850> agree<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.299> this

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
out there probably won't agree with this

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
out there probably won't agree with this
and<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.079> won't<00:01:49.439> want<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> hear<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and they won't want to hear it but the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.020 
and they won't want to hear it but the
simple<00:01:51.810> reality<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.799> even<00:01:53.220> though

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
simple reality is that even though

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.560 
simple reality is that even though

squats

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.560

are<00:01:54.689> an<00:01:54.960> awesome<00:01:55.530> exercise<00:01:56.360> when<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.450> all

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
are an awesome exercise when it all

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
are an awesome exercise when it all
comes<00:01:57.780> down<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.350> there's<00:01:58.530> still<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:59.009> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
comes down to it there's still not a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.609 
comes down to it there's still not a
mandatory<00:01:59.759> lift<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.540> absolutely<00:02:00.780> can

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
mandatory lift and you absolutely can

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.550 
mandatory lift and you absolutely can
build<00:02:02.149> significantly<00:02:03.149> big<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.719> strong<00:02:04.170> legs

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
build significantly big and strong legs

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
build significantly big and strong legs
without<00:02:04.920> them<00:02:05.159> any<00:02:05.430> exercise<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
without them any exercise out there that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.990 
without them any exercise out there that
puts<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> targeted<00:02:07.860> muscles<00:02:08.280> under<00:02:08.729> tension

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
puts the targeted muscles under tension

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
puts the targeted muscles under tension
and<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:10.110> allows<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.679> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and that allows you to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
to discourage anybody from squatting and

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.439 
to discourage anybody from squatting and
I'm<00:04:31.990> definitely<00:04:32.620> not<00:04:32.830> saying<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:34.240> leg

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
I'm definitely not saying that the leg

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.480 
I'm definitely not saying that the leg
press<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.900> better<00:04:35.199> somehow<00:04:35.560> or<00:04:36.040> that<00:04:36.400> it

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
press is better somehow or that it

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.010 
press is better somehow or that it
should<00:04:36.520> be<00:04:36.850> used<00:04:37.090> as<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> replacement<00:04:37.479> for

should be used as a replacement for

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
squats again all I'm really trying to

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.719 
squats again all I'm really trying to
point<00:04:40.840> out<00:04:40.990> here<00:04:41.350> is<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.530> both<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.460> these

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
point out here is that both of these

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.180 
point out here is that both of these
exercises<00:04:42.970> are<00:04:43.690> viable<00:04:44.110> lifts<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:44.770> there's

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
exercises are viable lifts and there's

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.040 
exercises are viable lifts and there's
really<00:04:45.340> no<00:04:45.639> need<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:45.970> pick<00:04:46.270> one<00:04:46.570> over<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
really no need to pick one over the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.800 
really no need to pick one over the
other<00:04:47.080> if<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:48.070> had<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.520> pick<00:04:48.699> one<00:04:48.729> then<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.540> would

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
other if I had to pick one then I would

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.050 
other if I had to pick one then I would
definitely<00:04:49.990> go<00:04:50.500> with<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.770> basic<00:04:51.070> barbell<00:04:51.610> squat

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
definitely go with a basic barbell squat

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.210 
definitely go with a basic barbell squat
but<00:04:52.840> if<00:04:53.020> you're<00:04:53.169> like<00:04:53.320> most<00:04:53.500> lifters<00:04:53.979> and

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
but if you're like most lifters and

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.920 
but if you're like most lifters and
you're<00:04:54.610> going<00:04:54.760> to<00:04:54.790> be<00:04:54.940> using<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.360> variety<00:04:55.510> of

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
you're going to be using a variety of

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.290 
you're going to be using a variety of
exercises<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:56.830> hit<00:04:57.039> your<00:04:57.160> lower<00:04:57.310> body<00:04:57.580> then

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
exercises to hit your lower body then

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.540 
exercises to hit your lower body then
just<00:04:58.539> use<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.750> combination<00:04:59.169> of<00:04:59.500> both<00:04:59.560> and<00:05:00.070> on

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
just use a combination of both and on

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.520 
just use a combination of both and on
top<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.180> if<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:01.510> truly<00:05:01.960> can't<00:05:02.380> perform

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
top of that if you truly can't perform

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.159 
top of that if you truly can't perform
squats<00:05:03.160> because<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.699> some<00:05:03.940> sort<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.539> injury

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
squats because of some sort of injury

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.560 
squats because of some sort of injury
usually<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.710> lower<00:05:05.889> back<00:05:06.220> then<00:05:07.060> just<00:05:07.389> know

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
usually to the lower back then just know

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.210 
usually to the lower back then just know
that<00:05:07.720> using<00:05:07.900> leg<00:05:08.199> presses<00:05:08.650> as<00:05:08.770> your<00:05:08.949> main

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
lower body compound lift is still going

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.129 
lower body compound lift is still going
to<00:05:11.410> produce<00:05:12.330> significant<00:05:13.330> gains<00:05:13.539> in<00:05:13.690> size<00:05:13.930> and

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
to produce significant gains in size and

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.070 
to produce significant gains in size and
strength<00:05:14.440> as<00:05:14.830> long<00:05:15.490> as<00:05:15.639> you<00:05:15.729> apply

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
strength as long as you apply

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.140 
strength as long as you apply
progressive<00:05:17.080> overload<00:05:17.410> over<00:05:17.830> time<00:05:18.150> squats

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
progressive overload over time squats

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.330 
progressive overload over time squats
are<00:05:19.449> an<00:05:19.750> awesome<00:05:20.320> exercise<00:05:20.470> but<00:05:21.190> there's

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
are an awesome exercise but there's

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.730 
are an awesome exercise but there's
really<00:05:21.490> nothing<00:05:22.020> magical<00:05:23.020> about<00:05:23.229> them<00:05:23.500> and

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
really nothing magical about them and

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.890 
really nothing magical about them and
you<00:05:24.130> absolutely<00:05:24.370> can<00:05:25.180> still<00:05:25.510> build<00:05:25.780> an

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
you absolutely can still build an

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.659 
you absolutely can still build an
impressive<00:05:26.020> lower<00:05:26.590> body<00:05:26.919> without<00:05:27.160> them<00:05:27.520> and

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
impressive lower body without them and

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.029 
impressive lower body without them and
just<00:05:28.450> as<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.599> side<00:05:28.930> note<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.380> know<00:05:29.440> that<00:05:29.770> some

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
just as a side note I know that some

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.640 
just as a side note I know that some
people<00:05:30.070> will<00:05:30.520> probably<00:05:30.760> point<00:05:31.389> out<00:05:31.650> that

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
people will probably point out that

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.260 
people will probably point out that
squats<00:05:33.070> are<00:05:33.280> far<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:33.789> away<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:34.000> better

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
squats are far and away the better

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.350 
squats are far and away the better
exercise<00:05:34.840> because<00:05:35.740> they<00:05:36.130> boost<00:05:36.610> testosterone

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
exercise because they boost testosterone

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.529 
exercise because they boost testosterone
and<00:05:38.139> growth<00:05:38.200> hormone<00:05:38.800> levels<00:05:38.830> in<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.280> body

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
and growth hormone levels in the body

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.360 
and growth hormone levels in the body
but<00:05:40.539> just<00:05:40.720> keep<00:05:40.900> in<00:05:41.020> mind<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:41.349> this<00:05:41.530> point<00:05:41.919> is

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
but just keep in mind that this point is

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.900 
but just keep in mind that this point is
more<00:05:43.240> likely<00:05:43.720> than<00:05:43.870> not<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:44.440> non-issue<00:05:45.039> because

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
more likely than not a non-issue because

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.750 
more likely than not a non-issue because

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610
