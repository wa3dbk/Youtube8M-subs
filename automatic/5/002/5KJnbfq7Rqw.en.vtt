00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.580
 collector all I am already 91 I come 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.700
 bringing them today a new 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.480
 video in which I come bringing what 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.730
 would be the preview of some topics that I did 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.029
 a long time ago but because 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.340
 problems here with youtube and some 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.460
 things that you had pending because not the 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.830
 I could not get it out but well these 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.830
 themes are very simple 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.730
 it did not really take long 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.829
 do nothing but 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.680
 more than anything I made them this way 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.270
 so that it could be avoided in some way 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.910
 way a problem with what is the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 resolution since many times I have seen 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.710
 I want to download a theme and put it 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 in what is my browser but at 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.089
 time to put it the wallpaper that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.220
 has a background and is very large or many 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.780
 Sometimes it is very small and this is 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.480
 obviously makes our subject and the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.370
 visualization looks bad good then 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.040
 select images that did not have a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.500
 background so they did not have much 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.050
 problem so it is that change the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.869
 resolution of that monitor or whatever it is 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.850
 a little more independent good here 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.630
 there are the previous ones of some of the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.880
 the some dedicated subjects of camps 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.190
 come many more topics in nothing 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.340
 more than you check them not 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.940
 I can put all of them all here I put this 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940
 in full screen 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.180
 and well I hope you like the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.880
 issues as I tell you are very simple in 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.080
 actually nothing else was the background sometimes 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.150
 the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.970
 in some font the color of the font 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.970
 here and this and the color here in this 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.100
 bar we changed it a little 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.970
 this as I tell you these are some of 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.750
 the previous ones of some of the subjects I 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.960
 I hope you like the link will be 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.570
 in the description of the video as I say 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.030
 there are more issues there 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.460
 and well, if any of you have 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.930
 doubts about how to install these topics we are going 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.440
 to see what is our google chrome 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.570

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.560

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.900
 short video 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.150
 I have more projects that I am 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.810
 still working but it's not very safe 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.720
 I have them 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.000
 on a specific date I take it 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.400
 I would be telling everyone if there 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.040
 new updates or something important 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.720

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.910
 be doing original videos and that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.130
 these projects are made by me although 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.989
 Well, I know they are very simple but it is 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.730
 same if you like it then let me 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.980
