and<00:04:49.590> whatnot<00:04:49.860> they<00:04:49.950> always<00:04:50.220> make<00:04:50.400> an<00:04:50.550> issue

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
and whatnot they always make an issue

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.760

over<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.270> quality<00:04:51.720> they<00:04:52.230> always<00:04:52.380> go<00:04:52.560> all<00:04:52.740> in

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
over the quality they always go all in

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.400 
over the quality they always go all in
bad<00:04:53.760> quality<00:04:54.330> or<00:04:54.540> this<00:04:54.840> this<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.110> that<00:04:55.320> about

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
bad quality or this this and that about

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
the dazzle quality and I think it can be

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.510 
the dazzle quality and I think it can be
a<00:04:58.050> real<00:04:58.290> hindrance<00:04:58.560> for<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.890> lot<00:04:59.040> of<00:04:59.070> people<00:04:59.160> now

that<00:06:08.070> so<00:06:08.910> um<00:06:09.260> yeah<00:06:10.260> that's<00:06:10.470> I<00:06:10.680> definitely

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
that so um yeah that's I definitely

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.880 
that so um yeah that's I definitely
would<00:06:11.400> advise<00:06:11.820> getting<00:06:12.210> diver<00:06:12.630> I<00:06:13.110> don't<00:06:13.830> know

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
would advise getting diver I don't know

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.110 
would advise getting diver I don't know
say<00:06:14.100> if<00:06:14.160> you've<00:06:14.250> got<00:06:14.370> Astros<00:06:14.760> or<00:06:14.910> something

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
say if you've got Astros or something

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.000 
say if you've got Astros or something
that's<00:06:15.240> perfectly<00:06:15.840> fine<00:06:15.900> but<00:06:16.440> you're

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
that's perfectly fine but you're

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.250 
that's perfectly fine but you're
probably<00:06:17.160> going<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:17.400> get<00:06:17.550> crackling<00:06:18.000> or

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
probably going to get crackling or

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.750 
probably going to get crackling or
background<00:06:19.260> noise<00:06:19.440> so<00:06:20.100> if<00:06:20.220> you<00:06:20.310> do<00:06:20.460> really

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
background noise so if you do really

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.130 
background noise so if you do really
want<00:06:20.910> to<00:06:20.970> take<00:06:21.090> it<00:06:21.240> seriously<00:06:21.600> I<00:06:21.690> would<00:06:21.810> advise

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
want to take it seriously I would advise

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.560 
want to take it seriously I would advise
getting<00:06:22.320> a<00:06:22.470> decent<00:06:22.680> pc<00:06:23.160> mike<00:06:23.480> regarding<00:06:24.480> your

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
getting a decent pc mike regarding your

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.360 
getting a decent pc mike regarding your
pc<00:06:24.960> any<00:06:25.110> specifications<00:06:25.920> and<00:06:26.070> whatnot<00:06:26.340> that

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
pc any specifications and whatnot that

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.330 
pc any specifications and whatnot that
really<00:06:27.030> isn't<00:06:27.240> massively<00:06:27.990> importance<00:06:28.830> in<00:06:29.070> my

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
really isn't massively importance in my

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.720 
really isn't massively importance in my
opinion<00:06:29.640> and<00:06:30.410> an<00:06:31.410> average<00:06:31.590> pc<00:06:32.160> today<00:06:32.310> will<00:06:32.610> be

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
opinion and an average pc today will be

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.660 
opinion and an average pc today will be
fine<00:06:33.000> for<00:06:33.390> a<00:06:33.420> PVR<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.350> for<00:06:34.590> recording<00:06:35.580> and

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
fine for a PVR and for recording and

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.750 
fine for a PVR and for recording and
everything<00:06:36.090> like<00:06:36.240> that<00:06:36.300> but<00:06:37.130> the<00:06:38.130> render<00:06:38.550> time

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
everything like that but the render time

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.250 
everything like that but the render time
is<00:06:38.910> going<00:06:39.060> to<00:06:39.120> be<00:06:39.180> longer<00:06:39.540> depending<00:06:40.050> on<00:06:40.140> how

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
is going to be longer depending on how

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.570 
is going to be longer depending on how
good<00:06:40.410> your<00:06:40.560> pc<00:06:40.950> is<00:06:41.070> so<00:06:41.250> that's<00:06:41.400> all

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
good your pc is so that's all

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.710 
good your pc is so that's all
something<00:06:41.759> you<00:06:41.849> have<00:06:42.000> to<00:06:42.030> take<00:06:42.300> into<00:06:42.449> note

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
something you have to take into note

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.360 
something you have to take into note
because<00:06:42.900> you<00:06:43.590> obviously<00:06:43.680> can<00:06:43.979> have<00:06:44.069> to<00:06:44.189> render

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
because you obviously can have to render

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.950 
because you obviously can have to render
it<00:06:44.550> in<00:06:44.639> some<00:06:44.879> kind<00:06:45.120> of<00:06:45.180> editing<00:06:45.479> software

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
it in some kind of editing software

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.999 
it in some kind of editing software
because<00:06:46.319> you're<00:06:46.470> gonna<00:06:46.590> have<00:06:46.710> to<00:06:46.800> turn<00:06:46.979> down

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
because you're gonna have to turn down

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.749 
because you're gonna have to turn down
the<00:06:47.340> game<00:06:47.370> volume<00:06:47.699> and<00:06:48.120> all<00:06:48.240> that<00:06:48.419> but<00:06:49.759> the

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
the game volume and all that but the

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.279 
the game volume and all that but the
most<00:06:50.909> important<00:06:51.389> thing<00:06:51.449> to<00:06:51.810> take<00:06:52.229> into

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
most important thing to take into

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.469 
most important thing to take into
consideration<00:06:53.129> is<00:06:53.310> a<00:06:53.340> render<00:06:53.789> time<00:06:54.030> know<00:06:54.300> if

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
consideration is a render time know if

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.330 
consideration is a render time know if
you've<00:06:54.629> got<00:06:54.780> a<00:06:54.810> really<00:06:55.020> crappy<00:06:55.530> old<00:06:55.650> pc<00:06:56.129> then

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
you've got a really crappy old pc then

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.890 
you've got a really crappy old pc then
it's<00:06:56.490> going<00:06:56.639> to<00:06:56.699> take<00:06:56.939> absolute<00:06:57.449> age<00:06:57.629> to

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
it's going to take absolute age to

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.679 
it's going to take absolute age to
render<00:06:58.199> it<00:06:58.620> usually<00:06:58.979> take<00:06:59.189> to<00:06:59.219> me<00:06:59.520> around<00:07:00.210> 40

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:00.689 
render it usually take to me around 40

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:02.540 
render it usually take to me around 40
minutes<00:07:00.990> to<00:07:01.110> render<00:07:01.349> a<00:07:01.379> video<00:07:01.560> which<00:07:01.979> is<00:07:02.009> okay

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
minutes to render a video which is okay

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.959 
minutes to render a video which is okay
my<00:07:03.180> pc<00:07:03.389> isn't<00:07:03.780> that<00:07:03.900> great<00:07:04.139> but<00:07:04.409> um<00:07:04.969> that's

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969 
my pc isn't that great but um that's

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:08.450 
my pc isn't that great but um that's
really<00:07:06.389> is<00:07:07.199> generally<00:07:07.560> the<00:07:07.620> equipment<00:07:08.189> you<00:07:08.310> do

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
really is generally the equipment you do

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.300 
really is generally the equipment you do
need<00:07:08.669> obviously<00:07:08.879> an<00:07:09.569> xbox<00:07:10.189> wouldn't<00:07:11.189> go

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
need obviously an xbox wouldn't go

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.459 
need obviously an xbox wouldn't go
wouldn't<00:07:12.120> go<00:07:12.180> amiss<00:07:12.300> or<00:07:12.599> a<00:07:12.659> ps3<00:07:12.990> if<00:07:13.379> you

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:13.469 
wouldn't go amiss or a ps3 if you

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:16.459 
wouldn't go amiss or a ps3 if you
haven't<00:07:13.680> got<00:07:13.770> one<00:07:13.860> of<00:07:13.979> them<00:07:14.039> but<00:07:14.819> yeah<00:07:15.750> that's

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:16.469 
haven't got one of them but yeah that's

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.320 
haven't got one of them but yeah that's
that's<00:07:16.830> generally<00:07:17.520> the<00:07:17.550> equipment<00:07:18.120> you<00:07:18.180> need

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
that's generally the equipment you need

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.730 
that's generally the equipment you need
and<00:07:18.389> I<00:07:18.750> think<00:07:19.050> I<00:07:19.139> haven't<00:07:19.289> really<00:07:19.469> got<00:07:19.710> much

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 
and I think I haven't really got much

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.619 
and I think I haven't really got much
time<00:07:20.250> to<00:07:20.520> address<00:07:20.969> a<00:07:21.090> lot<00:07:21.300> of<00:07:21.419> other<00:07:21.539> things
