00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello very good to all family that such 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.120
 I'm try line this is going to be the tutorial 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.589
 definitive of eyes because I have been 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.660
 fixing I have like two or three 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.200
 eye tutorials and I say up to me 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.110
 same 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 I had a hard time finding the second or the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.369
 third I do not know I think I would swear that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.560
 I even have more but I have lost 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.420
 out there but good 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.390
 this is going to be the definitive tutorial 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.789
 here how are you going to see is going to gather everything 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.230
 what I have already given in a single video I do not know 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.820
 how long will it be I do not want 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.129
 either it's too heavy so it's going to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 be all pretty condensed if you're 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.440
 new in the channel you have not seen the others 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.050
 videos this is the first and only video 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 what you should and would need albert themes 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.620
 in the description of the video you have the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.659
 program that I use the tablet that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 I use the song that is in the background that 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.690
 well the song I imagine will be one of 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.790
 you're free from youtube so the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.409
 own ride give me for ass and you have 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.670
 my ID and my bank account up to what 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.830
 I have in the fridge in the description what 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.559
 you have everything there so you can look at it 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.930
 you can look so we do not start with 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.720
 eyes in front of agreement if you do not have 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.540
 that I'm going too fast a pace 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.430
 what should go is normal is the idea of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.890
 video let's start seeing the parts 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.600
 of the eye, I'm not going to put them too much 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 complicated because you do not need 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.750
 we are cartoonists or we want to be what 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.000
 we will be future cartoonists 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.189
 illustrators or whatever we do not need 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.570
 learn them nothing the anatomy the rules 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.100
 that you have to follow the advice 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.810
 that I am going to give you are quite simple 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.920
 to this day I keep doing these 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.600
 container types 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 these rectangles types of rectangles 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.070
 I always do not rectangles 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.960
 I do it in another way to locate it to the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.189
 position of the eye do not ever 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.619
 details 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.189
 if you have that eagerness to draw the eyes 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.850
 before I finished what I know about 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.530
 make the sketch of the hairstyle as well 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.420
 bad we 're going bad we 're going to go and take that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.189
 mania the sooner you will thank 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.740
 really these rectangles serve me 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.990
 to put the position and know that the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.390
 eye more or less walks around there is already the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.950
 separation of the eyes this other or this 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.479
 automatically does this itself that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.220
 true that they do not think is not drawn 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.170
 another eye does not draw another container in 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.600
 means to say the time which is the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.330
 separation in any case always 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.739
 try to throw a little more for the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.630
 sides to the separation being a bit 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.819
 greater before doing science more 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.160
 together it is preferable that it be separated 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.450
 to do the types of eyes this what 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.920
 let's see in examples but good 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.830
 we are always going to modify the form 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.180
 simple of the iris of the eyelid 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.799
 eyelashes I do not care anything 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.510
 even from the glitters make videos 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.819
 squares or make glitters that are more 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.319
 rounded ovals all that is going to 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.879
 change the type of the eye 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.249
 but always always it goes from 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.870
 a simple way to then start 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.609
 put the details in the tutorials 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.170
 old I said that you could modify 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.499
 the container to get eyes 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.939
 different and these yes and no if we modify 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.409
 the container that also passes 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.370
 we will modify what has been the 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.140
 distance from the eye 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.060
 this for in some cases is a 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.190
 problem more than a benefit because 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.200
 we can make a wrong separation or 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 place your eyes where they do not have to be 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.769
 square is easier to get it out 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.239
 to the eye anywhere as without 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.650
 deepen too much to tell you that these 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.810
 containers are not suitable for 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.989
 manga emotions much exaggerates 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.310
 emotions is stretched it stretches a lot what 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.860
 what is the eye and everything else 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.900
 so it is not used immediately is left 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.909
 of the limits and it would not fit us like this 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.319
 that apart from that most of the 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.620
 emotions the form is also modified 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.590
 of the face and it's one more topic to see in 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.299
 another part not here to draw the eyes 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.090
 in three quarters to draw it in a 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.400
 character that is in profile what 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.290
 let's do is the following we're going to 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.019
 continue with the same technique because we 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.209
 it comes perfectly in the case in this 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.370
 case let's draw this container 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.530
 ok let's continue with this same this 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.280
 same rectangle let's draw this 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.290
 eye imagine this this example 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.090
 at the time of making the eye that remains 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.260
 small one that is farthest left 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.300
 already in profile let's do it like this we're going to 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.209
 draw a few lines on the 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.890
 Main container if necessary 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.750
 that is, you are going to do this 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.239
 automatically but to learn this 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.880
 it's luxury if we separate them from this 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.200
 forms the eye that is farther away than 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.569
 it is smaller we will know 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.430
 exactly how it should look good 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.319
 means how the three quarters do not 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.760
 they are always the same and to put some 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.280
 as many examples we will see that if 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.260
 we use another kind of perspective a 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.790
 contrapicado in three quarters or a 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.440
 simply a contrapicado a chopped 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.070
 ok let's change the perspective of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.750
 the whole face this rule is not modified and 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.870
 we can apply it to any 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.160
 perspective in the old tutorials 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.810
 already said that the eye in profile if 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.150
 let's make making containers with 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.700
 its rectangles and all basically 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.110
 as we have been doing so far what 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.400
 we will also apply to the profile but there 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.650
 an easier way that is doing 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.260
 simply a triangle in most 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.600
 of the eyes by type of eye we always 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.430
 let's guide by eye type and it's going to 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.910
 be in quotes our container 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.680
 even though 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.630
 making that triangle what we will be 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.720
 doing is a simple form of the eye what 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.300
 that would come to be a sketch 12 had a 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.770
 scheme better said so let's 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.270
 change that let's remove the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.430
 containers when we go to do 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.080
 profile and we're going to put triangles 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.640
 basically to know where the eye is 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.340
 and in the case of the profile as we see 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.370
 some more details are like these 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.780
 if you are drawing an eye completely 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.240
 round we see that the profile case is 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.440
 turns into an oval but good is all 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.110
 this is a matter of 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.720
 perspective so without any surprise 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.580
 without any newness and little more the truth 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.740
 the profile I think is even more 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.150
 easy to do in front comfort 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.849
 mentally you have more chances of 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.009
 wrong in the profile 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.389
 of agreement and this is the novelty people 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.429
 I've seen the old tutorials 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.520
 is going to find this interesting or the 

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:43.559
 except I brought it interesting because there 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.330
 More than 200 types of eyes in which you 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:48.029
 you will be able to guide to catch 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.979
 references you'll be able to tell which eye 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:53.009
 I want to do basically you go to this 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:56.669
 video you go to examples and here you have 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.979
 More than 200 kinds of eyes choose this is a 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.449
 The letter basically not going to go 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.300
 commenting all I will be going 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.219
 more or less quickly my idea is that you go 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.349
 giving you pause the video so you have 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.569
 all the time enough to be able 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.369
 look at all the eyes that are in each 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.929
 moment but I do not want to stop 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:14.780
 talk about the 200 types of eyes 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:17.470
 because it is not the case 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.470
 So nothing 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.030
 but family I hope that the video has you 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.000
 liked that I have served you especially 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.710
 for the part of the examples os 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.450
 I would recommend that this video have it and 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.340
 always more or less by hand it's worth it 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.290
 you will always have more than 200 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.230
 examples of eyes that good that never 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.420
 the one that does not come badly because nothing else 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.750
 you can give like if you want until the 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.750
 next
