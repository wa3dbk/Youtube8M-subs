00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.850

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.670
Way back

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.070
when I was a graduate student at Yale
at the botany department

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.080
and had the chance of possibly working
at the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.720
Connecticut Agricultural 
Experiment Station

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.830
and for my PhD work

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.260
had been working on the
American Chestnut and hybrids

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.230
but if I was going to get a job at the
Experiment Station they wanted me to

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.090
work on another plant group

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.190
and I look at Rhododendron
and Holly, Azaleas

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.030
and there was a student in
the Forestry School

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.580
working on the ecology of Mountain Laurel
and it was like "DING"

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.720
The CT state flower, only seven species,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.500
Mountain Laurel which is one,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.380
and there hadn't been any reports
 of controlled crosses

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.380
chromosome count, you know a weren't many
scientific publications on Kalmia

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.400
Mount Laurel and its relatives.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.539
So that really was kinda the beginning.

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.369
And I collected all variations

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.289
different species and tried to make
crosses

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.390
among the species initially. And that
didn't work very well

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.829
But then I realized wow,

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.170
a lot of variation within Mount Laurel
but nobody had really focused on it.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.189
You know, there were nice plants that'd been found in the wild

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:49.840
or selected in gardens and arboreta.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.359
Part of what I did was pull it together
make crosses

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.229
and learn how different traits
were inherited.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.859
This is a selection selection that was made

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.190
over fifty years ago by Weston nurseries
in Massachusetts called "Silver Dollar."

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.670
And this is one, same size oversized
flower

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.840
but it's "Show Time."

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.080
It's a new introduction, not yet
available but we're excited about it,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.180
because of large rich colored flower.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.430
Nice foliage, doesn't appear 
to get leaf spot

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.400
or is quite resistant to leaf spot.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.590
Okay now we have

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.390
silver dollar in my left hand and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.680
what we'd call wild-type or the native
Mount Laurel my right hand

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.870
and "Showtime" but bright pink.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.370
This was from a cross I made 
in 1986

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.630
so, twenty-some years old.  
And most of these plants in here...

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.690
we planted.  The oldest ones 
might even be

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.100
forty-years-old.  There were a few
native Mount Laurel in here.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.450
They love bright light...

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.870
in New England they
can be grown in full Sun.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.740
People think of them as shade tolerant...
they're gonna get leggy

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.920
and not flower as well in shade.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.190
So the plants like to see

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.110
half a days sun or the equivelant. 
This is a nice white,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.830
"Snowdrift" real nice white.  A few of the
flowers are beginning to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.220
to go by and the rain we had last night
and the night before

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.220
doesn't improve the flowers. They're still
looking good.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.300
Offscreen "How long do they flower for? About?"

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.620
Well the buds are pretty attractive,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.580
two to three weeks that range.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.400
Most woody plants and shrubs don't
have a real long flowering period.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.630
Just the facts of life, whether

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.940
crab apple or dogwood tree

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.940
rhododendron or Mountain Laurel.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.370
Some good companion plants... 
I have a hard time with this because

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.670
there are so many possibilities, but

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.750
we're looking at some blueberries or
huckleberries right here,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.610
rhododendrons , azaleas

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.169
some are native deciduous azaleas

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.310
Oakleaf hydrangea

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.509
all would be good companion plants.

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.629
We have three plants that I've named and
 introduced with this sort of flower

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.169
One them is "Keepsake," "Heart's Desire,"

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.400
and "Kaleidoscope."  And what we did,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.000
we crossed what we call a
red-budded Mountain Laurel

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.810
with one that has this

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.779
cinnamon -maroon band on the inside... went
through a couple generations

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:08.779
and selected this plant and and the
others that I just mentioned.

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.259
It's  quite different than

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:19.259
any Mountain Laurel you might
bump into out in the wild.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.160
