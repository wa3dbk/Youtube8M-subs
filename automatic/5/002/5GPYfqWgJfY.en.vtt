00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.510 
back and cut all the way down the body
cavity<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.680> flap<00:01:02.010> open<00:01:02.370> right

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
cavity so you get this flap open right

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.600 
cavity so you get this flap open right
here<00:01:05.270> just<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.390> that

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
here just like that

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.390 
here just like that
now<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> flip<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> fish<00:01:09.240> around<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
now you flip the fish around and so you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
now you flip the fish around and so you
have<00:01:11.580> fin<00:01:11.820> raised<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:12.990> bones

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
have fin raised here which are all bones

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.260 
have fin raised here which are all bones
and<00:01:13.770> pretty<00:01:14.430> much<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> fillet<00:01:15.090> knife

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and pretty much with the fillet knife

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.460 
and pretty much with the fillet knife
you're<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> skim<00:01:15.869> along<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> fin

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you're going to skim along the fin

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.649 
you're going to skim along the fin
raised<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:18.270> here

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
raised so you go from the back here

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.530 
raised so you go from the back here
where<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> made<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.890> first<00:01:20.040> incision<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
where you made your first incision you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.480 
where you made your first incision you
feel<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> bone<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.070> tilting

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
feel for the bone and now you're tilting

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.120 
feel for the bone and now you're tilting
the<00:01:23.610> knife<00:01:23.759> down<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.360> pressing<00:01:24.689> down<00:01:25.130> like

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the knife down so I'm pressing down like

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.490 
the knife down so I'm pressing down like
this<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.030> tilting<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:28.140> bending

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
this and it's tilting it's it's bending

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.490 
this and it's tilting it's it's bending
the<00:01:28.770> blade<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> scrape<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.960> meat

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the blade so that I scrape all the meat

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.460 
the blade so that I scrape all the meat
off<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> bones<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.140> down<00:01:34.290> like

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
off the bones and you just go down like

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.440 
off the bones and you just go down like
this<00:01:34.650> along<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> fin<00:01:35.490> raised<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.210> can

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this along the fin raised so you can

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.929 
this along the fin raised so you can
kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.750> feel<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.320> fin<00:01:37.740> raise<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.400> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
kind of feel the fin raise here and it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.959 
kind of feel the fin raise here and it's
scraping<00:01:39.540> along<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.660 

all<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.270> way<00:01:47.359> down<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.869> fin<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.670> caudal

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
all the way down to fin the caudal

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.240 
all the way down to fin the caudal
peduncle<00:01:49.759> which<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:50.719> thing<00:01:50.780> right<00:01:51.229> here

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.910 

okay<00:01:55.250> once<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:55.820> do<00:01:55.939> that<00:01:56.079> you<00:01:57.079> can<00:01:57.200> see<00:01:57.469> the

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
okay once you do that you can see the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.889 
okay once you do that you can see the
fin<00:01:58.159> ray<00:01:58.310> bones<00:01:58.520> right<00:01:58.759> here<00:01:58.789> they<00:01:59.509> actually

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
fin ray bones right here they actually

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.319 
fin ray bones right here they actually
you<00:02:00.109> could<00:02:00.259> feel<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.520> it's<00:02:01.670> literally<00:02:01.939> you're

bending down like that and you're

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.309 
bending down like that and you're
scraping<00:02:04.159> along<00:02:04.719> to<00:02:05.719> try<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.929> get<00:02:06.079> as<00:02:06.140> much

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
scraping along to try to get as much

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.440 
scraping along to try to get as much
meat<00:02:06.590> off<00:02:06.740> as<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:06.979> can<00:02:07.189> so<00:02:07.789> now<00:02:08.179> there's<00:02:08.390> two

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
meat off as you can so now there's two

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.900 
meat off as you can so now there's two
methods<00:02:08.929> now<00:02:09.080> some<00:02:09.560> fish<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:09.890> could<00:02:10.039> do<00:02:10.190> one

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
methods now some fish you could do one

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
methods now some fish you could do one
method<00:02:11.209> some<00:02:11.360> fish<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.599> could<00:02:11.720> do<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.900> other

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
method some fish you could do the other

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.270 
method some fish you could do the other
one<00:02:12.590> method<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.069> go<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.549> here<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
one method is to go in here and just you

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.680 
one method is to go in here and just you
could<00:02:16.370> hear<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.730> knife<00:02:16.940> scraping<00:02:17.329> along<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
could hear the knife scraping along the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.970 
could hear the knife scraping along the
bone<00:02:17.840> you're<00:02:18.019> pressing<00:02:18.230> down<00:02:18.380> with<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.799> knife

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
bone you're pressing down with the knife

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.270 
bone you're pressing down with the knife
so<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:20.000> bends<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.650> you're<00:02:21.650> going<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.069> and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
so it bends and you're going in and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.809 
so it bends and you're going in and
slowly<00:02:22.910> cutting<00:02:23.360> meat<00:02:23.540> like<00:02:24.079> this<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.730> you

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
slowly cutting meat like this and you

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.280 
slowly cutting meat like this and you
can<00:02:25.940> see<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.209> meats<00:02:26.420> like<00:02:26.510> slowly<00:02:26.930> coming

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
can see the meats like slowly coming

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.800 
can see the meats like slowly coming
away<00:02:27.500> from<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.769> bone<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:29.180> other<00:02:29.329> method<00:02:29.720> is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
away from the bone the other method is

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.539 
away from the bone the other method is
to<00:02:29.989> go<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:32.140> with<00:02:33.140> your<00:02:33.230> fillet<00:02:33.500> knife<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
to go in with your fillet knife to the

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.490 
to go in with your fillet knife to the
backbone<00:02:35.000> over<00:02:35.209> here<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:35.900> go<00:02:36.110> in<00:02:36.290> your

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
backbone over here so you go in your

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.949 
backbone over here so you go in your
first<00:02:36.739> incision<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.599> feel<00:02:38.810> that

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
first incision and you feel that

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.720 
first incision and you feel that
backbone<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.560> then<00:02:40.190> now<00:02:40.310> you're<00:02:40.489> bending

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
backbone and then now you're bending

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.100 
backbone and then now you're bending
your<00:02:40.940> play<00:02:41.150> knife<00:02:41.329> again<00:02:41.599> you<00:02:41.750> can<00:02:41.870> see<00:02:41.989> my

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
your play knife again you can see my

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.839 
your play knife again you can see my
hand<00:02:42.349> pressing<00:02:42.799> down<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.310> see<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.610> nice

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
hand pressing down you see this nice

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.940 
hand pressing down you see this nice
Bend<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.750> here's<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.379> blade<00:02:45.590> straight

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
Bend so here's the the blade straight

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.300 
Bend so here's the the blade straight
and<00:02:46.540> here's<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.690> bend<00:02:47.930> look<00:02:48.440> at<00:02:48.560> my<00:02:48.709> hand<00:02:48.980> here

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
and here's the bend look at my hand here

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.699 
and here's the bend look at my hand here
and<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:50.450> really<00:02:50.720> pushes<00:02:51.019> hard<00:02:51.350> against<00:02:51.560> the

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
and that really pushes hard against the

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.620 
and that really pushes hard against the
bone<00:02:51.889> so<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.280> don't<00:02:52.430> cut<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:52.639> bone<00:02:52.910> but<00:02:53.510> you

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
bone so you don't cut the bone but you

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.319 
bone so you don't cut the bone but you
cut<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.959> meat<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.519> now<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.730> just<00:02:58.850> hold<00:02:59.209> your

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
cut the meat so now you just hold your

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:11.820 
cut the meat so now you just hold your
fish<00:02:59.569> and<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.200> go<00:03:00.350> along<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.769> backbone

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.170 

again<00:03:12.520> get<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:12.880> bend<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.300> there

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.250 

and<00:03:17.750> then<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:18.140> go<00:03:18.290> all<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.590> way<00:03:18.860> through

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
and then just go all the way through

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.080 
and then just go all the way through
pressing<00:03:21.260> firmly<00:03:21.650> down<00:03:22.189> on<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.549> fish<00:03:22.790> with

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
pressing firmly down on the fish with

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.970 
pressing firmly down on the fish with
the<00:03:23.180> knife

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
the knife

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.750 
the knife
keep<00:03:24.980> pressing<00:03:25.450> go<00:03:26.450> all<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.810> way<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.140> tail

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
keep pressing go all the way to the tail

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.720 
keep pressing go all the way to the tail
just<00:03:28.760> like<00:03:28.909> that<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.829> then<00:03:30.829> now<00:03:31.040> here's<00:03:31.579> an

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
just like that and then now here's an

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.460 
just like that and then now here's an
interesting<00:03:31.879> part<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:32.599> there's<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.840> ribcage<00:03:33.110> on

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
interesting part so there's a ribcage on

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.420 
interesting part so there's a ribcage on
a<00:03:33.530> lot<00:03:33.709> of<00:03:33.799> fish<00:03:33.980> right<00:03:34.099> here

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
a lot of fish right here

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.970 
a lot of fish right here
if<00:03:34.549> you<00:03:35.030> cut<00:03:35.329> into<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> ribcage<00:03:36.019> there's<00:03:36.709> all

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
if you cut into the ribcage there's all

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.830 
if you cut into the ribcage there's all
bones<00:03:37.250> here<00:03:37.519> you'll<00:03:37.670> get<00:03:37.790> bones<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.269> here<00:03:38.450> but

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
bones here you'll get bones in here but

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.020 
bones here you'll get bones in here but
if<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.019> cut<00:03:39.170> over<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.620> ribcage<00:03:39.859> you<00:03:40.849> won't

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
if you cut over the ribcage you won't

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.580 
if you cut over the ribcage you won't
get<00:03:41.150> any<00:03:41.269> bones<00:03:41.540> but<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.019> will<00:03:42.170> lose<00:03:42.379> a<00:03:42.409> little

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
get any bones but you will lose a little

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.399 
get any bones but you will lose a little
bit<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.799> meat<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:44.269> I'd<00:03:44.629> rather<00:03:44.780> lose<00:03:45.079> a<00:03:45.109> little

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
bit of meat so I'd rather lose a little

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.710 
bit of meat so I'd rather lose a little
bit<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.680> meat<00:03:45.829> than<00:03:45.980> have<00:03:46.129> bones<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.549> my<00:03:46.670> fly<00:03:46.939> so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
bit of meat than have bones in my fly so

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.920 
bit of meat than have bones in my fly so
then<00:03:47.870> I'll<00:03:47.989> just<00:03:48.200> cut<00:03:48.769> along<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.190> ribcage

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.500 

like<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.409> you<00:03:57.769> get<00:03:57.920> your<00:03:58.010> fillet<00:03:58.359> okay

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
like so and you get your fillet okay

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.490 
like so and you get your fillet okay
this<00:03:59.659> fly<00:03:59.870> has<00:03:59.900> no<00:04:00.230> bones<00:04:00.379> in<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:02.030> now<00:04:02.930> what

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
this fly has no bones in it and now what

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.250 
this fly has no bones in it and now what

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
I'm going to show you is how to take the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.410 
I'm going to show you is how to take the
skin<00:04:06.650> off<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.099> you<00:04:07.549> want<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.760> remove<00:04:07.939> the<00:04:08.150> skin

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.300 
skin off so you want to remove the skin
from<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.750> fish<00:04:08.959> you<00:04:09.650> don't<00:04:09.799> have<00:04:09.889> to<00:04:10.010> scale<00:04:10.280> it

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
from the fish you don't have to scale it

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.830
