 wizard fighting against hordes of monsters 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.519
 bizarre ways to save your own life 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.559
 You start the story as a prisoner. 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.170
 of a mighty magician named mages air and 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.809
 in his cell finds a demon in shape 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.390
 book called lyon that not only 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.850
 conversation with you but also able to 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.750
 to revive the various battles 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.210
 magician while reading your pages I do 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.920
 this journey through the villain's past 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.350
 Can you develop your 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.369
 magic skills to take a chance 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.369
 to break free 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.450
 each chapter of the book represents a 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.330
 different mission and they are always 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.700
 closed arenas where you 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.130
 must battle against several monsters and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.380
 collect items 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.300
 there are also several side quests but 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.970
 they never run away from the same formula of 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.680
 battles in arenas and therefore end up 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.680
 making it a bit repetitive 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.570
 but advancing through the missions you are 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.659
 often rewarded with 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.240
 confrontations against bosses who 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.159
 require all your skills and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.330
 various different strategies for 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.330
 be defeated 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.050
 and it is by destroying your enemies that 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.270
 one of the main mechanisms of the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.730
 game because you can choose between 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.060
 save or sacrifice the souls of your 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.190
 enemies by sacrificing them you can 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.280
 earn permanent attack bonus for 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.380
 your magic skills while saving 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.020
 a monster can bring improvements to 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.940
 your life bar 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.830
 this is a very innovative system that 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.870
 allows you to evolve your character from a 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.240
 way different from the view in rpg 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.459
 traditional and there is still 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.100
 possibility for you to save the bosses 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.110
 so that they return to the human form and 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.740
 accompanies you on the journey helping 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.740
 in battles 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.720
 to invoke the great variety of 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.850
 spells and weapons your hero 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.370
 uses items that have a specific 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.440
 number of uses and so it is necessary to 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.940
 also explore the arenas to acquire 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.790
 new skills 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.550
 in addition there are the black rights but 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.620
 incredibly powerful days but 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.990
 charge a high price for your character 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.709
 causing negative effects such as 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.810
 reduction in defense by half to 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.850
 recover from these effects 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.040
 you must use the vita touch screen 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.040
 to collect tears that fall from the lyon 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.020
 however they are very rare causing 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.700
 you have to use the black rights of 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.700
 strategic ways 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.890
 You can still fight 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.570
 online with the help of three more friends 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.670
 but only on specific missions 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.640
 called avalon pecs 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.860
 in these games the system of sacrifices 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.200
 has gained a new function that makes it 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.350
 more interesting since you can 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.900
 save fallen allies or sacrifice 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.900
 to release a powerful magic attack 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.510
 soul sacrifice is a rpg that counts on 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.489
 original ideas challenging bosses and 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.069
 a combat system that will keep the 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.200
 owners of a ps vita involved in their 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.510
 battles and an advantage for 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.230
 is that the game still counts on 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.230
 Portuguese subtitles 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.699
