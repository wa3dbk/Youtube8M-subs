00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Intel's newest enthusiast platform 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.640
 is there 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 owns the high end platform of intel 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.099
 as many innovations as in years 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.000
 no more 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.670
 however, in 2011 ikea wants three processors 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.740
 iks 99 mainboards and ddr4 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.990
 memory in this video look 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.750
 we have the smallest one in parenthesis 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.730
 really processor i7 58 20 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.410
 closer to the new herbstware the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.039
 platform what is behind it 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.500
 with health offers intel for desktop pcs 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 first eight cores 16 threads and ddr4 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.130
 support both relies on a new one 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.750
 socket as well as new chipsets the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.820
 Enthusiast platform is thus the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.320
 best of the best and offers as usual 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.879
 the best professors as well 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.410
 Memory Support Keyword 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.149
 to chat despite the many innovations 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.050
 one thing stays the same and that is the one 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.020
 quite high price 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.090
 altogether 3 sv ii cpu were on the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.570
 Mass market let loose with optional 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.230
 six or eight cores of the i7 58 20 km 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.690
 has the cheapest lga2011 au 3 cpu 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.899
 six cores under twelve threads 15 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 megabyte cache 33 ghz standard clock and 3 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.830
 6 ghz clock are added only 28 pci 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.200
 express it a little less than the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.939
 bigger models but still more 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.600
 as the 16 lanes the mainstream 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.060
 platform haswell refresh the i7 58 20 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.299
 based on the 22 nanometer production 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.490
 has a tdp of 140 watts and the lga 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.689
 2011 v3 socket 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 even if the number of pins and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.909
 contacts are equal are the hessen-cdu 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 it is not compatible with the older x79 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.450
 platform what is really behind in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.280
 titz smallest has really processor 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.079
 and whether the price is justified 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.490
 That's what we'll see in detail now 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.490
 Let's go 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.150
 with a purchase price of 350 euro 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.070
 the smallest hesse marks the entry 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.630
 into the new iks 99 platform 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.580
 biggest plus point is the reduced 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.880
 power consumption the same power 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.700
 like the previous flagship 749 60x 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.290
 and all for 500 euros less 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.670
 sounds like a first moment 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.770
 bargain turns out to be 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.020
 second look as expensive fun 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.630
 the high cost for 699 mainboard and 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.940
 ddr4 memory also do it with the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.800
 smallest cpu at an expensive platform 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.900
 who primarily only performance 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.990
 The quad also needs to be played 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.120
 core platform hessel refresh the 58 20 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.280
 his mother plays only with applications 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.380
 such as extremely elaborate and 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.390
 highly complex video cut out of it 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.760
 should it have been more videos 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.989
 to the topic has really following short and 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.760
 if you do not miss this one 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.230
 then you want to click again 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.090
 Subscribe then I thank you right 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.440
 Sincerely for watching if that 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.940
 video has liked the video gives 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.890
 a thumbs up thought and 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.660
 Impressions fit as always well in the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.050
 Comment section until the next video 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.050
 Zschau
