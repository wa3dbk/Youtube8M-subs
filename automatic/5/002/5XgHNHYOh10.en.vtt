00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.930 

you'll<00:00:30.690> need<00:00:30.870> one<00:00:31.110> of<00:00:31.290> your<00:00:31.470> lights<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:32.820> you

you'll need one of your lights and you

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
you'll need one of your lights and you
need<00:00:33.150> it<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.330> be<00:00:33.360> pretty<00:00:35.870> solid<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.350> light

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
need it to be pretty solid for the light

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740 
need it to be pretty solid for the light
because<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.460> pattern<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> other

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
because the pattern will be on the other

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.180 
because the pattern will be on the other
ones<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.650> you<00:00:40.770> actually

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
ones and that's the one you actually

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.220 
ones and that's the one you actually
will<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.210> pattern<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.720> make<00:00:42.900> it<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
will see the pattern and make it and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.540 
will see the pattern and make it and
you'll<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.650> that<00:00:43.920> once<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> zigzag<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
you'll know that once the zigzag so you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
you'll know that once the zigzag so you
are<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> put<00:00:48.330> it<00:00:48.620> right<00:00:49.620> sides<00:00:49.950> together

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
are going to put it right sides together

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.240 
are going to put it right sides together
so<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.080> the<00:00:52.200> print<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.739> side<00:00:52.950> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so you have the print on this side and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
so you have the print on this side and
then<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.580> whites<00:00:53.790> just<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.809> really

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
then the whites just there's not really

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.630 
then the whites just there's not really
brighter<00:00:55.950> wrong<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:57.600> line<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.580> and<00:00:59.580> then

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
brighter wrong and line it up and then

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.630 
brighter wrong and line it up and then
you<00:01:00.600> are<00:01:00.720> going<00:01:00.900> to<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.140> 1/4<00:01:01.350> inch<00:01:01.920> seam<00:01:02.190> all

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you are going to do 1/4 inch seam all

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.070 
you are going to do 1/4 inch seam all
the<00:01:02.700> way<00:01:02.940> around<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.690> take<00:01:03.810> it<00:01:03.960> down

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the way around which will take it down

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.420 
the way around which will take it down
half<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.440> inch<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> actually<00:01:05.220> will<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
half an inch so it actually will be a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.969 
half an inch so it actually will be a
nine<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> half<00:01:06.060> inch<00:01:06.270> square<00:01:06.630> its<00:01:07.440> own<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
nine and a half inch square its own and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.940 
nine and a half inch square its own and
it<00:01:08.490> ends<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.790> being<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.180> 13<00:01:10.050> inch<00:01:10.380> Chevron

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it ends up being like a 13 inch Chevron

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
it ends up being like a 13 inch Chevron
I<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.700> kind<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> play<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:13.080> sizes

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I think so kind of play with your sizes

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.190 
I think so kind of play with your sizes
I<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.250> care<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.690> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
I don't really care because I can you
add<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.410> border<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.040> need<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.399> whatever

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
add a border if I need to or whatever

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.670 
add a border if I need to or whatever
for<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> quilt<00:01:18.300> I'm<00:01:18.479> making<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:22.410> I'm

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
quilts you don't really have to back

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.040 
quilts you don't really have to back
stitch<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:24.780> worry<00:01:24.930> about

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
Flex I can trim those up and square them

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:24.890 
Flex I can trim those up and square them
off<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.120> way<00:05:24.180> whenever<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:24.690> sew<00:05:24.840> it

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
off that way whenever you sew it

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.580 
off that way whenever you sew it
together<00:05:26.300> they'll<00:05:27.300> match<00:05:27.660> up<00:05:27.900> better<00:05:28.050> but<00:05:28.560> for

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
together they'll match up better but for

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.670 
together they'll match up better but for
now<00:05:28.919> we'll<00:05:29.250> just<00:05:29.280> make<00:05:29.669> them<00:05:29.850> fit<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:31.470> just

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
now we'll just make them fit and just

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.410 
now we'll just make them fit and just
know<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:31.830> those<00:05:32.130> will<00:05:32.310> be<00:05:32.400> cut<00:05:32.580> off

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.740 

so<00:05:35.810> there's<00:05:36.020> your<00:05:36.170> point<00:05:36.350> of<00:05:36.500> your<00:05:36.560> Schiavone

so there's your point of your Schiavone
actually<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:38.780> point<00:05:39.050> pull<00:05:39.260> it<00:05:39.380> over<00:05:39.440> because<00:05:39.680> I

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
actually I point pull it over because I

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.170 
actually I point pull it over because I
have<00:05:39.920> that<00:05:40.070> other<00:05:40.160> piece<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.610> can<00:05:40.670> put<00:05:40.880> next<00:05:41.060> to

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
have that other piece I can put next to

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.540 
have that other piece I can put next to
it

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.010

offset you want your whites on the

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:58.450 
offset you want your whites on the
inside

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.310 

so<00:05:59.030> they're<00:05:59.240> you<00:05:59.300> know<00:05:59.360> there's<00:05:59.660> one<00:05:59.840> ship<00:06:00.140> on

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
and then I have this green already done

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.530 
and then I have this green already done
as<00:06:03.110> well<00:06:03.340> I'll<00:06:04.340> put<00:06:04.550> it<00:06:04.670> next<00:06:04.700> to<00:06:05.060> it<00:06:05.330> so<00:06:05.480> you

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
way I know for sure that's so and then

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.480 
way I know for sure that's so and then
you<00:06:41.620> sew<00:06:41.800> it<00:06:41.860> together<00:06:41.979> now

you sew it together now

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.890 
you sew it together now

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
probably mix lineup like good this will

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.600 
probably mix lineup like good this will
be<00:06:46.810> like<00:06:46.990> four<00:06:47.379> different<00:06:47.560> greens<00:06:48.069> and<00:06:48.430> four
