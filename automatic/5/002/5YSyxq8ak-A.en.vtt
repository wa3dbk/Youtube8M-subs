sure enough you wouldn't net no one

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.820 
sure enough you wouldn't net no one
would<00:02:35.330> ever<00:02:35.360> walk<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:36.020> know<00:02:36.050> walk<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.590> and

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
would ever walk you know walk in and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.470 
would ever walk you know walk in and
look<00:02:36.980> at<00:02:37.130> this<00:02:37.310> guy<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.790> think<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.300> is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
look at this guy and think that this is

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.770 
look at this guy and think that this is
a<00:02:38.510> factory<00:02:39.110> because<00:02:39.910> yeah<00:02:40.910> it's<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.360> Medicom

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
a factory because yeah it's the Medicom

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.940 
a factory because yeah it's the Medicom
is<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.960> much<00:02:42.230> smaller<00:02:42.650> figure<00:02:44.080> but<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.440> found

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
is a much smaller figure but I found

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.220 
is a much smaller figure but I found
that<00:02:46.160> if<00:02:46.490> you<00:02:46.990> were<00:02:47.990> really<00:02:48.020> careful<00:02:48.770> with

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
that if you were really careful with

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.900 
that if you were really careful with
remounting<00:02:51.230> because<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.310> basically<00:02:52.490> what<00:02:52.880> I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
remounting because I basically what I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.510 
remounting because I basically what I
did<00:02:53.000> was<00:02:53.120> like<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.770> separated<00:02:54.770> all<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.010> Medicom

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
did was like I separated all the Medicom

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.970 
did was like I separated all the Medicom
armor<00:02:55.940> from<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.210> bodysuit<00:02:56.710> basically<00:02:57.710> had<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
armor from the bodysuit basically had to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.850 
armor from the bodysuit basically had to
destroy<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.700> costume<00:02:59.240> um<00:02:59.750> but<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.500> was<00:03:00.680> able

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
destroy that costume um but I was able

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.600 
destroy that costume um but I was able
to<00:03:01.010> salvage<00:03:01.220> all<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.310> just<00:03:04.460> got

but I think it just looks way better and

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.090 
but I think it just looks way better and
it<00:04:40.030> doesn't<00:04:40.330> attract<00:04:40.690> all<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.080> lint<00:04:41.320> like<00:04:41.950> the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
it doesn't attract all the lint like the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.970 
it doesn't attract all the lint like the
original<00:04:42.520> hot<00:04:42.700> toys<00:04:43.170> rubber<00:04:44.170> bodysuit<00:04:44.740> did

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
and this will just last much longer also

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.610 
and this will just last much longer also
which<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.850> really<00:04:49.090> cool<00:04:49.270> about<00:04:49.300> this<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.870> it's

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
which is really cool about this is it's

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.630

another custom I worked on recently I'm

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.930 
another custom I worked on recently I'm
pretty<00:05:36.850> proud<00:05:37.090> of<00:05:37.150> it<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:39.070> I'm<00:05:39.280> not<00:05:39.460> much<00:05:39.640> of<00:05:39.669> a

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
pretty proud of it and I'm not much of a

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.800 
pretty proud of it and I'm not much of a
Batman<00:05:40.600> fan<00:05:40.630> at<00:05:41.020> all<00:05:41.169> but<00:05:41.520> but<00:05:42.520> uh<00:05:42.810> obviously

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
Batman fan at all but but uh obviously

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.490 
Batman fan at all but but uh obviously
the<00:05:43.960> costume<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:44.500> pretty<00:05:44.740> pretty<00:05:45.040> cool<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:46.630> I

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
the costume is pretty pretty cool and I

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.080 
the costume is pretty pretty cool and I
think<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:48.010> just<00:05:48.130> works<00:05:48.370> much<00:05:48.610> better<00:05:48.850> this<00:05:49.000> way

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
think it just works much better this way

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.780 
think it just works much better this way
too<00:05:49.360> bad<00:05:49.540> hot<00:05:50.169> toys<00:05:50.470> didn't<00:05:50.770> just<00:05:51.280> originally

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
too bad hot toys didn't just originally

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.870 
too bad hot toys didn't just originally
make<00:05:51.940> this<00:05:52.090> costume<00:05:52.540> this<00:05:52.750> way<00:05:52.930> in<00:05:53.169> my<00:05:53.320> opinion

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
make this costume this way in my opinion

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.340 
make this costume this way in my opinion
because<00:05:54.880> this<00:05:55.419> will<00:05:55.570> just<00:05:55.720> last<00:05:55.930> way<00:05:56.320> longer

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
because this will just last way longer

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.340 
because this will just last way longer
than<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.640> original<00:05:57.940> rubber<00:05:58.419> suit<00:05:58.720> version<00:05:59.260> of

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
than the original rubber suit version of

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.990 
than the original rubber suit version of
this<00:05:59.500> so<00:05:59.680> hope<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:00.640> liked<00:06:00.790> it

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000
