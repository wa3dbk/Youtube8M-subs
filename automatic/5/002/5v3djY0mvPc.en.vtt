00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.020
 and you 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.940
 hello friends how are we good 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:16.150
 Sometimes I bring the revised unboxing of 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:22.880
 this bomber of this bracelet for iphone 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:25.370
 55 s and maybe iphone 6 had been 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.530
 I ordered this bracelet because it was made to me 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.500
 interesting good this bumper bracelet 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.260
 this bomber bracelet because what is going 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.380
 to repeat is a bracelet here you already have 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.620
 A bracelet 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.940
 Pretty father but it's also a bumper 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:48.940
 on the page said it worked for 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.850
 iphone 6 iphone 5 5 s 6 and 6 close sale 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.800
 reading a little bit because the case if 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.000
 we can see here nothing else says that it is 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.120
 5 and 5 s trying to read a bit and from 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.680
 investigate see here nothing else says that 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:11.110
 is 5 and 5 s effectively investigating 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.570
 The bracelet is not as flexible 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.850
 thinks that it can damage even the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.770
 device that is most advisable 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.890
 put it on the iphone 55 that and maybe 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.530
 it would look good on an iphone 6 comes out but 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.430
 you can see we put the bracelet here 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.960
 has its tickets for the speakers that 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.150
 is for the microphone that's a 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.710
 problem a very serious problem but 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.440
 well come out let's try 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.780
 here you find everything perfectly 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.610
 buttons perfectly and good you can see 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.590
 A) Yes 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.470
 and you mount and I bet nothing more than as 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.480
 that I feel that bothers you a lot would be 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.290
 throw everything a little more back 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.290
 but hey this is one of those things that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.470
 They are multifunctional and good friends in 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.290
 it really looks pretty father but like 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.160
 protector I really would not recommend it 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.530
 so much I repeat it again 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.870
 it gets to clog it does not look so aesthetic 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.940
 as in the images but then of all 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.580
 forms I leave the link in the description 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.070
 of the video in case you get to like it comes out 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.220
 You can see that on an iPhone 5 and 5 that is 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.680
 more or less complicated to put it and good 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.440
 in larger devices would come 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.020
 being much more complicated it comes out 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.530
 we put back 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.050
 here is supposed to be left but 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.510
 I'll have you tell you I do not know I do not like it 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.880
 make the device look like this 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.000
 because I do not know I feel that it does not look so 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.950
 so so aesthetic but good friends buzz 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.350
 as always this can be yours at 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.520
 only we need is to reach 200 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.410
 likes look said here is stage a 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.240
 little to the camera but we can do it 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.820
 forward and ready it does not pass 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.560
 absolutely nothing ok 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.170
 but now we have the problem 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.550
 that he comes to cover he said excuse 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.590
 that you get used to her 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.230
 we throw very close to the cover almost 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.510
 we give them forward covers the screen 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.860
 I tell you it's kind of weird but good 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.750
 thing that you 're getting used to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.520
 she and if you like it then it can be good 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.520

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.530
 already left came to reach 150 álex 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.170
