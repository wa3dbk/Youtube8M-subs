and<00:00:43.579> it's<00:00:44.579> exactly<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.379> if<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.890> drop<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.600> in

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and it's exactly that if you drop it in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
and it's exactly that if you drop it in
a<00:00:48.719> fight<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.590> ever<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> fight<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
in photon that would be kind of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
in photon that would be kind of
ridiculous<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.440> you're<00:00:55.590> ever<00:00:55.739> nothing<00:00:56.100> to

ridiculous if you're ever nothing to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.380 
ridiculous if you're ever nothing to
fight<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.489> more<00:00:56.640> fun<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> tried<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
fight with more fun if you tried to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
fight with more fun if you tried to
suicide<00:00:57.570> drop<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> open<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.410> close<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
suicide drop it open and close it and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.660 
suicide drop it open and close it and
you<00:00:59.250> dropped<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.670> you're<00:01:00.059> done

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
you dropped it you're done

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.179 
you dropped it you're done
flashy<00:01:02.690> there's<00:01:03.690> no<00:01:03.989> reason<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> aside

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
flashy there's no reason to do it aside

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.370 
flashy there's no reason to do it aside
from<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.299> quick<00:01:06.600> I'll<00:01:07.049> give<00:01:07.200> them<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
from one it's quick I'll give them that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
from one it's quick I'll give them that
it's<00:01:07.830> quicker<00:01:08.040> than<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> horizontal<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it's quicker than the horizontal and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.039 
it's quicker than the horizontal and
vertical<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> correctly<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:12.049> let

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
vertical when you do it correctly so let

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.560 
vertical when you do it correctly so let
me<00:01:13.140> teach<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.799> let<00:01:13.979> me<00:01:14.010> show<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> first

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.700 

and<00:01:17.960> though<00:01:19.690> this<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.840> tough<00:01:21.050> trick<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.500> get

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
and though this is a tough trick to get

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.660 
and though this is a tough trick to get
and<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.430> still<00:01:22.850> mess<00:01:23.060> up<00:01:23.090> on<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:24.580> decent<00:01:25.580> amount

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
and I still mess up on a decent amount

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.970 
and I still mess up on a decent amount
um<00:01:26.080> you're<00:01:27.080> going<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.230> want<00:01:27.440> start<00:01:27.710> with<00:01:27.890> the

it falls gravity takes a hold knife
comes<00:01:53.030> down<00:01:53.240> like<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.630> they<00:01:54.440> hit<00:01:54.619> together

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
comes down like that they hit together

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.190 
comes down like that they hit together
on<00:01:55.700> downward<00:01:56.210> angle<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.630> nice<00:01:56.780> going<00:01:57.050> down

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
on downward angle the nice going down

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.700 
on downward angle the nice going down
and<00:01:57.880> catch<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.030> arms<00:01:59.210> right<00:01:59.360> now<00:01:59.410> it's<00:02:00.410> tough

and catch the arms right now it's tough
trick<00:02:01.090> really<00:02:02.090> tough<00:02:02.270> trick<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.570> learn<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:03.020> I

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
trick really tough trick to learn and I

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.219 
trick really tough trick to learn and I
recommend<00:02:04.369> if<00:02:04.610> you're<00:02:04.729> learning<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.930> you

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
recommend if you're learning it that you

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.949 
recommend if you're learning it that you
do<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.950> on<00:02:07.040> carpet<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:09.470> probably<00:02:09.790> be

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
do it on carpet a and you probably be

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.840 
do it on carpet a and you probably be
safe<00:02:11.959> in<00:02:12.140> your<00:02:12.260> knife<00:02:12.410> because<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.310> will<00:02:13.580> cut

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
safe in your knife because you will cut

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.550 
safe in your knife because you will cut

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
yourself probably learning how to do

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.590 
yourself probably learning how to do
this<00:02:15.680> trick<00:02:15.950> very<00:02:16.670> tough<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.180> when<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.360> start

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
this trick very tough and when you start

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.960 
this trick very tough and when you start
learning<00:02:17.900> how<00:02:17.930> when<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.410> start<00:02:18.680> mixing<00:02:19.610> and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
learning how when you start mixing and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.940 
learning how when you start mixing and
throwing<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.570> catching<00:02:20.690> stuff<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.860> know

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
throwing and catching stuff and you know

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.699 
throwing and catching stuff and you know
not<00:02:22.130> knowing<00:02:22.400> if<00:02:22.760> when<00:02:23.150> or<00:02:23.570> how<00:02:23.870> much<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.620> going

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
not knowing if when or how much is going

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.220 
not knowing if when or how much is going
to<00:02:24.800> open<00:02:25.190> or<00:02:25.340> what<00:02:25.519> angle<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.180> there's<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.080> lot

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
to open or what angle is there's a lot

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.390 
to open or what angle is there's a lot
of<00:02:27.350> factors<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.250> may<00:02:28.570> shed<00:02:29.570> some<00:02:29.600> blood

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
of factors and you may shed some blood

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.580 
of factors and you may shed some blood
but<00:02:31.400> um<00:02:31.930> once<00:02:32.930> again<00:02:33.140> you're<00:02:33.260> going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.440> flip

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
but um once again you're going to flip

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.650 
but um once again you're going to flip
up<00:02:33.920> here<00:02:34.310> I'm<00:02:34.820> going<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:34.970> drop<00:02:35.150> down<00:02:35.209> and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
up here I'm going to drop down and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.699 
up here I'm going to drop down and
you're<00:02:35.780> going<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.989> want<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.200> catch<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.530> down

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
you're going to want to catch it down

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.150 
you're going to want to catch it down
lower<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:39.140> gravity<00:02:39.320> has<00:02:39.590> taught<00:02:39.860> me<00:02:39.980> take

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
lower so that gravity has taught me take

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.820 
lower so that gravity has taught me take
hold<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.640> completely<00:02:41.299> do<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.600> trick<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.080> once

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
hold and completely do the trick so once

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.610 
hold and completely do the trick so once
again<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.280> looks<00:02:43.310> like<00:02:43.489> this<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.450> and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
again it looks like this like that and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.490 
again it looks like this like that and
I've<00:02:50.620> done<00:02:50.920> solo<00:02:51.490> on<00:02:52.050> good<00:02:53.050> luck

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
I've done solo on good luck

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.700 
I've done solo on good luck
safe<00:02:53.680> travels<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:55.200> safe<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.350> your<00:02:56.380> blade

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
safe travels and safe in your blade

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.420 
safe travels and safe in your blade
before<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.250> try<00:02:57.490> to<00:02:57.550> do<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.770> I<00:02:59.980> want<00:03:00.280> that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
before you try to do this so I want that

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.980 
before you try to do this so I want that
on<00:03:00.550> my<00:03:00.580> conscious<00:03:01.240> that<00:03:01.420> you'll<00:03:01.600> cut<00:03:01.870> yourself

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
on my conscious that you'll cut yourself

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.550 
on my conscious that you'll cut yourself
because<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.770> watch<00:03:02.980> my<00:03:03.190> video<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.630> do<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.440> for

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
because you watch my video so do it for

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.800 
because you watch my video so do it for
me
