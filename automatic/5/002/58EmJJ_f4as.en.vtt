00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.140
 when my mom and dad decided to build 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.840
 home for a long time thought the food you three in 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.630
 world a lot of good technology so 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.900
 you need to compare everything and choose the one where 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.300
 benefits more you agree with 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.100
 considering it seemed like a big part 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.410
 Canada Finland capitalists to therein 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.260
 Germany lives in houses built 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.339
 on the so-called Canadian technology 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.579
 yes now 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.890
 and in our country Russia such houses 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.239
 gets more and more 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.969
 popularity 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.199
 what is so beautiful about them 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.600
 low-rise construction technology 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.780
 houses of the vulture panels does not impose 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.559
 no restrictions on 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.030
 architectural planning solutions and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.750
 allows you to implement the most 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.820
 various projects 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.770
 cost up to 50 percent lower than when 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.050
 brick construction wood 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.240
 foam blocks if you take a two-story house 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.950
 170 square meters then the cost 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.710
 will be a million eight hundred and twenty 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.060
 thousand rubles and this with the foundation of the roof 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.010
 with roofing and pvc windows 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.130
 any available finishes 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.310
 you can lay a house on a brick floor or 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.370
 plaster the walls 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.330
 siding clapboard blockhouse pace 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:42.140
 construction at least 8 times faster 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.590
 than other technologies minimum 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.020
 heating costs seven eight times 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.010
 less than heating brick or 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.010
 houses from timber 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.780
 environmental friendliness in European countries in general 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.660
 There is a mass psychosis when it comes to 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.050
 environmental friendliness and only therefore there is more 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.120
 80 percent of families live exactly in 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.130
 such houses 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.020
 debt after all 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.050
 the estimated lifetime of the vulture panels is not 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.930
 less than 80 years for example estimated period 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.700
 brick service is 75 years a 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.209
 foam block only 20 fire resistance 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.430
 at burning of a vulture the panel allocate in seven 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.080
 less heat energy than 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.959
 wood high seismic resistance 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.180
 unlike stone houses these houses 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.670
 able to endure earthquakes to 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.220
 nine points so they can be built 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.150
 even where earthquakes are not 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.310
 rarity house made by the canadian 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.620
 construction technology meets all 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.170
 requirements of modern life he is not 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.520
 only environmentally safe durable 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.260
 and reliable but affordable we 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.620
 made your choice 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.709
 now it's up to you the whole family give 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.709
 advice is better than home no beast 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.299
