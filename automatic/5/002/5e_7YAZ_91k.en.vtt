batteries<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.259> were<00:01:31.409> inside<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:33.210> one

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
batteries that were inside but this one

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.469 
batteries that were inside but this one
is<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.259> really<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.619> gem<00:01:34.950> inside<00:01:35.670> let's<00:01:36.360> go

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
is it's really a gem inside let's go

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
is it's really a gem inside let's go
ahead<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.780> play<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.380> you'll<00:01:37.560> hear<00:01:37.950> after

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
ahead and play it what you'll hear after

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.210 
ahead and play it what you'll hear after
we<00:01:38.729> put<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:38.939> penny<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> turn<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.860> handle

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we put the penny in and turn the handle

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.530 
we put the penny in and turn the handle
is<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:42.060> combination<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> two<00:01:43.290> noises<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:43.979> is

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
is a combination of two noises one is

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
is a combination of two noises one is
clock<00:01:45.540> mechanism<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.439> escapement<00:01:46.770> mechanism

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
clock mechanism an escapement mechanism

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
clock mechanism an escapement mechanism
that's<00:01:47.520> ticking<00:01:47.909> down<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:48.990> turns

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
that's ticking down that is what turns

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.399 
that's ticking down that is what turns
the<00:01:50.090> electrical<00:01:51.090> system<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.810> off<00:01:51.899> inside

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the electrical system on and off inside

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.130 
the electrical system on and off inside
and<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> secondary<00:01:53.939> buzz<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and then the secondary buzz is the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.530 
and then the secondary buzz is the
electrode<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.460> associated<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
electrode that is associated with the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.389 
electrode that is associated with the
capacitor<00:01:57.930> basically<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> big<00:01:58.979> capacitor

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
capacitor basically the big capacitor

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.910 
capacitor basically the big capacitor
that<00:01:59.549> gets<00:01:59.700> created<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:01.020> give<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> jolt

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
that gets created to give you the jolt

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.190 
that gets created to give you the jolt
that<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.159> feel<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.930> we'll<00:02:03.930> go<00:02:04.049> ahead

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
that you feel so we'll go ahead

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.230 
that you feel so we'll go ahead
both<00:02:05.740> in<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.010> end<00:02:06.190> we<00:02:06.340> hear<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.550> drop<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.060> when

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
both in the end we hear a drop and when

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.410 
both in the end we hear a drop and when
we<00:02:07.360> let<00:02:07.510> go<00:02:08.520> we've<00:02:09.520> you're<00:02:09.640> both<00:02:09.850> buzzes

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:23.230 

so<00:02:15.420> certainly<00:02:16.020> does<00:02:16.230> give<00:02:16.440> us<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:17.060> nice<00:02:18.860> nice

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.910 

quite<00:02:24.240> get<00:02:24.420> at<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:24.870> 200<00:02:25.020> mark<00:02:25.440> that

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
quite get at that for 200 mark that

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.800 
quite get at that for 200 mark that
gives<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.670> nice<00:02:26.820> strong<00:02:27.120> shock<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.700> has<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.810> new

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
gives a nice strong shock and has a new

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.040 
gives a nice strong shock and has a new
battery<00:02:31.080> inside<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.010> they<00:02:32.160> say<00:02:32.660> match<00:02:33.660> to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
battery inside that they say match to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.300 
battery inside that they say match to
the<00:02:34.200> historically<00:02:36.140> correct<00:02:37.140> models<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.250> you

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the historically correct models and you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.950 
the historically correct models and you
hear<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> buzzer<00:02:38.820> stopped<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.570> timer<00:02:39.810> is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
hear the buzzer stopped and the timer is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.360 
hear the buzzer stopped and the timer is
just<00:02:40.200> go<00:02:40.290> ducks<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.620> finished<00:02:40.890> turn<00:02:41.100> him<00:02:41.220> down

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
just go ducks it finished turn him down

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.700 
just go ducks it finished turn him down
and<00:02:41.790> now<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.630> machine<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:42.960> ready<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.470> another

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
and now the machine is ready for another

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.910 
and now the machine is ready for another
cycle<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> advanced<00:02:45.920> shock

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
cycle so this is the advanced shock

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.800 
cycle so this is the advanced shock
machine<00:02:50.060> from<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.470> 1930s<00:02:52.470> early<00:02:52.620> 1940s
