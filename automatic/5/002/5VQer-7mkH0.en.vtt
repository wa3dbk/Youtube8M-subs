00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.480
 hi to all and welcome to this 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.980
 new video in which I'm going 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.290
 you unpack the request 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.550
 that's you so it's a gaming mouse of 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.619
 mid-range that you will find at 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.029
 around 45 euros on the internet 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.410
 we will start right away with 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.150
 valleys this mouse so on the top one 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.989
 see the name of the mouse on the side 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.120
 some small information 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.129
 essentials on the mouse on the side 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.110
 marking 24 I really find this 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.220
 way of super nice we have a pretty good 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.540
 information about the box 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.910
 in the back we see the mouse with 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.580
 some information and we're going to 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.140
 Following open the box inside 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.100
 the box we find a small notice 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.900
 who will explain to us how 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.479
 download the mouse software is 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.239
 installed with mouse and we find well 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.680
 sure the rocket that's you my first 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.900
 impressions are very good on this 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.369
 mice have a rather light mouse with 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.040
 a pretty nice topic actually on 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.409
 the side you have a matter a bit 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280
 adli slope even more than matt and that's 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.409
 very pleasant 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.880
 so there you see the software that goes 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.860
 allow you to change everything on the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.510
 mouse cursor speed buttons 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.220
 programmable so there are seven buttons 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.960
 programmable on this mouse you 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.100
 you can even choose the color of 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.720
 the letter at the back of 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.730
 the mouse so I chose that it 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.740
 changes continuously but you can see 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.980
 that you can choose for example if 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.570
 I put it yellow I get it applied and you 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.040
 can see that my mouse turns yellow 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.620
 so it's rather gadget but it's 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.330
 nice enough you have plenty of others 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.430
 options that you can change you 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.080
 can also contact the support of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.790
 11.4 I will let you discover all that 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.560
 we will now move on to a quick 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.150
 comparison with my old sweden that 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.820
 I introduced you this summer that costs 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.070
 only 24 role so cheaper but 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.260
 the ring road his view that you stupid my 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.909
 wish is still to my taste above 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.159
 because we have on the sides a material 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.370
 more pleasant and a better grip 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.260
 hand 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.180
 but hate heart that only costs 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.580
 24 euros on amazon remains very good 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.780
 I hope this video will have you 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.430
 more if it is the case do not hesitate to 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.229
 leave a blue thumb and share it 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.310
 on all social networks and me I 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.330
 See you soon for 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.330
