without<00:01:22.770> tear<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.549> no<00:01:23.790> repairs<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
without tear there can be no repairs so

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.999 
without tear there can be no repairs so
the<00:01:24.659> purpose<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.320> workout<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the purpose of your workout is to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
the purpose of your workout is to
actually<00:01:26.130> create<00:01:26.580> these<00:01:26.880> micro<00:01:27.299> fiber<00:01:27.509> tears

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
actually create these micro fiber tears

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.230 
actually create these micro fiber tears
but<00:01:28.350> here's<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> thing<00:01:28.979> these<00:01:29.670> tears<00:01:30.000> only

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
but here's the thing these tears only

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
but here's the thing these tears only
happen<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> greater<00:01:31.439> stress<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.040> placed

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
happen when a greater stress is placed

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.069 
happen when a greater stress is placed
on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> muscles<00:01:32.939> than<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.840> have
