00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.099
 We need the benton farm in the visit of my farm that served opposite in 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.099
 that event is 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.099
 a small piece of valley delivered ravines 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.429
 and one of here is only the casan wii greenhouse and a storage room 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.539
 p 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.410
 percent will do it declared p what I want to front 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.530
 I want 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.660
 to do things now when I start working for another person I can still do nothing 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.220
 with this car 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.180
 a greenhouse min 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.450
 a very diminished world 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.380
 ibm 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 depor pe demanded with 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 on that side 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 with steve myers euros total 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.340
 min wood is built with one hundred percent recycled material 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 of things that you find by air polyethylene pipes in the structure and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 wrapped of that 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 plastics by air greenhouse remains as well 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.170
 It is very simple of cost 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.420
 ll very resistant the structure there is and blow strong hurricane winds 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.570
 and endured well to extend 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.570
 but the own 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.909
 did not have a good point 1 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.340
 it is not property 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.770
 We believe that the idea has not caught anyone or was polyethylene 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.620
 the light of the advances and 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.860
 they are entering they are happening 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.840
 Lleida are getting hard 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.310
 one 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.149
 They spend too big nothing to eat they are very good they change us 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.249
 there are some that are have to eat 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.159
 for example rest 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.459
 but all that 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.709
 I'm here 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.810
 nor in those little plants that inside out are with him for something they know 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.709
 little cold 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.249
 the wind and the breaker and is better 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.019
 as artichoke has given a few 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.019
 then when little is spent outside 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.239
 and it's pretty good 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.379
 both cole sprouse 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.199
 bobo of tone experimenting the one that what better is given by there well 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:55.199
 and now it's all this morning putting the irrigation area 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.430
 the famous moneybox 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.269
 that falls almost lateral wind 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.809
 so much life ramshackle 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.889
 lorenzo 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.029
 I do not know how we hold a miracle that the wind is up 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.029
 so much 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.519
 here plan tÃ©c adds sugar one to a fence that makes it go against the 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.939
 winds 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.609
 the orchard the plants suffer a lot 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.909
 the strong winds 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.449
 look how it is 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.699
 inclined these of the wind 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.309
 the transplants 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:34.529
 b 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.489
 through a cannula 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.320
 I do not know yet be tall 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.789
 Sugarcane 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.319
 and then to suffocate voursarcedes as with a bush machine towards his wife 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.659
 sugar world 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.659
 if we have the porch here 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:58.059
 with the reason of shade that is lived almost all the year have gone to the house 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.079
 just went in to sleep 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.079
 bloom practically there is very good in winter 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.229
 in total they are 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.799
 almost to the bottom 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.839
 and in packing in summer does not come 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.839
 never any of that we were not so special 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.249
 well here I have a boom delivery of the provisional officials 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:26.229
 provisional tables 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.759
 for now 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.389
 later I want to do one or better more this is all 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.599
 very very simple very basic things all 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.949
 I've been here for a year and a half, only years have not come 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.050
 and there was nothing 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.620
 here there was nothing extra 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.100
 all a relieved 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.759
 one year and months 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.889
 I say in work 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.240
 busy 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.190
 Well, at home, I started to make a house in a wooden cabin, the kind that sell 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.909
 normal 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.029
 that are from that mine 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.509
 wood of 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.180
 you will say 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.129
 and in the end I finished doing 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.499
 the house of construction 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.299
 that the winds in winter plan very strong and these walls do not 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.969
 they do not go well, they do not have nor do they have good 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.689
 I put you leave the government 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.689
 on the outside it was a house of work and inside wood 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.969
 and I have a solar panel there is answer from above 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.300
 the absence of the plant a very basic system 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.300
 did not act of 60 watts of the year 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.839
 moment that the regulator battery is inside and 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.219
 with a cable and I still have only for light bulbs to give them 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.410
 end up buying generator to treat 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.199
 for large machines 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.430
 for the concrete mixer 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.500
 we would need power I do not have enough with silver 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.620
 and then continue for a powerful drill too 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:15.719
 to the new 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:16.750
 both a 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.830
 this ambition the film the couple of French transita 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.949
 you must also give and grants also another couple with two children 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.909
 They have bought another couple also to the inc 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.479
 and others are behind a farm that next to my farm also 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.479
 a package in buying another couple 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.289
 although little activity we have collective 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.289
 a group of friends 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.589
 very well is very good because it is a very quiet place at the moment 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:55.499
 well are we and I go to a neighbor who come here in the 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.680
 farms but not 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.619
 very quiet there are no problems 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:03.499
 well there is always some problem 

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:06.499
 can be solved 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:08.199
 it is not a serious problem
