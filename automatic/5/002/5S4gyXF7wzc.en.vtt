00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090

ultimately for silhouette this season
the<00:00:23.160> big<00:00:23.460> thing<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:24.000> me<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.869> idea<00:00:24.900> of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the big thing for me was the idea of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.710

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
some volume and some movement and the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.750 
some volume and some movement and the
idea<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.349> focus<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> waste

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760
