00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.520
 hello evgeny she had all 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:11.890
 in this short video we will look at 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:16.840
 the characteristics of this type of dummy 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:20.280
 there is only a body in which its main 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.860
 Unlike a country bag or pear 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.279
 Naturally the most important difference is that 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.390
 what is this mannequin shaped man specifically 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.000
 depicting 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.420
 man dropping a bit in exaggerated 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.749
 the shape of the muscles is more developed than in 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.940
 reality can be but it is done with 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:43.030
 the goal is simply to strengthen it 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.639
 that we're going to beat him to a fine of 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.019
 neck and head tear off thin arms 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:51.940
 come off i mean therefore amplified 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:56.799
 the main advantage about working with such 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:59.530
 dummy is that he has exactly those 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.379
 vulnerable points you are at 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.789
 reality will work striking 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.550
 by a living person 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.640
 if a punch bag then it's just 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.090
 what kind of cylinder are you 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.240
 strike not at all 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.550
 thinking specifically how it will be 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.930
 happen reality man and so 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.000
 Here on this dummy that we see face 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.260
 totally imagines a real face 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.120
 human eyebrows eyes we have 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.760
 there is 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.640
 lips have chin ears that is all that 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.000
 need to look where 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.930
 specifically hit the neck naturally 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.900
 there are muscles that mean we can beats 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.540
 hearts apply abdominals but we 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.960
 take not where the abdominal muscles are developed 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.979
 press and put in a vulnerable point between 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.360
 large and abdominal muscles that is 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.540
 solar plexus what kinds of bumps are you 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.079
 can work on this mannequin that 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.099
 start on top on the head naturally you 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.930
 can punch in the bottom 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.349
 jaw 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.840
 different straight straight chins 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:22.200
 lateral only immediately warn 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.109
 without a master on preparing hands if 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.230
 no stuffed you're not tempered and fuckers then naked 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:30.930
 hands immediately thresh with all your might not 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.989
 it is necessary that you first get used to it 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.889
 hardening or wearing tire gloves 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.069
 cards or boxing gloves 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:42.659
 no matter that is, protect the park first 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.470
 first consider how to work goal 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.599
 hand on the street you will be without gloves and 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.500
 so you will use and 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:56.189
 open hand and fingers and different sides 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.909
 palm and fist and elbows the needle will 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:02.030
 use and all kinds of still beats 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.219
 legs sit stretching we are now 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.150
 dummy precisely to the belt i.e. mannequins 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:11.370
 where else feet will consider it further 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.930
 so we work on the upper level 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.030
 We look that it is possible to fulfill on it 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.549
 first palm can strike 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.220
 it is in the nose that is, you immediately form 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.310
 skill to put the right place in any way on 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.769
 bag it is not clear where it hits specifically 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.510
 get used to that here's the face of the opponent and 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:37.159
 applied with the base of the palm 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.000
 nose following you can use 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:43.769
 there are ears 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.009
 blow fly with two palms that is such 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.590
 bumps that stun confusing 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.449
 the enemy that is, you will not knock him out 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.109
 and but dumbfounded in order to inflict 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:04:01.799
 there specifically varnish for example with palms 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:06.840
 right now we are considering we get external 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:08.909
 side palm down your throat 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.759
 strike naturally with your fingers 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.079
 do not necessarily treat their eyes 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:16.560
 drink in color 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:19.470
 that is, it is simply a means of 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.539
 temporarily demoralize incapacitate 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.099
 the opponent by the eyes can work 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.160
 can work by 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.760
 heart 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.490
 in the center of a heart block 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.860
 strike the solar plexus then 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:38.220
 is here you specifically form the skill 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:41.500
 not only the punches themselves but also points 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.410
 maximally vulnerable to your punches 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.070
 body of a real person so you can 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:54.220
 use elbow punches 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:58.060
 Bottom side can you here 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.360
 fine form this skill we 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.460
 a little bit like mice 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.290
 bare hands on it what kinds of beats 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.930
 work again I repeat right away 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.750
 no need to thresh with all the dope you first 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.520
 just feel what you feel 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.450
 how to work 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:30.730
 on from work throats solar plexus 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:33.630
 heart head fists gone but specifically 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:37.260
 detail chop off you grind taro 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.400
 educational film consider the same 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.700
 boxing gloves or shingart 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.030
 you can dress and work out different 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:50.070
 combinations from the bottom side that is specifically 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:53.350
 we work a stream of boxing gloves 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:57.780
 we work we combine all types of blows 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:02.160
 body head bottom side straight 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.160
 heart sun head 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.580
 that is, we are quietly choosing points 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.940
 who are on real salt and are attacked 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.940
 strike 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.699
 Hello, I am Eugene she had of this 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:46.139
 film and specifically consider how 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:51.520
 train on a mannequin in uniform 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:53.469
 man in this case dummy waist 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.779
 that is, as if for boxing equipment 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:58.899
 although it may kick your head here 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:01.569
 Stretching well, now consider how your hands 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:03.490
 work is understandable if there is no stretch 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:05.379
 there is no point talking about many 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.869
 if it is waist-high, you have to 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:10.319
 high beat so now only hands 

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:14.709
 work first boxing gloves 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:17.050
 ordinary 10 mb new czech 

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:19.569
 gloves recommend starting 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.569
 train on such a mannequin exactly in 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:25.149
 such gloves 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:27.939
 at first it is in 10 new they are in the mines 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:30.300
 because hands fists should get used 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:32.519
 then you can take them off 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.039
 shear gloves shingarta 

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:38.889
 them to train when your hands 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:42.659
 temper strengthened then you can bare 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:46.139
 hand work that is gradually and then 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:49.439
 easier when soft and 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:52.479
 more complicated when the goals are working hand 

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:54.369
 do everything neatly break your arms 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:56.349
 damage is not necessary that is, it is necessary for 

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:59.919
 in order to become stronger in order to 

00:07:56.349 --> 00:08:02.789
 spoil your health as you can 

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.789
 train
