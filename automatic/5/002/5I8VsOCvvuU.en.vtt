all<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.809> information<00:01:04.019> I've<00:01:04.470> changed<00:01:04.769> all<00:01:05.010> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
all this information I've changed all of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.170 
all this information I've changed all of
that<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.720> nothing<00:01:06.720> seems<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.080> make<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.439> work

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
that and nothing seems to make it work

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.539 
that and nothing seems to make it work
but<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.260> says<00:01:10.320> Pro<00:01:10.740> Tools<00:01:10.979> aggregate

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
but up here it says Pro Tools aggregate

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.230 
but up here it says Pro Tools aggregate
IO<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.470> that's<00:01:16.310> interesting<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.549> noticed

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
IO and that's interesting I noticed

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.990 
IO and that's interesting I noticed
something<00:01:18.720> before<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:21.049> audio<00:01:22.880> MIDI<00:01:23.880> setup

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
something before in the audio MIDI setup

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.910 
something before in the audio MIDI setup
and<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:28.970> in<00:01:29.970> your

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
and you know you can get to that in your

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.929 
and you know you can get to that in your
utilities<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> don't<00:01:32.310> already<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.759> how

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
utilities if you don't already know how

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.780 
utilities if you don't already know how
to<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> stair<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> anyway<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
to get to the stair so anyway so in the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
to get to the stair so anyway so in the
audio<00:01:38.810> setup<00:01:39.810> arm<00:01:40.640> here<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.820> noticed<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.479> Pro

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
audio setup arm here I noticed this Pro

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.030 
audio setup arm here I noticed this Pro
Tools<00:01:43.470> aggregate<00:01:44.009> IO<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.200> not

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
Tools aggregate IO here which is not

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.969 
Tools aggregate IO here which is not
really<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.180> device<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:48.960> using<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
really the device that I'm using it is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.350 
really the device that I'm using it is
but<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> device<00:01:51.210> is

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
but it's not that's the device is

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.359 
but it's not that's the device is
showing<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.780> Pro<00:01:51.990> Tools<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.860> device<00:01:53.159> I'm

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
showing up in Pro Tools the device I'm

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
showing up in Pro Tools the device I'm
using<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:54.000> multi<00:01:54.630> eight<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> eight<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.350> mk2

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
using is multi eight to eight and mk2

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.859 
using is multi eight to eight and mk2
am<00:01:56.430> using<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.600> course<00:01:57.810> my

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
am using that is you know of course my

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.789 
am using that is you know of course my
IO<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:59.930> interesting<00:02:00.930> thing<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.590> that

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
IO the interesting thing is is that

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.120 
IO the interesting thing is is that
since<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.549> an<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.090> Pro<00:02:03.270> Tools<00:02:03.479> egg<00:02:03.719> VI<00:02:03.960> oh

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
since it's an the Pro Tools egg VI oh

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.319 
since it's an the Pro Tools egg VI oh
that<00:02:05.130> was<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.310> throwing<00:02:05.640> me<00:02:05.790> off<00:02:05.939> what<00:02:06.299> I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that was just throwing me off what I

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.050 
that was just throwing me off what I
discovered<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.250> what<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> pro

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
discovered is what that what the pro

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.610 
discovered is what that what the pro
tools<00:02:09.300> area<00:02:09.509> IO<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.830> does

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
tools area IO is or does

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.550 
tools area IO is or does
I<00:02:11.650> guess<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.849> takes<00:02:13.120> everything<00:02:13.480> all<00:02:14.230> your

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
I guess is it takes everything all your

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.400 
I guess is it takes everything all your
aisles<00:02:15.190> on<00:02:15.370> your<00:02:15.519> computer<00:02:15.940> or<00:02:16.930> they're

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
aisles on your computer or they're

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.309 
aisles on your computer or they're
connected<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.190> your<00:02:18.310> computer<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.110> dump<00:02:20.110> them

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
connected to your computer and dump them

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.119 
connected to your computer and dump them
into<00:02:20.470> one<00:02:21.510> quote-unquote<00:02:22.510> sound<00:02:23.170> card<00:02:23.440> kind

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
into one quote-unquote sound card kind

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.710 
into one quote-unquote sound card kind
of<00:02:24.280> thing<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.590> what<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.709> have<00:02:27.010> here<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.790> I

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
of thing and so what you have here is I

there's<00:03:24.910> there<00:03:25.329> this<00:03:25.480> area<00:03:25.900> when<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.410> click

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
there's there this area when I click

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.009 
there's there this area when I click
back<00:03:26.799> here<00:03:26.859> it's<00:03:27.519> just<00:03:27.849> you<00:03:28.030> know<00:03:28.150> aggregate

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
back here it's just you know aggregate

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.120 
back here it's just you know aggregate
i/o<00:03:29.230> now<00:03:29.859> the<00:03:30.569> significance<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:32.099> again<00:03:33.099> I

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
i/o now the significance of that again I

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.819 
i/o now the significance of that again I
guess<00:03:33.370> it's<00:03:33.819> just<00:03:34.120> having<00:03:34.720> an<00:03:34.989> issue<00:03:35.200> trying

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
guess it's just having an issue trying

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.449 
guess it's just having an issue trying
to<00:03:36.239> send<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.299> information<00:03:37.630> back<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.459> I

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
to send that information back and I

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.740 
to send that information back and I
thought<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.910> was<00:03:40.030> kind<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.269> weird<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.780> I

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
thought it was kind of weird so I

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.900 
thought it was kind of weird so I
clicked<00:03:43.750> here<00:03:44.410> back<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.950> Pro<00:03:45.130> Tools<00:03:45.160> again<00:03:45.700> and
