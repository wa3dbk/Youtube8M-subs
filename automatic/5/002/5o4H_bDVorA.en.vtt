fine I and you can look over the solar

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.529 
fine I and you can look over the solar
panels<00:00:53.969> from<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.210> too<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:55.350> nice<00:00:55.649> oh<00:00:56.539> you

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
panels from here too that's nice oh you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.709 
panels from here too that's nice oh you
know<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.020> added<00:00:59.010> texture<00:00:59.370> pack<00:00:59.719> it's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
know what I added texture pack it's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.520 
know what I added texture pack it's
called<00:01:01.079> faithful<00:01:01.710> back<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:03.229> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
called faithful back and I think it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.039 
called faithful back and I think it
looks<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.830> nice<00:01:05.330> if<00:01:06.330> everyone<00:01:06.659> likes<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
looks really nice if everyone likes it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.480 
looks really nice if everyone likes it
then<00:01:07.229> I'll<00:01:07.350> probably<00:01:07.740> stick<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
then I'll probably stick with it for a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399 
then I'll probably stick with it for a
while<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.909> close<00:01:09.450> enough<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> original

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
while it's close enough to the original

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.880 
while it's close enough to the original

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
it's available i'll probably build one

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.459 
it's available i'll probably build one
of<00:01:54.659> those<00:01:54.869> big<00:01:55.189> queries<00:01:56.189> first<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.990> dig

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
of those big queries first and just dig

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.670 
of those big queries first and just dig
the<00:01:58.680> crap<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.219> something

thing sorry when I did here is this

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.690 
thing sorry when I did here is this
block<00:04:52.660> here<00:04:52.870> is<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:52.990> detector<00:04:53.500> block<00:04:53.710> this

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
block here is a detector block this

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.550 
block here is a detector block this
block<00:04:54.910> will<00:04:55.060> tell<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.780> if<00:04:56.020> there's<00:04:56.410> any

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
block will tell you if there's any

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.060 
block will tell you if there's any
current<00:04:57.130> passing<00:04:57.640> through<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.940> wire<00:04:59.070> current

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
current passing through the wire current

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.030 
current passing through the wire current
went<00:05:00.669> at<00:05:00.850> current<00:05:01.240> happens<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:02.560> will<00:05:02.740> power

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
went at current happens it will power

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.550 
went at current happens it will power
this<00:05:03.340> redstone<00:05:03.730> and<00:05:04.030> this<00:05:04.870> redstone<00:05:05.260> will

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
this redstone and this redstone will

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.090 
this redstone and this redstone will
turn<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:06.070> torch<00:05:06.970> off<00:05:07.530> which<00:05:08.530> will<00:05:08.710> turn<00:05:08.919> my

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
turn this torch off which will turn my

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.150 
turn this torch off which will turn my
indicator<00:05:09.700> on<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:11.110> when<00:05:11.410> there's<00:05:11.680> current

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
indicator on so when there's current

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.190 
indicator on so when there's current
going<00:05:12.220> from<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.970> torch<00:05:13.240> from<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.960> solar

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
going from the torch from the solar

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.530 
going from the torch from the solar
panels<00:05:14.590> into<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.010> house<00:05:15.160> that<00:05:16.060> light<00:05:16.270> will<00:05:16.450> go

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
panels into the house that light will go

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.560 
panels into the house that light will go
on<00:05:17.340> we're<00:05:18.340> not<00:05:18.460> solar<00:05:18.729> panels<00:05:19.030> specifically

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
on we're not solar panels specifically

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.930 
on we're not solar panels specifically
but<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.750> bat<00:05:20.020> box<00:05:20.320> right<00:05:20.590> there<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:21.010> that's

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
but the bat box right there and that's

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.050 
but the bat box right there and that's
probably<00:05:22.390> full<00:05:23.169> right<00:05:23.440> now<00:05:23.620> let<00:05:23.979> me<00:05:24.040> see<00:05:24.310> yep

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
probably full right now let me see yep

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.290 
probably full right now let me see yep
it's<00:05:25.450> all<00:05:26.190> yeah<00:05:27.190> definitely<00:05:27.610> this<00:05:27.729> this<00:05:28.000> solar

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
it's all yeah definitely this this solar

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.200 
it's all yeah definitely this this solar
panel<00:05:28.600> array<00:05:28.720> right<00:05:29.110> here<00:05:29.320> has<00:05:29.650> been<00:05:30.210> hugely

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
panel array right here has been hugely

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.450 
panel array right here has been hugely
hugely<00:05:31.750> helpful<00:05:31.930> it's<00:05:32.320> been<00:05:32.470> very<00:05:32.800> nice<00:05:33.300> it's

hugely helpful it's been very nice it's

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.230 
hugely helpful it's been very nice it's
at<00:05:36.460> even<00:05:37.210> with<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.570> number<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:40.120> right

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
at even with the number of the right

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.620 
at even with the number of the right
equipment<00:05:40.450> i<00:05:40.690> added<00:05:41.020> i<00:05:41.140> added<00:05:41.470> some<00:05:41.500> i<00:05:42.570> added<00:05:43.570> a

equipment i added i added some i added a

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.240 
equipment i added i added some i added a
few<00:05:43.780> more<00:05:43.840> smelters<00:05:44.350> we<00:05:44.800> open<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.070> door

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
few more smelters we open the door

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.700 
few more smelters we open the door
continued<00:05:45.880> sad<00:05:46.690> i<00:05:46.870> added<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.140> couple<00:05:47.229> smelters

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
continued sad i added a couple smelters

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.050 
continued sad i added a couple smelters
a<00:05:47.740> couple<00:05:48.010> grinders<00:05:48.400> i<00:05:48.520> can<00:05:48.789> have<00:05:48.880> all<00:05:49.030> of

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
a couple grinders i can have all of

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.159 
a couple grinders i can have all of
these<00:05:49.240> running<00:05:49.600> and<00:05:51.090> it<00:05:52.090> will<00:05:52.720> it<00:05:52.900> will<00:05:52.930> drain

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
these running and it will it will drain

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.469 
these running and it will it will drain
faster<00:05:53.650> than<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.860> bat<00:05:54.010> boxes<00:05:54.430> but<00:05:54.580> it's<00:05:54.760> all

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
faster than the bat boxes but it's all

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.580 
faster than the bat boxes but it's all
finished<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:56.140> certainly<00:05:56.410> i'll<00:05:56.560> finish<00:05:58.590> we
