00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
we look at durability and so I don't

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940 
we look at durability and so I don't
know<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.360> pretty<00:01:09.780> nard<00:01:10.740> up

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
know if you can see it's pretty nard up

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.090 
know if you can see it's pretty nard up
on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.939> sides<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:13.500> where<00:01:13.770> actually

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
on the sides and that's where actually

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.710 
on the sides and that's where actually
putting<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> nerf<00:01:14.640> bars<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.180> comes<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:15.689> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
putting the nerf bars that comes with it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.880 
putting the nerf bars that comes with it
what<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.650> came<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> lot<00:01:17.630> handier<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.170> didn't

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
what it came in a lot handier I didn't

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.149 
what it came in a lot handier I didn't
use<00:01:20.100> them<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.350> definitely<00:01:22.350> did<00:01:22.740> some<00:01:22.920> damage

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
use them so I definitely did some damage

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.890 
use them so I definitely did some damage
to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.580> sides<00:01:23.850> laying<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> down<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.780> things

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
to the sides laying it down and things

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
to the sides laying it down and things
like<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.470> mean<00:01:25.680> obviously<00:01:25.970> nothing

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
like that but I mean obviously nothing

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.960 
like that but I mean obviously nothing
really<00:01:27.210> broke<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.140> plastic<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> sides<00:01:29.549> or

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
really broke the plastic on the sides or

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.350 
really broke the plastic on the sides or
lexan<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> would<00:01:32.310> say<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:33.000> pretty

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
lexan you know I would say it's pretty

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.510 
lexan you know I would say it's pretty
bendy<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.930> flexible<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.860> might<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.040> break

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
bendy and flexible so it might not break

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
bendy and flexible so it might not break
as<00:01:35.700> easily<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.329> would<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.600> thought<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
as easily as I would have thought I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
as easily as I would have thought I
could<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.860> these<00:01:37.979> fenders<00:01:38.400> being<00:01:38.670> an<00:01:38.759> issue

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
could see these fenders being an issue

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.560 
could see these fenders being an issue
long-term<00:01:39.600> maybe<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> handlebars<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.820> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
long-term maybe the handlebars but in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.740 
long-term maybe the handlebars but in
the<00:01:42.750> pecks<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.140> Iran<00:01:43.470> nothing<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:45.090> jumped

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the pecks at Iran nothing really jumped

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.830 
the pecks at Iran nothing really jumped
out<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:46.079> an<00:01:46.229> obvious<00:01:46.909> part<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.119> needs<00:01:48.360> some

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
out as an obvious part that needs some

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.770 
out as an obvious part that needs some
beefing<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.579> out<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.880> box<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.360> shock<00:01:51.570> oil

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
beefing up out of the box the shock oil

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
beefing up out of the box the shock oil
is<00:01:51.990> probably<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.500> light<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.909> know

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is probably a little light I don't know

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
is probably a little light I don't know
how<00:01:54.210> far<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.659> want<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:54.930> upgrading

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
how far you want to go upgrading

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
a half out of five will call it because

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.550 
a half out of five will call it because
only<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> couple<00:02:30.900> factors<00:02:31.439> i

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
only because of all a couple factors i

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.959 
only because of all a couple factors i
mean<00:02:31.709> obviously<00:02:32.040> you're<00:02:32.579> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:32.939> a

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
mean obviously you're going to be a

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.610 
mean obviously you're going to be a
little<00:02:33.150> limited<00:02:33.389> with<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.900> terrain<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.319> you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
little limited with the terrain that you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890 
little limited with the terrain that you
can<00:02:34.769> run<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.069> bike<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.819> because<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
can run this bike on just because the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.959 
can run this bike on just because the
nature<00:02:37.139> of<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.439> beast<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:38.040> mean<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:38.790> not

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
nature of the beast I mean it's not

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.369 
nature of the beast I mean it's not
going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> really<00:02:39.359> handle<00:02:39.599> super<00:02:40.049> bumpy

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
going to really handle super bumpy

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.530 
going to really handle super bumpy
terrain<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.730> need<00:02:41.909> to<00:02:41.969> something<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.299> little

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
terrain you need to something a little

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.170 
terrain you need to something a little
smooth<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.109> little<00:02:43.409> consistent<00:02:44.219> to<00:02:44.760> handle<00:02:45.090> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
smooth a little consistent to handle it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.390 
smooth a little consistent to handle it
so<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.659> may<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:45.989> be<00:02:46.049> able<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.439> be<00:02:46.650> bashed<00:02:46.889> just

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
so it may not be able to be bashed just

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.000 
so it may not be able to be bashed just
about<00:02:47.609> everywhere<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.290> good<00:02:49.500> points<00:02:49.919> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
about everywhere the the good points the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.619 
about everywhere the the good points the
high<00:02:50.159> marks<00:02:50.459> or<00:02:50.579> bash<00:02:50.730> ability<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> thought

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
high marks or bash ability is I thought

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.309 
high marks or bash ability is I thought
besides<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.859> challenge<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.549> all<00:02:53.669> I<00:02:54.319> which

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
besides the challenge of it all I which

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.619 
besides the challenge of it all I which
is<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> challenge<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.189> drive<00:02:56.400> at<00:02:56.549> first<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.510> a

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
is a challenge to drive at first it's a

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.189 
is a challenge to drive at first it's a
lot<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.930> fun<00:02:58.139> and<00:02:58.549> it<00:02:59.549> just<00:02:59.879> makes<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:01.049> just

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:01.199 
lot of fun and it just makes it's just

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
lot of fun and it just makes it's just
another<00:03:01.530> level<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.419> RC<00:03:03.419> hobby<00:03:03.659> and<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.219> in

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
another level to the RC hobby and so in

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.080 
another level to the RC hobby and so in
that<00:03:05.579> case<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:06.060> like<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:07.370> overall<00:03:08.370> value<00:03:08.579> I

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
that case I like it overall value I

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.780 
that case I like it overall value I
think<00:03:09.599> for<00:03:09.780> 350<00:03:10.530> which<00:03:10.889> is<00:03:11.040> probably<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.639> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
think for 350 which is probably like the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.500 
think for 350 which is probably like the
median<00:03:12.150> price<00:03:12.530> for<00:03:13.530> any<00:03:13.680> ready<00:03:13.919> to<00:03:14.069> run<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.579> not

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
median price for any ready to run is not

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.939 
median price for any ready to run is not
a<00:03:15.540> bad<00:03:15.750> price<00:03:15.930> at<00:03:16.199> all<00:03:16.319> no<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.699> know<00:03:18.739> 50<00:03:19.739> bucks

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
a bad price at all no you know 50 bucks

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.469 
a bad price at all no you know 50 bucks
the<00:03:20.069> way<00:03:20.159> I<00:03:20.189> try<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.400> look<00:03:20.579> at<00:03:20.669> as<00:03:20.790> 50<00:03:21.120> bucks<00:03:21.329> one

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
the way I try to look at as 50 bucks one

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.610 
the way I try to look at as 50 bucks one
way<00:03:21.629> or<00:03:21.689> the<00:03:21.750> other<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.199> going<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.439> make<00:03:22.470> a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
way or the other is that going to make a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.710 
way or the other is that going to make a
big<00:03:22.739> difference<00:03:22.979> I<00:03:23.639> don't<00:03:24.209> really<00:03:24.329> think<00:03:24.449> it

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
big difference I don't really think it

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.619 
big difference I don't really think it
does<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.169> mean<00:03:25.290> if<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> was<00:03:25.620> 299<00:03:26.189> what<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.819> like<00:03:27.389> it

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
does I mean if it was 299 what I like it

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.369 
does I mean if it was 299 what I like it
loads<00:03:28.409> better<00:03:28.759> know<00:03:29.759> if<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.269> was<00:03:30.359> 400<00:03:31.049> would<00:03:31.259> it

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
loads better know if it was 400 would it

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.939 
loads better know if it was 400 would it
change<00:03:31.560> my<00:03:31.769> opinion<00:03:31.979> on<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:33.239> ton<00:03:34.019> probably

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
change my opinion on it a ton probably

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.460 
change my opinion on it a ton probably
not<00:03:35.720> there's<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.810> couple<00:03:36.989> things<00:03:37.229> that<00:03:37.379> I

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
not there's a couple things that I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.780 
not there's a couple things that I
learned<00:03:37.650> while<00:03:37.859> driving<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.549> want<00:03:38.729> to

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.929 
you want to rev it up a little bit to
get<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.409> balancing<00:03:41.159> stuff<00:03:41.370> working<00:03:41.639> in<00:03:41.849> the

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
get the balancing stuff working in the

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.569 
get the balancing stuff working in the
back<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> little<00:03:42.299> bit<00:03:42.479> before<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.870> set<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.169> down

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
back a little bit before you set it down

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.789 
back a little bit before you set it down
the<00:03:44.579> other<00:03:44.699> big<00:03:45.349> drawback<00:03:46.349> would<00:03:47.189> be<00:03:48.650> some<00:03:49.650> of

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
the other big drawback would be some of

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:50.929 
the other big drawback would be some of
the<00:03:49.919> things<00:03:50.129> that<00:03:50.189> you<00:03:50.310> need<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.519> do<00:03:50.669> I<00:03:50.699> mean

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
the things that you need to do I mean

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.780 
the things that you need to do I mean
the<00:03:51.000> shocks<00:03:51.269> are<00:03:51.479> really<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:53.310> really<00:03:53.459> need<00:03:53.699> to

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the shocks are really you really need to

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.369 
the shocks are really you really need to
add<00:03:53.849> some<00:03:53.879> thick<00:03:54.209> oil<00:03:54.419> in<00:03:54.599> there<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.840> have<00:03:54.959> you

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
add some thick oil in there to have you

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.869 
add some thick oil in there to have you
know<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.530> get<00:03:55.799> get<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.400> going<00:03:56.669> right<00:03:56.849> the

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
know to get get it going right the

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.449 
know to get get it going right the
driver<00:03:57.389> to<00:03:57.689> me<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.989> just<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.290> novelty<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.159> you

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
driver to me is just a novelty so you

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.890 
driver to me is just a novelty so you
know<00:03:59.519> take<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.120> or<00:04:00.359> leave<00:04:00.419> it<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.689> don't<00:04:00.840> know

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
know take it or leave it I don't know

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.649 
know take it or leave it I don't know
how<00:04:00.989> many<00:04:01.019> people<00:04:01.229> actually<00:04:01.590> leave<00:04:01.919> that<00:04:02.129> on

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
how many people actually leave that on

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.969 
how many people actually leave that on
so<00:04:03.659> for<00:04:03.870> value<00:04:04.229> I'm<00:04:04.319> going<00:04:04.439> to<00:04:04.500> give<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.739> 3

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
so for value I'm going to give it a 3

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.240 
so for value I'm going to give it a 3
out<00:04:05.009> of<00:04:05.129> 5<00:04:05.449> could<00:04:06.449> it<00:04:06.540> have<00:04:06.569> been<00:04:06.659> 299<00:04:07.250> maybe

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
out of 5 could it have been 299 maybe

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.849 
out of 5 could it have been 299 maybe
but<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.180> think<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.629> priced<00:04:09.900> fair<00:04:10.229> for<00:04:10.709> where

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
but I think it's priced fair for where

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.059 
but I think it's priced fair for where
it's<00:04:11.009> at<00:04:11.189> then<00:04:11.879> getting<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.389> fun<00:04:12.629> factor<00:04:13.069> now

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
it's at then getting the fun factor now

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.830 
it's at then getting the fun factor now
this<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.579> at<00:04:14.789> first<00:04:14.969> if<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.329> watch<00:04:15.509> kind<00:04:15.780> of

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
this one at first if you watch kind of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.409 
this one at first if you watch kind of
my<00:04:15.930> box<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.469> ground<00:04:16.739> video<00:04:17.159> I<00:04:17.459> have<00:04:18.359> a

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
my box to the ground video I have a

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.360 
my box to the ground video I have a
really<00:04:18.719> complicated<00:04:19.199> relationship<00:04:20.190> with

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
really complicated relationship with

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.969 
really complicated relationship with
this<00:04:20.489> bike<00:04:20.729> because<00:04:20.940> at<00:04:21.870> first<00:04:22.199> you<00:04:22.650> know<00:04:22.860> I

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
this bike because at first you know I

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.740 
this bike because at first you know I
felt<00:04:23.159> like<00:04:23.279> I<00:04:23.430> hated<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.909> then<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.180> loved<00:04:24.570> it

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
felt like I hated it then I loved it

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.970 
felt like I hated it then I loved it
then<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:24.990> hated<00:04:25.199> it<00:04:25.409> then<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:25.650> loved<00:04:26.010> it

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
then I hated it then I loved it

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.250 
then I hated it then I loved it
so<00:04:27.160> maybe<00:04:27.490> after<00:04:27.700> some<00:04:28.030> upgrading<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.810> would

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
so maybe after some upgrading I would

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.720 
so maybe after some upgrading I would
say<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:30.990> might<00:04:31.990> like<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.230> little<00:04:32.470> bit<00:04:32.680> more<00:04:32.890> but

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
say I might like a little bit more but

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.210 
say I might like a little bit more but
you<00:04:33.880> know<00:04:33.990> if<00:04:34.990> it's<00:04:35.230> not<00:04:35.410> your<00:04:35.560> first<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:36.070> it's

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
you know if it's not your first if it's

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.300 
you know if it's not your first if it's
your<00:04:36.310> first-ever<00:04:36.700> RC<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.270> would<00:04:37.570> probably

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
your first-ever RC I would probably

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.680 
your first-ever RC I would probably
write<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.370> little<00:04:39.670> bit<00:04:39.760> lower<00:04:39.970> but<00:04:40.180> for<00:04:40.390> me<00:04:40.510> who

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
write a little bit lower but for me who

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.540 
write a little bit lower but for me who
have<00:04:41.050> been<00:04:41.230> in<00:04:41.380> RC<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:42.010> like<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.400> challenge

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
have been in RC and I like the challenge

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.370 
have been in RC and I like the challenge
of<00:04:43.060> something<00:04:43.420> new<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.750> different<00:04:43.780> I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
of something new and different I

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.040 
of something new and different I
probably<00:04:44.980> gave<00:04:45.160> it<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.370> three<00:04:45.900> three<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:46.960> a

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
probably gave it a three three and a

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.160 
probably gave it a three three and a
half<00:04:47.700> three<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.910> half<00:04:48.940> out<00:04:49.240> of<00:04:49.270> five<00:04:49.390> for

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
half three and a half out of five for

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.710 
half three and a half out of five for
fun<00:04:50.320> factor<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:50.950> think<00:04:51.460> if<00:04:51.580> i<00:04:51.730> were<00:04:51.850> really<00:04:52.060> into

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
fun factor I think if i were really into

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.580 
fun factor I think if i were really into
bikes<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:55.120> general<00:04:55.600> like<00:04:55.750> as<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:55.960> hobby<00:04:56.170> i<00:04:56.320> would

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
bikes in general like as a hobby i would

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.240 
bikes in general like as a hobby i would
probably<00:04:57.010> rate<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.280> even<00:04:57.520> better<00:04:58.710> now<00:04:59.710> would<00:05:00.220> i

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
probably rate it even better now would i

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.040 
probably rate it even better now would i
buy<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.550> again<00:05:00.790> which<00:05:01.210> is<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.480> final<00:05:01.750> category

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
buy it again which is the final category

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.460 
buy it again which is the final category
of<00:05:02.350> our<00:05:02.440> reviews<00:05:03.780> this<00:05:04.780> is<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.960> tough<00:05:05.230> one<00:05:05.260> for

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
of our reviews this is a tough one for

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.080 
of our reviews this is a tough one for
me<00:05:05.730> I<00:05:06.730> think<00:05:07.060> it's<00:05:07.450> fun<00:05:09.150> would<00:05:10.150> I<00:05:10.180> buy<00:05:10.420> it<00:05:10.450> again

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
me I think it's fun would I buy it again

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.360 
me I think it's fun would I buy it again
yeah<00:05:13.090> maybe<00:05:13.570> I'm<00:05:14.020> not<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.620> jury<00:05:14.920> still<00:05:15.160> out<00:05:15.310> on

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
yeah maybe I'm not the jury still out on

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.490 
yeah maybe I'm not the jury still out on
that<00:05:15.700> I<00:05:15.730> think<00:05:16.090> you<00:05:16.600> know<00:05:16.720> it's<00:05:16.870> not<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.380> a

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
that I think you know it's not just a

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.770 
that I think you know it's not just a
clear<00:05:17.830> awesome<00:05:18.400> winner<00:05:18.610> like<00:05:18.970> like<00:05:19.330> maybe<00:05:19.540> the

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
clear awesome winner like like maybe the

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.020 
clear awesome winner like like maybe the
st<00:05:20.080> for<00:05:20.290> was<00:05:20.530> but<00:05:21.280> it's<00:05:21.430> something<00:05:21.670> different

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
st for was but it's something different

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.460 
st for was but it's something different
it's<00:05:22.660> something<00:05:22.870> that<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.080> kind<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.350> just

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
it's something that you kind of just

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.140 
it's something that you kind of just
take<00:05:23.740> out<00:05:23.920> and<00:05:24.070> have<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.220> little<00:05:24.430> fun<00:05:24.520> with<00:05:24.850> I

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
take out and have a little fun with I

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.300 
take out and have a little fun with I
could<00:05:25.630> see<00:05:25.750> get<00:05:25.960> into<00:05:26.200> doing<00:05:26.470> some<00:05:26.740> projects

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
could see get into doing some projects

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.190 
could see get into doing some projects
maybe<00:05:27.550> with<00:05:27.820> it<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.210> upgrading<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:28.900> making<00:05:29.140> a

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
maybe with it and upgrading it making a

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.130 
maybe with it and upgrading it making a
little<00:05:29.440> bit<00:05:29.560> more<00:05:29.770> fun<00:05:30.070> I<00:05:30.940> think<00:05:31.390> had<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.600> ran<00:05:31.990> it

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
little bit more fun I think had I ran it

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.200 
little bit more fun I think had I ran it
with<00:05:32.170> the<00:05:32.320> nerf<00:05:32.500> bars<00:05:32.770> on<00:05:32.950> from<00:05:33.430> Jump<00:05:33.730> Street<00:05:33.790> I

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
with the nerf bars on from Jump Street I

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.790 
with the nerf bars on from Jump Street I
would<00:05:34.750> have<00:05:34.840> liked<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.170> a<00:05:35.230> little<00:05:35.320> bit<00:05:35.530> more

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
would have liked it a little bit more

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.930 
would have liked it a little bit more
but<00:05:36.490> overall<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:37.360> think<00:05:38.250> my<00:05:39.250> final<00:05:39.670> kind<00:05:39.880> of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
but overall I think my final kind of

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.740 
but overall I think my final kind of
take<00:05:40.150> on<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:40.480> is<00:05:40.510> is<00:05:40.930> it<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.590> great<00:05:41.740> first<00:05:42.130> rc

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
take on it is is it a great first rc

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.080 
take on it is is it a great first rc
