00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.230
 they are all boys and welcome again 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.450
 video of your rac1 the raccoon 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.429
 today on a guide to assassin's 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.559
 creed 4 black flag on how to approach 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.330
 easily a vessel as you see vi 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.460
 I'm showing my videos in the video 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.529
 statistics for now are pretty much al 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.869
 73 percent of naval power then 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.320
 not much indeed as you will see in the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.789
 video when I try to fix the view 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.050
 on the scene it will be too powerful for me 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.760
 there will be the red writing 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.439
 this I 'm showing you on 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.570
 map instead is practically the place in 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.210
 to whom I call it the Strait of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.540
 battles because a strait is present 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.090
 between the island of cuba and the islet that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.100
 just heavens under which one does not know for 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.350
 what a motive but continually that is a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 coming and going of English and Spanish vessels 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 from one direction to another how to go about 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 to approach 1 easily and simply must 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.920
 wait for these occasions here or the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.829
 occasions when two vessels of the two 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.410
 nations or england and spain yes 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.890
 see and begin to draw of saint 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.190
 reason 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.409
 now you will say yes but difficult because 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.430
 maybe there is so much space in the face 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.659
 you ca n't see far away and all the rest 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.939
 it's not that hard 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.939
 that is, it is not as rare as boys seem 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.860
 I could even show you others 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.570
 episodes that he has recorded today 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.830
 because I wanted to wait for this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.619
 that this is really fine 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.250
 this battle is perfect 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.799
 while they clear each other is 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.630
 this is practically really common 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.150
 what or if it is not a vessel against 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.970
 another vessel is there to be precisely 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 as you can see now some English frigates 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.049
 that a Spanish vessel is wearing 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.820
 or the opposite of frigates 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.710
 Spanish against an English vessel 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.329
 in short, they are always there to make war 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.329
 because apparently they're on their ass 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:53.880
 it is therefore normal for him to be so from 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.590
 adapt and my advice is if you have 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.110
 especially when you have a weak ship 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 that maybe you can't do 1 v1 with 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.360
 wait for them to finish with a vessel 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.729
 this bombarding each other because 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.530
 maybe it doesn't seem to you because you 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.539
 ships still seem intact though 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.039
 they are shooting each other then 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.069
 maybe the first thing that comes from me 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.219
 think is 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.439
 it's all scene because in reality the engine 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.480
 chart does not detect the shots you are taking 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.799
 shooting but it's all fiction in reality 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.889
 they are not suffering any harm is 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.170
 just to give the idea ok that 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.510
 that thing there is a battle instead 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.370
 guys now I'll show you soon 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.150
 currently the opposite because if you 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.219
 try I do n't know how to shoot him like that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.959
 I'll do it soon you'll see that 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.090
 virtually life if they are removed 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.159
 really but if they are really given 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.709
 toste ie bombarde not 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.209
 indifferent then immediately after what you 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.129
 I advise to do when I am already 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.560
 pretty damaged it goes well 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.599
 first expected in finish of 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.900
 shoot yourself between them because this 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.400
 because first of all it is all work that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.049
 you don't have to do yourself ok that is if 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.599
 they continue to damage each other you 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.909
 state man takes a distance 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.069
 but not too far away because otherwise 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.409
 the ships disappear and you missed the 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.879
 battle that is, keep your distance 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.400
 security however continue on 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.199
 observe always keep an eye on them now 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.109
 I shot at the vessel and as you see 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:18.400
 it's not like I took half his life with him 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.109
 those balls I almost took away almost 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.889
 nothing half life took away the other 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.989
 vessel now let me do that 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.970
 pulling of immense broadsides because 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.090
 even at 73 percent it's pretty easy 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.560
 let's get rid of a vessel anyway 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.120
 been lucky that half the life 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.650
 the other had already taken it from him otherwise 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.500
 of the lines of this vessel to think 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.959
 business surely and therefore as you see 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.250
 with this method it is very easy 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.530
 board her because this way me 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.139
 I can already go at him and skip them 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.849
 having left my ship anyway 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.379
 practically intact because if you look 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.780
 there is no health of my ship either 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.419
 a damage but not a line and 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.879
 what is nice about this in this 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.530
 close here there will be many more 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.599
 English vessels or in any case English ships 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.030
 in general, how many there are 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.419
 they will be from Spanish vessels or in 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.310
 average there are two English vessels for each 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.259
 Spanish vessel consequently you 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.120
 you will almost always have to skip those 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.439
 Spanish 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.419
 so you who do see the battle 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.709
 that you are bombarding veins a 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.810
 away and don't shoot 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.190
 until they practically stop them 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.990
 because sooner or later one of the vessels will 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.710
 he retires because he was too damaged 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.870
 various things 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.690
 that point you and 2 networks intervene 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.180
 attack only the vessel that is alone 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.039
 because if you attack maybe I do a 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.530
 example that is two English vessels one 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.240
 Spanish the Spanish one is intact and of 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.190
 the English ones there is one intact and one 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.690
 which is practically going to sink 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.669
 you must continue to go against 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.440
 the Spanish one because it doesn't have one 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.150
 other ships while the English vessels 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.919
 are they have stocks behind 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.520
 brigantini and frigates that are one thing 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.310
 Crazy 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.349
 however once this is done not 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.509
 you will have to make another note that to approach 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:05:00.280
 the Spanish vessel and beware that 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.289
 what a class and now now with the blowgun 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.830
 property from a meter and a half of 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:10.330
 distance makes sleeping that does anyway 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.610
 nothing you need to do is board the ship 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.110
 do the tasks you will be assigned 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.120
 as I am showing you before precisely 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.680
 he made off the crew he found 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.320
 one thing to take out the crew myself 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.139
 I have seen several videos on youtube and I have 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.000
 ever noticed that no one before 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.530
 get on the opposing ship shoot with i 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.880
 rotating guns, ie those with which he has 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.889
 fired at the start before getting on 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.080
 on the opposing vessel it does not 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.610
 no one and I don't know why there 's shots 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.789
 little girls who end up there for the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.770
 business maybe you can shoot 45 on 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.570
 moment but note the boarding ended 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.430
 strokes recharge by themselves ie you can 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.949
 use them endlessly I don't know if 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.259
 you have understood what is also very useful for 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.120
 take out opposing goals first 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.400
 still to climb especially when 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.340
 I don't know about schooners 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.539
 stuff here those cannons can make you 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.550
 let you win the battle 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.740
 of the boarding even before it begins 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.930
 really guys i'm not kidding e 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.300
 so now look at the murder on this one 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.509
 captain but it's something of a leap 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.909
 from 20 meters to 30 meters I don't know how many it was 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.469
 but rather high and therefore nothing in 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.020
 this way you will have approached a 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.930
 really easy and easy vessel 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.389
 fast and no guys so this 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.400
 video let's call it tutorial ends here 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.940
 obviously after taking a vessel 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.759
 I live in my fleet and instant 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.930
 nothing if you want more videos like that 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:32.330
 veal and I hope it was enough 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.830
 interesting bono never finished 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.729
 hello to all of you guys the next one 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.729
 video Assilli
