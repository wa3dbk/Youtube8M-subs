well<00:00:22.020> not<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.830> focus<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.400> hard<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:24.180> that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
well not that one focus is hard not that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
well not that one focus is hard not that
one<00:00:24.510> either<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:25.230> everything<00:00:25.859> looks<00:00:26.070> good<00:00:26.279> on

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
one either that everything looks good on

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370 
one either that everything looks good on
the<00:00:26.550> back<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> camera<00:00:27.180> LCD<00:00:27.449> these<00:00:28.019> are<00:00:28.140> not

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the back of a camera LCD these are not

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.609 
the back of a camera LCD these are not
precision<00:00:29.369> monitoring<00:00:30.269> devices<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:31.230> but

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
precision monitoring devices right but

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.990 
precision monitoring devices right but
that<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> much

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that one is we do and we have a much

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.370 
that one is we do and we have a much
bigger<00:00:33.149> screen<00:00:33.510> there<00:00:33.660> which<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:33.840> helps

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
bigger screen there which really helps

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.350 
bigger screen there which really helps
however<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.280> cinema<00:00:35.640> cameras<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.000> actually

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
however the cinema cameras have actually

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
however the cinema cameras have actually
a<00:00:36.390> couple<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.960> neat<00:00:37.110> features<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.800> make

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a couple really neat features to make

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.850 
a couple really neat features to make
manual<00:00:38.760> focusing<00:00:39.480> pretty<00:00:39.840> easy<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.620> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
manual focusing pretty easy on this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.930 
manual focusing pretty easy on this
camera<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.190> actually<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> focus

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
camera I actually just have a focus

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.330 
camera I actually just have a focus
button<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.559> full<00:00:43.829> manual

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
button and because it's a full manual

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040 
button and because it's a full manual
lens<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> camera<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.840> have

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
lens that I have this camera and I have

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.510 
lens that I have this camera and I have
this<00:00:46.200> particular<00:00:46.410> camera<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> MFT

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
this particular camera is the MFT

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
this particular camera is the MFT
version<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.750> Blackmagic<00:00:49.200> Cinema<00:00:49.260> Camera

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
version of the Blackmagic Cinema Camera

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.889 
version of the Blackmagic Cinema Camera
it's<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.430> an<00:00:50.579> active<00:00:51.090> mount<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.539> means<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
it's not an active mount so it means it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.350 
it's not an active mount so it means it
doesn't<00:00:51.930> communicate<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> lens

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
doesn't communicate at all with a lens

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
doesn't communicate at all with a lens
even<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.870> had<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> lens<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.949> supported

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
even if I had a lens that supported

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
even if I had a lens that supported
manual<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.020> automatic<00:00:58.020> aperture<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
manual you know a automatic aperture and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
manual you know a automatic aperture and
focus<00:00:59.190> control<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:00:59.969> doing<00:01:00.090> everything

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
focus control so I'm doing everything

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.660 
focus control so I'm doing everything
fully<00:01:00.930> manual<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.890> camera<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.370> because

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
fully manual on this camera and because

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
fully manual on this camera and because
of<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.329> really<00:01:03.629> check<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.290> my

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
of that I need to really check that my

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.140 
of that I need to really check that my
focus<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.920> working<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> press<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
focus is working so when I press the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
focus is working so when I press the
focus<00:01:06.479> button<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.840> happens<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
focus button what happens here is that I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
focus button what happens here is that I
get<00:01:08.220> some<00:01:08.400> peaking<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> display<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
get some peaking on the display here and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.450 
get some peaking on the display here and
then<00:01:10.500> some<00:01:10.680> peaking<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.070> we're<00:01:11.189> running<00:01:11.369> out

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
then some peaking that we're running out

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.039 
then some peaking that we're running out
there<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> looks<00:01:12.479> over<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.900> look

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
there now it looks over here if you look

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.300 
there now it looks over here if you look
at<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> big<00:01:13.350> monitor<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.710> looks<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.979> Jason

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
at the big monitor it looks like Jason

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.999 
at the big monitor it looks like Jason
has<00:01:14.820> some<00:01:15.150> sort<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.420> fungus<00:01:15.930> growing<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.680> over

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
has some sort of fungus growing all over

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.910 
has some sort of fungus growing all over
his<00:01:17.280> face<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.540> his<00:01:18.689> body

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
his face right and all over his body

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.469 
his face right and all over his body
that's<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.150> its

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that's not what that is it's just its

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.730 
that's not what that is it's just its
focus<00:01:21.869> peaking<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.530> allow<00:01:22.680> me

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
focus peaking that's going to allow me

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
focus peaking that's going to allow me
to<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.119> texture<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.720> know

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to where I see that texture that I know

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
to where I see that texture that I know
that<00:01:25.259> things<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.860> relatively<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.640> focus

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that things are relatively in focus

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.580 
that things are relatively in focus
right<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.840> other<00:01:27.990> cool<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
right there the other cool thing is that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
right there the other cool thing is that
because<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> touchscreen<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.240> just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
because this is a touchscreen I can just

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
because this is a touchscreen I can just
double<00:01:30.570> tap<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> image<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.979> doesn't

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
double tap on the image now it doesn't

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
double tap on the image now it doesn't
go<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> SDI<00:01:33.030> output<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
go out to the SDI output but on the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.590 
go out to the SDI output but on the
camera<00:01:34.439> itself<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.340> sort<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> zoomed<00:01:36.420> in
