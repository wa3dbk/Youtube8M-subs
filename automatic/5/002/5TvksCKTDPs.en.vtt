00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.630
 the pleasure of meeting the cavalier mario boselli was not extinguished 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.129
 president of the fashion room good evening cavagna welcome to the evening 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.969
 eheheh thanks for the Italian post office 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.630
 Knight was we cut the love chamber right away in the fashion room 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.289
 very important for the spread of made in italy in the world but what are the 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.349
 main functions synthetic way of the fashion chamber 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.989
 given only to see the inter a nice replacement question 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.060
 in Italy abroad I must say that maybe 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.480
 the best results have been achieved abroad 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.830
 since in 2001 an alliance was signed with me to the sister organization 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.910
 French 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.450
 chaired by tgcom bank 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.690
 and then 17 January 2005 8 reconfirmed this alliance by reaching the sea. 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.310
 this allowed assimil French but here sint or later 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.290
 once slow, becoming a reference point for all fashion 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.420
 week of the world that is, today is not going 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.620
 you change a nanny without asking without having agreed with us 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.700
 besides of course speech of the chocolatier calendars of so many things on the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.510
 international plan 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.510
 this is for the various authorities 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.539
 prosecutor asks whether to colleagues 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.580
 as regards ferrara to the representation in Italy speech 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.370
 for me it was a little more complex for the prophet at home 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.650
 not always 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.570
 they are successful but I think it has a decent discount at the central level 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.770
 government 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.820
 it is a good listening at a local level, especially the Milan municipality 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.620
 we are working very well enough to remember difficult projects 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.390
 full 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.450
 keygen recently also with the Lombardy region and with the province started a 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.240
 little 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.990
 kind of coloring that can count good companies 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.070
 secondary perhaps the most 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.129
 known to the public 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.290
 that of the organization of its important monuments in Milan cap rossi 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.399
 projected internationally 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.989
 the two editions of milano moda donna 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.979
 they are also organized with our location 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.679
 the 2 men's fashion edition of milan 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.699
 apple last from tele2 diction milan fashion showroom 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.459
 which was so successful as to push us 2008 fans doubled 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.109
 the duration of performance from 10 to 20 days together with the winter edition that 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.749
 the summer one 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.889
 third and final area those of special projects 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.059
 where is it 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:52.139
 precisely because they are special projects each time a focus 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.859
 on the particular topic second place mentioned 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.779
 some therefore as an example contact log 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.889
 in-depth way of the city of fashion 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.959
 of the fight against counterfeiting 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.819
 of training 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.849
 and other themes more or less Tridentine 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.849
 to improve the sector of its actors 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.209
 commercially face aspect finance worker and one so strong with 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.529
 dollar so weak what it was 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:27.679
 these people take so many things are endless 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.559
 and now the negative effects as it is beginning to have them 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:38.379
 both in the upstream part of the fiat in Italian of the textiles milk fabrics 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.719
 because obviously the products that are imported in competition with the 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.319
 mountain companies 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.749
 enters the fortress of infinitely lower prices then 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.139
 highly competitive 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.169
 they operate destructively on companies that 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:04:00.029
 being placed therefore Italian is fundamental of cost 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:03.029
 which we well know rmk limited with pet 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.619
 but the strong dollar also hurts our endurance 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.619
 in the dollar area you have to remember that 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:16.090
 let's not just talk about the united states of america the reality 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.389
 and to which we support in very club women it treats of simple states 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.479
 of america 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.379
 and this unfortunately the overwhelming 7 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:25.809
 why 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:29.389
 6 or 9 months ago clothes were made with 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.229
 do not tolerate 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.920
 product type of the euro 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.729
 from about 1 and 30 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.749
 the price lists 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.449
 we are doing now 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.300
 sono - 1 45 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.030
 here are these 15 points of difference 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.870
 only 15 points greater than 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.199
 omegle 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.780
 karel the importer of our products that will be moved to the born 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:58.520
 therefore it will have consequences 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.990
 if not on all software products - 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.550
 certainly representative of gigi gigi d'alessio 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.110
 will absorb quoted productive teapot aphorisms we must you my countries as 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.879
 the China 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.159
 the city 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.249
 he did great 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.529
 disasters especially 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.529
 in 2005 when the system ended 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.749
 of quotas associated with the agreement to mount multi-fiber 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:30.939
 ebay 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.939
 luckily he noticed gaeta gaeta 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.549
 in the sense that mendelssohn attacks with deputy minister 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.550
 Chinese foreign trade 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.550
 the topic production 20 quotas 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.839
 are dozens of products 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.800
 death will come live 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.580
 with the 31 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.580
 December of this faith and reason 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.710
 enya cows 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.119
 Also here 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:04.749
 from the beginning of 2008 there will be some not particularly positive movements 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.639
 However 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.879
 we think he will not be a man by the sea 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.639
 to put it all, like what happened at the beginning of 2005 because 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.419
 the conditions have changed, especially in China 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.949
 tower 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.699
 next to a slight - competitiveness of the country 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.879
 there has been an explosion of Chinese domestic consumption with occasionally I go for 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.599
 I love them 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.949
 for the increase the telekinesis consumption for the hooks 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.169
 dressmakers clothes 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.569
 fashion star of our lawn readers 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.939
 30 have that before you even buy 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.979
 these products I buy new many products 

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.059
 of Chinese industries then of the Chinese up 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.719
 promotions in Chinese and what it does 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:02.490
 reduces the pressure to export 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.460
 the part these companies change this 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.249
 what I believe 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:09.379
 can you 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.449
 to worry a little less than in 2005 

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:15.819
 let's say you can also be Italian 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.830
 I love further modified so that you dream 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:22.339
 their own 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:27.669
 situations on the one hand, competitiveness with miracle localizations 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:30.289
 on the other 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:34.469
 convert a push to position yourself higher and higher then 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:38.909
 raise - subject to tourism competitiveness
