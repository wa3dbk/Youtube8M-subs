00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:20.260
 How is the cat that is prepared in parallel with the making of hoho and supports our hotel come out 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:23.300
 Let's see how the difference in appearance was depending on the rice 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.039
 Fine leave hair prior to the date around 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.039
 I tried to dig out a share 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.509
 If you try to wash out the roots cleanly 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.360
 Penetration through the lower board at the time just before slightly coming out 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.360
 You can see that thick sound is out 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:54.570
 This sound has just come out so far right now 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.570
 It has a completely different nature from the sound that comes out after this 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:09.820
 Growth the way of roots How different As the rice growth 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:13.750
 According to the researcher of the researcher , the initial sound of 1000 going relatively sticks to the surface 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.520
 The following is extending so oblique 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.610
 The next is put directly below the department of gramineous 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.200
 Referred to as the now directly under this 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:30.670
 And the sound that comes out last is the upper eye 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.670
 Then let's introduce the fact of whole story height smile smile judgment method 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:44.890
 Protection violation count will check the oa date of the drop to predict the inner to moisture 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:51.040
 Even if you trust the amount of growth , you will not miss too much 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:59.880
 We judge whether it is easy to duplicate and move smile period of this year back and forth 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.880
 Three of the lathe is done in actual smile month before and one month of Hyo' moisture 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:16.490
 Already paid also aquaculture Speaking 1 month ago flood 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.490
 The occurrence of the split also fits in and making is beginning 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:33.250
 First select the average tab 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.250
 Let's remove the tallest part from the stem base 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.270
 This is mostly for parents 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:52.430
 Use a cutter to squeeze the stem base of the stem and put out the water for this baby 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:57.210
 It is a method to examine the number of days until heading time by amniotic fluid length 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:02.240
 The irrigation water can not be seen with naked eye 30 days before the flood 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.240
 If you see it, it is proof that the growth of the rice has been accelerated 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.549
 There was amniotic fluid 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.700
 Let's dye it with an iodine tincture so that it can be viewed with a camera 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.800
 The villa's villa is a popular route 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.800
 You can see the white amniotic fluid above it 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:36.629
 Amniotic fluid is 2 mm in length 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.629
 Situation 2 mm is about 23 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:52.020
 Harvested field position has been speaking to various things to us 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:57.350
 The photo shows various damage dragons found in brown rice 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:01.040
 It is a damage that white or something like this is called white immature grains 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.630
 Mainly when you want to encounter abnormal high temperature 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.240
 new Hakuryu 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.860
 Heart flow 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.650
 Back White 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:19.340
 It is said that some immature flow is likely to occur 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:19.340
 You can also see if corn has caused a lucky failure of rice over the same period 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:31.580
 The cloudiness found in brown rice is due to lack of starch in that part 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:35.479
 It is a manifestation of a state in which the starch has been destroyed and air has entered. 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.880
 Left is normal brown rice starch flow 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:48.830
 It was taken by electron microscope 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:48.830
 The right is the starch flow of the cloudy part, and it is possible to see the small hole by the cone on the surface
