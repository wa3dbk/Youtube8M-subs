I don't know this gun has something as

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.820 
I don't know this gun has something as
the<00:01:15.880> animation<00:01:16.750> from<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.049> sp9<00:01:17.350> heat<00:01:17.590> which<00:01:17.799> is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
the animation from the sp9 heat which is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.010 
the animation from the sp9 heat which is
an<00:01:18.130> amazing<00:01:18.490> sniper<00:01:18.700> rifle<00:01:19.180> but<00:01:19.420> it's<00:01:19.780> a

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
an amazing sniper rifle but it's a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.840 
an amazing sniper rifle but it's a
little<00:01:20.170> bit<00:01:20.380> faster<00:01:20.530> on<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.370> skull<00:01:21.580> Philippe

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
little bit faster on the skull Philippe

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.090 
little bit faster on the skull Philippe
I<00:01:22.000> know<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.360> animation<00:01:22.870> seems<00:01:23.200> slower<00:01:23.680> for<00:01:24.040> me

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
I know the animation seems slower for me

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.280 
I know the animation seems slower for me
I<00:01:24.400> don't<00:01:24.820> know<00:01:24.909> why<00:01:25.120> but<00:01:25.450> it's<00:01:26.020> just<00:01:26.200> my

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
I don't know why but it's just my

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.190 
I don't know why but it's just my
opinion<00:01:26.680> maybe<00:01:26.860> then<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:28.180> has<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.510> very<00:01:28.960> very

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
opinion maybe then it has a very very

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.980 
opinion maybe then it has a very very
good<00:01:29.650> he<00:01:29.860> fire<00:01:30.070> accuracy<00:01:30.610> in<00:01:31.270> my<00:01:31.450> opinion<00:01:31.690> has

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
good he fire accuracy in my opinion has

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.870 
good he fire accuracy in my opinion has
an<00:01:32.200> even<00:01:32.470> better<00:01:32.710> he<00:01:32.920> fire<00:01:33.130> accuracy<00:01:33.549> in<00:01:33.820> a

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
an even better he fire accuracy in a

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.789 
an even better he fire accuracy in a
skull<00:01:34.060> belief<00:01:34.299> she's<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.869> best<00:01:35.110> one<00:01:35.290> he<00:01:35.590> fire

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
skull belief she's the best one he fire

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.399 
skull belief she's the best one he fire
sniper<00:01:36.400> rifle<00:01:36.940> so<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.780> my<00:01:37.869> opinion<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.260> one

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
sniper rifle so in my opinion this one

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.340 
sniper rifle so in my opinion this one
is<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.619> best<00:01:38.799> of<00:01:39.010> keep<00:01:39.220> firing<00:01:39.869> sniper<00:01:40.869> rifle

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
is the best of keep firing sniper rifle

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.730 
is the best of keep firing sniper rifle
then<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.460> has<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.729> real-time<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.780> slow<00:01:44.170> or<00:01:44.590> the

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
then it has a real-time the slow or the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.640 
then it has a real-time the slow or the
fast<00:01:45.070> one<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.490> 2.7<00:01:46.330> seconds<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:47.170> long<00:01:47.350> one<00:01:47.619> I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
fast one of 2.7 seconds and a long one I

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.539 
fast one of 2.7 seconds and a long one I
think<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:48.100> 4.2<00:01:48.939> seconds<00:01:49.390> which<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.659> decent<00:01:49.990> but

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
think is 4.2 seconds which is decent but

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.460 
think is 4.2 seconds which is decent but
those<00:01:51.549> are<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:51.880> advantages<00:01:52.150> what<00:01:53.110> these

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
those are the advantages what these

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.130 
those are the advantages what these
advantages<00:01:54.189> have<00:01:54.400> this<00:01:54.640> time<00:01:54.880> well<00:01:55.299> it<00:01:55.750> has<00:01:56.110> a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
advantages have this time well it has a

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.039 
advantages have this time well it has a
very<00:01:56.680> very<00:01:57.070> high<00:01:57.790> bullet<00:01:58.210> drop<00:01:58.450> which<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:58.869> not

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
very very high bullet drop which is not

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.260 
very very high bullet drop which is not
good<00:01:59.080> for<00:01:59.380> long-range<00:02:00.009> sniping<00:02:00.369> exactly<00:02:01.150> like

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
good for long-range sniping exactly like

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.380 
good for long-range sniping exactly like
the<00:02:01.420> m40<00:02:01.900> but<00:02:02.200> even<00:02:02.470> worse<00:02:02.799> then<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:04.090> bullet

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
the m40 but even worse then the bullet

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.749 
the m40 but even worse then the bullet
speed<00:02:04.600> is<00:02:04.810> not<00:02:05.080> as<00:02:05.259> amazing<00:02:05.470> as<00:02:05.799> well<00:02:05.979> so<00:02:06.369> long

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
speed is not as amazing as well so long

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.809 
speed is not as amazing as well so long
when<00:02:06.939> typing<00:02:07.240> not<00:02:08.019> too<00:02:08.200> much<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:09.429> in<00:02:09.700> my

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
when typing not too much so in my

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.520 
when typing not too much so in my
opinion<00:02:09.909> this<00:02:10.239> gun<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.509> made<00:02:11.049> for

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
opinion this gun is made for

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.530 
opinion this gun is made for
close-quarter<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.459> mean<00:02:12.730> not<00:02:12.939> really<00:02:13.180> close

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
close-quarter I mean not really close

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.530 
close-quarter I mean not really close
for<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> medium<00:02:14.230> range<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:15.159> may<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.579> made<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.269> be

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
for a medium range it may is made to be

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.690 
for a medium range it may is made to be
used<00:02:16.780> for<00:02:17.260> aggressive<00:02:17.560> recon<00:02:17.769> because<00:02:18.370> it's<00:02:18.610> a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
used for aggressive recon because it's a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.699 
used for aggressive recon because it's a
very<00:02:18.730> small<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.629> I<00:02:19.930> think<00:02:20.260> that's<00:02:20.410> why<00:02:20.650> it

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
very small and I think that's why it

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.809 
very small and I think that's why it
comes<00:02:21.040> with<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> suppressor<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.580> gun<00:02:24.790> has

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
comes with a suppressor so this gun has

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:25.350 
comes with a suppressor so this gun has
a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
a

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.320 
a
