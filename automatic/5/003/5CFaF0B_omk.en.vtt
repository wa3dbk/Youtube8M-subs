00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.139
 furry hi guys with you leopards and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.200
 this next one can say global 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.839
 update and so was made full 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.050
 rebalance craft now your shooting range 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.050
 The flexible bed depends on her citrus 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.560
 also from the level of modules and in particular 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.439
 level guns installing gun 10 lvl you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.779
 automatically become the tenth tyr 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.510
 even if before all your craft 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.270
 fit the first dash the same 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.850
 happens when you exceed 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.420
 allowable limit for example: 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.750
 only your craft will start to occupy 1404 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.180
 Circus 9 Tire will be replaced by the tenth 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.430
 developers decided to fight with pedobira 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.129
 my who being pumped them better 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.739
 novices built craft and out of reach 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.559
 on this dash of blocks and modules 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.829
 from now on you can only build on a par 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.290
 with everyone and nobody canceled the skill 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.710
 just build a good craft and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.979
 dare nothing bad about it personally 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.890
 I played one fight and realized that I was dragging 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.850
 far not skill namely pedobir sky 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.100
 crib 4 shooting but now it's craft 5 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.710
 shooting gallery where it is carried along with others 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.590
 Well, all this is basically for me 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.990
 I liked it but the blocks 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.030
 Now you can not put the blocks too 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.520
 low level for your shooting range 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.579
 which means that many decor craft and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.950
 just went into oblivion for example 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.070
 my kamazik which was used 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.170
 first level blocks when trying to exit 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 fight you see this message 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.000
 which means that on your craft 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.640
 blocks too low 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.680
 level pleases only one in the game 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.380
 there were really cool 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.640
 innovations that sweeten everything 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.189
 the foregoing 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.950
 now in the game you can put a label on 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.250
 card vote for surrender 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.330
 admire the statistics well and sad 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.509
 a few minutes 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.910
 waiting for a penalty for escaping from the battlefield penalty 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.910
 really funny at the moment 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.330
 poked around in the nose and back into battle so 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.340
 That will focus on the previous three 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.010
 innovations and so clicking during the battle 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.470
 on the control key and clicking on 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.200
 minimap you put one of the three 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.810
 markers to select the necessary 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.630
 hold down the left mouse button drag 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.680
 cursor on the icon that interests you 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.350
 danger i go here well and all here 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.160
 the marker will be visible for a while 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.959
 minimap and what is the most interesting 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.050
 directly on the location itself that 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.170
 just incredibly comfortable and very cool 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.740
 looks the same from the 5th minute of the battle 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.130
 any player can click a button 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.890
 surrender 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.860
 will start voting to surrender 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.870
 an opponent without a fight if at least two 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.170
 man will vote against it 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.010
 capitulation not take a vote for 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.800
 and against is done with buttons y and and 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.080
 accordingly if you are hopeless 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.370
 merge why not surrender and not 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.100
 start the fight again 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.739
 you even loot thrown as a simple 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.350
 defeat so the function is definitely 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.260
 useful especially when half the team 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.320
 not even swinging to second level 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.420
 Now a few words about statistics clicking on 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.269
 tab during the battle you can admire 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.060
 on their combat results compare them with 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.160
 its with platoon sheep teammates and 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.730
 rivals can also sort 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.730
 list by various damage type criteria 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.820
 frags and so on for fusion 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.220
 the towers now they are not 4 and three 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.769
 This means that one of the teams is always 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.380
 will possess more of your 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.050
 that is, dominate a couple 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.560
 little things developers have accelerated the process 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.320
 reach level 100 by as much as 30 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.040
 percent now the player is pumping up and up 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.440
 10 tira will have at its disposal 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.200
 approximately 90 level also appeared 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.570
 carbon transport and 10 bought 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.410
 only for donat is no different from 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.200
 the usual 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.110
 aster but he damn beautiful and 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.720
 now slave shock added three to it 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.120
 new crafting which replaced a bunch 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.310
 previous buildings ad-free jam 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.070
 if i have free parts to 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.370
 another, I will definitely roll back a couple 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.790
 battles on each of them and will release 3 video 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.610
 from the rubric run around I will try very hard 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.940
 do it but not guarantee so as you 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.590
 don't believe i got a job and 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.470
 I have free time now 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.810
 virtually no need to delve into the new 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.660
 the post they play square 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.870
 robots okay i'm naturally robocraft 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.430
 I will not abandon just videos will come out 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.250
 rarely enough, thank you all for 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.820
 understanding and by and large on this 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.640

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.560
