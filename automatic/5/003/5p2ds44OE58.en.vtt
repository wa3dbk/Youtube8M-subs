00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
can see a little bit more of the line

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.380 
can see a little bit more of the line
now<00:03:37.730> as<00:03:38.730> far<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.570> goes<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:41.010> can<00:03:41.280> make<00:03:42.240> it
