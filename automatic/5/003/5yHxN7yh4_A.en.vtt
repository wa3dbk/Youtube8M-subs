00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.090
 night monitor light illuminates my 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.880
 half closed eyes only luscious taste 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.820
 cold coffee prevents them from closing 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.070
 completely my hand lazily stretches to 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.380
 mouse clicks on the button next series 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.920
 a string of events alone characters 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.939
 replaced by others again come back 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.219
 old is a vicious circle from which 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.110
 there is only one way out 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.579
 even if you stop watching now 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.969
 you will come back to this then she will return 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.530
 I pulled the cord out of the socket 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.399
 Mom continued to swallow the ice cream in 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.170
 laptops have built-in batteries 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.969
 up to something like the viewing tool 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.329
 of room if to exclude from it the main 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.329
 component 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:17.919
 [music] 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.090
 hello friends my name is steve and 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.610
 Today we will talk about to love ru 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.080
 but rather what is not so fru to start 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.900
 let's bring some clarity 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.520
 here is this string genre bizim comedy 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.390
 romance with the game 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.369
 you already feel this anticipation 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.080
 unforgettable 20 hours of viewing 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.190
 unique unique single 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.780
 the genre they do not have that same congratulations from 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.550
 you have the ability to be rational 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.590
 thinking or at least a little experience 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.360
 choosing them exactly from here then we 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.950
 Let's start there were times when I watched everything 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.320
 indiscriminately it was then I met 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.440
 with such titles as the Lady Kanokon 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.390
 against the butler keys axis and i'm for sure 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.660
 I can say what to expect this love 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.490
 ru 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.700
 and what's not worth it with the first we all 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.580
 elementary fan service very much 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.840
 fan service of the most diverse 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.269
 almost everything you could do 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.830
 think as part of the censorship of television 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.390
 Of course there is to love ru 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.459
 But with the second paragraph we have a few 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.019
 harder actually stupid to expect 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.000
 something like good fiction from 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.890
 haremnik and no it is not here and never will be 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.660
 don't even try to hide behind it 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.549
 justify your viewing and also here 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.019
 there will be no deep plot that will 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.930
 keep you at the screen from start to finish 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.489
 Well, you ask, but what then? 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.829
 sense i'm not saying that all harem nicknames 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.600
 completely devoid of the plot the same dx 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.519
 dy makes the viewer constantly wait 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.560
 development of events to love-ru just 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.140
 gives us a situation here we have a school 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.500
 protagonist tutu girls tutu 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.180
 weird girls and everything usually from 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.070
 series in a series nothing new almost 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.160
 happens except that girls change with 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.670
 which vita supposedly comes closer and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.360
 the circumstance under which this 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.769
 happens 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.810
 it all works in the same way 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.850
 here she is almost ready to surrender to him 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.040
 something happens this is something their 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.769
 stops they stop ending 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.090
 opening new girl yes even after 10 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.930
 20 30 episodes are generally doing 2 episodes and 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.120
 and complete two episodes of 12 of 12 of you 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.459

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.459
 nudity while cellular passes and 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.590
 satisfied by not doing what is right 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.450
 the store goes and buys the publishing bureau for 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.920
 35 dollars actually the whole plot 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.049

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.629
 resent such acts but not 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.610
 less in the world a huge number of people 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.709

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.829
 look at mom in the shower how does it affect 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.630
 it does so the industry as a whole has 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.250
 a similar study involved such as the fila 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.720
 and where the rivers about this can not even 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.730
 think but the fact remains 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.129
