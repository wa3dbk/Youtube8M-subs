00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
doubt by now and we still got a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.600

Lollapalooza and outside lands to go to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.220 
Lollapalooza and outside lands to go to
so<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.090> both<00:00:36.690> those<00:00:36.899> should<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.079> pretty

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
so that both those should be pretty

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.530 
so that both those should be pretty
awesome<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.550> any<00:00:38.760> distinct

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
awesome is there any distinct

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.030 
awesome is there any distinct
differences<00:00:39.989> between<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.469> festivals<00:00:40.950> like

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
differences between the festivals like

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.700 
differences between the festivals like
East<00:00:41.340> Coast<00:00:41.610> West<00:00:41.760> Coast<00:00:42.030> European<00:00:42.780> well<00:00:43.620> we

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
East Coast West Coast European well we

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
East Coast West Coast European well we
haven't<00:00:43.890> done<00:00:44.040> any<00:00:44.219> European<00:00:44.550> ones<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:44.940> there

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
haven't done any European ones but there

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
haven't done any European ones but there
definitely<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> difference<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.739> guess

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
definitely is a difference like I guess

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
definitely is a difference like I guess
each<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.610> its<00:00:47.640> own<00:00:47.879> identity<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.420> that's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
each one has its own identity and that's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.920 
each one has its own identity and that's
what's<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.200> whole<00:00:49.410> bottom<00:00:49.739> off<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.930> bonner
