00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.250 

the<00:01:28.550> one<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.030> always<00:01:29.240> comes<00:01:29.420> back<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.900> me

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
the one that always comes back to me

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.580

because<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:31.400> was<00:01:31.550> just<00:01:31.790> such<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.000> big<00:01:32.960> game<00:01:33.230> I

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
because it was just such a big game I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.310 
because it was just such a big game I
think<00:01:33.680> is<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.220> 96<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:35.420> know<00:01:35.540> game<00:01:35.780> against

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
think is the 96 you know game against

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.250 
think is the 96 you know game against
John<00:01:37.190> Smoltz<00:01:37.460> in<00:01:37.730> Atlanta<00:01:38.180> we<00:01:38.900> were<00:01:39.020> able<00:01:39.110> to

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
John Smoltz in Atlanta we were able to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.720 
John Smoltz in Atlanta we were able to
win<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.470> game<00:01:39.530> one<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.070> nothing<00:01:40.370> so<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.550> mean

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
win that game one and nothing so I mean

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.600 
win that game one and nothing so I mean
that<00:01:40.880> one<00:01:41.030> sticks<00:01:41.300> out<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.750> me<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:43.010> know<00:01:43.520> the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
that one sticks out to me you know the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.160 
that one sticks out to me you know the
World<00:01:43.820> Series<00:01:44.060> starts<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.690> seems<00:01:44.930> like

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
World Series starts it seems like

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.220 
World Series starts it seems like
they're<00:01:45.470> kind<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.890> bigger<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.940> know

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
they're kind of a bigger you know

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.700 
they're kind of a bigger you know
platform<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:50.600> know<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.810> them<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.320> those<00:01:51.440> kind

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
platform you know to them so those kind

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.100 
platform you know to them so those kind
of<00:01:51.800> stand<00:01:52.040> out<00:01:52.220> but<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.790> think<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.930> most

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
of stand out but I think the most

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.990 
of stand out but I think the most
gratifying<00:01:54.680> ones<00:01:55.010> are<00:01:55.160> sometimes<00:01:55.700> were<00:01:55.940> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
gratifying ones are sometimes were the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.790 
gratifying ones are sometimes were the
ones<00:01:56.240> when<00:01:56.450> we're<00:01:56.600> down<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.170> series<00:01:57.560> you
