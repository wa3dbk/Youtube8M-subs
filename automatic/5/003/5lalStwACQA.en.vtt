00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
actually what I used as liner today I

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.699 
actually what I used as liner today I
just<00:02:39.120> dipped<00:02:39.390> my<00:02:39.750> eyeliner<00:02:40.170> brush<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.680> water

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
just dipped my eyeliner brush in water

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.750 
just dipped my eyeliner brush in water
and<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:43.530> know<00:02:43.620> we've<00:02:43.739> got<00:02:43.920> some<00:02:44.250> eyeshadow<00:02:44.400> on

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
and you know we've got some eyeshadow on

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.180 
and you know we've got some eyeshadow on
it<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.330> lying<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.170> my<00:02:46.290> eyes<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.920> I

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it and then lying to my eyes with it I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.040 
it and then lying to my eyes with it I
think<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.730> would<00:02:47.910> make<00:02:48.030> such<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.300> pretty<00:02:48.630> smoky

think it would make such a pretty smoky
eye<00:02:49.489> it<00:02:50.489> actually<00:02:50.700> would<00:02:50.970> look<00:02:51.120> really<00:02:51.269> good

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
eye it actually would look really good

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.520

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
I've said this before but estee lauder

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.770 
I've said this before but estee lauder
was<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.390> brand<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.780> never<00:04:04.079> really<00:04:04.500> um<00:04:05.780> one

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
was a brand that I never really um one

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.720 
was a brand that I never really um one
and<00:04:06.989> looked<00:04:07.470> at<00:04:07.650> really<00:04:08.010> because<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.340> reminded

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
and looked at really because it reminded

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.819 
and looked at really because it reminded
me<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.850> like<00:04:08.940> my<00:04:09.180> grandma's<00:04:09.569> makeup<00:04:09.900> brand<00:04:10.170> but

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
me of like my grandma's makeup brand but

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.860 
me of like my grandma's makeup brand but
they<00:04:10.980> have<00:04:11.190> definitely<00:04:11.790> like<00:04:12.209> up<00:04:12.389> the<00:04:12.540> ante

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
they have definitely like up the ante

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.349 
they have definitely like up the ante
and<00:04:13.170> they've<00:04:13.950> definitely<00:04:14.489> been<00:04:14.790> marketing

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
and they've definitely been marketing

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.659 
and they've definitely been marketing
themselves<00:04:15.510> towards<00:04:16.139> a<00:04:16.260> younger<00:04:16.470> group<00:04:17.430> I

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
themselves towards a younger group I

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.770 
themselves towards a younger group I
think<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.030> before<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.299> said<00:04:18.479> I<00:04:18.539> think<00:04:18.600> it's

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
think it before I said I think it's

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.120 
think it before I said I think it's
because<00:04:18.900> I'm<00:04:19.139> getting<00:04:19.380> older<00:04:19.680> which<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.010> may

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
because I'm getting older which that may
