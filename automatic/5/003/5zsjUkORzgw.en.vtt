Snapdragon in the center and you want it
a<00:01:17.280> little<00:01:17.640> bit<00:01:17.820> off<00:01:18.210> center<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.350> don't<00:01:19.560> want

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
a little bit off center you don't want

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.609 
a little bit off center you don't want
it<00:01:19.920> precisely<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> center<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.470> I've

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it precisely in the center and then I've

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.550 
it precisely in the center and then I've
embellished<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.549> other<00:01:24.299> flowers<00:01:24.900> now

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
embellished it with other flowers now

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020 
embellished it with other flowers now
this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> line<00:01:26.340> flower<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
this is a line flower this is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
this is a line flower this is
leucadendron<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.200> what's<00:01:28.860> interesting<00:01:29.189> is

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
leucadendron and what's interesting is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.969 
leucadendron and what's interesting is
that<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.509> could<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> line<00:01:31.229> flower<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that it could be a line flower but I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.520 
that it could be a line flower but I
just<00:01:32.280> felt<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:32.880> too<00:01:33.270> heavy<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.079> this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
just felt it was too heavy for this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.399 
just felt it was too heavy for this
lighter<00:01:35.070> arrangement<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:37.079> cut<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
lighter arrangement so I just cut it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.300 
lighter arrangement so I just cut it
short<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.100> used<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.299> top<00:01:39.600> petals<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
short and used the top petals of it the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.870 
short and used the top petals of it the
face<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.570> add<00:01:42.840> beautiful<00:01:43.799> contrast<00:01:44.640> in

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
face of it to add beautiful contrast in

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.810 
face of it to add beautiful contrast in
color<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> add<00:01:47.579> different

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
color and you want to add different
