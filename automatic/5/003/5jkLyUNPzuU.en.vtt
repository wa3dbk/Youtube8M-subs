I<00:00:23.660> metal<00:00:24.660> holder<00:00:26.449> I'm<00:00:27.449> not<00:00:27.779> exactly<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.470> this

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
I metal holder I'm not exactly like this

I metal holder I'm not exactly like this
okay<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.330> could<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:31.140> something<00:00:31.850> that's<00:00:32.850> like

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
okay you could use something that's like

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.319 
okay you could use something that's like
this<00:00:33.649> but<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> holds<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.090> hold

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
this but it holds some that can hold

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.630 
this but it holds some that can hold
something<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.840> top<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.200> here

show you about this I'm gonna do and
take<00:01:56.479> any<00:01:57.320> two<00:01:57.619> dead<00:01:57.830> batteries<00:01:58.369> or<00:01:58.640> need<00:01:58.850> to

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
take any two dead batteries or need to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.920 
take any two dead batteries or need to
be<00:01:59.150> charged<00:01:59.590> I'm<00:02:00.590> going<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.340> see<00:02:01.550> one<00:02:02.450> battery

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
be charged I'm going to see one battery

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.790 
be charged I'm going to see one battery
that<00:02:03.229> has<00:02:03.260> oh<00:02:04.869> they'll<00:02:05.869> have<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.110> be<00:02:06.229> double-a

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
that has oh they'll have to be double-a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.699 
that has oh they'll have to be double-a
but<00:02:07.460> I'm<00:02:07.580> guessing<00:02:08.240> triple-a<00:02:08.989> can<00:02:09.229> work<00:02:09.440> too

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
but I'm guessing triple-a can work too

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:19.360 
but I'm guessing triple-a can work too
um<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:13.120> plus<00:02:14.120> here<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:16.630> positive<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.370> for

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
um this plus here the positive and for

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.479 
um this plus here the positive and for
the<00:02:19.430> other<00:02:19.580> battery<00:02:19.970> you'll<00:02:20.120> need<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.330> negative

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the other battery you'll need a negative

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.320 
the other battery you'll need a negative
so<00:02:22.489> looks<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:25.180> connect<00:02:26.180> them

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
so looks like that and just connect them

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.600 
so looks like that and just connect them
so<00:02:28.360> yeah<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.600> going<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.250> you'll<00:02:31.250> need

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
so yeah it's going like this you'll need

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.320 
so yeah it's going like this you'll need
a<00:02:31.910> tape<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.610> I'm<00:02:34.670> just<00:02:34.850> going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.030> set<00:02:35.239> them

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
a tape so I'm just going to set them

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:54.420 
a tape so I'm just going to set them
down<00:02:35.390> here<00:02:41.799> tape

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:17.760 

sorry<00:03:12.340> yes<00:03:13.340> yes<00:03:14.120> yeah<00:03:14.600> after<00:03:15.470> you

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.670 

so<00:03:18.770> yeah<00:03:19.070> you'll<00:03:19.310> get<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.640> prediction<00:03:20.650> take<00:03:21.650> a

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
so yeah you'll get a prediction take a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.730 
so yeah you'll get a prediction take a
cup<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.160> it

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:32.970 

take<00:03:25.460> this<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:29.560> slightly<00:03:30.560> tape<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.340> one

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
take this and slightly tape this one

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.110 
take this and slightly tape this one
down<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.730> right<00:03:35.120> there<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:36.590> take<00:03:37.160> this<00:03:37.430> one

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:49.750 

and<00:03:41.530> push<00:03:42.530> down<00:03:42.830> what<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:44.170> taping<00:03:45.170> bolt<00:03:48.760> with

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
and push down what and taping bolt with

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.160 
and push down what and taping bolt with
clear<00:03:50.090> tape

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.550 

make<00:03:54.170> sure<00:03:54.440> it's<00:03:54.709> tight<00:03:54.920> then<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.319> want

you<00:03:57.680> can<00:03:57.800> put<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.010> battery<00:03:58.220> there<00:03:59.740> just<00:04:00.740> put<00:04:01.010> it

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
you can put a battery there just put it

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
you can put a battery there just put it
there<00:04:01.250> for<00:04:01.310> movies<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.240> basically<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:04.120> make
