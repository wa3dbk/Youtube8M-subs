00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.000
 welcome to a special episode of 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.070
 devil 33 but only a few days 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.290
 before the season starts number 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.169
 2 surely you will have seen the 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.540
 news of the new legendaries as well 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.660
 as the beginning of the approximately 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.400
 season number 2 so we're going to 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.529
 be doing a little follow up on 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.590
 the videos in this season we're going to 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.310
 put a little more full in devil 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.310
 iii 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.450
 ancestral objects that's new what 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.670
 we have and what we can already permeate 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.670
 depending on the level of torment in the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.160
 game these objects will appear from the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.470
 torment 1 onwards obviously 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 the better the greater the torment for 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.440
 the probability of obtaining an object 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.900
 ancestral will do and even if 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.330
 we have the necessary materials 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.510
 to be able to create the object in this case if 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.900
 we use some as the as 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.130
 in my case that I still use power of 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.910
 useful made by the blacksmith there may be 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.400
 a probability of creating the object of 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.130
 set in this ancestral case and how 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960
 let's know they are ancestral good 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.540
 at the time they fall we will not know 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.720
 that are ancestral however we are going to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.320
 have to come to check in the book 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.370
 of kane or rather to identify them 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.590
 and can have it we can have the option 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.260
 of having found them that in this case 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.260
 Here we can see some gloves 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 gladiator who are legendary 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 ancestral 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.260
 and will improve statistics by 30% 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.520
 compared to the other gloves 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.429
 unfortunately I do not have here 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.829
 move the other but you can see 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.810
 that the box that is marked in color 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.970
 Golden 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.640
 and that means that it is ancestral 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.800
 apart from that obviously says in the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.099
 description wang legendary gloves 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.530
 ancestral and in those of ancestral 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.330
 will say wilderness of the ancestral set 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.650
 and it's going to be covered with a 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.480
 it's a golden frame so to speak this 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.550
 it means that it may be that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.260
 forward there are new objects more 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.170
 powerful that the ancestral one gives us a 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.810
 platinum frame a diamond frame already 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.170
 I 'm getting some link 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.170
 reading 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.810
 and obviously with this introduction of 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.110
 these new objects obviously people 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.970
 he's going to be looking for them since 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.500
 all the objects that they had right now and 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.810
 that could do it in torments and 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.080
 Imagine saying they have them all in mode 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.350
 ancestral will be much more serious 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.980
 so do not miss the opportunity 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.320
 She also has an option and more 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.590
 well a chance that you will fall 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.690
 ancestral object that in this case I'm going 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.040
 to buy something cheap because I do not have 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.980
 Many 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.950
 that will be good 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.800
 wilderness 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.790
 hold on to see what I'm going to buy gloves 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.790
 who use a 5 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.240
 Not too much, I only got a few 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.340
 that were the phoenix's we're going to check 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.220
 all these are obviously not going to 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.190
 come ancestral but let's see if at 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.420
 least I got something good 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.820
 unfortunately it is not a gloves 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.200
 normal because it does not have the framework 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.750
 golden although I can not see it 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.040
 up to the top but I know it could be said 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.129
 that you notice that it is not ancestral 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.040
 and that could change this all me but 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:58.200
 they are very two and so it is that of my part 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.810
 has been everything I hope you all 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.909
 are forming and if they do not try 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.310
 how to find them I already told them kill 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.980
 monsters in torment one towards 6 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.250
 while more or be the torture very much 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.359
 easier to find the items 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:20.030
 ancestral, so until next time 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:20.030
 share it and like if they liked charito
