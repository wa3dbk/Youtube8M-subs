00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.100
 We need a piece of ginger 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.740
 small holes grater 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:15.629
 a piece of house 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.090
 bottle and two plates and that's it and 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:22.200
 we always do 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.770
 we go the ginger and go a 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:37.130
 piece about the size of a finger 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:42.430
 thumb in this way so then 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.430
 let's have a ginger zest 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.390
 we are going to put it 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.730
 in another good dish I'm using a 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.920
 Nursing home 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.920
 one more is left in the subway 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.250
 we put here the extendable scratches 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.619
 and we squeeze 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.920
 in this way 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.720
 to the qadam in you that a 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.990
 liquid 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.510
 is also you 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.470
 a liquid extract 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.300
 of the gene here 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.500
 what we do with this extract 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.740
 that is, here you can see it there 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.740
 is 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.260
 we wet the herbs of the fingers of 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.430
 both hands 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.630
 in this liquid and we apply it in 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.770
 our head like a lotion for 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 The hair 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.440
 we return to wet the fingertips 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.900
 and we repeat the action 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.240
 until this liquid runs out good I 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.510
 I'm using this plastic head 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.430
 for the demonstration 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.740
 Y 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.640
 This head does not absorb 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.640
 the liquid 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.010
 in practice our head our 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.600
 skin will absorb all this liquid goes 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.600
 to penetrate our scalp 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.900
 and finished the process we will feel 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.690
 a feeling of freshness as of 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.990
 mint freshness on the head for about 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.100
 10 minutes and a smell of ginger 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.470
 About half an hour 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.660
 we let the ginger act for some 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.970
 hours if possible until the day 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.160
 following 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.590
 If your hair is wet at the time of 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.310
 sleeping can be dried with a dryer 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.300
 hair do not worry your pillow is not going 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.300
 to smell ginger
