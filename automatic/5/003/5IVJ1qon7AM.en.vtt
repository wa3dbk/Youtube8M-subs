00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.279 

though<00:01:42.879> then<00:01:43.879> here's<00:01:44.119> our<00:01:44.330> dark<00:01:44.899> Kabuto<00:01:47.289> and

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
though then here's our dark Kabuto and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.919 
though then here's our dark Kabuto and
if<00:01:48.379> you<00:01:48.500> notice<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:48.920> did<00:01:49.099> that<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.569> cell<00:01:50.569> metal

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
if you notice it did that a cell metal

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.600 
if you notice it did that a cell metal
sound<00:01:51.229> again<00:01:51.619> just<00:01:51.860> like<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.160> other<00:01:52.280> dark

rider<00:01:52.879> one<00:01:53.119> did<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:53.629> I<00:01:53.660> guess<00:01:53.899> that's<00:01:54.080> just

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
rider one did so I guess that's just

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.410 
rider one did so I guess that's just
kind<00:01:54.979> of<00:01:55.069> how<00:01:55.160> they're<00:01:55.429> doing<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.910> there

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
kind of how they're doing that there

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.940 
kind of how they're doing that there
wasn't<00:01:56.569> just<00:01:56.720> some<00:01:57.020> kind<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.259> mistake<00:01:57.410> of<00:01:57.800> any

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
wasn't just some kind of mistake of any

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:11.309 
wasn't just some kind of mistake of any
kind<00:01:58.220> then<00:01:58.910> hibiki<00:02:01.360> denno<00:02:04.450> akito<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:07.450> Kabuto

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.050 

so<00:02:12.319> those<00:02:12.500> are<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.739> sounds<00:02:12.980> now<00:02:13.519> take<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> look

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
so those are the sounds now take a look

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.490 
so those are the sounds now take a look
at<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.420> actual<00:02:14.750> metals<00:02:15.200> themselves<00:02:17.019> now<00:02:18.019> sigh

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
at the actual metals themselves now sigh

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.190 
at the actual metals themselves now sigh
I<00:02:18.530> think<00:02:18.980> it's<00:02:19.160> really<00:02:19.340> cool<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:20.569> not<00:02:20.900> as

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
I think it's really cool it's not as

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.110 
I think it's really cool it's not as
see-through<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.160> other<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:22.519> since<00:02:23.000> it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
see-through as the other one since it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.570 
see-through as the other one since it
has<00:02:23.269> that<00:02:23.480> whole<00:02:23.660> white<00:02:23.989> going<00:02:24.349> on<00:02:24.470> with<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.890> so

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
has that whole white going on with it so

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.339 
has that whole white going on with it so
you<00:02:25.640> can<00:02:25.760> see<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.150> front<00:02:26.450> here<00:02:26.510> then<00:02:27.110> on

combo that got me at first not sure of

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.990 
combo that got me at first not sure of
you<00:04:54.620> got<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.950> hear<00:04:55.160> that<00:04:55.220> well<00:04:55.460> enough<00:04:55.760> but

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
you got to hear that well enough but

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.390 
you got to hear that well enough but
took<00:04:56.600> me<00:04:56.780> quite<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.080> few<00:04:57.230> tries<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.560> get<00:04:57.919> it<00:04:58.100> so

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
took me quite a few tries to get it so

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.159 
took me quite a few tries to get it so
unfortunately<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:59.360> had<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.600> faced<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.080> other

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
unfortunately I had it faced the other

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.070 
unfortunately I had it faced the other
way<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:01.190> think<00:05:01.790> it<00:05:01.850> was<00:05:01.910> loud<00:05:02.120> enough<00:05:02.180> though<00:05:02.660> if

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
way I think it was loud enough though if

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.200 
way I think it was loud enough though if
not<00:05:03.320> then<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.950> guess<00:05:04.520> I<00:05:04.640> could<00:05:04.790> do<00:05:04.940> that<00:05:04.970> on

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
not then I guess I could do that on

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.930 
not then I guess I could do that on
another<00:05:05.419> video<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:06.130> comment<00:05:07.130> what<00:05:07.370> did<00:05:07.580> I<00:05:07.669> use

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
another video and comment what did I use

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.010 
another video and comment what did I use

for that I had Hibiki and denno that got

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.750 
for that I had Hibiki and denno that got
me<00:05:12.169> coming<00:05:12.590> or<00:05:12.890> at<00:05:13.039> least<00:05:13.100> what<00:05:13.340> i<00:05:13.370> think<00:05:13.640> is

have<00:05:43.820> been<00:05:44.090> fortunate<00:05:44.450> enough<00:05:44.630> to<00:05:44.810> have<00:05:44.930> it<00:05:45.140> in

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
have been fortunate enough to have it in

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.930 
have been fortunate enough to have it in
the<00:05:45.320> exact<00:05:45.740> position<00:05:45.919> to<00:05:46.370> hear<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.700> since

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
the exact position to hear it since

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.700 
the exact position to hear it since
apparently<00:05:47.600> it's<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:47.990> lot<00:05:48.140> harder<00:05:48.320> than<00:05:48.500> I

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
apparently it's a lot harder than I

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.029 
apparently it's a lot harder than I
thought<00:05:48.800> to<00:05:49.190> get<00:05:49.340> back<00:05:49.580> but<00:05:50.450> anyway<00:05:50.930> um<00:05:51.260> that's

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
thought to get back but anyway um that's

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.159 
thought to get back but anyway um that's
pretty<00:05:52.250> much<00:05:52.430> it<00:05:52.490> for<00:05:52.880> right<00:05:53.210> now<00:05:53.270> I<00:05:53.690> do<00:05:53.810> have

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
pretty much it for right now I do have

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.310 
pretty much it for right now I do have
my<00:05:54.500> retort<00:05:55.400> ah<00:05:55.550> combo<00:05:56.419> change<00:05:56.690> figure<00:05:57.020> on<00:05:57.200> the

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
my retort ah combo change figure on the

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.050 
my retort ah combo change figure on the
way<00:05:57.440> so<00:05:57.500> that<00:05:57.770> will<00:05:58.010> be<00:05:58.130> my<00:05:58.280> next<00:05:58.340> video<00:05:58.789> more

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
way so that will be my next video more

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.240 
way so that will be my next video more
than<00:05:59.180> likely<00:05:59.360> I've<00:06:00.140> been<00:06:00.350> trying<00:06:00.710> to<00:06:00.860> get<00:06:01.039> the

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
to get the metal set whenever I can so

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.779 
to get the metal set whenever I can so
until<00:06:30.530> then<00:06:30.710> like<00:06:30.979> I<00:06:31.070> said<00:06:31.130> the<00:06:31.340> next<00:06:31.490> one<00:06:31.760> is

until then like I said the next one is

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.330 
until then like I said the next one is
more<00:06:32.090> than<00:06:32.240> likely<00:06:32.419> going<00:06:32.810> to<00:06:32.930> be<00:06:33.140> the<00:06:33.710> retort

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
more than likely going to be the retort
