for<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.160> mileage<00:02:28.640> that's<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.630> correct<00:02:29.930> tact

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
for the mileage that's the correct tact

the<00:02:35.510> key<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:35.780> bug-eyes<00:02:36.380> was<00:02:36.680> normally<00:02:37.160> here

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the key on bug-eyes was normally here

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.640 
the key on bug-eyes was normally here
but<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.630> lot<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.930> people<00:02:39.110> like<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.380> have<00:02:39.560> a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
but a lot of people like to have a

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
meters and that's where they often end

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.990 
meters and that's where they often end
up<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.870> key<00:02:42.050> got<00:02:42.230> moved<00:02:42.530> on<00:02:42.769> this<00:02:43.010> one<00:02:43.250> we

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
up so the key got moved on this one we

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.330 
up so the key got moved on this one we
have<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.150> correct<00:02:44.510> turn<00:02:45.470> signal<00:02:45.860> switch<00:02:46.010> and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
have a correct turn signal switch and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.150 
have a correct turn signal switch and
wiper<00:02:46.519> switch<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.180> here's<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.630> heater

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
wiper switch and here's the heater

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.080 
wiper switch and here's the heater
control<00:02:49.160> right<00:02:50.030> there<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:51.220> wiper<00:02:52.220> pump

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
control right there and the wiper pump

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.500 
control right there and the wiper pump
as<00:02:53.750> well<00:02:53.989> as<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.170> starter<00:02:54.650> here<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.160> choke

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
as well as the starter here in the choke

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.020 
as well as the starter here in the choke
so<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.750> lot<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.319> original<00:02:57.860> stuff<00:02:58.220> still<00:02:58.670> on<00:02:58.819> that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.240 
so a lot of original stuff still on that
dashboard<00:02:59.269> and<00:03:02.230> there's<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.470> door<00:03:03.680> closing

seal and stop these things from leaking

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.740 
seal and stop these things from leaking
on<00:04:30.680> your<00:04:30.830> feet<00:04:31.129> it's<00:04:31.879> almost<00:04:32.150> guaranteed<00:04:32.389> that

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
on your feet it's almost guaranteed that

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.570 
on your feet it's almost guaranteed that
that<00:04:33.169> one<00:04:33.349> in<00:04:33.469> the<00:04:33.590> car<00:04:33.889> is<00:04:34.189> going<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.460> be

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
that one in the car is going to be

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.860 
that one in the car is going to be
leaking<00:04:34.939> the<00:04:35.060> minute<00:04:35.300> we<00:04:35.389> fill<00:04:35.629> it<00:04:35.659> up<00:04:35.810> with

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
leaking the minute we fill it up with

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.200 
leaking the minute we fill it up with
hydraulic<00:04:36.530> fluid<00:04:36.889> so<00:04:37.460> what<00:04:37.669> needs<00:04:37.879> to<00:04:38.060> be<00:04:38.180> done

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
hydraulic fluid so what needs to be done

bugeye<00:05:36.500> carbs<00:05:36.979> but<00:05:37.490> what<00:05:37.669> happens<00:05:38.090> over<00:05:38.240> time

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
bugeye carbs but what happens over time

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.409 
bugeye carbs but what happens over time
is<00:05:38.659> from<00:05:39.229> every<00:05:39.589> cycle<00:05:40.099> of<00:05:40.219> the<00:05:40.370> throttle<00:05:40.639> you

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
is from every cycle of the throttle you

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.180 
is from every cycle of the throttle you
get<00:05:41.599> where<00:05:41.839> in<00:05:42.050> these<00:05:42.229> little<00:05:42.409> bushings<00:05:42.949> in

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
get where in these little bushings in

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.399 
get where in these little bushings in
the<00:05:43.339> throttle<00:05:43.789> shafts<00:05:44.029> on<00:05:44.389> both<00:05:44.599> carburetors

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
the throttle shafts on both carburetors

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.890 
the throttle shafts on both carburetors
makes<00:05:46.159> it<00:05:46.310> hard<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:46.819> adjust<00:05:46.969> the<00:05:47.240> carbs<00:05:47.629> well

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
makes it hard to adjust the carbs well

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.930 
makes it hard to adjust the carbs well
and<00:05:48.589> that's<00:05:48.680> why<00:05:48.889> sometimes<00:05:49.190> people<00:05:49.729> throw

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
and that's why sometimes people throw

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.019 
and that's why sometimes people throw
away<00:05:50.150> s<00:05:50.509> use<00:05:50.779> and<00:05:51.110> put<00:05:51.319> Weber's<00:05:51.710> on<00:05:52.029> personally

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:53.029 
away s use and put Weber's on personally

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:54.760 
away s use and put Weber's on personally
I<00:05:53.060> love<00:05:53.360> s<00:05:53.599> use<00:05:53.839> and<00:05:54.110> when<00:05:54.229> they're<00:05:54.349> set<00:05:54.650> up

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
I love s use and when they're set up

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.070 
I love s use and when they're set up
right<00:05:55.069> they<00:05:55.430> work<00:05:55.639> great<00:05:55.849> but<00:05:56.690> what<00:05:56.839> I<00:05:56.870> would

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
right they work great but what I would

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.680 
right they work great but what I would
do<00:05:57.199> on<00:05:57.349> this<00:05:57.469> car<00:05:57.770> is<00:05:57.979> take<00:05:58.250> those<00:05:58.460> off<00:05:58.690> send

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
do on this car is take those off send

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.269 
do on this car is take those off send
them<00:05:59.839> into<00:06:00.020> one<00:06:00.289> of<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.529> many<00:06:00.770> vendors<00:06:01.069> that

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:01.279 
them into one of the many vendors that

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.850 
them into one of the many vendors that
will<00:06:01.669> rebus<00:06:02.150> them<00:06:02.419> and<00:06:02.629> get<00:06:03.289> them<00:06:03.469> done<00:06:03.650> right

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
will rebus them and get them done right

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.159 
will rebus them and get them done right
so<00:06:04.039> you<00:06:04.129> start<00:06:04.460> with<00:06:04.550> a<00:06:04.610> good<00:06:04.969> foundation<00:06:05.240> that

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
so you start with a good foundation that

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.839 
so you start with a good foundation that
would<00:06:06.289> be<00:06:06.409> the<00:06:06.529> next<00:06:06.830> step<00:06:06.889> on<00:06:07.310> this

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
would be the next step on this

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.329 
would be the next step on this
particular<00:06:08.240> car<00:06:08.719> I've<00:06:09.409> also<00:06:09.680> I've<00:06:10.069> changed

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:10.339 
particular car I've also I've changed

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
heater valve did you know that that's

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.879 
heater valve did you know that that's
how<00:06:14.449> you<00:06:14.509> turn<00:06:14.719> the<00:06:14.930> heat<00:06:15.080> on<00:06:15.199> on<00:06:15.440> a<00:06:15.469> bug<00:06:15.710> i<00:06:15.830> is

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
how you turn the heat on on a bug i is

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.029 
how you turn the heat on on a bug i is
right<00:06:16.099> here<00:06:17.080> they<00:06:18.080> will<00:06:18.319> leak<00:06:18.529> even<00:06:18.889> though

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
right here they will leak even though

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.920 
right here they will leak even though
this<00:06:19.159> one's<00:06:19.430> off<00:06:19.729> so<00:06:20.029> i<00:06:20.060> changed<00:06:20.389> that<00:06:20.750> and

this one's off so i changed that and
this<00:06:21.349> is<00:06:21.500> another<00:06:21.740> thing<00:06:22.099> that's<00:06:22.310> really

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
this is another thing that's really
