there are some interesting things about

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.800 
there are some interesting things about
you<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:44.909> enough<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.360> draw<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> attention

you but not enough to draw the attention

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.170 
you but not enough to draw the attention
of<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.380> war<00:01:46.560> builder<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.820> still<00:01:48.000> worth

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of a war builder but it's still worth

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.090 
of a war builder but it's still worth
noting<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.320> thing<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> comes

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
noting that for one thing when it comes

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.730 
noting that for one thing when it comes
to<00:01:50.310> size<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.060> much<00:01:51.509> more<00:01:51.899> versatile<00:01:52.470> than

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
to size you are much more versatile than

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.609 
to size you are much more versatile than
your<00:01:53.009> spiral<00:01:53.310> counterparts<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.200> actual

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
your spiral counterparts and the actual

your spiral counterparts and the actual
physics<00:01:56.159> keeping<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> stable<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> moderately

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
physics keeping you stable is moderately

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.620 
interesting
I<00:01:59.320> mean<00:01:59.800> it's<00:01:59.980> nothing<00:02:00.310> like<00:02:00.460> Oilers<00:02:00.970> identity

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
I mean it's nothing like Oilers identity

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.570 
I mean it's nothing like Oilers identity
kind<00:02:01.900> of<00:02:02.050> interesting<00:02:02.590> but<00:02:02.860> frankly<00:02:03.400> I'll

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
kind of interesting but frankly I'll

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.050 
kind of interesting but frankly I'll
take<00:02:03.850> whatever<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.540> can<00:02:04.780> get<00:02:05.200> at<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.530> moment

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
take whatever I can get at the moment

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.580 
take whatever I can get at the moment
firstly<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.180> star<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.600> inside<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.200> tend<00:02:08.470> to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
firstly the star is inside you tend to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.100 
firstly the star is inside you tend to
orbit<00:02:09.040> radially<00:02:09.610> as<00:02:09.790> opposed<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.540> in<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.690> single

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
orbit radially as opposed to in a single

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.250 
orbit radially as opposed to in a single
plane<00:02:11.350> which<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.280> cool<00:02:12.610> but<00:02:13.000> really<00:02:13.900> dangerous

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
plane which is cool but really dangerous

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.250 
plane which is cool but really dangerous
in<00:02:14.800> terms<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.280> galactic<00:02:15.850> habitability<00:02:16.390> also

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
in terms of galactic habitability also

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.140 
in terms of galactic habitability also
there<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> tight<00:02:17.950> correlation<00:02:18.310> between<00:02:18.820> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
there is a tight correlation between the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.060 
there is a tight correlation between the
velocity<00:02:19.690> dispersion<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.320> your<00:02:20.470> stars<00:02:20.770> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
velocity dispersion of your stars and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.160 
velocity dispersion of your stars and
the<00:02:21.490> size<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.030> supermassive<00:02:22.510> black<00:02:22.900> hole

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
the size of the supermassive black hole

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.830 
the size of the supermassive black hole
this<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.010> called<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> M<00:02:24.490> Sigma<00:02:24.910> relation<00:02:25.480> it's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
this is called the M Sigma relation it's

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.180 
this is called the M Sigma relation it's
a<00:02:25.990> little<00:02:26.200> too<00:02:26.320> complicated<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:27.040> get<00:02:27.130> into

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
a little too complicated to get into

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.980 
a little too complicated to get into
right<00:02:27.430> now<00:02:27.610> go<00:02:28.210> check<00:02:28.450> out<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.690> link<00:02:28.870> in
