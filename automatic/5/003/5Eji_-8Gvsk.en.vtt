 hello hello it is not mate today 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.080
 let's talk about the sandbox 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.150
 every summer if he has to his house or 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.460
 dacha equip sandbox I will tell 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.000
 about the letter to be brought 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.769
 and about our toys you may be 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 will be pantheism than having prescribed I will tell 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:33.880
 what mistakes can you make suddenly 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.989
 because I want to kind of make sand 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.910
 which is somewhere near and not buy and you 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.640
 start digging up there next day on 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.160
 small river and maybe dug in the forest 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.620
 they brought sand from him 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.170
 kulichiki they fail why 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.210
 sand not everyone is suitable for the sandbox 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.989
 because not everyone can 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.590
 such wonderful kulichki if sand 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.780
 white and poorly molded maybe you 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.119
 brought straws how to define it 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.000
 it needs to be wet and slightly left 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.729
 dad and you will see what getting such 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.750
 lumps when you put it in 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.840
 some mold 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.090
 when he is wet will be so watery 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.290
 grow fast and nothing you 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.450
 it turns out so you have to replace 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.979
 sand because the child does not 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.250
 Kulichiki turns out what to do 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.799
 experiencing their failures and thinking what it is 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.380
 he does something wrong this thing is in the sand 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.220
 here we are sand so yellow it 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.579
 crumbly 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.920
 no lumps it does not have any 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.320
 no lumps when he's wet he 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.159
 they are going to cling to a separate 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.630
 sink good us write your us 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.759
 like you and we are wonderful 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.920
 smokers get that is he 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.899
 such is the consistency here 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.369
 attention to your courtyards if you 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.130
 city ​​dweller and came to the village 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.100
 you too in the yard yellow sand here 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.579
 yellow sand is best done with 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.100
 Kulichki therefore river sand he as 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.610
 the rule is very bad and the bird from him 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.560
 bad kulichi and blurred 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.260
 and does not hold the form so here we are 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.720
 grandfather dig a big hole and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.500
 deep enough here is this piece dealer 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.320
 the bay 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.390
 Now that you approached and the like 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.320
 you are ready to form the sandbox itself 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.770
 brought sand 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.510
 need to fall asleep but previously 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.940
 remember that where you arranged 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.760
 sandbox most likely you had 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.150
 some kind of not knowing the clearing and where it grew 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.580
 grass 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
 so that the grass does not grow in 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.130
 sand 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.270
 but you need to sandbox 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.550
 here we just flew simple 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.660
 can lay the cardboard utero quickly 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.920
 warms for a while he will save you 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.790
 Someone is covered with garbage bags. 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.459
 because good goes through them 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.739
 plants don't grow but of course 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.810
 can be used professionally 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.590
 special black &amp; dara film which 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.010
 I will miss but still do not give 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.200
 grow 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.410
 weeds here we came we had 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.650
 the sandbox is ready for us 9 but kozyrev 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.260
 and made a bone with your own hands 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.280
 Of course, grandfather, well, helped here we need 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.690
 it was best to get sand if you 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.489
 bring sand garden 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.549
 we had a small mountains and but we had her 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.600
 already we were dragging the sand around us 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.269
 here it means that the bucket drags everywhere and everything 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.560
 that's why us the sandbox is already a mountain gone 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.530
 so maybe we still 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.000
 sand brought and doing 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.640
 one more thing i would like to stay is 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.670
 about processing sand if you brought 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.060
 sand and took for example it from the top 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.510
 layers sure it needs to sift a 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.330
 Here we have such a seeder and a lot 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.490
 He can find on the code on the path and to 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.800
 anything to me if sand zack was 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.260
 taken from deeper layers ie you 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.080
 were in erler pit and it is a good sandy 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.310
 some kind of quarry is possible like this 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.190
 sifting no need some further 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.710
 sand is ignited, that is, well, I am not 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.470
 imagine some big 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.660
 on the Internet how do they do it 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.660
 there is a mother who believe that it is necessary 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.160
 be sure to ignite the sand before 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.170
 put in the sandbox but i believe that this 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.870
 over the fact that well here's the whole sandbox 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.050
 I did not read how to process it 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.330
 so we just close the sandbox on 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.650
 for the night flew on if you have 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.950
 such an opportunity to close or make 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.510
 spelled very much with a cap then this 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.270
 much better because all the same 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.500
 animal they run and can arrange from 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.380
 your of very relevant 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.010
 further toys of course need shovels and 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.730
 rake 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.290
 and all forms well for such a baby 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.070
 small 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:17.590
 better small so that it fits 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.810
 in his hand then the mold is small 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.960
 baby can not keep himself if you 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.480
 is too big you get a 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.430
 what will you do kulichik they 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.860
 the child is uncomfortable for him 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.860
 turn the same with buckets 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.770
 our favorite new york is so small and 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.479
 we, too, turn him over easily 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.449
 holds in hand because to us from one and a half 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.030
 year old we don't need a big bucket again 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:52.660
 same you will play with him they themselves 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.330
 child is definitely better for you 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.900
 It was cure because the sand dries 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.040
 bring water from the river is more interesting 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.710
 very often there are such here 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.870
 toys 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.240
 grinder water or sand here hubs 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.100
 it turns but not all cogs 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.860
 spinning here I had different 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.870
 mills what to look for 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.800
 here is this here is a hole to which pours 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.770
 or pours water it should not be 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.930
 center where this is now sleeps sleeping 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.050
 put and shifted to the side for 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.330
 so that it falls on the blade itself if 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.280
 it will not spin in your center 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.960
 and sold such a lot 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.240
 mill you buy start or 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.039
 pour it is not spinning this is very 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.760
 nice mill on us and pours out 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.560
 sculpt and everything is great baby 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.240
 plays 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.910
 shoulder blades, too, these are our little ones 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.650
 Rite affairs on TC lay a big car not 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.590
 we take we take small in size 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:53.250
 respectively, the blades also need 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:56.349
 choose a dish 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:00.940
 any tableware you see 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:02.710
 the store she goes to three years and our 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.419
 child and a half but I thought so here 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.490
 That we yesterday in our mouth and and I will not take 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.039
 does not want the case I will not give it all on the list 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.229
 so from three years you make a super chip 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.210
 I have a wonderful play and cook days 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:16.690
 equal in the mouth I don't give him yes because 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.970
 mostly they for three years 3 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:22.449
 three years old here this limiter from that 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.099
 what is the bad stuff used here 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.810
 cheaper which the child should not 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.789
 take hands but he and so will take here 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.870
 in the hands of the face it is all aired 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:34.960
 so therefore everything goes well when 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.969
 you turn and ti sandbox clever pro 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.099
 a place to sculpt waders 

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:42.860
 That's because we had such 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:46.479
 the scarlet edges he had to the sandbox we had 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.179
 make so small so that where 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:52.099
 the child was won over here by the kitchen and 

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:55.759
 kulichiki and everything and of course 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:59.089
 canopy made almost a whole house 

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:01.129
 is about kleyonochku first we had not 

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:03.799
 the client is still strong sun and we 

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:09.049
 also oilcloth added to the child 

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:11.059
 played well so good luck and hope everyone 

00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:14.049
 what I have told you will be useful for now. 

00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:14.049
 until March 5th no
