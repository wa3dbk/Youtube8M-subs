let me show you a tech race ROM here is

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.660 
let me show you a tech race ROM here is
the<00:00:19.199> factory<00:00:19.560> boost<00:00:19.770> controller<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.430> now<00:00:20.609> we

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the factory boost controller and now we

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.670 
the factory boost controller and now we
can<00:00:20.970> turn<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> boost<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.779> down<00:00:21.930> using<00:00:22.260> the

can turn the boost up and down using the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.640 
can turn the boost up and down using the
cruise<00:00:22.890> control<00:00:23.420> settings<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.050> show<00:00:25.560> up

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
cruise control settings so here show up

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.999

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
max boost see here

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.869 
max boost see here
so<00:00:32.009> using<00:00:36.050> that's<00:00:37.050> max<00:00:37.380> boost<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.610> turn<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
so using that's max boost I can turn it

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
so using that's max boost I can turn it
down<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.059> little<00:00:39.270> bit<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> time<00:00:42.260> it's<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
down a little bit at a time it's like a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.220 
down a little bit at a time it's like a
stock<00:00:43.739> setting<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.719> high

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
stock setting and then this is high

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.110 
stock setting and then this is high
boosts<00:00:46.500> 5<00:00:46.980> pound<00:00:47.250> increments<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> now<00:00:50.129> we're

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
boosts 5 pound increments so now we're

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.250 
boosts 5 pound increments so now we're
going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> take<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.629> thing<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.050> test
