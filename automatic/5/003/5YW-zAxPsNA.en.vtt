00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.939
 tecni web offers multiple services 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.789
 here we can see a touch screen 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.240
 where we have a plan of the restaurant 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.840
 with all its tables the tables that are 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.260
 free those who are busy and those who 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.290
 are waiting for the account are shown in 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.930
 red 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.650
 we can have different areas of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.290
 restaurant 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.800
 banquet terrace 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.579
 let's see how to make a command of 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.950
 a table 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.170
 simply by selecting the table 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.680
 we mark the guests and from 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.400
 here we go selecting the dishes that 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.250
 they ask us 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.090
 we can also indicate variations in 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.390
 the dishes like for example the ribeye 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.840
 that is little done even with a 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.050
 special description for this dish 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.780
 we can also mark the drink 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.470
 as you can see it is very difficult to 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.460
 to be wrong since you see the image of 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.950
 each of them with the exit button 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.980
 each dish will come out through a monitor 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.400
 kitchen or by a printer in the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.640
 own kitchen or in a printer 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.080
 request in the bar this same process 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.540
 we can do it with a handheld terminal 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:51.830
 be an ipad an order man or any 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 even type of the program allows 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.650
 set the language according to the client and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.200
 when selecting the plate automatically 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.380
 appears with the translation in said 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.810
 language is very useful for both 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.590
 waiter as for the customer who already 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.900
 You will receive the account in your own language 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.420
 in the kitchen and in the bar will come in the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.209
 established language or habitually 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.360
 in Spanish in the loyalty of 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:25.380
 Clients we have different options 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.990
 We can give a balance to the customer ie 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.370
 gives us 100 euros and we pay in 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:37.760
 card 110 with which we are giving 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.340
 10% added value 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.720
 but we charge the full amount 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.720
 before serving the products 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.000
 It is also very useful because the card 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.040
 it will almost never be zero, there will be two or 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.159
 three euros that if they do not return it to 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.099
 recharge they do not lose or they can do another 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.489
 recharge and recover what is left of 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.489
 sando 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.370
 to create a new product in the 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.900
 screen is very simple we select 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.900
 where to add a product 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.310
 and in three seconds we get the option 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.400
 create 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.830
 We indicate the name of the product you 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.599
 we can put a price depending on 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.700
 the area on the terrace or inside 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.940
 an image directly taken from 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.320
 Google 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.320
 with the action of copying 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:46.090
 directly pasting into the regulator already 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.980
 We have the product ready to sell 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.800

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.800
 demonstration program TVE 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.800
