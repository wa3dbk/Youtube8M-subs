00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.490
 tank breakthrough test 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.980
 It was launched in the summer of '38 as in the case 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.469
 SMK tank originally three towers 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 she was replaced by 2 in your favor 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.980
 tank armor on demand 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.150
 chieftain 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.890
 final assembly of the car was 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 completed by the thirty first of July 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.300
 thirty ninth year and up to 100 was 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
 Commissions accepted for 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.000
 ground tests which combined 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.730
 factory August 1 to 30 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.380
 passed the startle method for stop mid 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.930
 November thirty ninth year car 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.220
 was removed from the spot it was later 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.590
 sent to karist 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.020
 and neck checking and combat and running 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.710
 qualities in the front part of the conditions 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.020
 special formation group 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.150
 manufactured with plants of Leningrad tank 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.260
 were going to equip 150 two 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.690
 millimeter howitzers 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.210
 however, they did not manage to do this in Karelia 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 drove a variant of 76 millimeters 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.730
 main armu first battle quests 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.670
 participated along with the castle and to we in 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.070
 the breakthrough time for the defense of the Finns with current 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.530
 about something less than seven hit 37 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.090
 40 mm 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.310
 Finnish artillery did not get a shell 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.619
 none of the former after 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.080
 somewhat polished with you without here for long 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.110
 covered up fire damaged so up 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.200
 the moment the whole crew could 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.460
 damaged car to go to the test 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.740
 shot from cannons and machine guns to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.990
 100 move back but after going a few 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.320
 hundreds of meters failed due to 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.700
 breakage magnet 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.090
 fixing the floor under the tank managed to return 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600
 in position from the fields further so once again by 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.119
 him 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.880
 us test arrived in the area of ​​hostilities 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.509
 February 21 fortieth year was included 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 The composition of a group of experienced heavy tanks in 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.990
 group besides the test he was a tank KVN 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.320
 flare 76 2 millimeter well done and three 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.259
 tank kvs howitzer m-10 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.240
 caliber 152 and 4 mm is a group 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.610
 intended to combat bots 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.920
 check tanks fight against dates and 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.429
 failed due to lack of such in this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.320
 area 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.510
 on the Karelian isthmus the tank was 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.329
 fired by armor-piercing shells of caliber 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.480
 37 47 millimeters to the station 300 500 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:21.120
 meters recorded in 8 hits one 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.030
 barrel of forty five millimeter cannon 5 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.989
 starboard and one for disk 4 left 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.750
 track roller 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.239
 petri body game with a barrel hit 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.790
 guns put her out of action two hits 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.220
 starboard hull left on armor 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.920
 funnels in the form of an ellipse depth 20 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.620
 millimeters and a circle depth of 20 6 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.739
 millimeter 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.690
 and so on the crew did not suffer a blow from 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.700
 enemy projectiles were not louder than blows 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.879
 sledge hammer on the body after the secondary 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.400
 arrival at the front of the plant on February 10 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.739
 the fortieth year of the test before the end of the war 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.390
 March 12, another hundred and fifty-five passed. 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.440
 kilometers total mileage 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.620
 winter 39 forties amounted to 1745 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.530
 kilometers to armor on March 12 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.510
 there were 14 traces of shells from 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.450
 adoption of the tank abandoned 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.940
 in favor of there efforts to the web on August 2 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.510
 the fortieth year of the test was sent on 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.340
 polygon 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.560
 where he was before the beginning of the great 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.569
 patriotic war approaching 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.510
 Germans Cuban machine was evacuated 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.519
 to the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant in 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.049
 unlike other experienced machines, it does not 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.900
 It was sent to be melted down 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.340
 left to learn features 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.440
 design and use with new 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.739
 designing further fate test 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.769
 It is not known how you can evaluate the table in 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.470
 report written on February 22 fortieth 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.760
 it was noted that the tank e-100 completely 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.709
 corresponds to the specified tth 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.689
 as deficiencies noted not 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.269
 stable operation of the cooling system 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.819
 weak fan reliability failed 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.159
 cooling grid design also 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.290
 recommended to refine the mechanism 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.030
 control gearbox and strengthen 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.769
 friction clutch design 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.140
 as dignity noted the presence 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.599
 pneumatic tank control system 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.670
 despite the overall compliance of the tank 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.220
 Requirements Commission was 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.920
 found inappropriate to recommend 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.989
 will give about adopting since 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.620
 tank attractive Papuans given 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.919
 the parameter 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.940
 however, b1 for a station wagon 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.680
 Now 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.590
 believed that the tank should be 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.100
 recommended adoption 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.540
 is a machine and many eyes forge 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.139
 this partly corresponds to and 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.830
 he was without 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.600
 can't mutation well 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.810
 be used to install more 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.860
 powerful that on arms 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.020
 set 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.630
 one hundred and 30 millimeter cannon whereas 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.200
 more functional to my bear 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.820
 only arc de 76 2 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.190
 however , engineers are not 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.030
 listened and who was never accepted 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.310
 into service 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.330
 really try hard weapons tests 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.360
 the plot was taken in January 1940 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.480
 Deputy Commissar of Defense Commander 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.880
 person involved 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.300
 snails gave appropriate instructions 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.490
 supposed to be installed on a tank of 150 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.870
 pro street m10 able to effectively 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.150
 fight puffed up in march 1940 for 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.670
 the test was made new importance 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.270
 howitzer m-10 which was supposed 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.130
 set on tank instead 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.580
 the resulting modification was supposed to 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.460
 to wear 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.190
 tzz index however instead of this machine on 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.770
 armament was adopted there kv-2 as a whole 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.650
 dough was quite a good machine 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.430
 the tank basically matched 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.190
 operational-tactical look over his 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.510
 tank booking application also 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.110
 matched 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.520
 requirements 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.680
 and weapons allowed to lead 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.990
 massive and maneuverable circular 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.600
 fire simultaneously possible directions 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.510
 all test scores are significant 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.260
 exceeded 30 however the tank had such 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.540
 typical 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.850
 multi-turbo tanks flaws like 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.470
 large crew size 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.080
 and complexity of production 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.060
 what simka test represented 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.430
 necessary step on the way from heavy 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.430
 multi-turret layout heavy 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.230
 a new type of tank such as a square-1 on 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.860
 the base of the test tank was made 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:19.400
 self-propelled gun under moscow su-14 one myself 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:22.569
 hunting on the chassis of the tank t-35 and self-propelled gun 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.059
 test four times left for shelling 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:28.029
 or the depth of the German defense su-14 two 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:30.939
 times the total spent 69 shells caliber 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.830
 152 mm and 26 caliber 130 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:35.159
 millimeters 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.689
 all sau were part of 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:38.439
 Separate heavy division 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.110
 destination 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:44.050
 so ended the era many head 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.969
 monsters it's time for soviet 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.699
 tank building was a period of early 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:51.699
 youth for its peculiar age 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.469
 maximalism and delusions mostly 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.409
 stopped this romantic time 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:58.029
 surprise in almost all countries 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.189
 anti-tank guns in connection with this 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:02.680
 all the old concept of creating tanks 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:05.319
 gone the question arose about the production 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.020
 more powerful armored vehicles to 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.189
 trades new generation who 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.689
 Satisfied with this condition follows 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:14.080
 carry tanks serikova 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:16.719
 and t-34 can certainly say that the tanks 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.999
 the female test is so fantastic too 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:21.189
 meet new requirements however 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:23.289
 their multi-turret makes them all the same 

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:25.839
 treat cars of the thirties 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:28.240
 we can say that they were peculiar 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:29.019
 transition from the concept of the thirties in 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.779
 new cars 

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:33.699
 however, these cars were not put into production. 

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:36.430
 preference was given over 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:38.649
 practical tank KV-1 turret 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.499
 layouts refused once and for all a 

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:45.779
 tanks to you continued their development and 

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:45.779
 turned into a series of heavy tanks is
