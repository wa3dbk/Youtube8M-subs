 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.849
 today we thought of one 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.610
 really special recipe the one in 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.919

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.210
 Today's recipe is taken from the site to everything 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.369
 follo 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.810
 but you knew that mustard there 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.840
 used the ancient Romans 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.899
 they even ate and there 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.660
 they kept on CD and the Romans were 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.500
 great engineers but also at the table not 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.500
 they do badly 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.560
 from eleonora we begin that begins to have 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.600
 a certain fame and then today we must do 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.160
 just a nice job 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.320
 let's see what we need 500 g of linguine 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:18.619

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:20.780
 spoon of chopped parsley boil 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.860

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.290

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.300
 Drain the pasta and set aside one 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.460
 cup of cooking water to dilute 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.770
 eventually the sauce clicked on 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.460
 fat from the chicken and cut it into pieces 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.990
 pour the sour cream into a pan 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.660
 heat it over low heat until it is done 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.119

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.130

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.509
 dip the linguine in the sauce and 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.660
 stir the good 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.070
 serve them in a large bowl 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:54.140
 pulverizing with parsley and the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.179
 dish is ready but is exceptional as at 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.039
