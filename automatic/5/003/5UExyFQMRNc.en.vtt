00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 today I hope you are super well the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.950
 today and as we left 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.690
 September I will show you the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.099
 favorites that I had this month first thing 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.469
 that I want to show you as a favorite 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.240
 all this month and that I changed were the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 Neutrogena wipes but I changed 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.490
 from the diaz to the night are super 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.529
 good I absolutely retired all the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.600
 makeup including the mask to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.609
 water proof so obviously I do not 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.289
 I change neutrogena but I did 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.630
 a change as of the day to those of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.580
 night and I find it pretty good 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.189
 I do not know if I keep buying this line or the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.079
 another or use the two I have no idea 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.790
 how I'm going to keep doing but 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.710
 I like this month I liked them 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.480
 pretty happening today in makeup 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 obviously the first one that I am 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.149
 using a lot was this one that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.559
 flame lumi magic de l'oréal for this 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.989
 spring I find that it goes pretty 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.930
 ok to use this first one because it's 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.629
 super bright leaves you looking super 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.270
 luminous independent if you use base 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.829
 if you do not use if you use live cream the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.590
 base that you use is used only 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.510
 corrector etcetera this first makes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.159
 your skin looks super lit up so 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.390
 that even though I do not like it 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.350
 both that aspect 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.810
 I find that to begin with 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 spring-summer is pretty good and already 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.080
 I do not want to finish I love it but what 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.940
 that does not end because we already choose a 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 little to continue with makeup 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.140
 obviously I have the naked tree palette and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 I really love the colors that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 have I feel that they favor me enough 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.050
 because of the skin tone that I have, I am 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.450
 Pretty white as if pulling pink 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.820
 so I really like tonality 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.619
 which is obviously the clearest 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.640
 the darker has enough colors 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 how rose cabbage 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.220
 so they're pretty cute there's mate and 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.890
 there is also shimmer so it goes pretty 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.539
 well this palette is the original but I 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.210
 from the facebook store I have the 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.340
 replicas of today's 1 the 3 and the beige 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.619
 and I also have it so if you do not 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.929
 they can acquire the original they have that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.789
 alternative that are really very good 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.500
 quality the replica to seal it a 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.140
 makeup this month I'm using 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.740
 very much this line that is called studio 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.220
 Marc's fix in the tone in that 15 is a 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 pretty whitish tone I like 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.600
 very much to massify the skin I 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.739
 I use obviously with some brush that 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.120
 be as very chubby to be able 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.189
 branch all the people for my face 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.889
 what does have a value a little bit 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.599
 elevated I do not remember exactly what it is 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.829
 the value but if I find out obviously 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.359
 I'm going to leave it down in the box 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.180
 information I'm going to leave here 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.680
 but if it goes quite well and has been 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.900
 obviously one of my favorites of 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.969
 september away what is also 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.370
 using a lot of mac is this 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.260
 labial that is here is obviously a 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.639
 pink because if it's my favorite it has 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.790
 to be one of the pink ones because to me 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.519
 I love it is a tone that is impregnated in 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.189
 your lips really that it becomes matt 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.909
 this tone is called andrés it up and it's from 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.189
 the froilán where it cream de mch 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.769
 It is a beautiful tone and it also lasts 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.169
 very much on the lips very much 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.719
 very much very much I say that I have 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.799
 right now but I also put this one that 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.199
 he is also doing one of my 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.879
 favorites that this is a mix and it's like 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.280
 the same tone but this is like gloss 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.409
 this is called candyland and really 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.090
 I hope precious also the tone is 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.370
 wonderful for the formula that has the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.620
 I love they fascinate me they have me but 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.389
 crazy and obviously yes I use it together 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.160
 even more is the combination that I carry in 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.770
 this 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.540
 and I'm in the morning with this 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.820
 combination of lipsticks and artà that 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.470
 it comes out but with nothing because they are fixed 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.510
 in a way but extraordinary your 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.610
 lips so I've loved together 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.380

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.600

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.800

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.230
 which is super practical for more bringing 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.790

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.730
