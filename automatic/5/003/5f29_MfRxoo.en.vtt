00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.770
 the way is matching but one of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.229
 subscribers well bye couple I said in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.520
 set the only thing of course 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.590
 unconditionally by all means 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.510

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.790
 temperature drops i.e. perfect 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:01.890
