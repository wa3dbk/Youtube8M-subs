to get two of these pieces in there that

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.380 
to get two of these pieces in there that
works<00:04:38.220> just<00:04:38.310> fine<00:04:38.610> make<00:04:38.910> sure<00:04:39.060> they're<00:04:39.210> laying

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
works just fine make sure they're laying

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.550 
works just fine make sure they're laying
in<00:04:39.540> this<00:04:39.660> same<00:04:39.900> direction<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.350> you're<00:04:40.530> going

material down against the moist surface

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.510 
material down against the moist surface
of<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.140> meat<00:05:13.320> as<00:05:13.440> best<00:05:13.710> as<00:05:13.890> possible

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
of the meat as best as possible

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.000 
of the meat as best as possible
remember<00:05:15.390> Trebek<00:05:16.020> stickers<00:05:16.410> like<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.590> membrane

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
remember Trebek stickers like a membrane

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.490 
remember Trebek stickers like a membrane
so<00:05:17.640> it's<00:05:17.850> going<00:05:18.150> to<00:05:18.270> grab<00:05:18.570> on<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.230> moisture

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
so it's going to grab on to the moisture

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.230 
so it's going to grab on to the moisture
on<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.890> surface<00:05:20.100> of<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.460> meat<00:05:20.640> and<00:05:20.820> create<00:05:21.210> a

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
on the surface of the meat and create a

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.050 
on the surface of the meat and create a
bond<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:21.870> it's<00:05:22.560> through<00:05:22.890> that<00:05:22.920> bond<00:05:23.340> that

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
bond and it's through that bond that

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.140 
bond and it's through that bond that
you're<00:05:24.270> going<00:05:24.420> to<00:05:24.540> get<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:25.260> really<00:05:25.500> effective

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
you're going to get the really effective

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.780 
you're going to get the really effective
drying<00:05:27.150> well<00:05:28.050> you<00:05:28.830> know<00:05:28.920> dry<00:05:29.130> curing<00:05:29.430> using

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
drying well you know dry curing using

drying well you know dry curing using
the<00:05:29.880> fridge<00:05:30.170> so<00:05:31.170> once<00:05:31.350> it's<00:05:31.500> all<00:05:31.590> sealed<00:05:31.890> up

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
the fridge so once it's all sealed up

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.150
