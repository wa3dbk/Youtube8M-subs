00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.339
 facebook communication systems program 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.089
 designed for Nolan helmets 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.490
 penis as been developed by the nolan group internally 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.929
 waiting for the criteria of the group of 30 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.980
 in particular the security we have katy pier helmets nolan how to fix com 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.169
 added 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.149
 transportability and 'possible to use to fix as more 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.050
 helmets 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.380
 or simply move the system does not fall another 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.680
 system can be installed by the user simple way is sold 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.520
 separately from the prison 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.500
 feel comfortable helmet maintains the same comfort when we entered 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 - thanks to the predisposition of the helmet since birth 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.100
 the safety aspect has been kept 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.180
 in fact all nolan helmets prepared for me are highly regarded 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.250
 they have also been approved with the system inserted 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.990
 hence as a mounted system unlike 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.320
 a purchased microphone installed later as it guarantees 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140
 same location as the helmet 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 even when inserted 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.110
 creams with a modular range of products 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.320
 so it offers different features by combining products differently 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.630
 of the range of accounts 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.159

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.020

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.970
 external electronic card 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030
 if it fits inside the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 when instead the kit is installed inside the helmet it integrates 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.139
 perfectly inside leaving the comfort practically unchanged 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.450
 with kit weights only 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.650
