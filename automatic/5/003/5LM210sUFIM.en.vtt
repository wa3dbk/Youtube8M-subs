00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
 and such copies which in principle 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.169
 can demonstrate 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.170
 we will immediately see today 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.010
 but unfortunately work with students and 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.650

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.639

 Konyeva logs, by the way, is 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.529
 last time my wonderful 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.230
 Maehara endeavors with fashion shows 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.000
 and she will show us 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.900
 one very interesting topic in my opinion 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.899
 the consignment 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.140
 just at the end of the fifties 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.969
 order let's meet 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.969
 applause 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.130
 P 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.060
 meters 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.800
 in May on our Moscow towers 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.350
 analyst by the way clear 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.120
 and south 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.050
 former member of this melts 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.530
 during negotiations 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.159
 probably very happy because 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:11.920
 this 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.409
 new bought saturated with ridiculous money and 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.490
 one color in my 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.700
 what are you for some sort of french samples 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.340
 and I think that the stories aren't exactly right. 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.860
 I know 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.810
 at this end of the fifties 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.350
 these are famous 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740
 and kisses none of christian diora 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.900
 which he invented back in 1947 and such 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.049
 somewhere by the mid fifties is a whole 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.460
 reached us 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.650
 that's who reads corporate identity 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.520
 fifties 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.160
 I am all over the country if its considered 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.180
 durable i.e. the option is saturated with the old 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.240
 accessories 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.840
 accessory ii 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.050
 glove handbag from the same is all zintan 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.659

 18 camera paint 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.120
 By the way, so I think it’s possible 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.580
 call serious 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.290
 that's because 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.680
 in the first place as boards and as it were mixing 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.090
 all the same western ray 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.929
 here are three laptops 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.079
 in the world and then I did not know but in my opinion it is 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.479
 quite shocking appearance for 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.239
 fitness's only golden share 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.159
 tuesday night at the same time astronauts 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.399
 imported 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.289
 Here Crimea stakes factory of such hats 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.289
 we were not allowed here 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.960
 so we are upon you 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.440
 Medvedev today same tape that too 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.369
 much time yes she told me 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.169
 well probably already 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.159
 just the western style is the same interpol 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.449
 board 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:51.989
 it is she who is not French 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.420
 the american 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.459
 But I don’t know how miraculously 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.069
 then others will make you here and more expensive 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.200
 which is already very but at the time my debt 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.169
 the end 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.339
 sixties well, very common 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:06.830
 and female accessory 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.040
 now for some reason 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.240
 in general they pushed the boas though 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.959
 sort of coming into fashion 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.619
 most recently it is clear that standards are in progress 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:16.599
 this good 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.670
 tens 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.560
 gloves are also integral 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.430
 accessories 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.890
 Odanko clothes ie in principle and gloves 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.860
 and wore as up to 60 thousand years 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.910
 mandatory attribute was here 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.970
 actually like a fine one bet on 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.290
 street 11 rooms 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.610
 so today i'm here on pc on me 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.930
 Now the goal is, in principle, probably 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.269
 place mummers options may rather 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.680
 be and option there 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.920
 they are rich enough ladies from can 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.290

 Of course it's all like that and alter to 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.920
 modern manners and so we were all 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.139
 not so 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.499

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.960
 draft country program 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.210
 I don’t feel like a body because 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.110
 who drives an unadapted jack 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.410
 of our time there we have a long skirt she has him 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.289
 the same is shorter and then but not above the knees 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.300
 worn almost only at the beginning 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.339
 sixties 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.999

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.020
 knees must be closed 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.770
 but now there is a price 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.539
 and there it is all like that 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.770
 I am a little bit and rewrites the price 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.610
 so said 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.020
 tell or here if you come across 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.740
 things and vintage forever flea 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.879
 for example the market 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.959
 and which is really 

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.050
 represents 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.559
 stage interests 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.859
 but she spent time spent 

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:05.699
 stuffed 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.969
 these are famous people who 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.869
 restore such things or need it 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.909
 make yourself very long winter 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.559
 fiber evenings 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:15.030
 Well, of course, in principle 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.449
 it is known to every prescription that 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.719
 things she acquired practically 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.330
 always requires restoration 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.960
 that is, his words are in excellent condition but 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.780
 seekers are rarely seen 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.229
 Especially it concerns not only clothes 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.309
 as if antiques in general 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.330
 new clothes become jean often happens 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.050
 in such a state from not very much 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.250
 good but in principle it can be seen that it can be both 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.630
 that is, in order 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.560
 sometimes of course there are duties in 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.610
 order just can not bring and she 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.960
 may be of museum interest 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.770
 maybe to eat in some way 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.939
 a copy 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:53.789
 but 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.680
 if some abstract time 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.839
 which established 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.740
 here of course you need to look at all 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.030
 here's how to see anyone understand 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.750
 let us be able to do this thing 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.650
 or not of course always big 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.979
 joy when this transfer goes 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:11.450
 pharmacy condition
