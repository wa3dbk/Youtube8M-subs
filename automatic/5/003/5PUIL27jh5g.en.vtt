00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.410 
the activating the ultra to and then he
just<00:02:41.950> locked<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.760> block<00:02:43.000> one<00:02:43.240> of<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
just locked and you block one of the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.210 
just locked and you block one of the
orbs<00:02:43.750> away<00:02:43.990> she<00:02:44.350> can't<00:02:44.560> throw<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:44.890> because

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
orbs away she can't throw you because

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.590 
orbs away she can't throw you because
you're<00:02:45.340> gonna<00:02:45.430> block<00:02:45.730> one<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.030> them<00:02:46.120> instantly

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
you're gonna block one of them instantly

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.440 
you're gonna block one of them instantly
so<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.530> like<00:02:47.910> only<00:02:48.910> things<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.090> could<00:02:49.240> do<00:02:49.300> is

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
so it's like only things you could do is

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.540 
so it's like only things you could do is
wake<00:02:49.600> up<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.930> throw<00:02:50.170> before<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:51.160> orbs<00:02:51.490> you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
wake up and throw before the orbs you

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.570 
wake up and throw before the orbs you
just<00:02:51.730> get<00:02:51.850> ready<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.180> take
