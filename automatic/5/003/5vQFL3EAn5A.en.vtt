00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
happens like you see in the movies you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.760 
happens like you see in the movies you
dive<00:00:41.820> off<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> building<00:00:42.629> into<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> water<00:00:43.500> if

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
dive off a building into the water if

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
dive off a building into the water if
you<00:00:44.190> would<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.460> protected<00:00:44.670> by<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> water<00:00:45.480> or

with<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> water<00:00:46.440> transmit<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> shock<00:00:47.309> wave

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
with the water transmit the shock wave

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.810 
with the water transmit the shock wave
but<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.980> problem<00:00:50.370> solved<00:00:50.670> like

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
but then we kind of problem solved like

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.029 
but then we kind of problem solved like
this<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> ends<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.809> getting<00:00:52.620> roughed

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
this and then it ends up getting roughed

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.810 
this and then it ends up getting roughed
out<00:00:53.250> into<00:00:53.730> an<00:00:53.910> actual<00:00:54.449> plan<00:00:54.899> over<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.289> and
