00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.210 
with a zombie deck for the new format
I'm<00:00:06.660> this<00:00:06.899> deck<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.290> really<00:00:07.560> big<00:00:07.710> contender

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
I'm this deck is a really big contender

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.549 
I'm this deck is a really big contender
because<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.030> its<00:00:09.420> speed<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.139> how<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.320> other

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
because of its speed and how the other

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.169 
because of its speed and how the other
decks<00:00:10.769> wouldn't<00:00:11.040> slow<00:00:11.190> down<00:00:11.429> but<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> SEC<00:00:12.030> has

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
decks wouldn't slow down but the SEC has

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.829 
decks wouldn't slow down but the SEC has
just<00:00:12.330> gotten<00:00:12.509> better<00:00:12.719> balance<00:00:14.570> so<00:00:15.570> I'm

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
just gotten better balance so I'm

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.490 
just gotten better balance so I'm
probably<00:00:16.529> gonna<00:00:16.770> play<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.190> format<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:18.500> this

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
