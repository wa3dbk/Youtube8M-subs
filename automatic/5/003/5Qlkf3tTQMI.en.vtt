might not even have that um let me see
you<00:02:41.629> take<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:42.110> instance<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:43.400> brown<00:02:43.610> rice<00:02:43.909> was

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
you take for instance the brown rice was

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.030 
you take for instance the brown rice was
a<00:02:45.069> for<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.099> full<00:02:46.310> cup<00:02:47.140> what<00:02:48.140> was<00:02:48.230> 109<00:02:48.650> calories

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
a for a full cup what was 109 calories

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.229 
a for a full cup what was 109 calories
or<00:02:49.160> something<00:02:49.400> like<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.700> forgot<00:02:49.970> what<00:02:50.180> it

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
or something like that I forgot what it

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.729 
or something like that I forgot what it
was<00:02:50.360> but<00:02:50.810> anyway<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:51.319> cut<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.129> out<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:54.590> did

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
was but anyway I cut that out and we did

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.479 
was but anyway I cut that out and we did
a<00:02:54.769> half<00:02:55.129> which<00:02:55.730> made<00:02:56.030> us<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.840> 95<00:02:57.470> calories<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.459> I

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
a half which made us to 95 calories so I

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.699 
a half which made us to 95 calories so I
took<00:02:58.700> away<00:02:58.970> from<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.359> brown<00:02:59.540> rice<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.049> added

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
took away from the brown rice and added

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.039 
took away from the brown rice and added
back<00:03:00.980> into<00:03:01.250> more<00:03:01.609> protein<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.569> now<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.810> guys

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
back into more protein so now you guys

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.280 
back into more protein so now you guys
are<00:03:03.109> see<00:03:03.500> what<00:03:03.769> I'm<00:03:03.890> doing<00:03:04.569> when<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.599> take<00:03:06.109> away

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
are see what I'm doing when I take away

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.110 
are see what I'm doing when I take away
if<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.709> take<00:03:06.890> away<00:03:07.040> from<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.489> green<00:03:07.700> beans<00:03:07.970> that

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
if I take away from the green beans that

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.849 
if I take away from the green beans that
means<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.540> might<00:03:08.720> be<00:03:08.870> adding<00:03:09.230> more<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.739> more

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
means I might be adding more and more

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.369 
means I might be adding more and more
protein<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.819> then<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.450> will<00:03:11.870> actually<00:03:12.019> get<00:03:12.260> in

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
protein and then I will actually get in

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.410 
protein and then I will actually get in
more<00:03:12.590> vegetables<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.609> salads<00:03:14.269> and
