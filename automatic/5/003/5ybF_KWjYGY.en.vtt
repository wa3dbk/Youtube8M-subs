00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
just days before this year's e3 back on

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.210 
just days before this year's e3 back on
in<00:04:04.190> back<00:04:04.430> in<00:04:04.609> June<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:06.049> they<00:04:06.530> really<00:04:06.889> have

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220

in back in June and so they really have
not<00:04:07.790> much<00:04:07.970> done<00:04:08.209> especially<00:04:08.359> on<00:04:08.780> how<00:04:09.019> it's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290
