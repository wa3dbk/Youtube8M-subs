00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 [music] 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.040
 hello broadcast bread on 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.200
 everyday 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.290
 thank god for new day new 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.090
 opportunities to reflect on his words 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.840
 the next few minutes we'll spend at 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.430
 reasoning about why is christ 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.250
 set children as an example for adults 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.370
 in general none of the virtues can 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 come from a sense of duty or worse and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.260
 guilt know how sometimes in us on 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.710
 guilt 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.670
 cause us to virtue or to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.950
 donations true virtue is not 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.380
 caused it exists by itself 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.080
 regardless need it or not 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.000
 need because true 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.210
 virtue lies in love 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.110
 which share without reason and even more 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.420
 unconditionally and above all in this 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.400
 need is love itself 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.500
 because love is like milk in 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.510
 maternal breast 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 causes pain until her baby is 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.780
 deplete adults rational 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.310
 adults logical adults 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.070
 prudent and prudent 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.970
 they intelligently allocate time to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:41.479
 tenderness compliments kiss baby 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.670
 rush child passion 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.490
 even sincerity is unworthy of a child 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.240
 because he is not higher and because not 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.600
 knows what it is to be sincere and not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.740
 knows because there is never no 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.880
 sincere in child is no vice because 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.510
 he does not distinguish even bad and good 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.479
 children are the only ones in the world 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.939
 state of innocence even when baby 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.340
 naughty or demanding something 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:17.700
 it is justified for the reason that he 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.950
 honest for not knowing how to be dishonest in 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 difference from a raised adult 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.800
 who silently angry of course silently 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.070
 envies 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.910
 and envy it by the way may be less 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.930
 hurts him than the inner 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.980
 duality and such a facade 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.750
 erected by spiritual disgrace 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.440
 In general, I refuse to call 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.960
 upbringing external ethics 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.810
 we gain our domestic price 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.290
 inconsistencies christ directly said if 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.770
 do not turn and do not become like children do not 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.170
 enter the kingdom of heaven thank you for 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.570
 you spent this time with me in 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.190
 reflections on the word of God thank you 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.370
 to everyone who makes production possible 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.390
 these short programs all the best 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.710
 next meeting on the air of thought from the book 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.710
 attack on the sovereignty of the highest
