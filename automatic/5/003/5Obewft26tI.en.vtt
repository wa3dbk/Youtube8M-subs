00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.150
 i have try away myself and 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.290
 Hand grenades are in my dough 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.849
 devices 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.590
 hello my little tree nice that you 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.270
 It's that time again 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.070
 your sport a network or something video 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.779
 was on time again and again time and there 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.310
 This weekend's break we show 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.039
 you now a very delicious and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.369
 Already cake almost one 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.900
 pie was 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.890
 and here we all see 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.950
 ingredients we need for the floor 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.340
 we made a baking mold of ground almonds flour 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.260
 butter vanilla sugar and sugar and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.829
 some butter for the back form what is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.899
 First we would have the baking mold 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:54.000
 and beat up all the eggs you will 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.600
 dare to drink this glass so me 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.059
 Do not start the eggs with the hand mixer first 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.300
 frothy for about three minutes 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.949
 beat 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.049
 add the packet of vanilla sugar 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.750
 and all about five minutes to one 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:16.220
 elastic beat now melt like 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.220
 the butter until it is lightly browned 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.040
 Well, it's a hot one 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:30.400
 then we sift the flour 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.250
 to our chill still give the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.350
 lacking too yes already like a recipe with 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.510
 so far, however, that's easy here 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.820
 certainly also gives away without looking 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:44.830
 everything is devouring and shuddering again 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.000
 of course the easy prey molten 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.290
 do not forget butter 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.920
 and now we have to do it all again 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.200
 nice by now we enter the mass in 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.210
 our greased baking mold and then it will 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.450
 the good piece in the preheated oven 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.760
 at 200 degrees above bottom heat about 35 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.950
 baked minutes 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:10.119
 You let the day cool down 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.990
 the form and just let him in 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.420
 cool down a bit 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.830
 Now we come to the covering and there you see 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.280
 you already the ingredients we for it 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.820
 need the fresh strawberries 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.880
 Lean quark for sugar juice and sugar 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.690
 vanilla sugar cream and there will have 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.690
 but not baked 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.180
 Now you have the cake yet 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.180
 halve horizontally 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.150
 tried halving the upper part 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.800
 of the floor may be a bit narrower too 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.390
 cut as the bottom so me 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.580
 how I think so if the upper one 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.340
 the cake is slightly thinner 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.500
 easier to eat now we give the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.930
 liquid cream in a mixing bowl and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.120
 Beat until stiff 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.520
 she is now stiff 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.950
 but do not pay attention to what 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.220
 we clench your cream so she has to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.750
 then look 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.700
 the beating of the saane makes it really nice 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.680
 a lot of dirt I have the harvey too 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.990
 clean it up 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.260
 now we have the lean quark with the 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.880
 vanilla sugar and the normal sugar 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.480
 and stir it until it's nice 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.480
 is smooth 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.890
 Now , we are gradually raising the sun 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.890
 under 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.420
 and now we can start the cake 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.909
 you start with that 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.280
 bottom floor where you are with the strawberries 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.230
 to catch you can place it as 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.090
 you want to cut if necessary 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.769
 the strawberries are still suitable for you 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:47.390
 right that we have a little puzzle 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:51.579
 play or tetris on the strawberries 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.579
 then comes our quark cream mixture 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.959
 The lid on it comes a bit 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.920
 and then come this time 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.920
 first the cream 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.290
 and then the strawberries 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.659
 Now we still have the rhubarb juice 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.900
 with the gelatin sugar on a pot 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.900
 bring to the boil 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:28.729
 the please also then it is really a 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:31.970
 a bit of action to cool down a bit 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.630
 let and then you glazed with it 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.630
 strawberries 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:45.479
 so ugly it is our multipacks 

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:47.099
 cake finished I still have them 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.289
 put in the fridge so that 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.409
 she solidifies everything a bit though 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.509
 I really had no problems with this 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.319
 mixed quark cream has really everything 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.999
 worked great and it really tastes 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:03.179
 delicious my god these are strawberries 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.619

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:06.929

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:10.469
