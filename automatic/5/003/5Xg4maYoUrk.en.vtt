00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.940
 Hi, how are you? I just got back from 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.690
 I was traveling there in Orlando on 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.370
 florida 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.410
 I went there to play in some 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.510
 amusement parks and I found that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 I got it from telling you that you're 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.960
 planning this type of trip 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.300
 what are the kinds of things I 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.189
 I like to carry in my purse in my 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.830
 backpack of the parks because the people 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 I was going to pack up I told you about the month 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
 I never talked about what you take 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.360
 every day you have here 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.620
 so come on 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.059
 I like to take it inside of mine. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.129
 backpack had a need for 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.840
 things get organized and I have 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.399
 this serious and transparent list is very 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.710
 practice because you find things 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.920
 very easily what goes in is 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.079
 the following is well- deserved teaching 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 This one you bought there and they are 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.760
 anti bacterial but I take any in five 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.739
 have even had in their hearts because 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.840
 it happens you'll get some some 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.160
 times when you will need a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.109
 bathroom but it will not work for you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.270
 bathroom or because the bathroom is very 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.000
 It's too crowded, the queue is too crowded. 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.930
 of a toy anyway there is just as well has 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.460
 to improvise 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.770
 so sometimes you have the hand 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.600
 because he took an ice cream ate a 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.340
 damage had something of the type and is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.070
 very cool also the deserved ones for 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.259
 clean your hands at these times 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.180
 It's also cool to have an antiseptic gel 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.040
 Why are you going to eat something there? 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.119
 want peacock for years that does not give 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.700
 search for water 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.200
 here is everything improvise even there you are 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.759
 in the rush you want to enjoy the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.860
 as long as you can the toys 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.900
 then the other things by mail without 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.450
 know whether or not teams are also very 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.220
 good to have because there you go you need only 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.710
 clean something that you 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.060
 game is and there is air conditioning in all 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 toys then if it's hot 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.780
 You 're in the heat of the sun. 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
 then you enter the cold air has this 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.530
 variation that sometimes makes National 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.930
 puc football only that this is very useful 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.409
 here is a ribbon of the next 3m or 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.180
 that you buy from non-ethical pharmacies 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.060
 It's micropore but it's a good business. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.950
 and that fiction will diminish is 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.860
 your foot in your shoe 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.290
 There you may be wearing tennis shoes. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.819
 time of the moment more comfortable than 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.979
 Can you imagine anyway you can? 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.290
 your foot is injured because you do not walk 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.879
 without stopping and tired at the end of the day if 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.709
 on your leg it hurts a lot 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.629
 You wake up the next day and can not 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.400
 put your foot down so it's good to have 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.170
 a little protection but only realizing 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.999
 so it's great here my 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.319
 shoes boots when you have a shoe 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.939
 taking a little on the foot 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.920
 it's just you put such a deal on 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.500
 that he stops doing this inflection and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.900
 I greatly improved on my trip 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.030
 that they are the smallest style 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.430
 star that the ones I used were knots 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.409
 he hurt a little bit back then 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.180
 I used a lot of this ribbon if you are 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.150
 girl the boy with long hair and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.219
 also needs in the suitcase or a 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.169
 an elastic I do not know how as each 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.480
 person calls this in society a 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:54.150
 panties when he was a child 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.040
 People called her panties sak is in 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.049
 last because you must fall mountain 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.760
 Russian and high speed toys 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.349
 You go to play and watering toys. 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.329
 then you will have an hour of your day that 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.790
 your hair is scary and it's going to be 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.319
 Good that I think you do not go so far 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.939
 scary photos 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.280
 I also like to take a little something 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.090
 for reasons that do not beat for brushing 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.970
 the teeth 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.949
 so sometimes we'll release the pac 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.139
 but let's go in the park you will need 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.750
 A little lament for then gives a 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.790
 false sense of cleanliness in the mouth and 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.769
 here also required is the car max you 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.120
 can use any blow that you have 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.069
 so its name that moisturizes a lot 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.870
 Mouth may be cold It may be hot 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.009
 do not go do not go trip even more 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.049
 in the united states 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.549
 I get my fingers dry with the 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.889
 dry nails with different hair 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.840
 with different feet and with very 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.569
 very closed then you need to have a 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.069
 deal ever you go is this is the 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.750
 optional step other 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.220
 If you like one of the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.889
 I like to pass a little bat to 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.840
 makeup I take to retouch and this powder 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.590
 which has an effect it the study done 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.750
 by mec 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.370
 it has an effect of the engineer then he 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.859
 despite being powder it has a cover 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.259
 baseline and also denies that a 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.419
 transvestite of the clinic to give a 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:05.669
 Snow kitchen in the mouth because I do 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.859
 A lot of the photo makes a lot of instagram. 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.060
 end I want some like this if you 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.500
 have a remedy 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.390
 Do you think it's important to you? 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.180
 during the day if you constantly have 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.799
 headache gets dizzy easy this 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.750
 kind of cool thing to take in the 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.250
 park because she will not have pharmacy 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.440
 so you're going to have to go into the 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.230
 laboratory if you could solve 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.000
 alone better then medicine in which you 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.889
 is already accustomed get you in the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.360
 Brazil to leave you in the backpack and 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.430
 for this it is necessary that everything is worth 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.560
 my suitcase no other things 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.260
 sunglasses is super important because 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.760
 It's going to be you and you'll sometimes want to leave. 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.720
 in the photos with the crisis for being more 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.850
 quiet 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.680
 is I also leads the champion takes the camera 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.430
 great so it was a taste in the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.320
 back 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.850
 if you're not going to take a big camera 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.540
 I'll tell you the photos on the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.370
 cell phone 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.560
 you can carry a smaller bag but 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.450
 Remember to carry a bag that puts 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.820
 so crossed in the body that you do not 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.490
 gotta keep holding on 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.919
 over the shoulder seal in practicality 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.990
 practicality a backpack or 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.210
 a transverse pouch that does not 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.280
 get too heavy be small easy to 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.070
 then carry the cam the better you need 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.560
 from a backpack and then to finish 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.500
 It's one of the things it's obvious is the cell phone it 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.780
 will have to do photo pakistan in the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.970
 universe how much disney fai you then 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.669
 can post their play of 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.350
 side to face is and the other thing is not 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.320
 I have here because I threw the way out 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.270
 but it's great to have a rain cap 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.090
 Are you able to buy raincoat on the 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.250
 park or you can buy or mate from there 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.990
 it's cheaper and she'll be useful in 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.330
 water toy has the toys 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.120
 the parks that live a lot look at 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.680
 worth on my blog I showed one of these 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.210
 so it's important to have a nice coat 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.789
 because it will help you especially if 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.910
 for wire the photo item never well does not have 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.919
 plus the ipca is the following is if you go 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.930
 summer does not need and if you go 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.090
 winter you will pay nothing but if you 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.370
 is kind now that spring in there the 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.350
 autumn and yes a very large variation 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.510
 then temperature when you arrive 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.729
 In the morning in the park, it's going to be very hot. 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.560
 as well as sun and is happening will 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.419
 being cold will be windy so i 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.070
 I always take this case 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.830
 from me here I have some of these 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.950
 jobs and are very thin and I can 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.169
 but so is put in the bag and 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.140
 It's very small, it takes up space. 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.520
 even the super rich areas 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.290
 including that this is selling 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.080
 At that moment, too, the children returned 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.330
 to sell the casinos and have other colors 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.040
 so I'm wearing a tank top too. 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.020
 trust it will not happen because the night 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.190
 Easy, I can talk, but one thing I 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.630
 I said I had already finished twice 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.420
 But there is one more thing that can be 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.100
 It also takes bahia cereal or 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.320
 some little thing for you to kill the hunger 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.180
 during the day because as I said 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.070
 The day is going to be very fast, and you will. 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.810
 want to take advantage so you do not 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.120
 necessarily achieve some 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.980
 bags and entering the restaurant is full 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.930
 When you 're ready, you 're right. 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.460
 hungry and sometimes it's good to have some 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.290
 little thing like that to disguise 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.600
 You can take a cereal bar. 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.880
 You can take the serve with chestnut.
