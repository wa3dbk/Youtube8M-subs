00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
64 bits you're going to need to install

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.750 
64 bits you're going to need to install
it<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.780> bit<00:02:54.930> differently<00:02:55.610> turn<00:02:56.610> off<00:02:56.730> your

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760

computer press f8 a few times before
Windows<00:03:00.060> boots<00:03:00.390> up<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.810> should<00:03:01.560> bring<00:03:01.800> into<00:03:02.070> a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
Windows boots up and should bring into a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.190 
Windows boots up and should bring into a
new<00:03:02.250> bootloader<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:03.030> you're<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.050> need

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
new bootloader and you're going to need

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.500 
new bootloader and you're going to need
to<00:03:04.230> click<00:03:05.480> disable<00:03:06.480> driver<00:03:07.110> enforcement<00:03:07.830> and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
to click disable driver enforcement and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.850 
to click disable driver enforcement and
then<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.750> pretty<00:03:10.020> much<00:03:10.140> repeat<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.650> process

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
then just pretty much repeat the process

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.800 
then just pretty much repeat the process
and<00:03:11.250> should<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.520> good<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> go<00:03:11.820> alright

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
and should be good to go alright

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.010 
and should be good to go alright
