engines<00:00:33.790> which<00:00:33.969> use<00:00:34.179> an<00:00:34.390> interesting

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
engines which use an interesting

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.290 
engines which use an interesting
technology<00:00:35.440> called<00:00:35.649> common<00:00:36.190> rail<00:00:36.429> so<00:00:37.090> in<00:00:37.210> this

learning how to get more power out of
your<00:00:48.489> diesel<00:00:48.760> then<00:00:49.629> come<00:00:49.809> along<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.230> let's

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
your diesel then come along and let's

00:00:50.410 --> 00:01:01.250 
your diesel then come along and let's
let's<00:00:51.129> see<00:00:51.249> how<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:51.399> goes

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.960 

we're<00:01:02.260> ready<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.470> begin<00:01:02.740> this<00:01:03.310> lesson<00:01:03.580> about

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
we're ready to begin this lesson about

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.510 
we're ready to begin this lesson about
diesel<00:01:04.720> fuel<00:01:04.960> injection<00:01:05.380> engines<00:01:05.650> but<00:01:06.280> as<00:01:06.370> it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
diesel fuel injection engines but as it

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.100 
diesel fuel injection engines but as it
turns<00:01:06.670> out<00:01:06.790> before<00:01:07.210> we<00:01:07.240> can<00:01:07.600> talk<00:01:07.870> about

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
turns out before we can talk about

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.320 
turns out before we can talk about
engines<00:01:08.740> in<00:01:08.950> general<00:01:09.550> regardless<00:01:09.790> of<00:01:10.180> what

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
engines in general regardless of what

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.850 
engines in general regardless of what
kind<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:10.870> we<00:01:11.140> could<00:01:11.260> be<00:01:11.410> talking<00:01:11.560> about

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
kind it is we could be talking about

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.890 
kind it is we could be talking about
gasoline<00:01:12.280> or<00:01:12.730> diesel<00:01:12.760> or<00:01:13.240> even<00:01:13.480> turbine

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
gasoline or diesel or even turbine

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.870 
gasoline or diesel or even turbine
engines<00:01:14.230> we<00:01:14.710> have<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.950> understand<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.460> basic

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
engines we have to understand the basic

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.750 
engines we have to understand the basic
premise<00:01:16.060> that<00:01:16.270> an<00:01:16.630> engine<00:01:17.080> is<00:01:17.470> an<00:01:17.680> air<00:01:17.920> pump<00:01:18.130> we

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
premise that an engine is an air pump we

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.210 
premise that an engine is an air pump we
actually<00:01:19.270> move<00:01:19.570> air<00:01:19.960> in<00:01:20.470> our<00:01:20.830> engine<00:01:21.130> that's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
actually move air in our engine that's

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.560 
actually move air in our engine that's
the<00:01:21.370> whole<00:01:21.520> concept<00:01:21.730> we're<00:01:22.120> going<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.300> pick<00:01:22.480> it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
the whole concept we're going to pick it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.000 
the whole concept we're going to pick it
up<00:01:22.660> interact<00:01:23.140> together<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.710> how<00:01:23.800> each<00:01:23.980> one

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
up interact together and how each one

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.400 
up interact together and how each one
works<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:25.090> complete<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.570> process<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:26.170> moving

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
works to complete the process of moving

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.070 
works to complete the process of moving
air<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.950> our<00:01:27.190> air<00:01:27.790> pump<00:01:28.150> come<00:01:28.780> on<00:01:28.870> let's<00:01:28.960> go

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
air to our air pump come on let's go

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.950 
air to our air pump come on let's go
check<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.440> out

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.360 

well<00:01:38.960> with<00:01:39.200> all<00:01:39.290> this<00:01:39.470> talk<00:01:39.650> about<00:01:39.710> airflow

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
well with all this talk about airflow

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.980 
well with all this talk about airflow
should<00:01:40.640> start<00:01:40.910> being<00:01:41.120> obvious<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.960> that

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
should start being obvious to you that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.290 
should start being obvious to you that
you<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:42.530> only<00:01:42.680> burn<00:01:43.220> as<00:01:43.550> much<00:01:43.700> air<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:44.090> you

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
you can only burn as much air as you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.810 
you can only burn as much air as you
have<00:01:44.710> which<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:45.860> interesting<00:01:45.980> because<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.550> lot

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
have which is interesting because a lot

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.250 
have which is interesting because a lot
of<00:01:46.850> wheel<00:01:47.150> up<00:01:47.480> to<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.750> point<00:01:47.990> when<00:01:48.110> you've

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
of wheel up to the point when you've

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.720 
of wheel up to the point when you've
consumed<00:01:48.650> all<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.010> air<00:01:49.160> but<00:01:49.370> oftentimes

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
consumed all the air but oftentimes

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.310 
consumed all the air but oftentimes
would<00:01:50.060> be<00:01:50.150> working<00:01:50.480> on<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.600> project<00:01:50.900> something

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
would be working on a project something

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.840 
would be working on a project something
like<00:01:51.470> this<00:01:51.680> where<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.610> amount<00:01:52.820> of

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
like this where the amount of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.310 
like this where the amount of
restrictions<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.660> air<00:01:53.750> flow<00:01:53.930> system

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
restrictions in the air flow system

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.140 
restrictions in the air flow system
they're<00:01:54.560> set<00:01:54.890> there's<00:01:55.460> nothing<00:01:55.760> I<00:01:55.880> can<00:01:55.940> do

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
they're set there's nothing I can do

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.850 
they're set there's nothing I can do
with<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.330> laptop<00:01:56.810> or<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:57.020> keyboard<00:01:57.440> or<00:01:57.590> even<00:01:57.800> a

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
air that the engine is able to give us

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.040 
air that the engine is able to give us
and<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.760> amount<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.030> fuel<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.570> mix<00:02:11.810> with

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
and the amount of fuel that we mix with

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.770 
and the amount of fuel that we mix with
it<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.890> when<00:02:13.010> we<00:02:13.100> talk<00:02:13.280> about<00:02:19.600> well<00:02:20.600> while

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
it so when we talk about well while

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.930 
it so when we talk about well while
we're<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.170> subject<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.830> controlling<00:02:22.640> fuel

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
we're on the subject of controlling fuel

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.240 
we're on the subject of controlling fuel
or<00:02:23.360> essentially<00:02:24.200> what<00:02:24.320> we<00:02:24.380> call<00:02:24.560> mapping<00:02:25.100> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
or essentially what we call mapping the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.620 
or essentially what we call mapping the
engine<00:02:25.490> let's<00:02:25.640> talk<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.850> little<00:02:25.970> bit<00:02:26.240> about<00:02:26.420> how

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
engine let's talk a little bit about how

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.720 
engine let's talk a little bit about how
that<00:02:26.690> happens<00:02:27.230> traditionally<00:02:28.130> there's<00:02:28.370> three

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
that happens traditionally there's three

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.210 
that happens traditionally there's three
ways<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:29.360> we<00:02:29.510> could<00:02:29.720> calculate<00:02:30.110> or<00:02:30.770> or

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
ways that we could calculate or or

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.310 
ways that we could calculate or or
represent<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.060> load<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.690> engine<00:02:32.840> and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
represent the load on the engine and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.400 
represent the load on the engine and
those<00:02:33.830> would<00:02:33.950> be<00:02:34.010> speed<00:02:34.880> density<00:02:35.410> mass

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
those would be speed density mass

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.550 
those would be speed density mass
airflow<00:02:36.709> or<00:02:37.190> torque<00:02:37.910> based<00:02:38.360> now<00:02:39.020> speed

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
airflow or torque based now speed

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.949 
airflow or torque based now speed
density<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:40.220> probably<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.000> most<00:02:41.180> practical

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
density is probably the most practical

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.310 
density is probably the most practical
for<00:02:42.590> app

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.330 

talked<00:02:49.320> about<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.710> fact<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.130> map

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
talked about the fact that the map

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.980 
talked about the fact that the map
sensor<00:02:50.730> measures<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.150> pressure<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
sensor measures the pressure and the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.990 
sensor measures the pressure and the
manifold<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:53.220> can<00:02:53.460> actually<00:02:53.820> measure

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
manifold it can actually measure

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.850 
manifold it can actually measure
pressure<00:02:54.360> anywhere<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:55.080> measure<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
pressure anywhere can measure this is a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.820 
pressure anywhere can measure this is a
basic<00:02:56.220> throttle<00:02:57.060> position<00:02:57.570> sensor<00:02:57.650> it's<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
basic throttle position sensor it's a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.860 
basic throttle position sensor it's a
mystery<00:02:59.280> their<00:02:59.610> device<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.240> changes<00:03:00.690> its

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
mystery their device that changes its

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.110 
mystery their device that changes its
resistance<00:03:01.650> relative<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.760> temperature

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
resistance relative to the temperature

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.670 
resistance relative to the temperature
of<00:03:03.270> something<00:03:03.660> around<00:03:03.930> intercessors

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
of something around intercessors

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.830 
of something around intercessors
actually<00:03:05.580> very<00:03:05.820> much<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.210> an<00:03:06.360> air<00:03:06.570> sensor

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
actually very much like an air sensor

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.470 
actually very much like an air sensor
except<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.550> designed<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.210> in

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
except that it's designed to be in

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.800 
except that it's designed to be in
liquid<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.080> if<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.260> have<00:03:10.440> some<00:03:10.680> speed<00:03:11.070> sensors

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
liquid so if you have some speed sensors

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.330 
liquid so if you have some speed sensors
speed<00:03:12.810> sensors<00:03:13.290> can<00:03:13.530> comes<00:03:13.740> with<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.130> guy

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
speed sensors can comes with this guy

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220 
speed sensors can comes with this guy
here<00:03:14.580> this<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.180> diesel<00:03:15.480> particulate<00:03:15.810> filter

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
here this is a diesel particulate filter

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.740 
here this is a diesel particulate filter
let's<00:03:16.680> take<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> look<00:03:17.100> look<00:03:17.820> in<00:03:18.030> there<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.300> you

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
let's take a look look in there and you

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.330 
let's take a look look in there and you
can<00:03:18.900> see<00:03:19.050> that<00:03:19.230> essentially<00:03:19.740> what<00:03:19.830> happens<00:03:20.220> is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
can see that essentially what happens is

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.680 
can see that essentially what happens is
the<00:03:20.550> Swit<00:03:20.760> coming<00:03:21.030> out<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.330> exhaust<00:03:21.390> pipe

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
the Swit coming out of the exhaust pipe

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.050 
the Swit coming out of the exhaust pipe
goes<00:03:22.080> in<00:03:22.320> here<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.680> gets<00:03:22.830> trapped<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.910> that

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
goes in here and it gets trapped so that

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.400 
goes in here and it gets trapped so that
it<00:03:24.150> doesn't<00:03:24.300> come<00:03:24.570> out<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.810> other<00:03:24.930> end<00:03:25.020> and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
it doesn't come out the other end and

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.140 
it doesn't come out the other end and
you<00:03:25.470> well<00:03:25.920> here<00:03:26.100> we<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> basic

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
you well here we have a basic

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.180 
you well here we have a basic
turbocharger<00:03:27.930> cutaway<00:03:28.320> configuration<00:03:29.040> where

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
turbocharger cutaway configuration where

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.560 
turbocharger cutaway configuration where
we<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.400> talk<00:03:29.550> about<00:03:29.820> what<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.180> thing<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.390> and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
we can talk about what this thing is and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.290 
we can talk about what this thing is and
kind<00:03:30.990> of<00:03:31.110> what<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.440> does<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.740> how<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.890> works

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
kind of what it does and how it works

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.950 
kind of what it does and how it works
essentially<00:03:33.300> we<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.690> few<00:03:33.930> different

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
essentially we have a few different

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.810 
essentially we have a few different
components<00:03:34.590> we<00:03:34.710> have<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> hot<00:03:35.130> section<00:03:35.580> over

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
components we have a hot section over

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.240 
components we have a hot section over
here<00:03:35.850> made<00:03:36.360> out<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.660> heavy<00:03:36.930> metals<00:03:37.380> deal<00:03:37.590> but

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
here made out of heavy metals deal but

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.530 
here made out of heavy metals deal but
it<00:03:38.370> doesn't<00:03:38.640> have<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.910> withstand<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.420> high

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
it doesn't have to withstand the high

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.940 
it doesn't have to withstand the high
temperatures<00:03:40.020> that<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.350> exhaust<00:03:40.710> housing

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
temperatures that the exhaust housing

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.880 
temperatures that the exhaust housing
stuff<00:03:41.460> does<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.600> essentially<00:03:43.320> how<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.650> thing

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
stuff does so essentially how this thing

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.680 
stuff does so essentially how this thing
works<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.310> we<00:03:44.730> come<00:03:44.910> over<00:03:45.150> here

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.380 

you

number the CFM number those it doesn't

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.720 
number the CFM number those it doesn't

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
tell us the whole story you see see if M

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.540 
tell us the whole story you see see if M

is a volumetric so density one way that

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.090 
is a volumetric so density one way that
we<00:04:00.640> could<00:04:00.760> easily<00:04:00.940> define<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.720> in<00:04:01.840> terms<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.440> de

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
we could easily define it in terms of de

trying<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.959> figure<00:04:05.110> out<00:04:05.260> how<00:04:05.530> much<00:04:05.650> mass<00:04:05.980> of

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
trying to figure out how much mass of

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:30.980 
trying to figure out how much mass of
air<00:04:06.370> is<00:04:06.580> there<00:04:06.880> in<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.120> engine<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.930> we<00:04:08.050> can

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.930 

ok<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.380> succeeded<00:04:33.220> in<00:04:33.310> getting<00:04:33.430> our<00:04:33.640> first

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
ok so we succeeded in getting our first

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.370 
ok so we succeeded in getting our first
run<00:04:34.150> down<00:04:34.330> where<00:04:34.480> we<00:04:34.570> just<00:04:34.780> have<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.110> stock

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
run down where we just have the stock

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.020 
run down where we just have the stock
vehicle<00:04:35.890> now<00:04:36.070> we<00:04:36.130> can<00:04:36.340> display<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.850> bounce

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
vehicle now we can display the bounce

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.520 
vehicle now we can display the bounce
temperatures<00:04:37.540> there<00:04:37.750> when<00:04:37.900> we<00:04:38.020> do<00:04:38.170> that<00:04:38.320> so

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
temperatures there when we do that so

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.780 
temperatures there when we do that so
what<00:04:39.160> we're<00:04:39.250> going<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.430> do<00:04:39.490> we're<00:04:39.550> going<00:04:39.730> to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.610 
what we're going to do we're going to
have<00:04:39.940> our<00:04:39.970> calibration<00:04:40.390> engineer<00:04:40.900> Rob<00:04:41.080> go

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
have our calibration engineer Rob go

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.320 
have our calibration engineer Rob go
ahead<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.010> add<00:04:42.130> some<00:04:42.400> fuel<00:04:42.640> we'll<00:04:43.180> do<00:04:43.300> a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
ahead and add some fuel we'll do a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.580 
ahead and add some fuel we'll do a
second<00:04:43.780> run<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:43.990> we'll<00:04:44.110> come<00:04:44.260> back<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.530> we'll

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
second run and we'll come back and we'll

00:04:44.590 --> 00:05:02.559 
second run and we'll come back and we'll
talk<00:04:44.800> about<00:04:44.950> the<00:04:45.130> numbers<00:04:45.370> we<00:04:45.490> get
