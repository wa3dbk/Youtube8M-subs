00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 good afternoon dear viewers and 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.390
 our channel subscribers are my name 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.490
 Igor is an expert on plants and today we 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.080
 with you consider so very interesting 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.260
 topic 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:18.300
 planting and care of mountain pine mountain 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.070
 pine she hails from western europe this 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.080
 a small tree that will grow but 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 a maximum of two meters is very beautiful 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.640
 the thread is so short 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.010
 interesting thorn needles but many 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 gardeners believe that 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.940
 replant planting pine trees 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.410
 quite complicated burdensome at the very 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.450
 In fact, this is not the case and now I 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.570
 I'll show you all this means dropping off 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.850
 yourself on the mountain pine in principle 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 recommended late April early May 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 or late September early October here 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.090
 later closer to the frost do 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.770
 it does not stand on what plants can 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.600
 just not adapt to a new place 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.670
 and during severe frosts die 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.989
 basic rule for planting conifers 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.860
 pine in this case the horn is not 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.780
 an exception 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
 be sure to buy a sapling 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.129
 closed root system here in 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.660
 the century container we purchased a sapling with 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.369
 You can find it in a container at all 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.439
 land at least year round 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.659
 in the summer even in the strongest heat in what 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.330
 meaning root system developed very 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.250
 well earthy one-piece and there 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.840
 mycorrhiza which lives on the roots 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.040
 microorganisms that help pine 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.170
 soak up water and minerals 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.229
 some nutrients she 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.820
 left a whole if you buy a sapling 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.340
 open root system most likely 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.829
 mycorrhiza there already died 10 15 minutes on 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.450
 it grabs dry roots and most likely 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.240
 the plant will not take root so buy 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.189
 Here are such a closed root system when 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.170
 choosing a place for planting mountain pines 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.110
 follow these rules pine 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.000
 grows very well on well lit 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.909
 sunny places can be small 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.530
 penumbra principle and shade on endure but 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.600
 Of course will develop much 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.250
 slower much worse and so we chose 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.939
 such a place and now we will go with you 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.409
 Now you need to dig a hole the size of the hole can be 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.850
 determine by the size of this 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.030
 container is such a root system 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.549
 the pit is digging naturally more 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.520
 centimeters 15-20 more in diameter 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.500
 and centimeters 20 to 30 even 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.720
 Already group pine actually like 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.730
 of all wars and does not like stagnant water therefore 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.860
 if your waters are high or 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.360
 some kind of lowland a for 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.240
 need to do good drainage here we are 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.490
 with claydite we fall asleep the bottom of ours and we where 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.560
 then 5 centimeters 10 layer can be more 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.330
 after that we cover the layer of expanded clay 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.000
 we made a little of our soil 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.910
 a fertile mixture of about three 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.920
 parts of sod land 1 part of sand one 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.350
 a piece of cake it's all good 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.900
 we mix and now we get ours 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.820
 plants are careful not to damage 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.730
 earthy lump and here is a very important one 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.130
 detail under our edge is the top edge of our 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.900
 pits need to plant a plant so that 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.370
 root neck in no case 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.440
 it turned out for the depth because of his hours on 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.450
 recessed lower than our dna level 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.310
 our still need to pick up 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.070
 it is better to plant even a little higher ground 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.510
 then it will settle down and accordingly 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.670
 the plant sits in place and now 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.890
 space we fall asleep to our fertile 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.690
 ground in principle pine plant 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.880
 unpretentious but natural for better 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.340
 rooting for the first time a year or two 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.320
 and need a good fertile land of labor 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.420
 everything will be better than good 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.220
 we tamp down so that no voids and us 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.720
 did not remain 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.480
 to land all space replacement 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.010
 immediately form such a small 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.440
 to the pinhole to watering 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.570
 the water remained and did not flow immediately 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.940
 after planting it is desirable 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.790
 well pour the arm to 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.650
 you can water immediately and pour 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.270
 Coniferous plants are very fond of 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.370
 when they are doused with some water, give some water 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.100
 soak a little bit later you can still 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.040
 once shed before the start of winter root 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.140
 the system also needs to be covered with peat 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.180
 protects against excessive evaporation of moisture 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.830
 root system and more or less 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.830
 normal temperature 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.870
 will be patient 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.970
 art is the same centimeters 5 10 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.980
 sprinkle on the vest 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.900
 but young plants are better of course on 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.830
 cover with winter spruce branches that is 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.710
 coniferous branches of coniferous trees so 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.960
 right on top is good 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.180
 after something squeeze a little bit so that they 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.030
 not crumbled for more of course we 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.220
 here so show a lot of this 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.060
 young landing your protects from 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.060
 severe frost 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.830
 so today we saw how you need 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.360
 plant and care for mountain pine on 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.330
 this is actually saying goodbye to you 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.560
 watch our video plots 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.310
