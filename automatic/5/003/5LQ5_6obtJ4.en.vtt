 you have to wrap up people like this 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.960
 let's say let's say it happens because everything 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:06.380
 we are people more units and because on 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:08.840
 in the south, responsible people do not carry 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.090
 podmazhem not go in the technique in general 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.479

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.049
 father rows what we're doing now 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.299
 lining change 15 will take time 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.640
 bus drivers are also taught as 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.220
 other differences in size only 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.770
 vehicle 22 meters long 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.650
 3 meters almost width 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.770
 Well, the height of 300 full load 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:52.330
 bus twenty seven and a half tons 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:54.800
 let's go we are going now on route 16 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.500
 this is one of the nine routes which 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.090
 serves mosgortrans since not 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.860
 recommended to put it mildly distract 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.170
 driver while driving we will wait 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.970
 Stop Andrew Tell me what is the main 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.500
 interest to you 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.729
 professions like working on big ones 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.229
 buses 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.400
 carry passengers to work 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.530
 work back on a mule at rush hour happens 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.690
 there are so many people here that but literally not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.700
 push through but there is one person 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.049
 who feels in this turmoil 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.409
 like a fish in water 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.150
 erin but i'm right sure especially in 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.650
 rush hour our townspeople prefer 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.650
 to use 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.310
 our garage culture has changed markedly 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.310
 communicative 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.910
 well then we got to safely 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.400
 thanks to the conductor and my stop 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.070
 the driver today for the shift they will pass 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.380
 about 200 kilometers so for me 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:56.310
 handful im still today circles shake and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.310
 shove just go 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.959
 so of course in general, then nothing complicated 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.139
 responsible 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:21.350
 No, I really could have been a nickname bus 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.350
 everything is summer live is great
