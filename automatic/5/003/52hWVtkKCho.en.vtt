00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.960
 today talk about the current state of affairs 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.010
 in repair and completion tailgate windows 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:16.400
 and so on the back door I installed the glass 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.930
 with seal and fully assembled 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.410
 the wiper ie the lever is visible 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.900
 wiper or brush leash 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.199
 it is already installed functions will say 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 immediately that this is an abnormal wiper 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.329
 rather , the gear motor is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.700
 gear motor here are foreign cars 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.239
 that's why I went all loud I 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.840
 I'll tell you later so I'll start with 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.230
 which briefly tell you about glass 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.430
 It is worth to put in its regular place 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 its on the door a minute thing however it is 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.390
 very useful procedure since 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.960
 lets you understand how good 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.469
 gas pores work 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.439
 that means the second 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.710
 as I said right at the beginning this is new 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.920
 wiper new old means 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.240
 I'll show you how it works. 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.640
 it works for me so far 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 timeline here's an auxiliary 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.970
 battery 12 volt lead from 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.630
 bespereboynika computer 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.630
 Here you are, this is how it works. 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.759
 with 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.689
 so well, I feel that I need 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.070
 explain why I changed the staff 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.020
 wiper 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.670
 But on such from foreign cars 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.319
 Well, I explained it briefly like this. 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.100
 here now if you look at the arm that 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.600
 can be found on it is 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.740
 sheckler man in the street 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.280
 and when the whole system works that is 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.599
 the washer is turned on then a jet of fluid 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.979
 served directly under the brush 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:12.140
 here it is fed by rubber 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.690
 tubes turn rubber tube 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.870
 from through the adapter turns on ok pump 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.870
 washer 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.370
 Well, if you remember in the regular system 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:29.230
 which was on the window and actually 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.060
 any any vaz cars this here 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.519
 It is worth such a jet here to adjust it 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.590
 that he is well and steadily worked well, 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.170
 almost impossible anyway 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.750
 I have failed in my long life 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.900
 set up a single jet so that it 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.310
 It suited me here and so I decided 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.840
 question radically changed 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.209
 wiper well just assembled 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.250
 because it has all these questions 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.690
 liner 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.030
 fluids solved completely different 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.209
 way 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.050
 But now I will show a little more 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.569
 how is this new organized 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.910
 wiper i'm showing how 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.910
 the door opens with glass 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.850
 well hidden I have not put away I 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.040
 reported to lubricate the loops here 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.450
 here I will be only after 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.650
 I will paint the door completely and so here you can see 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:39.310
 what's brought here with a new design 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.700
 This one was a regular bracket from 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.989
 foreign cars with this one 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.250
 gear motor here I have it 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.910
 digest paws here paws I digested 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.860
 already at the place of the place I had 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.769
 organized like this I still 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.580
 poured here one plate like this 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:04.870
 steel lorries 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:11.670
 here it is here welded points well 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.670
 here you can see here and there all this can be seen 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:21.160
 here are these here are paws from this side 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:26.740
 that is, it all turned out like this 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:29.170
 very tough design that's the way I 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.400
 left her without looking at the drive and here 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:35.610
 can see what is between them 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:41.650
 there was a gap but absolutely small 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:49.320
 so here so here if you look deep into 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:49.320
 there are visible inlet in the depths 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.370
 washing liquid here I have now 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:01.390
 habit until it is his finger here's 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.790
 where is the washing fluid going 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.260
 actually so design track 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.830
 like the entrance 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:13.010
 but now 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:16.460
 but now we are not the door with the extra 3 holes 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:21.830
 here it is a gift once it is from the castle larvae 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:28.320
 this mountain is 2 from drive by the way drive 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:32.130
 Akusha then there is that it's bad, he 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:37.890
 fixed to the door with three dots two times 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:44.010
 three here is this point on the street is attached 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:47.430
 on here through this hole here 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.330
 always water and turn away not matter here 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.960
 This is the nut 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.070
 such a construction is very very difficult 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.280
 me too hacking 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:00.390
 always irritation in import 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.570
 gearmotor all decided committed to 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:07.650
 another one let you take your 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:13.500
 attention here I'll show see all here 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:17.310
 three attachment points is inside here 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:21.120
 This is the gum that goes shaft 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.630
 in fact it is the stuffing box then 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.570
 there is this gum seals the shaft and 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.280
 no water does not get anywhere here well 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.190
 By the way, here's a close-up view 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.880
 adapter through which is supplied 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:37.770
 washer fluid 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:43.980
 Well, these cute little things led to 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:47.250
 what I took and redid the wiper 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.810
 here now all the wires here they are 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.090
 are hanging 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:57.540
 yes the connector is bitten off and loose the terminals 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:07:01.470
 ordinary terminals this case dads here 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:05.360
 these probably also food but oh well 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:09.889
 that is, it means two points now 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:18.300
 car's another wiper and 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:22.460
 Now the car is working normally 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:26.960
 gas stops you are fine 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:30.110
 next time I brew these holes here 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.500
 these ones have become redundant 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:37.590
 well, everything and the door will be ready 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.400
 I don't know which one is higher yet 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:44.729
 make skin sense upholstery type 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:49.169
 to close this here this here 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:52.410
 all part of the door from the cabin 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:56.120
 from the passenger side, well, something like this 

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.120
 things are going on today
