00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
and grow them all the way to lay fruit

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.060 
and grow them all the way to lay fruit
so<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.660> takes<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:21.960> 2<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.320> 3<00:00:22.500> years<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:22.949> them

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
cashew nut itself is actually quite

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.289 
cashew nut itself is actually quite
large<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.939> thought<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> give<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

guys<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> quick<00:01:45.869> look<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.500> cashew<00:01:46.920> nut

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
guys a quick look at what the cashew nut

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.319 
guys a quick look at what the cashew nut
looks<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.490> itself<00:01:47.939> here

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
looks like itself here

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.999 
looks like itself here
got<00:01:48.659> kind<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.960> kidney<00:01:49.259> bean<00:01:49.439> shape<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
got kind of a kidney bean shape to it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.510 
got kind of a kidney bean shape to it
and<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.229> there's<00:01:52.649> there's<00:01:53.399> different

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and I you know there's there's different

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.120 
and I you know there's there's different
sizes<00:01:53.970> obviously<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.439> majority<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.979> them

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
sizes obviously but the majority of them

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.719 
sizes obviously but the majority of them
are<00:01:56.369> about<00:01:56.640> an<00:01:57.149> inch<00:01:57.299> long<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> know

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
are about an inch long and that you know

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
are about an inch long and that you know
they're<00:01:59.880> they're<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.479> large<00:02:00.810> size<00:02:01.170> nut<00:02:01.439> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
they're they're very large size nut I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.649 
they're they're very large size nut I
have<00:02:02.399> prepared<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.149> bucket<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
have prepared a a just like a bucket of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.020 
have prepared a a just like a bucket of
water<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.459> it<00:02:08.459> doesn't<00:02:08.729> matter<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
water here and it doesn't matter the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.940 
water here and it doesn't matter the
temperature<00:02:09.179> really<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.739> first

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
temperature really but this is the first

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
temperature really but this is the first
step<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.250> needs<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.580> done<00:02:11.730> you're<00:02:12.420> going

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
step that needs to be done you're going

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.580 
step that needs to be done you're going
to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
to
not<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.599> cardboard<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.260> there<00:02:16.470> now<00:02:17.310> see

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
not get the cardboard in there now see

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.910 
not get the cardboard in there now see
as<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.050> see<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.640> nuts

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
as you can see the nuts

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.970 

there's<00:02:23.459> nuts<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:23.970> bottom<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:24.980> there's

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
there's nuts on the bottom and there's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.759 
there's nuts on the bottom and there's
nuts<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.459> surface<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:28.290> keeps

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
nuts on the surface and that keeps

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.320 
nuts on the surface and that keeps
happening<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.840> nuts<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.260> float<00:02:31.799> are<00:02:32.330> non

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
happening the nuts that float are non

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.530 
happening the nuts that float are non
viable<00:02:33.989> seeds<00:02:34.319> they<00:02:34.590> won't<00:02:34.920> sprout<00:02:35.540> something

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
viable seeds they won't sprout something

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.650 
viable seeds they won't sprout something
happened<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.170> them<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.849> they<00:02:38.849> they<00:02:39.420> won't

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
happened to them and they they won't

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.250 
happened to them and they they won't
stop<00:02:39.959> they<00:02:40.319> won't<00:02:40.500> run<00:02:40.739> at<00:02:40.860> all<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:42.260> that's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
stop they won't run at all and that's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.390 
stop they won't run at all and that's
imperative<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.989> get<00:02:46.200> them<00:02:46.400> to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
imperative that you that you get them to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.220 
imperative that you that you get them to
that<00:02:47.519> stage<00:02:47.910> because<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.840> saves<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.170> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that stage because then it saves you a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.039 
that stage because then it saves you a
whole<00:02:49.290> lot<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.650> time<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.099> frustration<00:02:51.049> now

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
whole lot of time and frustration now

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
this water - that way you can make sure

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.940 
this water - that way you can make sure
that<00:02:59.549> they're<00:02:59.879> completely<00:03:00.690> viable<00:03:01.170> because

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that they're completely viable because

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.530 
that they're completely viable because
otherwise<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.879> just<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.180> waste<00:03:03.390> your

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
otherwise it's just going to waste your

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.490 
otherwise it's just going to waste your
time<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.760> uh<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:06.780> guys<00:03:06.900> look<00:03:07.140> gone

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
time and uh and then you guys look gone

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.800 
time and uh and then you guys look gone
over<00:03:07.799> there<00:03:08.010> anyways<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.549> make<00:03:08.879> sure<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.629> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
over there anyways is make sure that the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.140 
over there anyways is make sure that the
seeds<00:03:10.079> are<00:03:10.290> wrong<00:03:10.620> if<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.459> get<00:03:11.610> seeds<00:03:12.000> from

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
seeds are wrong if you get seeds from

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.360 
seeds are wrong if you get seeds from
your<00:03:12.299> local<00:03:12.540> stores<00:03:13.049> they're<00:03:13.560> always<00:03:13.950> going

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
your local stores they're always going

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.250 
your local stores they're always going
to<00:03:14.489> be<00:03:14.549> cooked<00:03:14.760> because<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.329> health<00:03:15.629> codes<00:03:15.959> and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
to be cooked because of health codes and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.539 
to be cooked because of health codes and
standards<00:03:16.379> and<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.010> generally<00:03:17.280> they're

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
standards and so generally they're

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.319 
standards and so generally they're
either<00:03:17.730> roasted<00:03:18.329> or<00:03:18.590> they're<00:03:19.590> on<00:03:20.030> their<00:03:21.030> rot

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
either roasted or they're on their rot

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.080 
either roasted or they're on their rot
in<00:03:21.630> their<00:03:21.870> hole<00:03:22.079> or<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.739> formed<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.790> eating

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
in their hole or have formed for eating

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.300 
in their hole or have formed for eating
and<00:03:24.299> it's<00:03:25.260> pretty<00:03:25.410> hard<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.680> find<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.130> raw

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
and it's pretty hard to find the raw

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.280 
and it's pretty hard to find the raw
form<00:03:26.639> so<00:03:26.880> look<00:03:27.480> online<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.170> can

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
form so look online and you can

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.009 
form so look online and you can
generally<00:03:28.769> find<00:03:28.920> some<00:03:29.430> raw<00:03:29.639> seeds<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.299> got

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
generally find some raw seeds I got

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.420 
generally find some raw seeds I got
these<00:03:31.170> from<00:03:31.319> a<00:03:31.440> seller<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:31.859> India<00:03:32.190> actually

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
pretty decent price for the price that I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.860 
pretty decent price for the price that I
got<00:03:39.209> them<00:03:39.359> at<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.530> uh<00:03:40.739> when<00:03:41.579> you<00:03:42.269> do<00:03:42.569> get

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
got them at all so uh when you do get

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.409 
got them at all so uh when you do get
these<00:03:43.280> when<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.400> five<00:03:44.609> to<00:03:44.760> ten<00:03:44.940> minutes<00:03:45.239> is

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
these when the five to ten minutes is

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.069 
these when the five to ten minutes is
elapsed<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.359> you<00:03:48.569> found<00:03:48.780> all<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
elapsed and you and you found all the

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.319 
elapsed and you and you found all the
non<00:03:49.230> viable<00:03:49.590> seeds<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:50.760> don't<00:03:51.030> want<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.209> stick

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
non viable seeds you don't want to stick

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.819 
non viable seeds you don't want to stick
your<00:03:51.389> hands<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:51.959> water<00:03:52.230> because<00:03:52.620> the

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
your hands in this water because the

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.920 
your hands in this water because the
water<00:03:53.099> will<00:03:53.370> draw<00:03:53.669> some<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.120> oils<00:03:54.510> out<00:03:54.690> and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
water will draw some of the oils out and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.780 
water will draw some of the oils out and
the<00:03:55.260> oil<00:03:55.440> rusts<00:03:55.829> on<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.010> surface<00:03:56.459> some<00:03:56.760> of

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the oil rusts on the surface some of

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.150 
the oil rusts on the surface some of
that<00:03:56.880> oil<00:03:57.030> they'll<00:03:57.299> burn<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.069> it's<00:03:59.069> really

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
that oil they'll burn you so it's really

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.390 
that oil they'll burn you so it's really
really<00:04:00.030> uh<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:01.470> have<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.650> be<00:04:01.709> very<00:04:01.889> careful

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
really uh you have to be very careful

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.309 
really uh you have to be very careful
not<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.180> reach<00:04:03.630> your<00:04:03.810> hands<00:04:03.989> right<00:04:04.200> in

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
not to just reach your hands right in

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.900 
not to just reach your hands right in
you're<00:04:04.769> going<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.010> want<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.160> drain<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.730> water

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
you're going to want to drain the water

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.080 
you're going to want to drain the water
off<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.690> then<00:04:07.380> pull<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.829> seeds<00:04:08.370> out<00:04:08.549> because

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
off and then pull the seeds out because

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.670 
off and then pull the seeds out because
any<00:04:09.329> oil<00:04:09.660> that's<00:04:09.930> remaining<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.410> seats

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
any oil that's remaining on the seats

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.050 
any oil that's remaining on the seats
will<00:04:10.980> float<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> surface<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.970> you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
will float to the surface and you

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.520 
will float to the surface and you
definitely<00:04:12.239> don't<00:04:12.660> want<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:12.959> on<00:04:13.139> your<00:04:13.169> skin

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
definitely don't want that on your skin

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
definitely don't want that on your skin
alright<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:13.950> it's<00:04:14.069> been<00:04:14.130> about<00:04:14.310> six<00:04:14.819> minutes

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
alright so it's been about six minutes

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.110 
alright so it's been about six minutes
and<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.720> think<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.200> probably<00:04:16.440> long<00:04:16.739> enough

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
and I think this is probably long enough

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.580 
and I think this is probably long enough
but<00:04:18.120> as<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.389> can<00:04:18.510> see<00:04:18.570> there<00:04:19.019> is<00:04:19.169> still<00:04:19.320> one

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
but as you can see there is still one

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.319 
but as you can see there is still one
floating<00:04:20.099> which<00:04:20.220> means<00:04:20.430> I'm<00:04:20.639> glad<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:20.940> did<00:04:21.180> this

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
floating which means I'm glad I did this

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.360 
floating which means I'm glad I did this
because<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:22.049> one<00:04:22.469> we're<00:04:22.620> not<00:04:22.650> around<00:04:23.039> anyway

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
because that one we're not around anyway

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
because that one we're not around anyway
so<00:04:23.430> what<00:04:23.700> I'm<00:04:23.760> actually<00:04:23.880> gonna<00:04:24.090> do<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.300> when

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
so what I'm actually gonna do is when

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.060 
so what I'm actually gonna do is when
she<00:04:24.479> can<00:04:24.599> take<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:24.870> little<00:04:25.140> thing<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.979> can

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
she can take this little thing you can

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.070 
she can take this little thing you can
probably<00:04:26.219> take<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.460> spoon

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
probably take a spoon

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.409 
probably take a spoon
or<00:04:27.379> something<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:28.520> make<00:04:28.789> sure<00:04:28.819> you<00:04:29.150> don't

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
or something but make sure you don't

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.149 
or something but make sure you don't
stick<00:04:29.690> your<00:04:29.780> hands<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.169> liquid<00:04:30.500> I'm<00:04:30.860> just

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
stick your hands in the liquid I'm just

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.680 
stick your hands in the liquid I'm just
going<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.310> scoop<00:04:31.639> that<00:04:31.819> one<00:04:32.030> out<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:32.419> was<00:04:32.539> the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
going to scoop that one out that was the

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.439 
going to scoop that one out that was the
bad<00:04:32.840> seed<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.319> was<00:04:33.409> floating<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.449> chances

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
bad seed that was floating and chances

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.839 
bad seed that was floating and chances
are<00:04:35.599> nothing<00:04:36.020> will<00:04:36.199> ever<00:04:36.229> happen<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.889> it<00:04:36.919> so

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
are nothing will ever happen to it so

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.749 
are nothing will ever happen to it so
I'm<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.060> going<00:04:38.569> to<00:04:38.780> go<00:04:39.289> drain<00:04:39.560> this<00:04:39.710> water<00:04:40.009> so

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
I'm just going to go drain this water so

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.700 
I'm just going to go drain this water so
that<00:04:40.789> I<00:04:41.000> can<00:04:41.360> retrieve<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.960> seeds<00:04:42.259> from<00:04:42.500> it

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
that I can retrieve the seeds from it

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.170 
that I can retrieve the seeds from it
and<00:04:42.860> then<00:04:43.370> I'm<00:04:43.460> actually<00:04:43.610> going<00:04:43.849> to<00:04:43.909> get<00:04:44.060> to

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
and then I'm actually going to get to

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.529 
and then I'm actually going to get to
planting<00:04:44.599> them<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.190> then<00:04:46.190> we<00:04:46.430> can<00:04:46.699> we<00:04:47.419> can

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
planting them and then we can we can

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.210 
planting them and then we can we can
move<00:04:47.780> on<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.080> next<00:04:48.199> step<00:04:48.470> once<00:04:48.680> they<00:04:49.009> get

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
move on to the next step once they get

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.860 
move on to the next step once they get
to<00:04:49.250> sprouting<00:04:49.669> so<00:04:49.819> now<00:04:49.940> that<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.270> have<00:04:50.479> your

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
to sprouting so now that you have your

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.649 
to sprouting so now that you have your
cashew<00:04:51.830> nuts<00:04:52.009> strained<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:54.830> have<00:04:55.639> let<00:04:56.509> them

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
cashew nuts strained you have let them

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:57.790 
cashew nuts strained you have let them
soak<00:04:56.930> for<00:04:56.990> five<00:04:57.349> minutes

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
soak for five minutes

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.189 
soak for five minutes
pick<00:04:57.949> out<00:04:58.069> the<00:04:58.129> bad<00:04:58.460> ones<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.719> strain<00:05:00.050> the

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
pick out the bad ones and you strain the

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.770 
pick out the bad ones and you strain the
water<00:05:00.229> you're<00:05:01.009> going<00:05:01.219> to<00:05:01.310> want<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.729> plant<00:05:02.629> them

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
water you're going to want to plant them

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.240 
water you're going to want to plant them
right<00:05:02.810> away<00:05:03.199> the<00:05:03.530> ones<00:05:03.710> that<00:05:03.979> have<00:05:04.129> not

right away the ones that have not

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.689 
right away the ones that have not

floated to the surface these cups are

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.029 
floated to the surface these cups are
filled<00:05:07.940> with<00:05:08.090> just<00:05:08.270> your<00:05:08.479> basic<00:05:08.740> potting<00:05:09.740> soil

seedlings<00:05:17.300> or<00:05:17.569> anything<00:05:18.080> like<00:05:18.319> that

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
seedlings or anything like that

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.909 
seedlings or anything like that
and<00:05:18.969> so<00:05:19.969> what<00:05:20.090> you're<00:05:20.210> going<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.389> do<00:05:20.539> is<00:05:20.919> you're

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
and so what you're going to do is you're

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.959 
and so what you're going to do is you're
going<00:05:22.159> to<00:05:22.250> want<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.870> look<00:05:23.870> at<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.409> nut<00:05:24.590> and

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
going to want to look at the nut and

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.760 
going to want to look at the nut and
there's<00:05:25.969> going<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.300> be<00:05:26.419> kind<00:05:26.780> of<00:05:26.870> a<00:05:27.940> little

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
there's going to be kind of a little

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.240 
there's going to be kind of a little
brown<00:05:31.120> seam<00:05:32.120> here<00:05:32.569> with<00:05:32.719> a<00:05:32.750> little<00:05:33.169> kind<00:05:33.979> of<00:05:34.069> a

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
brown seam here with a little kind of a

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.719 
brown seam here with a little kind of a
a<00:05:34.520> black<00:05:35.210> bump<00:05:35.750> here<00:05:36.110> this<00:05:36.770> is<00:05:37.009> the<00:05:37.159> spot<00:05:37.430> that

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
a black bump here this is the spot that

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.999 
a black bump here this is the spot that
the<00:05:38.270> root<00:05:38.449> is<00:05:38.569> going<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:38.900> come<00:05:39.020> out<00:05:39.169> of<00:05:39.199> so

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
the root is going to come out of so

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.820 
the root is going to come out of so
you're<00:05:40.130> going<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:40.460> want<00:05:40.759> to<00:05:40.849> orient<00:05:41.180> that<00:05:41.830> down

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
you're going to want to orient that down

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.570 
you're going to want to orient that down
in<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.699> soil<00:05:43.909> you<00:05:44.779> can<00:05:44.960> also<00:05:45.279> sometimes<00:05:46.279> you

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
in the soil you can also sometimes you

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.640 
in the soil you can also sometimes you
can<00:05:46.759> lay<00:05:47.150> it<00:05:47.270> flat<00:05:47.539> like<00:05:47.900> this<00:05:48.080> on<00:05:48.289> the<00:05:48.380> soil

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
can lay it flat like this on the soil

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.249 
can lay it flat like this on the soil
and<00:05:49.060> you<00:05:50.060> can<00:05:50.240> push<00:05:50.419> it<00:05:50.539> down<00:05:50.659> and<00:05:50.840> up<00:05:50.960> in<00:05:51.110> fact

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
and you can push it down and up in fact

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.469 
and you can push it down and up in fact
I'll<00:05:51.440> do<00:05:51.529> a<00:05:51.560> couple<00:05:51.770> like<00:05:52.009> that<00:05:52.039> because<00:05:52.940> not

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
I'll do a couple like that because not

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.659 
I'll do a couple like that because not
all<00:05:53.779> cashews<00:05:54.440> are<00:05:54.650> that<00:05:54.800> are<00:05:54.919> oriented<00:05:55.400> the

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
all cashews are that are oriented the

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.689 
all cashews are that are oriented the
same<00:05:55.699> way<00:05:55.940> inside<00:05:56.690> the<00:05:56.750> nut<00:05:57.129> sometimes<00:05:58.129> things

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
same way inside the nut sometimes things

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.059 
same way inside the nut sometimes things
happen<00:05:58.940> and<00:05:59.240> you'll<00:06:00.169> actually<00:06:00.409> from<00:06:00.919> what<00:06:01.039> I

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
happen and you'll actually from what I

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.399 
happen and you'll actually from what I
was<00:06:01.219> reading<00:06:01.460> you'll<00:06:02.000> actually<00:06:02.300> get<00:06:02.779> a<00:06:02.840> sprout

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
was reading you'll actually get a sprout

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.450 
was reading you'll actually get a sprout
that<00:06:04.190> will<00:06:04.550> um<00:06:05.020> that<00:06:06.020> will<00:06:06.139> come<00:06:06.349> out<00:06:06.500> of<00:06:06.710> the

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
that will um that will come out of the

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.689 
that will um that will come out of the
other<00:06:07.639> way<00:06:07.940> inside<00:06:08.360> the<00:06:08.419> nut<00:06:08.690> and<00:06:09.490> so<00:06:10.490> they

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
other way inside the nut and so they

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.550 
other way inside the nut and so they
said<00:06:10.940> that<00:06:11.150> sometimes<00:06:11.569> it's<00:06:11.960> best<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.319> place

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
said that sometimes it's best to place

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.800 
said that sometimes it's best to place
it<00:06:12.740> sideways<00:06:12.979> so<00:06:13.400> I'm<00:06:13.729> just<00:06:14.000> kind<00:06:14.270> of<00:06:14.300> planting

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
it sideways so I'm just kind of planting

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.619 
it sideways so I'm just kind of planting
some<00:06:15.680> sideways<00:06:16.310> and<00:06:16.580> some<00:06:16.819> not<00:06:17.060> and<00:06:17.270> we'll<00:06:17.419> see

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:17.629 
some sideways and some not and we'll see

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:21.430 
some sideways and some not and we'll see
which<00:06:17.779> one's<00:06:18.020> work<00:06:18.199> best<00:06:18.229> because<00:06:19.990> this<00:06:20.990> is<00:06:21.199> a

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
which one's work best because this is a

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.740 
which one's work best because this is a
learning<00:06:21.770> experience<00:06:21.800> for<00:06:22.219> me<00:06:22.400> as<00:06:22.550> well<00:06:22.750> then

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
learning experience for me as well then

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.110 
learning experience for me as well then
you<00:06:23.840> just<00:06:23.960> kind<00:06:24.080> of<00:06:24.139> shake<00:06:24.409> the<00:06:24.680> soil<00:06:25.460> loose<00:06:25.849> to

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
you just kind of shake the soil loose to

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.610 
you just kind of shake the soil loose to
fill<00:06:26.360> in<00:06:26.479> the<00:06:26.569> hole<00:06:26.719> there<00:06:26.900> and<00:06:29.469> then<00:06:30.469> I'm

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
fill in the hole there and then I'm

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.260 
fill in the hole there and then I'm
going<00:06:30.740> to<00:06:30.770> backfill<00:06:31.520> with<00:06:31.729> a<00:06:31.759> little<00:06:32.029> bit<00:06:32.150> more

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
going to backfill with a little bit more

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.930 
going to backfill with a little bit more
soil<00:06:32.599> I<00:06:32.840> planted<00:06:33.770> them<00:06:33.909> about<00:06:34.909> I'd<00:06:35.449> say<00:06:35.960> an

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
soil I planted them about I'd say an

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.149 
soil I planted them about I'd say an
inch<00:06:37.940> deep<00:06:38.620> you're<00:06:39.620> going<00:06:39.800> to<00:06:39.889> want<00:06:40.009> to<00:06:40.039> have

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
inch deep you're going to want to have

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.930 
inch deep you're going to want to have
them<00:06:40.279> on<00:06:40.339> a<00:06:40.399> heatmap

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
them on a heatmap

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.870 
them on a heatmap
because<00:06:41.210> they<00:06:41.480> do<00:06:41.540> require<00:06:42.160> a<00:06:43.160> little<00:06:43.790> bit

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
because they do require a little bit

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.500 
because they do require a little bit
warmer<00:06:44.240> soils<00:06:44.690> to<00:06:44.870> germinate<00:06:45.230> but<00:06:45.890> on<00:06:46.130> the<00:06:46.790> on

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
warmer soils to germinate but on the on

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.270 
warmer soils to germinate but on the on
the<00:06:47.630> plus<00:06:47.840> side<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.260> germination<00:06:48.890> rate<00:06:49.160> is

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
the plus side the germination rate is

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.880 
the plus side the germination rate is
actually<00:06:49.430> really<00:06:50.090> really<00:06:50.780> quick<00:06:51.050> you're

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:51.890 
actually really really quick you're

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.650 
actually really really quick you're
looking<00:06:52.190> at<00:06:52.340> probably<00:06:52.820> about<00:06:52.940> four<00:06:53.360> to<00:06:53.450> five

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
looking at probably about four to five

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.380 
looking at probably about four to five
days<00:06:53.960> for<00:06:54.380> them<00:06:54.740> to<00:06:54.830> germinate<00:06:55.250> and<00:06:55.460> at

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
days for them to germinate and at

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.690 
days for them to germinate and at
maximum<00:06:57.200> of<00:06:57.320> two<00:06:57.530> weeks<00:06:57.770> so<00:06:58.280> there<00:06:58.580> are<00:06:58.670> a

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
maximum of two weeks so there are a

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.810 
maximum of two weeks so there are a
fairly<00:06:58.910> fast<00:06:59.210> germinating<00:06:59.840> plant<00:07:00.140> and<00:07:00.820> once

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
fairly fast germinating plant and once

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.310 
fairly fast germinating plant and once
they<00:07:02.000> germinate<00:07:02.210> I'm<00:07:02.600> going<00:07:02.780> to<00:07:02.840> do<00:07:02.900> an<00:07:03.020> update

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.320 
they germinate I'm going to do an update

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.710 
they germinate I'm going to do an update
and<00:07:03.560> we'll<00:07:04.460> get<00:07:04.580> to<00:07:04.730> transplanting<00:07:05.360> them<00:07:05.510> and

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
and we'll get to transplanting them and

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.890 
and we'll get to transplanting them and
then<00:07:06.440> fertilizing<00:07:07.340> and<00:07:07.610> then<00:07:07.970> once<00:07:08.540> we<00:07:08.720> get<00:07:08.810> to

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
then fertilizing and then once we get to

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.510 
then fertilizing and then once we get to
pruning<00:07:09.170> I'll<00:07:09.560> teach<00:07:09.830> you<00:07:09.950> how<00:07:09.980> to<00:07:10.040> prune<00:07:10.370> them

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
pruning I'll teach you how to prune them

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.250 
pruning I'll teach you how to prune them
so<00:07:10.760> you<00:07:10.850> can<00:07:11.000> grow<00:07:11.150> them<00:07:11.300> indoors<00:07:11.540> hopefully

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260 
so you can grow them indoors hopefully

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.050 
so you can grow them indoors hopefully
