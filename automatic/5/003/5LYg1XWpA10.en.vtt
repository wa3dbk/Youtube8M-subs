00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
aluminum sculpted from aluminium has

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.899 
aluminum sculpted from aluminium has
like<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.740> pencil<00:01:11.240> hexagon<00:01:12.240> type<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.659> shape<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
like a pencil hexagon type of shape and

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.359 
like a pencil hexagon type of shape and
it<00:01:14.909> has<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> rubber<00:01:15.360> Nippert<00:01:15.780> there<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> tip

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
it has a rubber Nippert there on a tip

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
it has a rubber Nippert there on a tip
there<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.990> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.259> sittin<00:01:19.500> it's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
there and so it's kind of sittin it's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.320 
there and so it's kind of sittin it's
interesting<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.460> tip<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:21.000> hard

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
interesting if the tip is not hard

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.010 
interesting if the tip is not hard
rubber<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.080> feels<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.810> there's<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.869> little

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
rubber it feels like there's a little

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
rubber it feels like there's a little
bit<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.350> pocket<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> air<00:01:26.130> inside<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
bit of a pocket of air inside there and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.460 
bit of a pocket of air inside there and
then<00:01:27.390> below<00:01:27.689> that's<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.200> hard

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
then below that's like really hard

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.100 
then below that's like really hard
rubber<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.610> makes<00:01:29.759> any<00:01:29.850> sense<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.540> it's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
rubber if that makes any sense so it's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.450 
rubber if that makes any sense so it's
actually<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> squish<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> tip<00:01:32.340> right

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
actually kind of squish on the tip right

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.039 
actually kind of squish on the tip right
there<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> rebel<00:01:33.780> goes<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:33.990> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
there and I think the rebel goes all it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.600 
there and I think the rebel goes all it
to<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> very<00:01:34.350> back<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.860> comes<00:01:35.220> back<00:01:35.369> here

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to the very back so it comes back here

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
to the very back so it comes back here
as<00:01:35.700> well<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.509> you're<00:01:36.659> supposed<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
as well I don't think you're supposed to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.390 
as well I don't think you're supposed to
use<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.470> anything<00:01:37.619> anything<00:01:38.130> there<00:01:38.250> but

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
use this for anything anything there but

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.649 
use this for anything anything there but
the<00:01:38.640> rubbers<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.390> guess<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the rubbers in there so I guess the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.450 
the rubbers in there so I guess the
whole<00:01:39.780> center<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.259> hollowed<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.860> because

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
whole center is hollowed out so because

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.620 
whole center is hollowed out so because
I<00:01:41.490> guess<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.000> about<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.390> really

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I guess it's all about it's really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109 
I guess it's all about it's really
lightweight<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.530> aluminum<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.220> that's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
lightweight it's aluminum so that's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.370 
lightweight it's aluminum so that's
right<00:01:45.329> there<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.689> definitely<00:01:46.079> feels

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
right there so that definitely feels

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.690 
right there so that definitely feels
good<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.649> hand<00:01:46.710> something<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.430> probably

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
good in the hand something they probably

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.550 
good in the hand something they probably
used<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> using<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> has<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
used to using and so then it has a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
used to using and so then it has a
hollowed-out<00:01:50.070> tip<00:01:50.640> right<00:01:50.759> there<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.149> kind<00:01:51.570> of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
hollowed-out tip right there I kind of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.910 
hollowed-out tip right there I kind of
wish<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.079> bit<00:01:52.350> more<00:01:52.470> pointy

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
wish it was a little bit more pointy

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
wish it was a little bit more pointy
instead<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.729> rounded<00:01:54.090> off<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
instead of so rounded off like that you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.080 
instead of so rounded off like that you
can<00:01:55.649> use<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.100> any<00:01:56.250> any<00:01:56.610> touchscreen

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
can use this with any any touchscreen

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.580 
can use this with any any touchscreen
devices<00:01:57.390> including<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> ipod<00:01:58.170> touch<00:01:58.200> with

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
devices including the ipod touch with

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 
devices including the ipod touch with
the<00:01:58.680> iphone<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.670> rubber<00:01:59.880> tip<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.329> kind

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the iphone but the rubber tip is so kind

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.200 
the iphone but the rubber tip is so kind
of<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.229> big<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.460> exactly<00:02:02.850> useful

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
of so big and it's not exactly useful

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
of so big and it's not exactly useful
for<00:02:03.630> smaller<00:02:03.930> screen<00:02:04.200> devices<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
for smaller screen devices but for the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.760 
for smaller screen devices but for the
ipad<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.090> definitely<00:02:06.210> works<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.930> so

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
ipad you know it definitely works and so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.320 
ipad you know it definitely works and so
I'm<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> use<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:08.640> my<00:02:08.759> iPad<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.209> i'm

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
I'm going to use I have my iPad here i'm

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.250 
I'm going to use I have my iPad here i'm
actually<00:02:09.450> using<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:10.080> mobiles<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:11.400> stand

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
actually using just mobiles a up stand

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.160 
actually using just mobiles a up stand
to<00:02:13.040> do<00:02:13.129> this<00:02:13.220> demonstration<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.000> i'm<00:02:14.930> sure<00:02:15.110> i

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
to do this demonstration and i'm sure i

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.479 
to do this demonstration and i'm sure i
want<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.379> get<00:02:15.439> questions<00:02:15.769> on<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.220> diac

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
want to get questions on it but the diac

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.100 
want to get questions on it but the diac
i'm<00:02:16.670> using<00:02:16.879> right<00:02:16.909> now<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.090> called<00:02:17.390> adobe

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
i'm using right now is called adobe

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.410 
i'm using right now is called adobe
ideas<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.010> it's<00:02:19.129> just<00:02:19.189> a<00:02:19.340> sketch<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.299> can

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
ideas so it's just a sketch so you can

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.360 
ideas so it's just a sketch so you can
see<00:02:20.569> here<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:21.319> really<00:02:21.590> easy<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.980> use<00:02:22.010> you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
see here it's really easy to use you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.890 
see here it's really easy to use you
know<00:02:22.459> something<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:23.060> just<00:02:23.090> seems<00:02:23.599> second

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
know something it just seems second

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.479 
know something it just seems second
nature<00:02:24.049> I<00:02:24.140> mean<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.500> all<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.680> us<00:02:24.769> use<00:02:24.920> pens<00:02:25.220> and

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
nature I mean it all of us use pens and

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.890 
nature I mean it all of us use pens and
so<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.819> think<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.329> something<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.810> could

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
so I think it's something that you could

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.569 
so I think it's something that you could
be<00:02:27.019> easily<00:02:27.200> get<00:02:27.980> used<00:02:28.129> to<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.459> is

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
be easily get used to but this is

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.100 
be easily get used to but this is
probably<00:02:28.670> good<00:02:28.909> for<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.150> sketching<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.019> you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
probably good for like sketching and you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.960 
probably good for like sketching and you
have<00:02:30.290> ideas<00:02:30.769> if<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.579> want<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.760> do<00:02:31.819> any

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
have ideas if you want to do any

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.490 
have ideas if you want to do any
handwritten<00:02:32.420> notes<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.870> suppose<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.290> could<00:02:33.379> do

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
handwritten notes I suppose you could do

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.619 
handwritten notes I suppose you could do
that<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.709> well<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:34.790> know<00:02:34.909> those<00:02:35.329> types<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
that as well you know those types of

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.050 
that as well you know those types of
things<00:02:36.069> that's<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.220> type<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.610> does<00:02:37.819> have<00:02:37.970> to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
things that's the type that does have to

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.640 
things that's the type that does have to
do<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.209> probably<00:02:38.450> use<00:02:38.569> this<00:02:38.690> tool<00:02:38.959> now<00:02:39.500> keep

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
do that probably use this tool now keep

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470 
do that probably use this tool now keep
in<00:02:39.739> mind<00:02:39.799> guys<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.159> does<00:02:40.400> retail<00:02:40.819> for<00:02:41.090> forty

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
in mind guys this does retail for forty

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.740 
in mind guys this does retail for forty
dollars<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.560> not<00:02:42.799> cheap<00:02:43.720> forty<00:02:44.720> bucks

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
dollars so it is not cheap forty bucks

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.990 
dollars so it is not cheap forty bucks
but<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.409> like<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.709> said<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.489> know<00:02:46.609> solid

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
but it like I said it is you know solid

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.420 
but it like I said it is you know solid
aluminum<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.659> it<00:02:48.530> may<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.680> useful<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.220> some<00:02:49.370> of

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
aluminum and it may be useful to some of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.970 
aluminum and it may be useful to some of
you<00:02:49.489> guys<00:02:49.840> some<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.959> guys<00:02:51.049> may<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.409> be<00:02:51.470> you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
you guys some of you guys may not be you

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.710 
you guys some of you guys may not be you
can<00:02:52.190> keep<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.459> mind<00:02:52.670> because<00:02:53.269> of<00:02:53.389> the<00:02:53.450> way<00:02:53.540> they

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
can keep in mind because of the way they

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.170 
can keep in mind because of the way they
are<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.049> questions<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.129> sharp<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
are the questions to the sharp the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.119 
are the questions to the sharp the
capacitive<00:02:56.659> screen<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.799> have<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.069> either

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
capacitive screen is you have to either

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.890 
capacitive screen is you have to either
use<00:02:58.310> your<00:02:58.430> finger<00:02:58.790> or<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.030> special<00:02:59.540> stylist

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
use your finger or a special stylist

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.509 
use your finger or a special stylist
like<00:03:00.049> this<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:00.889> it's<00:03:01.010> not<00:03:01.069> like<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.250> can<00:03:01.310> get

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
like this so it's not like you can get

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.339 
like this so it's not like you can get
like<00:03:01.579> a<00:03:01.639> pencil<00:03:01.909> or<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.239> pen<00:03:02.269> or<00:03:02.720> anything<00:03:03.200> else

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
like a pencil or a pen or anything else
