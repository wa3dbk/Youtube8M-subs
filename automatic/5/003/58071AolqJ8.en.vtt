00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.989
 you will make homemade breads 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.230
 it will be interesting to stay for it 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:32.540
 of this we will need different kinds 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.890
 my seed is sunflower seeds 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.770
 sesame and flax seeds and also I usually 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.140
 I use different types of flour coarse 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.630
 grinding 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 here you can use the usual 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.590
 flour or wheat flour 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.560
 grinding is not a pharmacy bus 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.780
 and so cunning I do not know whether 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:12.420
 she is 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:15.960
 Russia is described to be replaced by our Russians 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.569
 bran irreplaceable our favorite 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.590
 oatmeal set very helpful 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:25.259
 polystyrene lowering action 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.249
 properties and is recommended for 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:34.700
 use by absolutely everyone as the most 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:38.729
 the smallest and the oldest 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.790
 I take absolutely normal all 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.900
 700 milliliters of water and desirable 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.950
 Of course, that the water was cleaned and 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.580
 Of course, a huge capacity for 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.979
 mixing 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:59.470
 of our ingredients, well, let's get started 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:28.510
 so the first thing i do and dr moshe 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:32.350
 family somewhere 200 grams very much for everything 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.769
 we got 400 grams of various 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.400
 by all 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.530
 that is, we have such a result 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.600
 well of vitamin 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.260
 which you add our big 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.260
 capacity 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.530
 if we have 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:01.690
 400 grams managed the same as pure 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.209
 and all the blooms are different kinds of coarse flour 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.220
 grinding 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.950
 unleashed 400 grams of coarse flour 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.870
 grinding different varieties 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.519
 now and the second to lower in this way 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.120
 we got such a homogeneous 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.120
 mixture 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.140
 700 temple 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:55.690
 if should be just 1 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:55.690
 but better butter on bread 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.400
 so weakly thin enough then 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.239
 the bread will be thin 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.750
 and crispy you did not get like this 2 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:14.510
 baking with our dough send them to 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:20.120
 oven at one hundred eighty degrees 200 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:27.760
 it's too much 180 degrees somewhere 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:43.060
 about ten minutes to get our bread 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:43.060
 from spirits cut into pieces that us 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.960
 for example , somewhere 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:11.030
 first across and usually done already 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.620
 small pieces because 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:20.750
 and we donâ€™t want to eat much 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:26.750
 I want something to crunch when 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.710
 you can take a very small piece 1 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.430
 30 minutes 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.520
 bake with the oven closed and last 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.810
 ten minutes I usually open the oven 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.310
 to merge a little bit 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:46.270
 so drained our bread 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.270
 we got out of the oven 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.029
 repressed a little shame 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.370
 and be sure to put in the basket 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.830
 covered 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.439
 a napkin and leave a picture 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.979
 open until the loaves are 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:24.159
 cool down 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:27.719
 otherwise they will become wet and soft. 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.719
 it will not be very good 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.150
 these are our loaves and 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:45.160
 and very fragrant and crispy oh well i 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:48.680
 did not even hold back and tried a piece 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.750
 very tasty but in order to improve 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.450
 I can advise you this recipe 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.810
 add any spices or dried 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.500
 herbs 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.750
 I like very much to add basil 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.090
 thank you very much for watching and welcome 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.380
 Welcome to my channel again I promise 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.380
 there will be many interesting things
