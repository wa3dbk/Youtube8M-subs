00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.730
 in this case we are going to use is a 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.360
 powerful inducer of collagen as is the 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.250
 radio let's perform the face and here what 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.860
 that we see is a level of the middle third 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.860
 as there is a marked effect flaccid 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 that is, the depth level of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.370
 injection to hypodermis always trying 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.610
 that the bevel comes out towards the dermis 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.310
 power 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.930
 deposit the product as close to 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.000
 the area 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.370
 where were the fibroblasts and power 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.670
 stimulate the equally for production 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.670
 of collagen 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.350
 the light tracings 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.670
 the three paths are usually sufficient 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 to project 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.360
 and give support to the whole structure as 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.360
 it said of the tail of the eyebrow 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.980
 also superior zygomatic for 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.570
 to eliminate is to be in places 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.570
 from the area of ​​the street legs 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.040
 sit down and now looking straight ahead 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.350
 from the camera 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.290
 let's really see what we have 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.480
 commented temporary fixation 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.400
 Zigomatic smile great mojito now 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.370
 smile in front of this other side we see 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.960
 smile like wrinkle more then those 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.600
 wrinkles would really yield more to a 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.030
 flaccidity effect than a pure effect 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.770
 dynamic by muscular strength we see 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.540
 how it has been projected and tensed to all 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.540
 the middle facial zone the oval zone
