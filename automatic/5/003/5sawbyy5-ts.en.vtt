improved performance significantly I

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.350 
improved performance significantly I
don't<00:05:40.560> see<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.860> lag<00:05:41.039> that<00:05:41.250> I<00:05:41.280> saw<00:05:41.550> before<00:05:41.759> this

don't see the lag that I saw before this

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.120 
don't see the lag that I saw before this
thing<00:05:42.570> is<00:05:42.630> up<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.110> speed<00:05:43.409> and<00:05:43.590> taking

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
quad-core Snapdragon 600 CPU so it's

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.240

running<00:05:48.300> fast<00:05:48.570> no<00:05:49.080> issues<00:05:49.469> anymore<00:05:49.710> with<00:05:50.009> lag

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
running fast no issues anymore with lag

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.580 
running fast no issues anymore with lag
that<00:05:50.490> is<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.639> huge<00:05:51.030> stress<00:05:51.419> relief<00:05:51.449> and<00:05:51.960> using

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
player on this device it's a little bit

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:08.659 
player on this device it's a little bit
different<00:06:07.590> here<00:06:07.710> so<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:07.919> plays<00:06:08.130> so<00:06:08.310> good<00:06:08.520> for

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
different here so it plays so good for

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.640 
different here so it plays so good for
example<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.630> can<00:06:09.780> see<00:06:09.870> just<00:06:09.900> some<00:06:10.259> basic

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
example and you can see just some basic

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.409 
example and you can see just some basic
aesthetic<00:06:11.099> differences<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:11.819> it's<00:06:12.000> on<00:06:12.210> silent

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
aesthetic differences and it's on silent

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:13.610 
aesthetic differences and it's on silent
right<00:06:12.750> now<00:06:12.900> so<00:06:13.110> that's<00:06:13.259> why<00:06:13.380> it's<00:06:13.409> not

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
right now so that's why it's not

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.870

actually playing but you can see a

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.950 
actually playing but you can see a
little<00:06:15.210> bit<00:06:15.330> of<00:06:15.389> difference<00:06:15.599> here<00:06:15.840> where<00:06:15.930> I

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
little bit of difference here where I

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.600 
little bit of difference here where I
can<00:06:15.990> cancel<00:06:16.319> it<00:06:16.530> out<00:06:16.620> directly<00:06:17.099> from<00:06:17.430> the
