00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.280
 tee 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.800
 you 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.660
 It seems that there is no injury 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.949
 It looks like I was pretty acquainted with you 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.410
 It is a nurse who feels that way 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.130
 I really keep you home 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.130
 That girl 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.270
 If I meet at a research institute ahead of this 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.370
 The name seems to say Arisa 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.920
 By the way you guys Gau 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.150
 I 'm tone 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.670
 I am acting as an aide to the rebel unit led by you 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.130
 Rebel unit 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.579
 I was low 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.579
 That's right 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.970
 I'm waiting for you, I'm kidding 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.970
 It's no wonder I'm confused but it's a fact 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:45.430
 That day you absorbed that laboratory, which is an important base of Mishima Zaibatsu 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.970
 But something unexpected happened there 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.710
 It is a meeting of g company 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.960
 If you think what happens when you see that misery 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.960
 Anyway it was safe and better than anything 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.539
 Well 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.539
 I wonder if only I survived 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.620
 Anyway , let's go back to the body once 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.549
 There is also the future 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.549
 Is it correct? 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.810
 Really I am the king 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.960
 It's a fact 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.970
 I gotta be as loaders 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:38.959
 Now 2nd place is confused by the report that the Kyushu team was wiped out 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.959
 Because I'm such a place I'd like to go back as soon as possible, if possible 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.290
 I'm sorry 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.490
 I understood 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.920
 Let's do something transparent with me 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.920
 But until you come back 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.689
 Your survival has already been transmitted to Mishima zaibatsu and people 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.490
 You know what those guys will come with the kind of hands before the are acting alone 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.490
 Please be careful with me 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.360
 Well that 's about you 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.360
 I do not think that it is easy to be done 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.040
 Please contact me when there is something 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.690
 We prepared encryption circuit for all 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.690
 For the time being it will not be intercepted 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.540
 Thank you 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.260
 With that 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.260
 It is a lost thing 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.000
 This 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.320
 You 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.320
 It was according to that laboratory 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.860
 Bad but I can not receive this 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.860
 To me now 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.630
 I thought I'd say so 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:16.020
 I will keep this until you return 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.020
 Perhaps 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.480
 Naa's up to you is what to do from now on 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.620
 First try Mishima Heihachi 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:30.080
 I used to say that you need to fit him 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.289
 What is it because I do not know whether the storage in the opportunity to return 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.030
 What if I and that Mishima Heihachi write 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.000
 Oh oh oh what 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.960
 You would not let speak never be their own 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.960
 To whom 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.700
 We will withdraw 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.700
 I can not help but stand out just by passing 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.120
 The people of 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.860
 It seems to have come Apparently 3
