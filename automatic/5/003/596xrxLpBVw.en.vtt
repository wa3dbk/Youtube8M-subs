00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 once the bosphorus eurosport stem cells and varied capacity of 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.339
 turn pinko usag very different 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.879
 in his service, cristina scardovi tells us about it 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:18.390
 ca 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.770
 it often happens especially in the field of research to discover something 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.489
 while another is being sought 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 nokia the tissue engineering laboratory of the operating unit of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.700
 plastic surgery of the University of Genoa recently was the scene of 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 an extraordinary event 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.660
 working on a skin bank 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.390
 of a logo that is where they reproduce they deposit the cute minetti 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.870
 the team of Professor Pierluigi Santi discovered the way to reproduce 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.560
 even the hair 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.620
 despite appearances, skin and hair have a very tight bond 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.750
 maps to understand it you need to go htc 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.200
 according to the studies of the same echipe indeed the hair follicles fairy 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.700
 contain key stem cells grown in vitro reproduce laminae of 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.440
 course 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.060
 firefighters steel workers bomb disposal personnel protection 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.320
 civilian workers in the fuel products industries belong to the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.620
 category of people at risk for burns being exposed daily to 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.150
 fire hazard 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.650
 according to the data provided by the health ministry of all subjects 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.430
 about 20% of burn victims who have requested medical care 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.310
 burns that required surgery and therefore damage 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.710
 morphological permanent while about 3% have burns and a trail costs 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.520
 50% of the body surface that represent a serious danger for the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.080
 life 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.290
 go there are leather banks all over the world but genoa will be just a few 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.860
 hair to have the possibility of having your adsl reproduced 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.450
 and therefore to keep laminae of autologous skin thanks to 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.920
 cryopreservation that at a temperature of 160 degrees below zero 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 he can keep them for an infinite time 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:21.559
 moreover, the technique of the English strip did in a few minutes without needing 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.130
 admission nevi anesthesia 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.610
 with the advantage of not having to resort to skin samples that are modest 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.750
 entities are a little pleasant and leave residual scars 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:36.909
 in conditions of necessity have ready to be transplanted promptly 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.709
 previously autologous skin flaps will avoid unnecessary 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:42.789
 suffering 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.819
 at the moment in fact to have cells in the laboratory able to develop 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.349
 turning into skin takes weeks to wait 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.499
 icon for autonomy there will be no risk of rejection 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.499
 100 in case of mestre 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.540
 therefore working hard on this project with your hands in your hair you are 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.079
 given that dividing the hair bulb of only one hair into two 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.260
 cultivating the two halves produced 2 boolprop with two hairs 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.799
 the amazing discovery as well as being applied to those who suffered burns to the 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.390
 head 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.410
 it can be used in the aesthetic field the method remains the same 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.760
 that of the autotransplant but to have back the hair lost from now on 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.310
 then it will be possible in different ways and in less time 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.729
 in general this type of intervention involves the removal of a strip 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.299
 of hair from the nape its splitting under the microscope for 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.979
 get some carrot species like hey bulb following each transplant 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.339
 bulb on the area quickly from balding usually the one at the top 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:46.669
 of the head 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.249
 the bulb takes root the hair grows back a hair for a youtube 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.619
 made to have 2000 hairs then you need spa parma and then transplant them 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:56.740
 always 2000 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.420
 now with in vitro cultivation - they will instead run for life but because 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.560
 each point of view of two points mark paper that happens to have 2007 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.560
 the master only take off a thousand 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.309
 the city that centuries ago 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.139
 saw the birth of the first bank 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.840
 it therefore seems that now he has another primacy to have the only ones 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.930
 banks in the world where what is deposited fool's reiki turn into 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.379
 something different is multiplied in a prodigious way 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.659
 in short times 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.179
 in the tissue engineering laboratory, work is also underway 

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:36.740
 construction of a fat bank 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.419
 fat is a large container of greenhouse stem cells implanted in the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.770
 same individual these precious cells help to rebuild away 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.080
 restoring tone to areas of the body subjected to kei myotherapy holotherapy 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.180
 surgical interventions 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.470
 siniscalchi today undergoes liposuction for aesthetic reasons 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.230
 possibility of keeping in this bank in liquid nitrogen for a 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.400
 indefinite time 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.650
 its heritage of stem cells 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.070
 a bit of superfluous fat deposited today therefore allows you to always have 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.339
 ready a capital to draw on in case of future need 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:16.229
 always hoping that we never need it 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.819
 the giant leaps in research are on the road to prevention 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.280
 leave our cells in custody in these banks and how to open a 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.689
 bearer passbook 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.599
 with the advantage of never running any risk of devaluation
