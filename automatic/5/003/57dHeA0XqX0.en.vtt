00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.890 
car enthusiasts have said that this car
looks<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.520> good<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.240> agree<00:02:36.570> with<00:02:36.600> them

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
looks pretty good and I agree with them

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.010 
looks pretty good and I agree with them
so<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:38.600> if<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:40.110> had<00:02:40.350> any<00:02:41.390> idea<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
so I think if you had any idea that you

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.140 
so I think if you had any idea that you
might<00:02:43.290> want<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> Lotus<00:02:43.860> car<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> were<00:02:45.030> on

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
great I was a little concerned about the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.530 
great I was a little concerned about the
weight<00:03:26.040> taking<00:03:26.640> away<00:03:26.790> from<00:03:27.030> things<00:03:27.270> but<00:03:27.420> you
