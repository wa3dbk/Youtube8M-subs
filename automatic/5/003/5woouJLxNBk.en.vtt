shafts the shaft then goes into the head
tube<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.219> where<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> have

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
tube up in here where you have

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.990 
tube up in here where you have
counter-rotating<00:00:52.500> gearing<00:00:52.829> system<00:00:53.250> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
counter-rotating gearing system this

system<00:00:54.059> spins<00:00:54.840> these<00:00:55.079> two<00:00:55.320> shafts<00:00:55.649> there's<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
system spins these two shafts there's a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.819 
system spins these two shafts there's a
shaft<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> front

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
shaft here and here down to the front

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.000 
shaft here and here down to the front
wheel<00:00:59.010> now<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> power<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.359> transferred<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
wheel now the power is transferred as a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.910 
wheel now the power is transferred as a
percentage<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.449> always<00:01:03.920> two-wheel

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
percentage so it's not always two-wheel

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
percentage so it's not always two-wheel
drive<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:06.030> system<00:01:06.479> actually<00:01:06.659> works<00:01:07.080> similar

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
drive the system actually works similar

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
drive the system actually works similar
to<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.799> positive<00:01:08.189> traction<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.700> an<00:01:08.820> automobile

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
to a positive traction in an automobile

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.480 
to a positive traction in an automobile
it<00:01:09.869> only<00:01:10.200> transfers<00:01:10.650> power<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.280> lose

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it only transfers power when you lose

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
it only transfers power when you lose
traction<00:01:11.880> both<00:01:12.720> wheels<00:01:12.990> spin<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> same<00:01:13.799> speed

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
traction both wheels spin the same speed

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
traction both wheels spin the same speed
on<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> ground<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> drive<00:01:15.479> system<00:01:15.720> runs

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
on the ground with the drive system runs

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.920 
on the ground with the drive system runs
at<00:01:16.259> 70%<00:01:16.650> speed<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:18.390> adjustable

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
at 70% speed and that's adjustable

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.890 
at 70% speed and that's adjustable
depending<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.560> how<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.979> set<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.670> bike<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.180> so

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
depending on how you set your bike up so

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.200 
depending on how you set your bike up so
when<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> rear<00:01:22.229> wheel<00:01:22.380> slips<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.820> power<00:01:24.060> will

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
when the rear wheel slips the power will

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.429 
when the rear wheel slips the power will
be<00:01:24.240> transferred<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> front<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> bike

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
be transferred to the front of the bike

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560 
be transferred to the front of the bike
and<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.759> gives<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> traction<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and that gives you the traction that you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.940 
and that gives you the traction that you
need<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.770> when<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> also<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.530> ability

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
need so when you also have the ability

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.679 
need so when you also have the ability
to<00:01:31.979> turn<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> system<00:01:32.610> off<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> shift<00:01:33.540> on

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to turn the system off from a shift on

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
to turn the system off from a shift on

when it's on the stationary ground it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.270 
when it's on the stationary ground it
also<00:01:45.750> gives<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.500> person<00:01:46.860> riding<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.250> the

also gives it the person riding at the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.069 
also gives it the person riding at the
opportunity<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.030> feel<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.899> bike

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
opportunity to really feel the bike

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
opportunity to really feel the bike
would<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> standard<00:01:50.220> rear<00:01:50.399> wheel<00:01:50.520> drive

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
