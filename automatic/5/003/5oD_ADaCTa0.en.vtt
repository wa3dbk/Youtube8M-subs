of<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:35.130> little<00:01:35.549> bit<00:01:35.670> disappointing<00:01:36.420> because

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
of a little bit disappointing because

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630

of courtesy to talk about them there

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.970 
of courtesy to talk about them there
were<00:03:35.880> some<00:03:36.150> events<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.810> thought<00:03:37.200> were

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
were some events that I thought were

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.730 
were some events that I thought were
kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.580> unnecessary<00:03:39.060> maybe<00:03:39.750> some<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.620> the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
kind of unnecessary maybe some of the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.410 
kind of unnecessary maybe some of the
parts<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.130> events<00:03:41.490> I<00:03:41.610> thought<00:03:41.790> maybe<00:03:42.030> could

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
parts and events I thought maybe could

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.560 
parts and events I thought maybe could
have<00:03:42.510> been<00:03:43.290> left<00:03:43.620> out<00:03:43.860> but<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.970> can<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.239> do<00:03:45.420> I

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
have been left out but what can you do I

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.960 
have been left out but what can you do I
thought<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.900> overall<00:03:46.260> pace<00:03:46.590> was<00:03:46.860> very<00:03:47.310> very

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
thought the overall pace was very very

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.690 
thought the overall pace was very very
fast<00:03:48.239> maybe<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.720> little<00:03:48.989> too<00:03:49.110> fast<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.950> wouldn't

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
fast maybe a little too fast I wouldn't

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.120 
fast maybe a little too fast I wouldn't
have<00:03:50.880> mind<00:03:51.150> if<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.780> book<00:03:51.989> was<00:03:52.020> like<00:03:52.470> longer

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
have mind if the book was like longer

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.240 
have mind if the book was like longer
just<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.810> kind<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.870> go<00:03:55.020> over<00:03:55.410> some<00:03:55.680> part<00:03:55.950> they

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
just to kind of go over some part they

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.110 
just to kind of go over some part they
went<00:03:57.209> through<00:03:57.390> events<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.900> they<00:03:58.820> had<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.970> get

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
went through events and they had to get

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.610 
went through events and they had to get
through<00:04:00.330> things<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.720> needed<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.350> get

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
through things that needed to get

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.770 
through things that needed to get
through<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.160> they<00:04:02.640> did<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.239> very<00:04:03.270> timely

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
through and they did it in a very timely

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.130 
through and they did it in a very timely
manner<00:04:04.200> which<00:04:04.530> was<00:04:04.739> awesome<00:04:04.980> because<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.930> just

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
manner which was awesome because it just

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.979 
manner which was awesome because it just
had<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.380> be<00:04:07.530> done<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.910> pacing<00:04:09.330> although<00:04:09.720> it

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
had to be done so the pacing although it

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.510 
had to be done so the pacing although it
was<00:04:10.110> very<00:04:10.410> fast<00:04:10.739> they<00:04:11.130> covered<00:04:11.430> everything

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
was very fast they covered everything

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.570 
was very fast they covered everything
that<00:04:12.060> needed<00:04:12.270> to<00:04:12.390> get<00:04:12.600> done<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.160> they<00:04:14.160> hit<00:04:14.400> all

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
that needed to get done and they hit all

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.729 
that needed to get done and they hit all
the<00:04:14.700> points<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.209> was<00:04:15.600> freaking<00:04:16.530> awesome

cheesy<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.060> some<00:04:21.060> parts<00:04:21.450> i<00:04:21.750> will<00:04:22.049> say<00:04:22.350> i<00:04:22.620> think

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
cheesy and some parts i will say i think

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.990 
cheesy and some parts i will say i think
it<00:04:23.039> was<00:04:23.160> kind<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.640> unavoidable<00:04:24.360> but<00:04:25.550> yeah

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
it was kind of unavoidable but yeah

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.880 
it was kind of unavoidable but yeah
still<00:04:27.210> read<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.630> as<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.840> movie<00:04:28.350> playing<00:04:28.650> in<00:04:28.800> her

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
still read it as a movie playing in her

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.700 
still read it as a movie playing in her
head<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:30.510> thought<00:04:30.780> this<00:04:31.050> would<00:04:31.110> make<00:04:31.500> a

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
head and I thought this would make a

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.070 
head and I thought this would make a
really<00:04:32.070> good<00:04:32.220> movie<00:04:32.790> yeah<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.780> was<00:04:33.810> good

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
really good movie yeah so that was good

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.890 
really good movie yeah so that was good

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
the conclusion of the book was very

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.380 
the conclusion of the book was very
satisfying<00:05:13.740> even<00:05:14.580> though<00:05:14.700> it's<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.150> last

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
satisfying even though it's the last

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.270 
satisfying even though it's the last
book<00:05:15.810> there's<00:05:16.230> still<00:05:16.440> adventure<00:05:17.040> and

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
book there's still adventure and

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.370 
book there's still adventure and
potential<00:05:17.970> for<00:05:18.240> these<00:05:18.419> characters<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.260> the

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
potential for these characters and the

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.120 
potential for these characters and the
story<00:05:19.410> I<00:05:20.130> thought<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:21.300> there<00:05:22.290> there<00:05:22.890> could

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
story I thought that there there could

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.190 
story I thought that there there could
be<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.250> possibility<00:05:23.820> for<00:05:24.120> another<00:05:24.870> book<00:05:25.169> to

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
be a possibility for another book to

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.460 
be a possibility for another book to
happen<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.010> which<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:27.150> great<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.990> hate<00:05:28.290> when

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470
