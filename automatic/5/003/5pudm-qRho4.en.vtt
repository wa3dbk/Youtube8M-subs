bar at the top with all the info is
actually<00:01:29.880> white<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.689> that's<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.380> first<00:01:31.740> for

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
actually white so that's a first for

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
actually white so that's a first for
psvita<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.640> actually<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
psvita I actually really like the way it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.300 
psvita I actually really like the way it
looks<00:01:34.079> I'd<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> stay<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:34.950> bar<00:01:35.130> being

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
looks I'd like to stay as bar being

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
looks I'd like to stay as bar being
white<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.270> pretty<00:01:36.509> nice<00:01:36.659> edition<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.229> when

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
white it's pretty nice edition but when

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
white it's pretty nice edition but when
you<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.560> into<00:01:37.680> an<00:01:37.860> app<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.579> does<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.909> back<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
you go into an app it does go back to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.170 
you go into an app it does go back to
black<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.560> guess<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> kind<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> suits<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
black so I guess it kind of suits the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.690 
black so I guess it kind of suits the
