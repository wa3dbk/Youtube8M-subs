00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.819 
enter the indoor party experience and
you<00:01:52.359> can<00:01:52.479> see<00:01:52.600> there<00:01:52.719> were<00:01:52.810> big<00:01:53.020> giant<00:01:53.380> doors

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
you can see there were big giant doors

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.800 
you can see there were big giant doors
in<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:54.219> concept<00:01:54.969> art<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.329> everyone<00:01:55.719> is

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
in that concept art that everyone is

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.229 
in that concept art that everyone is
talking<00:01:55.929> about<00:01:56.049> online<00:01:56.259> and<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.909> can<00:01:58.030> see

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
talking about online and you can see

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:59.819 
talking about online and you can see
that<00:01:58.270> all<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:58.780> those<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.079> lot<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.649> food

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
that all of those a lot of the food

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.050 
that all of those a lot of the food
stores<00:02:00.009> will<00:02:00.159> probably<00:02:00.489> cover<00:02:00.640> just<00:02:00.819> more

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
stores will probably cover just more

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.149 
stores will probably cover just more
rock<00:02:01.329> work<00:02:01.569> to<00:02:02.110> help<00:02:02.200> with<00:02:02.409> light<00:02:02.619> escape<00:02:02.950> but

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
rock work to help with light escape but

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.699 
rock work to help with light escape but
imagine<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.729> doors<00:02:03.969> will<00:02:04.149> probably<00:02:04.450> be

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
imagine the doors will probably be

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.289 
imagine the doors will probably be
affixed<00:02:05.709> right<00:02:06.459> there<00:02:06.700> where<00:02:06.880> we<00:02:06.909> see<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.179> big

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
affixed right there where we see the big

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.949 
affixed right there where we see the big
giant<00:02:07.569> holes<00:02:07.719> I<00:02:07.840> guess<00:02:07.989> that<00:02:08.140> will<00:02:08.200> make<00:02:08.349> sense

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
giant holes I guess that will make sense

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.400 
giant holes I guess that will make sense
but<00:02:10.959> again<00:02:11.920> when<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.459> look<00:02:12.489> dead<00:02:12.819> on<00:02:13.410> it's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
but again when you look dead on it's

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.309 
but again when you look dead on it's
pretty<00:02:14.829> freaking<00:02:15.310> awesome

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
pretty freaking awesome

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.170 
pretty freaking awesome
one<00:02:16.680> final<00:02:16.950> look<00:02:17.099> down<00:02:17.310> here<00:02:17.519> on<00:02:17.670> ground<00:02:18.060> level

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
one final look down here on ground level

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.119 
one final look down here on ground level
before<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.749> go<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.900> our<00:02:18.959> perch<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.650> cancer

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
before we go to our perch up in cancer

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.250 
before we go to our perch up in cancer
acid<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.389> get<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> look<00:02:21.629> at<00:02:21.749> more<00:02:22.079> of<00:02:22.109> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
acid you can get a look at more of the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.520 
acid you can get a look at more of the
heavy<00:02:23.219> rock<00:02:23.609> work<00:02:23.879> in<00:02:24.030> progress<00:02:24.299> as<00:02:25.290> it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
heavy rock work in progress as it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.470 
heavy rock work in progress as it
transforms<00:02:25.829> from<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:27.889> into<00:02:28.889> that

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
transforms from that into that

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.840 
transforms from that into that
sort<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.019> middle<00:02:30.379> ground<00:02:30.650> here

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
sort of this middle ground here

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.600 
sort of this middle ground here
and<00:02:33.270> again<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:37.380> building<00:02:37.830> without<00:02:37.920> walls<00:02:38.310> so

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
and again this building without walls so

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.410 
and again this building without walls so
you're<00:02:38.760> still<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> long<00:02:39.510> ways<00:02:40.140> away<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.920> well

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
you're still a long ways away as well

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.180 
you're still a long ways away as well
whatever's<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.630> on<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.810> there<00:02:43.190> doesn't

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
whatever's going on in there doesn't

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.850 
whatever's going on in there doesn't
have<00:02:44.280> wall<00:02:44.460> hit<00:02:45.380> but<00:02:46.380> we're<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.560> up<00:02:46.710> on<00:02:46.800> the

bird's eye view of the sky island reign

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.230 
bird's eye view of the sky island reign
of<00:02:53.580> Kong<00:02:54.030> construction<00:02:54.930> project<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:57.090> a

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
of Kong construction project and it's a

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.700 
of Kong construction project and it's a
look<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.320> pretty<00:02:58.620> snazzy<00:03:00.230> now<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.590> most

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
look in pretty snazzy now the most

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.960 
look in pretty snazzy now the most
interesting<00:03:02.130> thing<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.340> can<00:03:02.490> find<00:03:02.700> from<00:03:02.790> down

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
interesting thing I can find from down

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.460 
interesting thing I can find from down
here<00:03:03.210> is<00:03:03.330> again<00:03:03.510> talking<00:03:03.840> about<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.080> giant

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
here is again talking about that giant

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.630 
here is again talking about that giant
do

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
do

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.990 
do
element<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:07.230> could<00:03:07.380> see

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
element you could see

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.970 
element you could see
I<00:03:09.090> imagine<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> door<00:03:10.080> will<00:03:10.170> probably<00:03:10.530> give<00:03:10.950> it

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
I imagine the door will probably give it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.550 
I imagine the door will probably give it
on<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> top<00:03:11.490> there<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.260> keep<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
on the top there and keep it on the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.320 
on the top there and keep it on the
bottom<00:03:13.680> somewhere<00:03:14.070> down<00:03:14.250> there<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.670> just

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
bottom somewhere down there and just

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.050 
bottom somewhere down there and just
open<00:03:15.540> up<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.160> tell<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.550> your<00:03:17.760> chief

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
open up but you can tell it your chief
