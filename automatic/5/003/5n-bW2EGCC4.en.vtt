00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
missiles so it's the best thing to do

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.570 
missiles so it's the best thing to do
now<00:04:03.830> let's<00:04:04.010> see<00:04:05.170> if<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.350> press<00:04:06.800> down<00:04:06.830> blah<00:04:07.370> blah

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
now let's see if I press down blah blah

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.510 
now let's see if I press down blah blah
and<00:04:08.450> now<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:08.690> press<00:04:09.290> 1<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:09.709> 2<00:04:09.860> as<00:04:10.070> you<00:04:10.190> can<00:04:10.370> see

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
and now I press 1 and 2 as you can see

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.699 
and now I press 1 and 2 as you can see
all<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.940> missiles<00:04:11.450> are<00:04:11.630> launched<00:04:11.870> but<00:04:12.500> now<00:04:12.680> I

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
all the missiles are launched but now I

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.570 
all the missiles are launched but now I
did<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:13.130> big<00:04:13.370> mistake<00:04:13.400> here<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:15.280> as<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:16.459> can

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
did a big mistake here and as you can

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.530 
did a big mistake here and as you can
see<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:18.140> basically<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.459> front<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.299> this

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
see this is basically the front and this

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.490 
see this is basically the front and this
is<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.780> bank<00:04:21.140> but<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:23.030> way<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.240> did<00:04:23.600> fired<00:04:23.900> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
is the bank but the way I did fired the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.060 
is the bank but the way I did fired the
missiles<00:04:24.980> was<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.730> other<00:04:25.910> way<00:04:26.240> actually

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
missiles was the other way actually

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:38.860 
missiles was the other way actually
therefore<00:04:35.020> therefore<00:04:36.020> let's<00:04:37.630> let's<00:04:38.630> actually

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
therefore therefore let's let's actually

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.909 
therefore therefore let's let's actually
use<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.550> way<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:42.050> supposed<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.710> be

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
use it the way it it is supposed to be

00:04:42.919 --> 00:05:02.060 
use it the way it it is supposed to be
used<00:04:44.260> like<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:47.110> now<00:04:50.020> if<00:04:51.020> we<00:04:51.320> press<00:04:51.680> space<00:04:52.040> now

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.230 

right<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.590> way<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:06.700> has<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:07.090> be

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
right and this is the way it has to be

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.950 
right and this is the way it has to be
done<00:05:08.610> yep

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
done yep

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.580 
done yep
if<00:05:10.960> we<00:05:11.200> pray<00:05:11.530> space<00:05:12.040> now<00:05:13.200> things<00:05:14.200> work

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
if we pray space now things work

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.810 
if we pray space now things work
properly<00:05:15.540> as<00:05:16.540> you<00:05:16.750> can<00:05:16.930> see<00:05:17.170> you<00:05:17.440> have<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:18.040> turn

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
properly as you can see you have to turn

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:27.660 
properly as you can see you have to turn
this<00:05:19.210> Oh<00:05:22.800> like<00:05:23.800> this<00:05:25.710> basically<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:27.220> missile

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
this Oh like this basically the missile

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.390 
this Oh like this basically the missile
will<00:05:29.550> will<00:05:30.550> fall<00:05:31.170> from<00:05:32.170> this<00:05:32.380> and<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:32.890> will<00:05:33.190> get

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
will will fall from this and it will get

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.050 
will will fall from this and it will get
fired

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
fired

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.050 
fired
you<00:05:34.540> see<00:05:34.890> this<00:05:35.890> is<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.220> way<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.550> has<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:36.790> be

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
you see this is the way it has to be

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.010 
you see this is the way it has to be
done<00:05:37.470> yep

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
done yep

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.790 
done yep
but<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.320> shouldn't<00:05:41.680> lower<00:05:42.520> it<00:05:42.760> too<00:05:42.970> much<00:05:43.800> this

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
but you shouldn't lower it too much this

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.180 
but you shouldn't lower it too much this
is<00:05:45.010> enough<00:05:45.870> because<00:05:46.870> it<00:05:47.170> has<00:05:47.380> to<00:05:47.590> go<00:05:47.740> into<00:05:47.950> the

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
is enough because it has to go into the

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.530 
is enough because it has to go into the
arrow<00:05:49.650> because<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:50.830> has<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.280> go<00:05:51.460> into<00:05:51.670> oh

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.080 

because<00:05:55.980> because<00:05:56.980> it<00:05:57.160> has<00:05:57.340> to<00:05:57.520> go<00:05:57.670> into<00:05:57.880> the

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
because because it has to go into the

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:12.240 
because because it has to go into the
