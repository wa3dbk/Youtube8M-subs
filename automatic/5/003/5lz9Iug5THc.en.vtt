come over here it's a little small

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.010 
come over here it's a little small
counter<00:02:10.670> space<00:02:11.000> one<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.450> things<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:11.780> could

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
counter space one of the things we could

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.220 
counter space one of the things we could
do<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.470> maybe<00:02:12.650> add<00:02:12.980> in<00:02:13.340> an<00:02:13.550> extra<00:02:14.150> pop<00:02:14.660> out<00:02:14.930> that

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
do is maybe add in an extra pop out that

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.260 
do is maybe add in an extra pop out that
would<00:02:15.410> be<00:02:15.530> pretty<00:02:15.740> simple<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.460> might<00:02:17.060> just

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
would be pretty simple to do might just

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.750 
would be pretty simple to do might just
go<00:02:17.390> ahead<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.660> do<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.780> anyways<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:19.610> would

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
go ahead and do that anyways it would

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.730 
go ahead and do that anyways it would
add<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.120> counter<00:02:20.420> space<00:02:20.510> there<00:02:20.930> does<00:02:21.710> have

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
add to the counter space there does have

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.350 
add to the counter space there does have
