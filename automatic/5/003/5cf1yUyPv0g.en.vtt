00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.690 
circular why I can't talk pattern around
the<00:04:00.209> deck<00:04:00.419> and<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:01.260> kinda<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.950> tunnel

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
the deck and it kinda is like tunnel

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.550 
the deck and it kinda is like tunnel
reminds<00:04:03.090> me<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.269> little<00:04:03.419> bit<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.720> fire<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.410> way

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
reminds me a little bit of fire in a way

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.970 
reminds me a little bit of fire in a way
but<00:04:04.889> like<00:04:05.099> the<00:04:05.250> really<00:04:05.459> dark<00:04:05.639> colors<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:07.500> just

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
but like the really dark colors I just

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.930 
but like the really dark colors I just
think<00:04:08.099> it<00:04:08.160> looks<00:04:08.370> really<00:04:08.430> cool<00:04:08.730> i'm<00:04:08.819> not

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
think it looks really cool i'm not

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.099 
think it looks really cool i'm not
really<00:04:09.030> sure<00:04:09.150> exactly<00:04:09.540> what<00:04:09.989> it's<00:04:10.079> supposed

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
really sure exactly what it's supposed

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.369 
really sure exactly what it's supposed
to<00:04:10.349> be<00:04:11.150> but<00:04:12.150> i<00:04:12.209> do<00:04:12.480> like<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:12.840> ace<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.169> spades

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
to be but i do like this ace of spades

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.170 
to be but i do like this ace of spades
lot<00:04:13.560> because<00:04:13.889> it's<00:04:14.129> not<00:04:14.250> too<00:04:14.459> over-the-top<00:04:14.699> I

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
lot because it's not too over-the-top I

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.689 
lot because it's not too over-the-top I
think<00:04:15.510> it's<00:04:15.660> like<00:04:15.780> just<00:04:16.049> right<00:04:16.400> with<00:04:17.400> the

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
and there's found looking lines coming

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.920 
and there's found looking lines coming
out<00:05:05.090> diagonal<00:05:05.900> from<00:05:06.020> those<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.849> then<00:05:08.240> if<00:05:08.539> you

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
out diagonal from those and then if you

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.060 
out diagonal from those and then if you
look<00:05:09.050> really<00:05:09.199> closely<00:05:09.440> there's<00:05:09.830> actually

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
look really closely there's actually

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.839 
look really closely there's actually
scrollwork<00:05:10.990> running<00:05:11.990> across<00:05:12.460> well<00:05:13.460> if<00:05:13.669> you'd

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
scrollwork running across well if you'd

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.629

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
pattern in the middle I'm not again I'm

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:30.339 
pattern in the middle I'm not again I'm
not<00:05:29.539> really<00:05:29.750> sure<00:05:29.840> if<00:05:29.960> it<00:05:30.080> supposed<00:05:30.259> to<00:05:30.289> be

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
not really sure if it supposed to be

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.990 
not really sure if it supposed to be
like<00:05:30.409> flowers<00:05:30.860> or<00:05:31.070> something<00:05:31.430> that's<00:05:31.669> work

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
like flowers or something that's work

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.070 
like flowers or something that's work
but<00:05:32.470> it<00:05:33.470> looks<00:05:33.860> pretty<00:05:33.949> cool<00:05:34.719> all<00:05:35.719> right<00:05:35.870> and

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
but it looks pretty cool all right and

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.850 
but it looks pretty cool all right and
as<00:05:36.979> I<00:05:37.159> said<00:05:37.310> before<00:05:37.370> handles<00:05:38.030> like<00:05:38.740> stain<00:05:39.740> your
