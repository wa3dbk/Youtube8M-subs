there's the button of the two of them
back<00:00:24.439> together<00:00:27.640> making<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:28.910> real<00:00:29.300> simple<00:00:29.839> and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
back together making it real simple and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.820 
back together making it real simple and
real<00:00:31.490> stock<00:00:32.029> like<00:00:32.360> we'll<00:00:32.780> tuck<00:00:33.080> that<00:00:33.320> back<00:00:33.380> up

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
real stock like we'll tuck that back up

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.580 
real stock like we'll tuck that back up
under<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.310> dash<00:00:34.490> when<00:00:34.850> we're<00:00:35.030> all<00:00:35.180> done<00:00:38.590> so

we're going to go back up here and we're

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.560 
we're going to go back up here and we're
going<00:00:43.039> to<00:00:43.100> install<00:00:43.610> our<00:00:46.210> nice-looking<00:00:47.210> billet

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
going to install our nice-looking billet

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.209 
going to install our nice-looking billet
column<00:00:47.989> cover<00:00:48.260> there<00:00:49.180> top<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.420> bottom<00:00:50.809> and

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
column cover there top and bottom and

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.500 
column cover there top and bottom and
then<00:00:52.219> we'll<00:00:52.340> deal<00:00:52.550> with<00:00:52.579> our<00:00:52.879> steering<00:00:53.300> wheel

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
then we'll deal with our steering wheel

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.029 
then we'll deal with our steering wheel
and<00:00:53.750> our<00:00:53.840> levers<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.670> show<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:55.730> how<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.149> looks

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
and our levers and show you how it looks

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.400 
and our levers and show you how it looks
so<00:00:58.039> one<00:00:58.309> thing<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:58.760> might<00:00:58.789> run<00:00:59.480> into<00:00:59.539> it's

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
so one thing you might run into it's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.939 
so one thing you might run into it's
possible<00:01:01.190> we're<00:01:01.879> using<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.359> billet<00:01:02.949> column

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
possible we're using the billet column

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.520 
possible we're using the billet column
I'm<00:01:04.129> going<00:01:04.340> to<00:01:04.400> put<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.780> stock<00:01:05.780> plastic<00:01:06.350> one

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
I'm going to put a stock plastic one

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.590 
I'm going to put a stock plastic one
back<00:01:06.740> on<00:01:06.979> I've<00:01:07.159> got<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.400> little<00:01:07.970> bit<00:01:08.150> of<00:01:08.299> space

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.039 
back on I've got a little bit of space
here<00:01:09.020> about<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.130> thickness<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:11.090> maybe<00:01:11.570> I'm

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
here about the thickness of maybe I'm

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.160 
here about the thickness of maybe I'm
gonna<00:01:12.200> probably<00:01:12.500> stick<00:01:12.950> an<00:01:13.130> 8<00:01:13.430> inch<00:01:14.170> washer

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170

gonna probably stick an 8 inch washer
between<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.400> two<00:01:16.960> mounting<00:01:17.960> points<00:01:18.350> between

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
between the two mounting points between

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.100 
between the two mounting points between
the<00:01:18.829> body<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.400> column<00:01:19.970> mount<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.930> get

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
the body and the column mount to get

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.710 
the body and the column mount to get
that<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.590> sit<00:01:21.860> just<00:01:22.189> right<00:01:22.490> because<00:01:23.000> if<00:01:23.270> I<00:01:23.420> put

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
that to sit just right because if I put

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.990 
that to sit just right because if I put
my<00:01:24.460> top<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.670> my<00:01:25.790> column<00:01:26.240> piece<00:01:26.509> on<00:01:27.640> I've<00:01:28.640> got

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
my top of my column piece on I've got

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.690 
my top of my column piece on I've got
about<00:01:29.329> an<00:01:30.110> eighth<00:01:30.590> inch<00:01:30.619> gap<00:01:31.280> right<00:01:31.640> there

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
about an eighth inch gap right there

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.649 
about an eighth inch gap right there
I've<00:01:32.060> got<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.450> deal<00:01:32.630> with<00:01:33.369> no<00:01:34.369> big<00:01:34.670> deal<00:01:34.939> real

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
I've got to deal with no big deal real

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.010 
I've got to deal with no big deal real
quick<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.530> easy<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.100> change<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.600> not

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
quick and easy to change and it's not

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.139 
quick and easy to change and it's not
necessarily<00:01:39.890> going<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.280> work<00:01:40.490> out<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.939> same

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
necessarily going to work out the same

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.490 
necessarily going to work out the same
on<00:01:41.390> every<00:01:41.780> one<00:01:42.189> so<00:01:43.540> that's<00:01:44.540> something<00:01:44.899> easy<00:01:45.290> to

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
on every one so that's something easy to

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.100 
on every one so that's something easy to
fix

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
fix

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.990

there<00:01:48.110> we<00:01:48.259> go<00:01:48.409> same<00:01:48.860> column<00:01:49.399> just<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.790> few

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
there we go same column just a few

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.560 
there we go same column just a few
minutes<00:01:50.329> later<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.920> stuck<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.159> couple

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
minutes later just stuck a couple

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.459 
minutes later just stuck a couple
washers<00:01:53.570> in<00:01:53.869> each<00:01:54.619> side<00:01:54.979> close<00:01:55.610> up<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:55.850> gap

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
washers in each side close up that gap

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.999 
washers in each side close up that gap
centered<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:57.649> column<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:59.450> nice<00:02:00.009> billet

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
try to stock plastic one you're probably

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.170 
try to stock plastic one you're probably
gonna<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.810> do<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.170> same<00:02:06.409> thing<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.640> there
