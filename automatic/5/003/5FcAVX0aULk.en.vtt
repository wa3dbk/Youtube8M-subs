00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
minute he's lying about this third gear

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.880 
minute he's lying about this third gear
thing<00:02:24.410> apparently<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.370> underestimated<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
thing apparently I underestimated the

thing apparently I underestimated the
versatility<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.550> rotary<00:02:28.910> because<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.739> mean

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
versatility of the rotary because I mean

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.229 
versatility of the rotary because I mean
he<00:02:30.860> SAT<00:02:31.069> there<00:02:31.220> wrapped<00:02:31.400> out<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.700> second<00:02:32.060> gear

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
he SAT there wrapped out in second gear

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.360 
he SAT there wrapped out in second gear
at<00:02:32.360> 9000<00:02:32.930> rpm<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.260> cleared<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.010> course<00:02:34.220> no

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
at 9000 rpm and cleared the course no

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.309
