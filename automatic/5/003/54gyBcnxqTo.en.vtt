maintenance and the coils so this is the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.150 
maintenance and the coils so this is the
magnet<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.500> what<00:01:08.649> we're<00:01:08.740> gonna<00:01:08.860> do<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.070> we're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
magnet and what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.609 
magnet and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:09.220> hook<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:10.170> we're<00:01:11.170> gonna<00:01:11.229> hook<00:01:11.410> up<00:01:11.530> a

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
gonna hook up to we're gonna hook up a

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:12.900 
gonna hook up to we're gonna hook up a
voltage<00:01:11.950> source<00:01:12.160> in<00:01:12.340> here<00:01:12.399> and<00:01:12.670> it's<00:01:12.789> gonna

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
voltage source in here and it's gonna

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.710 
voltage source in here and it's gonna
cause<00:01:13.240> this<00:01:13.990> part<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.470> become<00:01:14.800> magnetic<00:01:15.160> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
cause this part to become magnetic and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.300 
cause this part to become magnetic and
as<00:01:16.720> we<00:01:17.170> turn<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.590> crank

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
as we turn the crank

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.020 
as we turn the crank
we'll<00:01:18.459> see<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.209> maintenance<00:01:19.619> pin<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
we'll see that the maintenance pin that

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.419 
we'll see that the maintenance pin that
magnets<00:01:25.630> will<00:01:26.380> be<00:01:26.470> spinning<00:01:26.740> on<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.039> inside

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
magnets will be spinning on the inside

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.540 
magnets will be spinning on the inside
of<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:27.759> coil<00:01:28.119> similar<00:01:28.899> to<00:01:29.110> like<00:01:29.349> this<00:01:29.550> and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
of this coil similar to like this and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.029 
of this coil similar to like this and
what<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.819> can<00:01:30.940> see<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.539> that<00:01:31.709> there's<00:01:32.709> a<00:01:32.830> bunch

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
what you can see is that there's a bunch

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.980 
what you can see is that there's a bunch
of<00:01:33.220> Spoils<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.090> this<00:01:34.240> thing<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.479> bunch<00:01:34.660> of<00:01:34.750> wire

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
of Spoils in this thing a bunch of wire

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.109 
of Spoils in this thing a bunch of wire
and<00:01:35.319> there's<00:01:35.890> actually<00:01:36.160> three<00:01:36.459> distinct<00:01:36.910> sets

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
and there's actually three distinct sets

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.480 
and there's actually three distinct sets
of<00:01:37.270> coils<00:01:37.690> there's<00:01:38.050> this<00:01:38.410> loop<00:01:38.740> up<00:01:38.950> here<00:01:38.979> which

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
of coils there's this loop up here which

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.389 
of coils there's this loop up here which
repeats<00:01:39.940> every<00:01:40.209> so<00:01:40.390> often<00:01:40.599> it's<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.530> same<00:01:41.800> set

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
repeats every so often it's the same set

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.699 
repeats every so often it's the same set
of<00:01:42.429> loops<00:01:42.700> there's<00:01:43.539> one<00:01:43.840> that's<00:01:43.989> a<00:01:44.140> third<00:01:44.440> off

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
of loops there's one that's a third off

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.800 
of loops there's one that's a third off
and<00:01:45.069> another<00:01:45.489> that's<00:01:45.670> another<00:01:45.849> third<00:01:46.390> off<00:01:46.569> so

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
and another that's another third off so

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.020 
and another that's another third off so
you<00:01:46.869> can<00:01:47.170> see<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.739> three<00:01:48.039> distinct<00:01:48.550> sets<00:01:48.729> and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
you can see the three distinct sets and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.120 
you can see the three distinct sets and
then<00:01:49.119> they<00:01:49.239> start<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:49.630> repeat<00:01:49.959> themselves<00:01:50.200> and

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
then they start to repeat themselves and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.609 
then they start to repeat themselves and
as<00:01:51.369> we<00:01:51.580> turn<00:01:51.819> this<00:01:52.030> magnet<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:53.319> magnetic

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
as we turn this magnet the magnetic

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.440 
as we turn this magnet the magnetic
field<00:01:54.099> is<00:01:54.310> going<00:01:54.459> to<00:01:54.580> change<00:01:54.880> as<00:01:55.209> it<00:01:55.330> goes

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
field is going to change as it goes

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.800 
field is going to change as it goes
around<00:01:55.739> the<00:01:56.739> current<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.360> because<00:01:58.630> of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
around the current and because of

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.870 
around the current and because of
Faraday's<00:01:59.170> law<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.410> induction<00:01:59.590> that<00:02:00.280> changing

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
Faraday's law of induction that changing

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.029 
Faraday's law of induction that changing
magnetic<00:02:01.090> field<00:02:01.509> will<00:02:01.929> give<00:02:02.200> rise<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.560> an

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
magnetic field will give rise to an

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.229 
magnetic field will give rise to an
induced<00:02:03.429> current<00:02:03.789> in<00:02:04.119> these<00:02:04.770> loops<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.239> the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
induced current in these loops and the

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.240 
induced current in these loops and the
loops<00:02:07.539> were<00:02:07.750> going<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:07.989> be<00:02:08.080> able<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.349> hook<00:02:09.039> up

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
loops were going to be able to hook up

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.850 
loops were going to be able to hook up
to<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.390> electrodes<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.319> electrodes<00:02:11.709> we

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
to the electrodes and the electrodes we

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.949 
to the electrodes and the electrodes we
hook<00:02:12.010> up<00:02:12.129> to<00:02:12.310> actually<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.700> plugs<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.330> are

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
hook up to actually the plugs that are

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.890 
hook up to actually the plugs that are
on<00:02:14.140> our<00:02:14.319> case<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.520> we'll<00:02:16.270> be<00:02:16.390> able<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.629> measure

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
on our case and we'll be able to measure

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.660 
on our case and we'll be able to measure
the<00:02:17.349> current<00:02:17.620> that's<00:02:17.920> induced<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.550> these

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
the current that's induced in these

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.050 
the current that's induced in these
loops<00:02:18.910> by<00:02:19.450> measuring<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.930> voltage
