I recently stopped skating about five
years<00:01:02.929> ago

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.290 

you're<00:01:13.160> skating<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:13.520> eat<00:01:13.850> needs<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.120> lot<00:01:14.270> of

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
you're skating you eat needs a lot of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.930 
you're skating you eat needs a lot of
our<00:01:14.750> legs<00:01:15.230> right<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.370> do<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.580> lot<00:01:16.910> of

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
our legs right so we do a lot of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.970 
our legs right so we do a lot of
plyometrics<00:01:17.750> training<00:01:18.140> which<00:01:18.290> is<00:01:18.470> basically

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
plyometrics training which is basically

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.270 
plyometrics training which is basically
fast<00:01:19.370> twitch<00:01:19.670> training<00:01:20.330> jumping<00:01:21.280> explosive

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
fast twitch training jumping explosive

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.340 
fast twitch training jumping explosive
movements<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.060> they<00:01:23.300> can<00:01:23.690> jump<00:01:24.140> and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
movements so that they can jump and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.290 
movements so that they can jump and
accelerate<00:01:24.770> into<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.130> air<00:01:25.280> faster<00:01:26.030> and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
accelerate into the air faster and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.360 
accelerate into the air faster and
twitch<00:01:26.690> faster<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:27.229> their<00:01:27.380> rotations<00:01:27.950> get

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
twitch faster so their rotations get

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.300 
twitch faster so their rotations get
better<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.540> also<00:01:29.750> we<00:01:30.050> do<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.229> lot<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.650> jumping

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
better and also we do a lot of jumping

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.700 
better and also we do a lot of jumping
kind<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.060> on<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.420> floor<00:01:32.660> so<00:01:32.960> we'll<00:01:33.110> do<00:01:33.229> Axel's

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
kind of on the floor so we'll do Axel's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.590 
kind of on the floor so we'll do Axel's
double<00:01:33.979> sounds<00:01:34.250> all<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.580> way<00:01:34.640> up<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.940> triple

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
double sounds all the way up to triple

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.340 
double sounds all the way up to triple
jumps<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:39.520> don't<00:01:40.520> pass<00:01:40.760> is<00:01:41.000> not<00:01:41.150> so<00:01:41.360> much<00:01:41.540> based

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
jumps I don't pass is not so much based

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.820 
jumps I don't pass is not so much based
on<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.010> movements<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.720> jumping<00:01:45.200> part<00:01:45.680> of

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
on the movements the jumping part of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.859 
on the movements the jumping part of
that<00:01:45.950> you're<00:01:46.070> skating<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.670> all<00:01:47.180> that<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:47.720> we

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
that you're skating and all that but we

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.499 
that you're skating and all that but we
do<00:01:48.080> incorporate<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.890> lot<00:01:49.369> of<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.910> different

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
do incorporate a lot of the different

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.090 
do incorporate a lot of the different
techniques<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.050> we<00:01:51.290> would<00:01:51.530> use<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:51.860> figure

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
techniques that we would use in figure

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.219 
techniques that we would use in figure
skating<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:52.610> there's<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.180> lot<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.540> like<00:01:53.720> squats

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
skating so there's a lot of like squats

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.279 
skating so there's a lot of like squats
and<00:01:54.560> split<00:01:55.280> jumps<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.850> lateral<00:01:56.570> bounding<00:01:57.050> so

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
and split jumps and lateral bounding so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.859 
and split jumps and lateral bounding so
it's<00:01:57.440> kind<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.800> like<00:01:58.039> simulating<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.149> idea<00:01:59.630> of

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
it's kind of like simulating the idea of

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.719 
it's kind of like simulating the idea of
figure<00:02:00.140> skating<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:00.800> in<00:02:01.039> a<00:02:01.130> way<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.520> adults

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729

can<00:02:02.210> still<00:02:02.660> appreciate<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:03.830> still<00:02:04.190> get<00:02:04.399> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
can still appreciate and still get the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
can still appreciate and still get the
fitness<00:02:05.270> out<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:05.630> it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
fitness out of it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.529 
fitness out of it

the reason I started this was because

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.460 
the reason I started this was because
when<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> competitive<00:02:46.200> figure<00:02:46.380> skater

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
