00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
really well it's so easy to use so what

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.720 
really well it's so easy to use so what
you<00:02:59.080> do<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.530> actually<00:02:59.620> wet<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.610> then

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
you do is you actually wet this and then

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.030 
you do is you actually wet this and then
you<00:03:00.820> squeeze<00:03:01.150> out<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.390> excess<00:03:01.750> water<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.380> it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
you squeeze out the excess water and it

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.640 
you squeeze out the excess water and it
swells<00:03:03.340> right<00:03:03.610> up<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:03.970> then<00:03:04.840> up<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.350> then

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
swells right up and then up and then

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.950 
swells right up and then up and then
it's<00:03:05.800> sort<00:03:06.460> of<00:03:06.550> like<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.760> bouncing<00:03:07.390> motion<00:03:07.810> so

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
it's sort of like a bouncing motion so

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.750 
it's sort of like a bouncing motion so
you're<00:03:08.110> pushing<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.830> then<00:03:08.950> kind<00:03:09.700> of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
you're pushing it on and then kind of

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.790 
you're pushing it on and then kind of
flicking<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:11.020> do<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> little<00:03:11.470> bit<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.680> a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
flicking in you do a little bit of a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.350 
flicking in you do a little bit of a
circular<00:03:12.040> motion<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.730> well<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:13.270> just

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
circular motion as well but it's just

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.560 
circular motion as well but it's just
more<00:03:13.980> spreading<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.700> I've<00:03:15.790> started<00:03:16.030> with<00:03:16.330> the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
more spreading so I've started with the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.470 
more spreading so I've started with the
light<00:03:17.410> areas<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.220> then<00:03:18.700> I'm<00:03:18.820> moving<00:03:18.970> on<00:03:19.300> to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
light areas and then I'm moving on to

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:49.040 
light areas and then I'm moving on to
the<00:03:19.570> darker<00:03:19.960> areas<00:03:20.260> now

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.390 

so<00:03:50.050> it<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.260> kind<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.680> circular<00:03:51.250> motion

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
so it is kind of like a circular motion

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.940 
so it is kind of like a circular motion
circular<00:03:52.030> dance<00:03:53.370> blend<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.560> around<00:03:59.830> the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
circular dance blend it and around the

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.430 
circular dance blend it and around the
areas<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.550> feel<00:04:00.820> like<00:04:01.200> sometimes<00:04:02.200> this

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
areas that you feel like sometimes this

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.980 
areas that you feel like sometimes this
can<00:04:02.650> push<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.340> foundation<00:04:04.000> off<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.780> if<00:04:04.870> you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
can push the foundation off so if you

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.450 
can push the foundation off so if you
feel<00:04:05.170> like<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.410> need<00:04:05.590> more<00:04:05.800> coverage<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.250> can

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
feel like you need more coverage you can

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.630 
feel like you need more coverage you can
do<00:04:07.030> like<00:04:07.450> this<00:04:08.040> but<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.130> keeps<00:04:09.250> all<00:04:09.490> the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
do like this but it keeps all the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.550 
do like this but it keeps all the
foundation<00:04:10.450> there<00:04:10.660> rather<00:04:10.960> than<00:04:11.110> pushing<00:04:11.410> it

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
foundation there rather than pushing it

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.060 
foundation there rather than pushing it
off<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:13.290> usually<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.560> do<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.770> around<00:04:14.980> my

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
off I usually like to do that around my

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.620 
off I usually like to do that around my
eye<00:04:15.100> area<00:04:15.220> as<00:04:15.760> well<00:04:15.970> because<00:04:16.269> it's<00:04:16.420> such

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
eye area as well because it's such

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.090 
eye area as well because it's such
delicate<00:04:17.410> skin<00:04:17.709> there

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
delicate skin there

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:28.050 
delicate skin there
I<00:04:18.130> like<00:04:19.030> dragging<00:04:19.660> along<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.260> skin<00:04:27.060> it's

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
I like dragging along that skin it's

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.810 
I like dragging along that skin it's
gonna<00:04:28.210> use<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.690> other<00:04:28.840> side<00:04:29.140> of<00:04:29.320> it<00:04:29.700> just<00:04:30.700> to

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
gonna use the other side of it just to

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.220 
gonna use the other side of it just to
get<00:04:31.030> in<00:04:31.120> these<00:04:31.240> area

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.620 

so<00:04:36.860> many<00:04:37.070> smaller<00:04:37.490> areas<00:04:37.970> it's<00:04:38.210> really<00:04:38.450> good

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
so many smaller areas it's really good

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.940 
so many smaller areas it's really good
you<00:04:38.780> can<00:04:38.810> use<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.200> side<00:04:39.410> of<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.590> blender

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
you can use that side of the blender

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:47.400 
you can use that side of the blender
that's<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.430> point

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.420 

so<00:04:48.410> that's<00:04:48.590> contouring<00:04:49.130> and<00:04:49.370> highlighting

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
so that's contouring and highlighting

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.460 
so that's contouring and highlighting
nice<00:04:50.090> that's<00:04:50.540> really<00:04:51.080> good<00:04:51.200> I<00:04:51.230> love

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
nice that's really good I love

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.960 
nice that's really good I love
highlighting<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.220> contouring<00:04:52.490> because<00:04:52.760> you

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
highlighting and contouring because you

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.180 
highlighting and contouring because you
can<00:04:53.120> darken<00:04:53.870> areas<00:04:54.170> and<00:04:54.650> then<00:04:54.740> really<00:04:55.010> bring

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
can darken areas and then really bring

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.070 
can darken areas and then really bring
out<00:04:55.370> features<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.480> you<00:04:56.570> want<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.810> bring<00:04:56.960> out

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
out features that you want to bring out

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.500 
out features that you want to bring out
-<00:04:57.260> like<00:04:57.500> your<00:04:57.650> cheekbones<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.520> brow<00:04:59.180> bones

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
- like your cheekbones and brow bones

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.540 
- like your cheekbones and brow bones
and<00:04:59.840> darken<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:00.380> areas<00:05:00.650> around<00:05:00.770> my<00:05:01.070> forehead

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
and darken the areas around my forehead

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.640 
and darken the areas around my forehead
and<00:05:01.580> chin<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.390> it<00:05:02.690> just<00:05:02.870> really<00:05:03.110> defines<00:05:03.530> a

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
and chin and it just really defines a

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.560 
and chin and it just really defines a
face<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.100> love<00:05:04.310> for<00:05:04.550> look<00:05:04.700> at<00:05:04.820> Gibbs<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.300> hope

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570
