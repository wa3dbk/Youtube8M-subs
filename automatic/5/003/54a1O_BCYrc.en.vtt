plugins<00:00:44.239> into<00:00:44.600> my<00:00:44.750> dedicated<00:00:45.170> server<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:45.800> it's

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
plugins into my dedicated server so it's

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.410 
plugins into my dedicated server so it's
way<00:00:46.070> easier<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:46.879> have<00:00:46.969> a<00:00:47.030> home<00:00:47.210> server

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
way easier if you have a home server
