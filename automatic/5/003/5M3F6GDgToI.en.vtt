why I chose

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.450 
why I chose
the<00:00:24.100> Yamaha<00:00:24.610> r3<00:00:24.850> as<00:00:25.840> my<00:00:26.140> first<00:00:26.410> bike

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
the Yamaha r3 as my first bike

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.090 
the Yamaha r3 as my first bike
the<00:00:28.790> research<00:00:29.270> I<00:00:29.420> did<00:00:29.570> before<00:00:30.560> I<00:00:30.770> actually

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
the research I did before I actually

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:40.069 
the research I did before I actually
bought<00:00:31.490> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.649 

that<00:00:40.890> motorcycle<00:00:41.339> license<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.210> some<00:00:42.390> time

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
that motorcycle license for some time

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.729 
that motorcycle license for some time
now<00:00:42.929> and<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> reason<00:00:45.359> why<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:46.289> forced<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
now and the reason why I was forced to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.360 
now and the reason why I was forced to
buy<00:00:46.920> bike<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.429> because

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
buy bike was because

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.569 
buy bike was because
my<00:00:49.989> beginner's<00:00:50.989> license<00:00:51.410> or<00:00:51.559> my<00:00:51.590> m2<00:00:52.039> was<00:00:52.280> going

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
my beginner's license or my m2 was going

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.760 
my beginner's license or my m2 was going
to<00:00:52.730> expire<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:53.420> I<00:00:53.449> needed<00:00:53.899> my<00:00:54.050> own<00:00:54.079> bike<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.620> do

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
to expire so I needed my own bike to do

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:04.719 
to expire so I needed my own bike to do
my

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.420 

I<00:01:04.930> know<00:01:05.930> we've<00:01:06.380> got<00:01:06.560> tests<00:01:06.829> I<00:01:06.950> had<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.189> go<00:01:07.310> on

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
I know we've got tests I had to go on

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.149 
I know we've got tests I had to go on
highway<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.020> there<00:01:09.020> was<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.200> certain<00:01:09.530> size

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
highway so there was a certain size

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.069 
highway so there was a certain size
restriction<00:01:10.939> I<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.090> had<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.570> have<00:01:11.719> I<00:01:11.750> couldn't

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
restriction I I had to have I couldn't

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.459 
restriction I I had to have I couldn't
have<00:01:12.289> my<00:01:12.530> tie<00:01:12.590> was<00:01:12.770> too<00:01:13.039> small<00:01:13.539> like<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:15.110> CBR

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
have my tie was too small like the CBR

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.569 
have my tie was too small like the CBR
125<00:01:16.310> which<00:01:17.299> while<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:17.539> was<00:01:17.750> looking<00:01:18.020> at<00:01:18.140> before

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
125 which while I was looking at before

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:25.270 
125 which while I was looking at before
but<00:01:19.720> because<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:20.750> its<00:01:21.100> low<00:01:22.100> cost<00:01:22.869> but<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:25.009> just

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
but because of its low cost but it just

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.940 
but because of its low cost but it just
wouldn't<00:01:25.610> have<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.149> juice<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:26.630> needed<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.229> take

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
wouldn't have the juice I needed to take

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.029 
wouldn't have the juice I needed to take
me<00:01:28.159> up<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.399> highway<00:01:28.549> speed<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.740> brought

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
me up the highway speed so that brought

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:42.639 
me up the highway speed so that brought
me<00:01:31.189> to<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.429> 300<00:01:32.000> class<00:01:36.939> so<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.849> 300s<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.720> was

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
me to the 300 class so of the 300s I was

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.440 
me to the 300 class so of the 300s I was
looking<00:01:42.979> at<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:44.530> r3<00:01:45.530> obviously<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:47.119> ninja

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
looking at the r3 obviously the ninja

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.039 
looking at the r3 obviously the ninja
300<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.750> CBR<00:01:51.140> 300<00:01:52.450> all<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.659> bikes<00:01:53.840> are

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
300 and the CBR 300 all the bikes are

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.139 
300 and the CBR 300 all the bikes are
are<00:01:54.979> pretty<00:01:55.280> good<00:01:55.549> I<00:01:57.700> wouldn't<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.880> wouldn't

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
are pretty good I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.710 
are pretty good I wouldn't I wouldn't
say<00:01:59.329> one<00:01:59.599> is<00:01:59.780> better<00:01:59.810> than<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.319> other<00:02:00.759> but<00:02:01.759> I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.270 

definitely<00:02:06.189> thought<00:02:07.189> for<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.030> price<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.739> r3

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
definitely thought for the price the r3

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.949 
definitely thought for the price the r3
had<00:02:10.489> much<00:02:11.209> more<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.660> offer

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.920 

one<00:02:16.439> thing<00:02:16.680> about<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> r3<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.549> liked<00:02:17.930> is

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
one thing about the r3 that I liked is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.699 
one thing about the r3 that I liked is
the<00:02:19.650> fact<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.189> has<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.640> gear<00:02:21.030> indicator

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the fact that it has a gear indicator

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.270 
the fact that it has a gear indicator
which<00:02:22.709> all<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.370> their<00:02:23.489> bikes<00:02:23.760> don't<00:02:24.090> have

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
which all of their bikes don't have

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.970 
which all of their bikes don't have
also<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.820> has<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.000> extra<00:02:27.600> 20<00:02:27.900> cc's<00:02:28.320> compared

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
also it has the extra 20 cc's compared

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.100 
also it has the extra 20 cc's compared
to<00:02:29.100> other<00:02:29.250> bikes

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
to other bikes

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.100 
to other bikes
comparable<00:02:32.160> wait<00:02:35.190> no<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:37.090> wouldn't<00:02:37.300> have<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
comparable wait no you wouldn't have the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.320 
comparable wait no you wouldn't have the
power<00:02:38.319> I<00:02:38.440> needed<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:40.720> do<00:02:40.870> my<00:02:41.080> my<00:02:41.560> head<00:02:41.800> makes<00:02:42.010> it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
power I needed to do my my head makes it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:51.059 
power I needed to do my my head makes it
what<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.360> would<00:02:43.540> also<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:44.110> know<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:51.040> that

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
what it would also you know now that

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.300 
what it would also you know now that
I've<00:02:51.310> been<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:51.670> this<00:02:51.850> might<00:02:52.090> go<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:53.010> had<00:02:54.010> some

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
I've been on this might go and had some

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.050 
I've been on this might go and had some
experience<00:02:54.940> with<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.620> definitely<00:02:57.060> would

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
experience with it I definitely would

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.870 
experience with it I definitely would
say<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.319> I'd<00:02:59.319> love<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.890> get<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.100> bigger<00:03:00.610> bike

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
say that I'd love to get a bigger bike

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.270 
say that I'd love to get a bigger bike
but<00:03:01.840> right<00:03:02.080> now<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.260> can't<00:03:02.590> really<00:03:02.650> afford<00:03:02.920> it

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
but right now I can't really afford it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.360 
but right now I can't really afford it
so<00:03:04.830> that'll<00:03:05.830> have<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.100> wait

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
so that'll have to wait

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:17.930 
so that'll have to wait
which<00:03:07.300> isn't<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.630> problem

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.760 

I<00:03:17.970> didn't<00:03:18.720> really<00:03:18.900> look<00:03:19.050> too<00:03:19.230> much<00:03:19.380> into<00:03:19.440> the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
I didn't really look too much into the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.680 
I didn't really look too much into the
Honda<00:03:20.330> CBR<00:03:21.330> 300<00:03:21.870> because<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:23.550> me<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:24.330> was<00:03:24.510> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
Honda CBR 300 because to me it was the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.490 
Honda CBR 300 because to me it was the
lowest<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.160> three<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:28.140> ninja

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
lowest of the of the three the ninja

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.350 
lowest of the of the three the ninja
really<00:03:28.650> caught<00:03:28.890> my<00:03:29.040> eye<00:03:29.070> for<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.090> couple

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
really caught my eye for a couple

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.450 
really caught my eye for a couple
reasons<00:03:30.510> one<00:03:31.020> because<00:03:31.970> my<00:03:32.970> buddy<00:03:33.680> has<00:03:34.680> one<00:03:34.950> as

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
reasons one because my buddy has one as

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.590 
reasons one because my buddy has one as
a<00:03:35.490> ninja<00:03:35.760> 300<00:03:37.160> another<00:03:38.160> reason<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.760> because<00:03:38.790> it

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
a ninja 300 another reason is because it

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.090 
a ninja 300 another reason is because it
already<00:03:39.810> has<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> lot<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.650> features<00:03:41.070> that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.369 

what<00:04:09.579> it's<00:04:10.579> nice<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:10.849> the<00:04:11.299> ninja<00:04:11.900> 300

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
what it's nice that the ninja 300

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.199 
what it's nice that the ninja 300
already<00:04:12.560> has<00:04:12.829> that<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.340> looks<00:04:16.549> sharp

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
already has that and it looks sharp

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.719 
already has that and it looks sharp
I<00:04:17.590> really<00:04:18.590> like<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:19.039> white<00:04:19.220> white<00:04:19.459> black

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
I really like it the white white black

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.870 
I really like it the white white black
it<00:04:20.000> looks<00:04:20.139> amazing<00:04:23.110> but<00:04:24.110> again<00:04:24.979> it's<00:04:25.729> more

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
it looks amazing but again it's more

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.499 
it looks amazing but again it's more
expensive<00:04:26.330> than<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.740> r3<00:04:28.220> so<00:04:28.940> why<00:04:29.210> would<00:04:29.389> I<00:04:29.449> get

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
expensive than the r3 so why would I get

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.499 
expensive than the r3 so why would I get
a<00:04:29.630> smaller<00:04:30.020> bike<00:04:30.320> for<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.340> same<00:04:31.550> price<00:04:31.880> as<00:04:32.240> I

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
a smaller bike for the same price as I

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.390 
a smaller bike for the same price as I
can<00:04:32.690> get<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.229> one<00:04:33.440> with<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.710> little<00:04:34.009> bit<00:04:34.220> more

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
can get the one with a little bit more

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:45.779 
can get the one with a little bit more
kick<00:04:34.669> I<00:04:41.919> was<00:04:42.919> also<00:04:43.280> looking<00:04:43.460> at<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:44.090> Dr<00:04:44.990> 200

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
kick I was also looking at a Dr 200

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.680 
kick I was also looking at a Dr 200
because<00:04:46.789> I<00:04:46.820> like<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.449> idea<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:49.479> having<00:04:50.479> a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690

nice hmm very pretty
I<00:04:57.699> like<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:58.820> idea<00:04:58.909> of<00:04:59.120> having<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.539> vehicle<00:04:59.900> that

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
I like the idea of having a vehicle that

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.120 
I like the idea of having a vehicle that
can<00:05:00.169> take<00:05:00.349> me<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.530> road<00:05:00.949> or<00:05:01.070> off<00:05:01.130> road<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:03.130> the

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
dr 200 is kind of like an ideal bug-out

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.700 
dr 200 is kind of like an ideal bug-out
vehicle<00:05:07.570> for<00:05:08.570> all<00:05:08.690> my<00:05:08.840> Preppers

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.090 

but<00:05:12.710> again<00:05:13.550> that's<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:14.030> same<00:05:14.470> same<00:05:15.470> price<00:05:15.770> as

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
but again that's the same same price as

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.650 
but again that's the same same price as
a<00:05:16.670> brand<00:05:17.540> new<00:05:17.630> is<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.590> same<00:05:18.800> price<00:05:19.070> as<00:05:19.280> a

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
a brand new is the same price as a

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.220 
a brand new is the same price as a
Yamaha<00:05:20.660> r3<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.710> r3<00:05:22.370> comes<00:05:22.640> with<00:05:23.230> fuel

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
Yamaha r3 and the r3 comes with fuel

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.290 
Yamaha r3 and the r3 comes with fuel
injection<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:25.100> all<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.370> latest<00:05:25.670> technology

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
injection and all the latest technology

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.410 
injection and all the latest technology
that<00:05:26.570> you<00:05:26.720> don't<00:05:26.930> really<00:05:27.080> find<00:05:27.410> in<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:28.580> dr<00:05:28.880> 200

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
that you don't really find in the dr 200

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.530 
that you don't really find in the dr 200
it's<00:05:29.570> still<00:05:29.810> carbureted<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:33.500> all<00:05:33.650> that<00:05:34.540> so

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
it's still carbureted and all that so

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.920 
it's still carbureted and all that so
that<00:05:36.310> led<00:05:37.310> me<00:05:37.340> towards<00:05:37.940> choosing<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.420> r3<00:05:38.810> as

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
that led me towards choosing the r3 as

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.140 
that led me towards choosing the r3 as
well

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
well

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.080 
well
and<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:40.870> figured<00:05:41.290> that<00:05:41.320> if<00:05:41.830> I<00:05:41.979> ever<00:05:42.100> resell<00:05:42.790> this

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
and I figured that if I ever resell this

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.670 
and I figured that if I ever resell this
it<00:05:43.330> would<00:05:43.449> give<00:05:43.600> me<00:05:43.750> a<00:05:43.780> little<00:05:44.410> bit<00:05:44.530> of<00:05:44.590> an

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
it would give me a little bit of an

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680 
it would give me a little bit of an
easier<00:05:45.040> task

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
easier task

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.040 
easier task
if<00:05:48.200> I<00:05:48.350> ever<00:05:48.470> wanted<00:05:48.800> to<00:05:48.860> buy<00:05:49.100> a<00:05:49.130> used<00:05:49.720> 2015<00:05:50.720> t.r

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
if I ever wanted to buy a used 2015 t.r

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.590 
if I ever wanted to buy a used 2015 t.r
200<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:52.010> think<00:05:52.370> I'd<00:05:52.760> be<00:05:52.910> able<00:05:53.030> to<00:05:53.120> find<00:05:53.270> a<00:05:53.420> really

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
200 I think I'd be able to find a really

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.720 
200 I think I'd be able to find a really
good<00:05:53.720> price<00:05:53.960> on<00:05:54.140> that

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:05.100 

moreso<00:05:58.730> than<00:05:58.760> buying<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.420> dr<00:05:59.660> 201st<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:04.030> in

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
moreso than buying the dr 201st and in

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.720 
moreso than buying the dr 201st and in
buying<00:06:06.110> an<00:06:06.260> r3<00:06:06.770> used<00:06:07.010> which<00:06:07.430> would<00:06:07.580> probably

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
buying an r3 used which would probably

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.749 
buying an r3 used which would probably
cost<00:06:08.090> me<00:06:08.300> more

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.640 

if<00:06:11.969> you<00:06:12.270> guys<00:06:12.419> have<00:06:12.719> any<00:06:12.870> questions<00:06:13.349> about<00:06:13.439> the
