00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
happens on the hi-hat and I throw it in

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.230 
happens on the hi-hat and I throw it in
here<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.380> there<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.770> fits<00:01:21.100> nice<00:01:21.490> when<00:01:22.119> you're

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
using the cross stick because the cross

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.149

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.770 
motion with my arm and i'm producing two
sounds<00:02:26.010> out<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:27.150> not<00:02:27.300> with<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> bounce

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
sounds out of it but not with a bounce

sounds out of it but not with a bounce
and<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.590> with<00:02:28.710> two<00:02:28.890> arm<00:02:29.070> motions<00:02:29.570> that's<00:02:30.570> how

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and not with two arm motions that's how

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.480 
and not with two arm motions that's how
you<00:02:30.780> get<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.140> technique<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:32.220> that's<00:02:32.430> how

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490

you get this lick to sound really fast
as<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.850> use<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.240> technique<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.810> technique

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
as you use that technique that technique

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.590 
as you use that technique that technique
can<00:02:37.350> be<00:02:37.380> used<00:02:37.500> elsewhere<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.580> use<00:02:39.570> that
