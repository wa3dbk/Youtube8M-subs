00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
take a look at the stock tire and I'll

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.340 
take a look at the stock tire and I'll
show<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.580> guys<00:01:05.880> exactly<00:01:06.119> why<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> decided<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
show you guys exactly why I decided to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
show you guys exactly why I decided to
change<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.580> here's<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> look<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
change them so here's a look at the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.320 
change them so here's a look at the
stock<00:01:09.990> tire<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:11.070> comes<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> pretty<00:01:11.850> decent

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
stock tire it comes in a pretty decent

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.770 
stock tire it comes in a pretty decent
design<00:01:13.369> almost<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> blockade<00:01:15.299> these

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
design almost like the blockade these

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.469 
design almost like the blockade these
are<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.259> larger<00:01:16.979> blocks<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.640> good

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
are a little bit larger blocks on good

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.469 
are a little bit larger blocks on good
side<00:01:18.810> design<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> firm<00:01:20.759> compound

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
side design but really a firm compound

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
side design but really a firm compound
these<00:01:22.020> things<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.619> designed<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> do

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
these things are designed to do

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.510 
these things are designed to do
everything<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.500> RTR<00:01:26.009> customer<00:01:26.460> is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
everything so if that RTR customer is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
everything so if that RTR customer is
going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> run<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.330> pavement<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:28.200> will

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
going to run it on pavement these will

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710 
going to run it on pavement these will
last<00:01:28.530> pretty<00:01:28.829> long<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:30.030> run<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.390> dirt

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
last pretty long if you run it on dirt

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.580 
last pretty long if you run it on dirt
you<00:01:31.650> won't<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> best<00:01:32.369> traction<00:01:32.700> so

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
you won't have the best traction so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.870 
you won't have the best traction so
other<00:01:34.590> thing<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.979> had<00:01:35.159> an<00:01:35.340> issue<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.700> these

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
other thing I had an issue with these

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.780 
other thing I had an issue with these
they<00:01:36.479> are<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.659> spoke<00:01:37.140> designed<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.979> looks<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
they are a spoke designed for looks and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.810 
they are a spoke designed for looks and
I<00:01:39.329> did<00:01:39.600> end<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.990> cracking<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.579> these

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
I did end up cracking one of these

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.060 
I did end up cracking one of these
spokes<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> clean

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
spokes right here you can see a clean

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.679 
spokes right here you can see a clean
the<00:01:44.250> crack<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> way<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> spoke

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the crack all the way through the spoke

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.289 
the crack all the way through the spoke
although<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> won't<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.759> deter<00:01:48.119> from

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
although it won't you know deter from

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.240 
although it won't you know deter from
the<00:01:48.390> performance<00:01:48.780> right<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.049> later<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.040> down

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the performance right now later on down

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
the performance right now later on down
the<00:01:50.310> line<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.030> start<00:01:51.270> breaking<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the line as I start breaking more and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.399 
the line as I start breaking more and
more<00:01:52.140> spokes<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> 6's<00:01:53.520> power<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.899> may

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
more spokes with that 6's power I may

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.929 
more spokes with that 6's power I may
have<00:01:55.619> issues<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.430> want<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> kind<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:58.700> stop<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
have issues so want to kind of stop the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209 
have issues so want to kind of stop the
horse<00:02:00.180> before<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.630> gets<00:02:00.780> over<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.649> actual

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
horse before it gets over the actual

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.569 
horse before it gets over the actual
bridge<00:02:03.090> there<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.689> other<00:02:04.500> thing<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.950> decided<00:02:05.369> to

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
bridge there so other thing I decided to

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.330 
bridge there so other thing I decided to
do<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:06.000> instead<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> 3.8<00:02:07.409> inch<00:02:07.439> wheel<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
do was instead of the 3.8 inch wheel I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.240 
do was instead of the 3.8 inch wheel I
went<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.390> new<00:02:09.569> VTR<00:02:10.170> wheel<00:02:10.379> from<00:02:10.860> proline

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
went with the new VTR wheel from proline

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.850 
went with the new VTR wheel from proline
Racing<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.239> here's<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> look<00:02:13.080> at<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.379> model

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
Racing so here's a look at the model

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.800 
Racing so here's a look at the model
and<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.340> all<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.910> specs<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.390> these<00:02:15.600> new

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and also all the specs of these new

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.390 
and also all the specs of these new
blockade<00:02:16.380> tires<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.490> VTR<00:02:17.880> dish<00:02:18.240> wheels

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
blockade tires on the VTR dish wheels

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.820 
blockade tires on the VTR dish wheels
VTR<00:02:20.400> basically<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.510> their<00:02:21.690> newest<00:02:22.140> velocity

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
VTR basically is their newest velocity

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.630 
VTR basically is their newest velocity
type<00:02:23.130> dish<00:02:23.940> wheel<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.920> 4.0<00:02:25.920> inches<00:02:26.490> in

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
type dish wheel that is 4.0 inches in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600 
type dish wheel that is 4.0 inches in
height<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.600> you're<00:02:28.170> gaining<00:02:28.500> about<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.040> quarter

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
height so you're gaining about a quarter

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.050 
height so you're gaining about a quarter
inch<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:30.600> height<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> wheel<00:02:31.860> thus<00:02:32.610> making

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
inch in height of the wheel thus making

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.600 
inch in height of the wheel thus making
your<00:02:33.450> tire<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.290> little<00:02:34.620> bit<00:02:34.770> more<00:02:34.920> low-profile

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
your tire a little bit more low-profile

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.260 
your tire a little bit more low-profile
that<00:02:36.300> means<00:02:36.510> better<00:02:36.840> cornering<00:02:37.400> less<00:02:38.400> you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
that means better cornering less you

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.710 
that means better cornering less you
know<00:02:39.709> foam<00:02:40.709> inside<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.220> tire<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.790> all<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.600> all

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
know foam inside the tire and all in all

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.100 
know foam inside the tire and all in all
you're<00:02:43.200> gonna<00:02:43.380> get<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.590> better<00:02:43.830> ride<00:02:44.810> these<00:02:45.810> are

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you're gonna get a better ride these are

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.590 
you're gonna get a better ride these are
the<00:02:46.320> 1h<00:02:46.590> scaled<00:02:46.890> truggy<00:02:47.280> tires<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.390> wheels

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
the 1h scaled truggy tires and wheels

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.440 
the 1h scaled truggy tires and wheels
they're<00:02:49.260> pre-mounted<00:02:49.970> they<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> zero

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
they're pre-mounted they are a zero

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.540 
they're pre-mounted they are a zero
offset<00:02:51.720> as<00:02:52.110> far<00:02:52.290> as<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.500> wheels<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.340> these

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
offset as far as the wheels and these

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.960 
offset as far as the wheels and these
are<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.959> x3<00:02:54.959> compound<00:02:55.620> which<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:55.830> soft<00:02:56.340> now

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
are the x3 compound which is soft now

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.930 
are the x3 compound which is soft now
the<00:02:57.450> softer<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.590> go<00:02:58.770> with<00:02:59.070> your<00:02:59.190> compounds

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
the softer you go with your compounds

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.820 
the softer you go with your compounds
the<00:03:00.330> better<00:03:00.540> traction<00:03:00.870> you'll<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.320> but<00:03:01.709> your

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the better traction you'll have but your

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.740 
the better traction you'll have but your
tires<00:03:02.160> will<00:03:02.880> end<00:03:03.000> up<00:03:03.090> wearing<00:03:03.300> out<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> little

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
tires will end up wearing out a little

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.330 
tires will end up wearing out a little
bit<00:03:03.930> quicker<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.440> keep<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:04.860> mind<00:03:05.160> when

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
bit quicker so keep that in mind when

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.229 
bit quicker so keep that in mind when
you<00:03:05.459> aren't<00:03:05.610> ordering

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
up and feeling the great compound

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.500 
up and feeling the great compound
they're<00:04:03.600> super<00:04:04.230> tacky<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.120> these<00:04:06.120> things<00:04:06.360> are

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
they're super tacky and these things are

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.979 
they're super tacky and these things are
gonna<00:04:06.630> do<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.650> great<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.190> this<00:04:08.670> tallien<00:04:09.330> now<00:04:09.959> I

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
gonna do so great on this tallien now I

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.800 
gonna do so great on this tallien now I
went<00:04:10.860> ahead<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.160> measured<00:04:11.370> up<00:04:11.760> like<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:12.570> said

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
went ahead and measured up like we said

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.780 
went ahead and measured up like we said
earlier<00:04:13.190> measured<00:04:14.190> up<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> rear<00:04:14.549> now

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
earlier measured up the rear now

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.539 
earlier measured up the rear now
remember<00:04:15.239> stock<00:04:15.630> rear<00:04:15.870> was<00:04:16.079> 16<00:04:16.590> stock<00:04:17.220> front

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
remember stock rear was 16 stock front

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.509 
remember stock rear was 16 stock front
was<00:04:17.729> 16<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.359> quarter<00:04:18.690> inches<00:04:19.019> from<00:04:19.919> end<00:04:20.160> to

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
was 16 and a quarter inches from end to

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.240 
was 16 and a quarter inches from end to
end<00:04:21.049> now<00:04:22.049> it's<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.320> little<00:04:22.560> bit<00:04:22.680> different<00:04:23.070> it's

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
end now it's a little bit different it's

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.270 
end now it's a little bit different it's
16<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.910> quarter<00:04:24.270> by<00:04:24.419> 16<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.620> half<00:04:25.919> so<00:04:26.250> a

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
16 and a quarter by 16 and a half so a

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.710 
16 and a quarter by 16 and a half so a
little<00:04:26.550> bit<00:04:26.640> wider<00:04:27.030> truck

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
little bit wider truck

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.720 
little bit wider truck
now<00:04:27.780> you've<00:04:28.500> gained<00:04:28.770> about<00:04:29.010> an<00:04:29.130> eighth<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.610> an

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
now you've gained about an eighth of an

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.240 
now you've gained about an eighth of an
inch<00:04:30.000> on<00:04:30.360> each<00:04:30.630> corner<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.860> that's<00:04:32.040> gonna

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
inch on each corner and that's gonna

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.950 
inch on each corner and that's gonna
give<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.700> little<00:04:32.970> bit<00:04:33.150> better<00:04:33.300> turning

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
give you a little bit better turning

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.670 
give you a little bit better turning
less<00:04:34.800> rollover<00:04:35.540> it's<00:04:36.540> gonna<00:04:36.720> basically<00:04:36.990> sink

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
less rollover it's gonna basically sink

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.040 
less rollover it's gonna basically sink
your<00:04:37.860> car<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.400> little<00:04:38.670> bit<00:04:38.960> for<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:39.990> little

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
your car in a little bit for a little

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.050 
your car in a little bit for a little
bit<00:04:40.380> lower<00:04:40.740> center<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.310> gravity<00:04:41.430> which<00:04:42.030> is

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
bit lower center of gravity which is

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.970 
bit lower center of gravity which is
pretty<00:04:42.450> cool<00:04:42.840> performance-wise

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
pretty cool performance-wise

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.950 
pretty cool performance-wise
now<00:04:44.700> another<00:04:44.880> thing<00:04:45.000> I<00:04:45.210> noticed<00:04:45.540> was<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.780> went

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.720 
ahead and I weighed in two of these
stock<00:04:48.030> wheel<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:48.960> tires<00:04:49.250> these<00:04:50.250> things<00:04:50.490> came

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
stock wheel and tires these things came

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.130 
stock wheel and tires these things came
in<00:04:50.880> at<00:04:51.170> 14.5<00:04:52.170> 2<00:04:52.470> ounces<00:04:52.980> I<00:04:53.280> weighed<00:04:54.090> in<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.750> new

upgraded proline wheels and tires two of

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.200 
upgraded proline wheels and tires two of
them<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.140> they<00:04:58.620> came<00:04:58.890> in<00:04:59.100> at<00:04:59.250> right<00:04:59.490> around<00:04:59.700> 7

or 12 point 7 2 on PSA's so you're
gaining<00:05:04.110> not<00:05:04.860> only<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.400> performance<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.120> the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
gaining not only the performance of the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.600 
gaining not only the performance of the
wider<00:05:06.450> track<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.470> traction<00:05:07.920> of<00:05:08.460> these

wider track and the traction of these

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.120 
wider track and the traction of these
great<00:05:09.000> Blockade<00:05:09.750> tires<00:05:10.140> but<00:05:10.920> you're<00:05:11.040> also

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
great Blockade tires but you're also

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.400 
great Blockade tires but you're also
getting<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.940> little<00:05:11.970> bit<00:05:12.360> benefit<00:05:12.870> from<00:05:13.200> the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
getting it a little bit benefit from the

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.350 
getting it a little bit benefit from the
power<00:05:13.680> department<00:05:14.430> you're<00:05:14.970> gonna<00:05:15.120> get<00:05:15.300> a

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
power department you're gonna get a

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.350 
power department you're gonna get a
little<00:05:15.510> bit<00:05:15.630> better<00:05:15.950> start<00:05:16.950> up<00:05:17.070> speed<00:05:17.430> up<00:05:17.970> to

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
little bit better start up speed up to

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.870 
little bit better start up speed up to
speed<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:19.020> in<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.919> end<00:05:20.130> you're<00:05:20.460> gonna<00:05:20.550> put

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
speed and in the end you're gonna put

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.200 
speed and in the end you're gonna put
less<00:05:21.090> stress<00:05:21.120> on<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.870> motor<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:22.470> ESC<00:05:23.210> thus

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
less stress on that motor and ESC thus

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.170 
less stress on that motor and ESC thus
better<00:05:25.020> performance<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:25.860> well<00:05:26.460> guys<00:05:26.640> that<00:05:27.000> is

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
better performance so well guys that is

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.330 
better performance so well guys that is
going<00:05:27.360> to<00:05:27.419> be<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.720> for<00:05:27.750> my<00:05:28.169> proline<00:05:28.740> upgrade

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
going to be it for my proline upgrade

for the Italian I can't wait to get this

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.290 
for the Italian I can't wait to get this
thing<00:05:31.710> on<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.100> track<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.669> see<00:05:32.880> how<00:05:33.120> this

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
thing on the track and see how this
