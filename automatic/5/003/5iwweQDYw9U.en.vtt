guys<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.320> new<00:00:25.560> toy

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
guys have a new toy

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
guys have a new toy
that's<00:00:26.369> gonna<00:00:26.519> help<00:00:26.699> us<00:00:26.849> monitor<00:00:27.090> turbos<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
that's gonna help us monitor turbos in a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.240 
that's gonna help us monitor turbos in a
new<00:00:28.080> way<00:00:28.230> tell<00:00:28.529> me<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> little<00:00:28.769> bit<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
new way tell me a little bit about it

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.609 
new way tell me a little bit about it
that's<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.990> new<00:00:31.140> waste

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that's right we have the the new waste

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.319 
that's right we have the the new waste
gate<00:00:31.800> position<00:00:32.189> sensor<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.730> lot<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.000> times

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
gate position sensor a lot of times

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.030 
gate position sensor a lot of times
everybody's<00:00:34.140> monitoring<00:00:34.590> their<00:00:34.710> pressures

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
everybody's monitoring their pressures

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.380 
everybody's monitoring their pressures
on<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> wastegate<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.790> they're<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:36.030> doing

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
on the wastegate but they're not doing

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.229 
on the wastegate but they're not doing
the<00:00:36.510> actual<00:00:37.160> actuation<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.700> waste<00:00:39.030> gates

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the actual actuation of the waste gates

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.299 
the actual actuation of the waste gates
so<00:00:39.420> now<00:00:39.719> we're<00:00:40.110> actually<00:00:40.230> looking<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
so now we're actually looking at the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
so now we're actually looking at the
position<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.420> pressure<00:00:42.600> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
position not just the pressure so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.229 
position not just the pressure so
monitoring<00:00:43.890> position<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:44.789> pressure

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
monitoring position not just pressure

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.670 
monitoring position not just pressure
now<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.660> kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.960> information<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.559> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
now what kind of information is that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
now what kind of information is that
giving<00:00:46.980> well<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.850> actually<00:00:48.030> gonna<00:00:48.450> give<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
giving well it's actually gonna give you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.150 
giving well it's actually gonna give you
some<00:00:48.870> unique<00:00:49.020> stuff<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.500> lot<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.649> people<00:00:49.739> don't

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
some unique stuff a lot of people don't

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
some unique stuff a lot of people don't
realize<00:00:50.399> what's<00:00:51.090> actually<00:00:51.300> happening<00:00:51.840> within

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
realize what's actually happening within

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
realize what's actually happening within
the<00:00:52.320> waste<00:00:52.469> gate<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.920> everybody<00:00:53.520> thinks<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the waste gate so everybody thinks that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.549 
the waste gate so everybody thinks that
the<00:00:54.090> pressure<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.989> important<00:00:55.379> part

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the pressure is just the important part

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.020 
the pressure is just the important part
but<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.100> position<00:00:56.550> makes<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> lot<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
but the position makes a lot of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.400 
but the position makes a lot of
difference<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.510> we're<00:00:57.629> finding<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
difference and we're finding a lot of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
difference and we're finding a lot of
interesting<00:00:58.890> things<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.609> with<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> new

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
interesting things with with the new

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
interesting things with with the new
sensor<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.980> cameron<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.579> brought<00:01:02.730> up

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
sensor so so cameron you just brought up

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
sensor so so cameron you just brought up
v-net<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.480> understand<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> guys<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.290> a

anything that we offer vena Don we now
have<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.470> new<00:01:10.530> module<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> GPS<00:01:11.909> base

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
have this new module that's a GPS base

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.030 
have this new module that's a GPS base
that<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.780> speed<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.290> anything
