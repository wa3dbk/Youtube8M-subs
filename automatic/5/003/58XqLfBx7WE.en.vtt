00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
so today I'll be unboxing and having a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.100 
so today I'll be unboxing and having a
quick<00:00:02.550> look<00:00:02.610> at<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.090> course<00:00:03.120> air<00:00:03.480> power<00:00:03.659> supply

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
quick look at of course air power supply

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.450 
quick look at of course air power supply
it's<00:00:04.319> not<00:00:04.500> particularly<00:00:04.950> new<00:00:05.430> or

just<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.649> mix<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:49.980> 750<00:00:50.640> watt<00:00:50.940> power

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
just the right mix for 750 watt power

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.459 
just the right mix for 750 watt power
supply<00:00:51.270> considering<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.199> you'd<00:00:52.320> be

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
supply considering what you'd be

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.380 
supply considering what you'd be
plugging<00:00:52.680> into<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.030> side

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
plugging into it then on the other side

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
plugging into it then on the other side
of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> box<00:00:54.840> you've<00:00:55.079> got<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> general<00:00:55.649> specs

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
of the box you've got the general specs

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.170 
of the box you've got the general specs
so<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.440> single<00:00:58.440> 12<00:00:58.890> volt<00:00:59.309> rail<00:00:59.820> power

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so this is a single 12 volt rail power

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
so this is a single 12 volt rail power
supply<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> 60<00:01:01.590> amp<00:01:01.770> 12<00:01:02.070> volt<00:01:02.309> rail<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
supply so that's a 60 amp 12 volt rail a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
supply so that's a 60 amp 12 volt rail a
lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.420> people<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.619> it's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
lot of people like to see that and it's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
lot of people like to see that and it's
a<00:01:04.920> no-nonsense<00:01:05.100> sort<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> approach<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.510> terms

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
a no-nonsense sort of approach in terms

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.960 
a no-nonsense sort of approach in terms
of<00:01:07.500> noise<00:01:07.770> level<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
of noise level you can see that the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
of noise level you can see that the
decibels<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.659> rated<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> curve<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.500> can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
decibels are rated on a curve you can

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
decibels are rated on a curve you can

part<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.930> their<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.380> know<00:02:33.410> sort<00:02:33.770> of

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
part of their you know sort of

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.410 
part of their you know sort of
no-nonsense<00:02:34.220> approaches<00:02:35.030> they've<00:02:35.180> always

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
no-nonsense approaches they've always

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.110 
no-nonsense approaches they've always
got<00:02:36.010> reasonably<00:02:37.010> long<00:02:37.250> cables<00:02:37.790> attached<00:02:38.090> to

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
got reasonably long cables attached to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.600 
got reasonably long cables attached to
their<00:02:38.420> power<00:02:38.630> supply<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:39.380> every<00:02:40.220> one<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.459> these

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
their power supply so every one of these

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.880 
their power supply so every one of these
cables<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.540> gonna<00:02:41.810> be<00:02:41.959> nice<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.470> long<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:42.860> that

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
cables is gonna be nice and long so that

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.580 
cables is gonna be nice and long so that
means<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.340> could<00:02:43.490> potentially<00:02:44.060> use<00:02:44.270> it<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:45.410> an
