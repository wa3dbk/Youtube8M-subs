and this will take a few minutes okay
now<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:13.739> done<00:02:14.209> converting<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.630> an<00:02:15.720> ISO<00:02:15.989> file

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
now it's done converting to an ISO file

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.759 
now it's done converting to an ISO file
but<00:02:17.100> as<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.489> see<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.910> has<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.810> dot<00:02:19.170> CDR

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769

but as you can see it has this dot CDR
extension<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.489> it

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
extension on it

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.120 
extension on it
so<00:02:21.000> let's<00:02:21.420> rename<00:02:22.049> that<00:02:22.380> by<00:02:22.950> typing<00:02:23.220> M<00:02:23.640> V<00:02:24.799> win<00:02:25.799> 8

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
so let's rename that by typing M V win 8

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:37.789 
so let's rename that by typing M V win 8
-<00:02:26.820> 32<00:02:27.690> .<00:02:28.049> iso<00:02:28.850> CDR<00:02:31.070> -<00:02:32.070> who<00:02:32.459> ate<00:02:33.420> -<00:02:33.810> 32<00:02:34.700> .<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.799> then

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
- 32 . iso CDR - who ate - 32 . so then

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.199 
- 32 . iso CDR - who ate - 32 . so then
hit<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.100> enter<00:02:38.130> key<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:40.049> now<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.709> can<00:02:40.799> see
