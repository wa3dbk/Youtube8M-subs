00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
three of the angles are covered you're

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.270 
three of the angles are covered you're
not<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.590> far<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
not going to get very far with that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
not going to get very far with that
right<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.660> starting<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> clear<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.199> now

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
right so it's starting to clear out now

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
right so it's starting to clear out now
the<00:00:52.890> reason<00:00:53.280> why<00:00:53.399> i<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> AS<00:00:54.000> val<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the reason why i like the AS val is it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
the reason why i like the AS val is it
is<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.530> lethal<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> high<00:00:56.550> rate<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> fire<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
is just lethal the high rate of fire and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.290 
is just lethal the high rate of fire and
its<00:00:57.690> silence<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> comes<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> handy<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.460> 64

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
its silence so that comes in handy in 64

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.279 
its silence so that comes in handy in 64
man<00:01:00.449> does<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.840> help<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.199> a

low<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.149> those<00:02:00.299> situations<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.110> they're

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
low in those situations because they're

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.319 
low in those situations because they're
probably<00:02:01.500> hiding<00:02:01.890> underneath<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:02.759> boxes

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
probably hiding underneath these boxes

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.270 
probably hiding underneath these boxes
which<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.320> definitely<00:02:04.530> shoot<00:02:04.950> through

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
which you can definitely shoot through

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950
