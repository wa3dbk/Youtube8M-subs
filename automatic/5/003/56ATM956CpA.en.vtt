00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
this is called larger than life and what

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.790 
this is called larger than life and what
I'm<00:03:31.910> gonna<00:03:32.000> do<00:03:32.209> with<00:03:32.330> this<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.660> just<00:03:32.870> line<00:03:33.140> my

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
I'm gonna do with this is just line my

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.960 
I'm gonna do with this is just line my
lash<00:03:34.130> line<00:03:34.160> basically

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
lash line basically

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.449 
lash line basically
so<00:03:35.600> my<00:03:36.050> lashes<00:03:36.320> have<00:03:36.740> something<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.220> blend

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
so my lashes have something to blend

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.160 
so my lashes have something to blend
into<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:38.180> could<00:03:38.300> skip<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:38.630> part<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.080> don't

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
into you could skip this part you don't

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.050 
into you could skip this part you don't
really<00:03:39.560> have<00:03:39.770> to<00:03:39.950> line<00:03:40.250> them<00:03:40.550> you<00:03:40.670> could<00:03:40.850> put

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
really have to line them you could put

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.540 
really have to line them you could put
flashes<00:03:41.480> without<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:42.890> thought<00:03:43.430> my

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.340 
flashes without it so I thought my
lashes<00:03:43.760> off-camera<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.630> those<00:03:44.900> are<00:03:45.080> really

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
me so like I said for any thing it's

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.490 
me so like I said for any thing it's
just<00:06:30.300> because<00:06:30.450> I'm<00:06:30.570> a<00:06:30.630> little<00:06:30.660> too<00:06:30.930> tan<00:06:31.230> right

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
just because I'm a little too tan right

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.909 
just because I'm a little too tan right
now<00:06:31.680> but<00:06:32.840> that's<00:06:33.840> why<00:06:34.020> I'm<00:06:34.140> mixing<00:06:34.530> it<00:06:34.680> with

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
the Kat Von D Lolita because it makes it

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.450 
the Kat Von D Lolita because it makes it
look<00:06:37.050> a<00:06:37.140> little<00:06:37.320> bit<00:06:37.560> more

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
look a little bit more

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.029 
look a little bit more
but<00:06:38.610> it<00:06:38.699> gives<00:06:38.880> it<00:06:39.000> some<00:06:39.180> more<00:06:39.360> color<00:06:39.780> so<00:06:40.199> I've

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
but it gives it some more color so I've

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.879
