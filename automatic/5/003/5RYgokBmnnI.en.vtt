it's really difficult

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.560 
it's really difficult
acting<00:00:25.980> underwater<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.390> never

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
acting underwater because you you never

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
acting underwater because you you never
know<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> camera<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.439> getting<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> from

the<00:00:29.310> right<00:00:29.400> angle<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.539> never<00:00:30.720> know<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.109> if

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the right angle you never know if if

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.290 
the right angle you never know if if
your<00:00:32.070> hair<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.340> doing<00:00:32.580> what<00:00:32.699> you<00:00:32.790> wanted<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.150> do

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
with it's it's always really tricky tell

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.009 
with it's it's always really tricky tell
me<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> results<00:00:36.600> afterwards

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
me when you see the results afterwards

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.500 
me when you see the results afterwards
that<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.199> can<00:00:37.410> say<00:00:37.589> if<00:00:37.739> you've<00:00:37.969> done<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.420> you

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.139 

especially<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> last<00:00:47.579> video<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
especially for the last video with the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.180 
especially for the last video with the
cool<00:00:48.329> fishtail

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
cool fishtail

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.470 
cool fishtail
there<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> very<00:00:50.550> tricky<00:00:50.789> shot<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.300> there

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there was a very tricky shot in there

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
there was a very tricky shot in there
that<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.719> wanted<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.019> do<00:00:52.280> where<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.579> girl<00:00:53.940> was

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that I wanted to do where the girl was

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.430 
that I wanted to do where the girl was
just<00:00:54.329> sort<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.540> floating<00:00:55.019> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> water<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
just sort of floating in the water and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
just sort of floating in the water and
there<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:55.769> blood<00:00:55.920> coming<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.339> her<00:00:56.489> mouth

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
there was blood coming out of her mouth

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.529 
there was blood coming out of her mouth
and<00:00:57.410> that<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.649> hard<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.640> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and that was really hard because in the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.030 
and that was really hard because in the
water<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.170> usually<00:01:01.350> breathe<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.860> when

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
water I have to usually breathe out when

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.540 
water I have to usually breathe out when
I'm<00:01:02.159> swimming

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I'm swimming

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.820 
I'm swimming
so<00:01:03.089> that<00:01:03.239> out<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.629> don't<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> fight<00:01:04.649> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so that out I don't have to fight to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.249 
so that out I don't have to fight to
stay<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.070> water<00:01:05.540> but<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.570> didn't<00:01:06.960> work<00:01:06.990> for

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
stay on water but that didn't work for

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.499 
stay on water but that didn't work for
that<00:01:07.380> shelf<00:01:07.649> so<00:01:07.860> Eric<00:01:08.369> had<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> actually<00:01:09.030> hold

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
that shelf so Eric had to actually hold

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.320 
that shelf so Eric had to actually hold
me<00:01:09.720> down<00:01:09.899> in<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.190> water<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.180> could

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
me down in the water just so we could

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
me down in the water just so we could
get<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.630> shot<00:01:12.810> right<00:01:13.049> before<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.649> would<00:01:13.860> float

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
get the shot right before I would float

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.660 
get the shot right before I would float
back<00:01:14.220> up

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
back up

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
back up
I<00:01:14.780> must<00:01:15.780> look<00:01:15.930> pretty<00:01:16.200> weird<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> people

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I must look pretty weird for the people

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.680 
I must look pretty weird for the people
around<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.729> because<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.270> were<00:01:18.330> sort<00:01:18.660> of

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
around there because they were sort of

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.279 
around there because they were sort of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
because all they were seeing was the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600 
because all they were seeing was the
girl<00:01:21.690> being<00:01:21.990> held<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.380> by<00:01:22.410> a<00:01:22.649> guy<00:01:22.740> underwater

running<00:01:25.500> from<00:01:25.710> her<00:01:25.800> face<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.850> pretty

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
running from her face so it was pretty

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.050

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
takes to catch my breath and Carl would

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
takes to catch my breath and Carl would
come<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> surface<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.090> tell<00:01:51.329> me<00:01:51.450> what

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
