level 5 exp chips which is going to be

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.380 
level 5 exp chips which is going to be
you<00:02:13.050> can<00:02:13.200> get<00:02:13.349> 100

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
you can get 100

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.039 
you can get 100
and<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:16.260> some<00:02:16.469> other<00:02:16.560> stuff<00:02:16.980> ooh<00:02:18.049> the
