00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
spring in our step into the squad try

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.220 
spring in our step into the squad try
and<00:00:52.399> bring<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:52.699> fact<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:52.969> we've<00:00:53.230> achieved

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and bring the fact that we've achieved

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.660 
and bring the fact that we've achieved
something<00:00:54.679> this<00:00:54.859> year<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.339> I've<00:00:55.489> some

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
something this year and I've some

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.610 
something this year and I've some
potentially<00:00:56.390> against<00:00:56.780> odds<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:57.050> sometimes

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
potentially against odds that sometimes

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.810 
potentially against odds that sometimes
and<00:00:57.890> maybe<00:00:57.920> that's<00:00:58.280> what<00:00:58.399> England<00:00:58.609> I'll<00:00:58.699> be

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
and maybe that's what England I'll be

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.310 
and maybe that's what England I'll be
against<00:00:59.120> odds<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.329> little<00:00:59.359> bit<00:00:59.660> so<00:00:59.839> there's

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
against odds a little bit so there's

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.750 
against odds a little bit so there's
nothing<00:01:00.589> wrong<00:01:00.710> with<00:01:00.769> that<00:01:00.980> feeling<00:01:01.429> as<00:01:01.609> long

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
nothing wrong with that feeling as long

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.369 
nothing wrong with that feeling as long
as<00:01:01.879> we<00:01:01.999> focus<00:01:02.210> as<00:01:02.539> a<00:01:02.570> group<00:01:02.839> but<00:01:02.989> if<00:01:03.109> we<00:01:03.230> can

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
as we focus as a group but if we can

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.810

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.210 
years been seen as one of the top
nations<00:01:59.470> but<00:01:59.619> when<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.860> think<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.130> the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
nations but when you think of the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
around Europe at the moment in their

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
around Europe at the moment in their
team<00:02:03.910> then<00:02:04.090> they're<00:02:04.210> going<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.510> very

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
team then they're going to be a very

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.990 
team then they're going to be a very
tough<00:02:04.960> game<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.800> see<00:02:06.010> we<00:02:06.130> go<00:02:06.250> down<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.610> a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
tough game you see we go down to that a

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.480 
tough game you see we go down to that a
few<00:02:07.479> years<00:02:07.600> with<00:02:07.780> England<00:02:08.110> what<00:02:08.860> crucially

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
few years with England what crucially

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.699 
few years with England what crucially
needs<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.179> be<00:02:10.300> different<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:10.840> time<00:02:10.899> for<00:02:11.620> it

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
needs to be different this time for it

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.370 
needs to be different this time for it
to<00:02:11.739> go<00:02:11.950> better<00:02:12.600> well<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.630> think<00:02:14.050> it's<00:02:14.320> about

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
to go better well I think it's about

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.840 
to go better well I think it's about
different<00:02:14.860> web<00:02:14.950> heads<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.370> say<00:02:15.550> we've<00:02:15.700> had

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
different web heads as you say we've had

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.970 
different web heads as you say we've had
some<00:02:16.030> good<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.420> well<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.110> we<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.620> how<00:02:17.830> it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
some good as well so that we know how it

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.110 
some good as well so that we know how it
feels<00:02:18.190> when<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.430> get<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.730> roll<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
feels when you get on a roll in a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.280 
feels when you get on a roll in a
tournament<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.630> you're<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:19.900> pretty<00:02:20.170> well

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
tournament and you're going pretty well

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.840 
tournament and you're going pretty well
and<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.920> good<00:02:21.100> feel<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.550> get<00:02:21.700> through

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
and the good feel that you get through

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.010 
and the good feel that you get through
that<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.209> good<00:02:22.360> football<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.840> can

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
that and a good football that you can

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.710 
that and a good football that you can
play<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.610> i<00:02:24.640> think<00:02:24.790> really<00:02:25.120> there<00:02:25.390> needs<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.690> be

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
play so i think really there needs to be

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.600 
play so i think really there needs to be
a<00:02:25.840> relaxed<00:02:26.770> atmosphere<00:02:26.920> around<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.370> camp

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
a relaxed atmosphere around the camp

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.850 
a relaxed atmosphere around the camp
which<00:02:27.880> seems<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.630> way<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:28.900> very<00:02:29.230> much<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.739> a

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
which seems the way it is very much in a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.160 
which seems the way it is very much in a
minute<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.270> real<00:02:31.630> focus<00:02:32.020> and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
minute and a real focus and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.630 
minute and a real focus and
determination<00:02:32.650> we've<00:02:33.010> got<00:02:33.130> lots<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.430> training

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
determination we've got lots of training

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.250 
determination we've got lots of training
sessions<00:02:34.090> before<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.750> start<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.080> tournament

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
sessions before we start the tournament

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.650 
sessions before we start the tournament
we've<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.800> game<00:02:35.950> on<00:02:35.980> saturday<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.790> as

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
we've got the game on saturday and as

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.330 
we've got the game on saturday and as
long<00:02:37.810> as<00:02:37.959> everyone's<00:02:38.260> focused<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.860> determine

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
long as everyone's focused and determine

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.710 
long as everyone's focused and determine
and<00:02:39.489> trying<00:02:39.730> hard<00:02:40.000> i<00:02:40.180> think<00:02:40.390> we've<00:02:40.510> got<00:02:40.630> the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
and trying hard i think we've got the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.330 
and trying hard i think we've got the
quality<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.320> team<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:42.160> it's<00:02:42.280> about

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
quality in the team so it's about

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.310 
quality in the team so it's about
harnessing<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.630> making<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.110> group

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
harnessing that and making the group

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.170 
harnessing that and making the group
very<00:02:44.590> very<00:02:44.769> strong<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:45.760> who<00:02:45.850> knows<00:02:46.000> what

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
very very strong and then who knows what

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.500 
very very strong and then who knows what
can<00:02:46.269> happen<00:02:47.700> such<00:02:48.700> only<00:02:48.970> days<00:02:49.120> for<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.390> in
