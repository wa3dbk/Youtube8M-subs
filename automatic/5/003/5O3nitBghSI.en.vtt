00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
prefer but this way I feel it's safer

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.330 
prefer but this way I feel it's safer
because<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.450> just<00:01:55.660> creates<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.110> thicker<00:01:56.350> layer

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
freeze it again and that's it now we

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.880 
freeze it again and that's it now we
just<00:02:05.920> have<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.130> kill<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.850> kill<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.900> kill<00:02:08.560> it
