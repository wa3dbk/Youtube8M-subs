as you can see crystal is kind of darker
than<00:06:12.460> gold<00:06:12.730> and<00:06:12.790> silver<00:06:13.210> and<00:06:14.170> the<00:06:14.980> generation

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
than gold and silver and the generation

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.030 
than gold and silver and the generation
of<00:06:15.850> for<00:06:16.060> sprites<00:06:16.390> are<00:06:16.570> brighter<00:06:17.050> than<00:06:17.410> the

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
of for sprites are brighter than the

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.410 
of for sprites are brighter than the
generation<00:06:18.580> free<00:06:18.790> sprites<00:06:19.090> which<00:06:19.300> is

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
generation free sprites which is

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.450 
generation free sprites which is
interesting<00:06:19.780> and<00:06:20.080> kind<00:06:20.260> of<00:06:20.290> the<00:06:20.980> developers

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
interesting and kind of the developers

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.350 
interesting and kind of the developers
obviously<00:06:21.790> change<00:06:22.030> their<00:06:22.240> mind<00:06:22.480> a<00:06:22.600> bit<00:06:22.750> and

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
obviously change their mind a bit and

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.600 
obviously change their mind a bit and
now<00:06:25.360> obviously<00:06:25.600> moving<00:06:25.960> on<00:06:26.140> to<00:06:26.290> bayleaf<00:06:26.770> again

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
now obviously moving on to bayleaf again

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.890 
now obviously moving on to bayleaf again
these<00:06:27.850> sprites<00:06:28.120> are<00:06:28.330> very<00:06:28.570> similar

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
these sprites are very similar

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.200 
these sprites are very similar
throughout<00:06:29.230> all<00:06:29.560> the<00:06:29.770> games<00:06:30.010> but<00:06:30.910> like

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
throughout all the games but like

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.540 
throughout all the games but like
chikorita<00:06:31.750> there<00:06:31.930> are<00:06:32.140> differences<00:06:32.980> in<00:06:33.040> color

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
chikorita there are differences in color

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.630 
chikorita there are differences in color
crystal<00:06:34.540> sprite<00:06:34.870> is<00:06:35.020> brighter<00:06:35.920> than<00:06:36.310> gold<00:06:36.580> and

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:36.640 
crystal sprite is brighter than gold and

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.790 
crystal sprite is brighter than gold and
silver<00:06:37.060> unlike<00:06:37.600> chikorita<00:06:38.080> sprite<00:06:38.410> crystal

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
silver unlike chikorita sprite crystal

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.310 
silver unlike chikorita sprite crystal
which<00:06:38.920> was<00:06:39.070> darker<00:06:39.730> and<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.990> difference

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
which was darker and the difference

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.990 
which was darker and the difference
again<00:06:41.440> between<00:06:41.590> generation<00:06:42.220> of<00:06:42.310> three<00:06:42.790> and

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
again between generation of three and

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.450 
again between generation of three and
four<00:06:43.420> it<00:06:44.080> gets<00:06:44.350> a<00:06:44.470> darker<00:06:44.860> again<00:06:45.190> in

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
four it gets a darker again in

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.070 
four it gets a darker again in
generation<00:06:46.060> four<00:06:46.240> and<00:06:46.420> five<00:06:46.600> where<00:06:46.930> our

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
generation four and five where our

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.810 
generation four and five where our
generation<00:06:47.530> free<00:06:47.680> is<00:06:47.830> quite<00:06:48.130> light<00:06:48.400> in<00:06:48.610> color

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
generation free is quite light in color

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.280 
generation free is quite light in color
and<00:06:51.000> finally<00:06:52.000> looking<00:06:52.330> at<00:06:52.420> Meganium<00:06:52.930> sprites

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
and finally looking at Meganium sprites

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.030 
and finally looking at Meganium sprites
here<00:06:53.530> now<00:06:54.240> again<00:06:55.240> it<00:06:55.870> looks<00:06:56.530> pretty<00:06:56.830> much<00:06:56.920> the

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
here now again it looks pretty much the

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.950 
here now again it looks pretty much the
same<00:06:57.160> throughout<00:06:57.340> all<00:06:57.700> the<00:06:57.880> games<00:06:58.090> but<00:06:58.840> there

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
same throughout all the games but there

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.260 
same throughout all the games but there
are<00:06:59.110> a<00:06:59.140> few<00:06:59.560> slight<00:06:59.890> color<00:07:00.190> changes<00:07:00.670> in

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
are a few slight color changes in

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.980 
are a few slight color changes in
