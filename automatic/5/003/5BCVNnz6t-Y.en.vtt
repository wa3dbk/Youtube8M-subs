00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.629
 hi girls as you know the world already 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.640
 started and sure that our friends 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.860
 will be consumed by refer 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.190
 future so why not join us 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.959
 them and maybe we could show them 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.139
 that we can be part of this 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.139
 celebration 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.779
 ah 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 a female way of incorporating the 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.090
 worldwide in our lives is with 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.680
 our outfits I chose Mexico as 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.690
 the outfit is the center of attention of my 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.300
 look makeup should be the most 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.800
 neutral possible first of all I like 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.080
 apply a moisturizer for 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.200
 keep my face fresh and radiant and 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.540
 then hydrate my lips 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.430
 then he applied some base to me 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.790
 disguise dark circles and match the skin 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.710
 my face usually I put on a bit of 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.290
 transparent gel on the eyebrows because it 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 they easily ruffle me so as not to be 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.489
 pale I applied myself a small amount of 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.070
 pink blush on my cheeks gives me a look 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.020
 healthy natural and very feminine and 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.970
 When I'm finished, I rub my hands 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.620
 a few seconds and he placed them on the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.010
 cheeks so that the color mixes the 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.720
 fluorine with the base I like to apply my 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.490
 very light shadows and cakes in the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.009
 eyelid mobile because it gives me a loop is 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.170
 Friday and then to create depth 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.859
 added a dark brown color in which 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.120
 on the eyelid 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:26.070
 Delirium is the target of destiny 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.050
 when I finish applying I take a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.050
 brush and blend in as much as you can 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.030
 If you want your eyes to look more 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.759
 great apply eyeliner in the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.049
 upper and lower eyelid 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.119
 I normally use brown day for a 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.899
 sweet and black look at night for a 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.899
 intense look 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.300
 and of course I can not live without mascara 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.860
 so that I can not be beaten in any 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.840
 makeup that makes me 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.880
 Finally a pink or coral color are 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.100
 perfect to give you a definite look and 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.810
 jovial to turkey if you feel that your 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.670
 lips look very matte adds a 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.360
 touch of brightness to highlight the and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.360
 give more egg 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.880
 to make a super feminine hairstyle 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.800
 cool roll a lock of each side of 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.800
 your head and fasten them with pins 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.890
 5.3 tense then divide your hair into 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 three and roll each section to form 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.280
 a bow tie 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.200
 you do not have to make the idea perfect 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.200
 is that they are a bit messy 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.950
 but 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.380
 when they have been as you like 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.360
 secure them with more pins and ready now 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.780
 you have a beautiful hairstyle and without much 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.780
 work 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.370
 it's not me 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.750
 and boutique and 5 when we sad 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.300
 I hope you are encouraged to create your own 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.860
 looks inspired by the world have not 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.260
 to do a super sports fan 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.930
 but I think it's a very chic way 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.120
 to encourage your country your favorite team 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.010
