00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
maybe we didn't get it or that story

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.700 
maybe we didn't get it or that story
point<00:01:15.330> isn't<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.720> clear<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.140> guys<00:01:16.470> think

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
point isn't as clear as you guys think

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.039 
point isn't as clear as you guys think
it<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.670> then<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.390> good<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.810> us<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
it is so then it's a good way for us to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.390 
it is so then it's a good way for us to
adjust<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.860> yeah<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> good

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
adjust and then so yeah it's a good

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.950 
adjust and then so yeah it's a good
dance<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.909> think<00:01:21.119> between<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.479> two<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.689> us<00:01:21.810> a

up<00:02:19.820> on<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.060> farm<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.690> top<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.380> hill<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:21.920> we

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
up on a farm on top of the hill so we

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.760 
up on a farm on top of the hill so we
said<00:02:22.820> okay<00:02:23.120> Cal<00:02:23.300> probably<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.960> haven't<00:02:24.410> asked

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
said okay Cal probably I haven't asked

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.190 
said okay Cal probably I haven't asked
her<00:02:24.860> okay<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.490> it's<00:02:25.940> never<00:02:26.090> come<00:02:26.360> up<00:02:26.390> but<00:02:27.020> I

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
her okay and it's never come up but I

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.720 
her okay and it's never come up but I
think<00:02:27.410> that's<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.800> reasons<00:02:28.010> she's<00:02:28.550> so

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
think that's one of the reasons she's so

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.730 
think that's one of the reasons she's so
down-to-earth<00:02:28.970> yeah<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.260> know<00:02:30.290> her<00:02:30.530> she

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
down-to-earth yeah as you know her she

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.200 
down-to-earth yeah as you know her she
has<00:02:30.860> such<00:02:30.980> great<00:02:31.130> family<00:02:31.550> in<00:02:31.670> her<00:02:31.730> life<00:02:31.940> and

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
has such great family in her life and

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.670 
has such great family in her life and
was<00:02:32.630> home-schooled<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.290> that's<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.590> think

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
was home-schooled so that's I think

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.900 
was home-schooled so that's I think
that's<00:02:33.800> pretty<00:02:34.070> interesting<00:02:34.250> about<00:02:34.700> her<00:02:34.820> that

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
that's pretty interesting about her that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.310 
that's pretty interesting about her that
I<00:02:34.970> didn't<00:02:35.210> know<00:02:35.330> before<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.720> show<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.140> seemed
