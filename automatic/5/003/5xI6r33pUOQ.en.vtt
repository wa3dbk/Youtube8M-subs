use<00:00:41.010> natural<00:00:41.520> light<00:00:41.700> ever<00:00:42.500> make<00:00:43.500> sure<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
use natural light ever make sure that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.190

you<00:00:44.129> use<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> lamp<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> light<00:00:46.170> source

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
you use a lamp and that the light source

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.010 
you use a lamp and that the light source
stays<00:00:46.829> consistent<00:00:47.610> because<00:00:48.030> light<00:00:48.510> flicker

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
stays consistent because light flicker

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.000 
stays consistent because light flicker
ruins<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> end<00:00:49.770> product<00:00:50.809> okay<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.710> time

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
ruins the end product okay now it's time

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the size that you would like and reduce

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.429 
the size that you would like and reduce
the<00:01:35.070> hardness<00:01:37.579> then<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.729> might<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> zoom

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the hardness then you might like to zoom

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.450 
the hardness then you might like to zoom
in<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.990> start<00:01:42.990> erasing<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.770> brick<00:01:44.009> just

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
in and start erasing that brick just

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.190 
in and start erasing that brick just
like<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:45.439> it's<00:01:46.439> pretty<00:01:46.890> easy<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:48.060> takes<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
like that it's pretty easy it takes a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.420 
like that it's pretty easy it takes a
bit<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.530> time<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> lot<00:01:50.399> of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
bit of time when you have a lot of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.569 
bit of time when you have a lot of
photos<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.320> but<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> end<00:01:52.619> result<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.189> very

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
photos to do but the end result is very

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.789 
photos to do but the end result is very
rewarding<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.990> everything<00:01:55.409> right

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
rewarding if you do everything right

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.270 
rewarding if you do everything right
yeah<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.479> quite<00:01:57.869> fun<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.009> look<00:01:59.159> at

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
yeah it is quite fun when you look at

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.090 
yeah it is quite fun when you look at
the<00:01:59.369> end<00:01:59.549> result<00:02:00.140> try<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.259> try<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> nice

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the end result try and try and do a nice

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.380 
the end result try and try and do a nice
job<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:05.119> that's<00:02:06.119> better<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
job not like that that's better and

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.240 
job not like that that's better and
if<00:02:08.660> we<00:02:08.840> zoom<00:02:08.869> out<00:02:09.259> you'll<00:02:09.590> see<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.039> the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
if we zoom out you'll see that the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.100 
if we zoom out you'll see that the
minifigure<00:02:10.759> looks<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.120> it's<00:02:11.330> jumping<00:02:11.840> in

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
minifigure looks like it's jumping in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.830 
minifigure looks like it's jumping in
the<00:02:12.200> air<00:02:13.330> there<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.420> go

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
the air there you go

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.680 
the air there you go
and<00:02:15.220> now<00:02:16.220> we'll<00:02:16.460> combine<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.180> layers<00:02:17.390> or

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
and now we'll combine the layers or

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.340 
and now we'll combine the layers or
merge<00:02:17.900> layers<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:20.350> save<00:02:21.350> as<00:02:22.990> then<00:02:23.990> call<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
merge layers and save as then call the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.350 
merge layers and save as then call the
