I did find a photo tutorial but I really

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.840 
I did find a photo tutorial but I really
need<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:21.990> say<00:00:22.289> things<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.859> motion<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.640> me<00:00:23.730> to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
need to say things in motion for me to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.580 
need to say things in motion for me to
understand<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.199> took<00:00:25.320> me<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> really

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
understand it so it took me a really

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.050 
understand it so it took me a really
long<00:00:25.859> time<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.430> figure<00:00:26.580> out<00:00:26.730> from<00:00:26.880> just

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
long time to figure out from just

knitting that one and then coming back
and<00:01:35.189> doing<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.810> instead<00:01:37.170> of

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
and doing this it's just that instead of

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.280 
and doing this it's just that instead of
having<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.880> mess<00:01:39.119> around<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.479> cable<00:01:39.960> needles

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
