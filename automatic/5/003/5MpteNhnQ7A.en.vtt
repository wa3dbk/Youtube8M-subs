00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.429
 ladies and gentlemen, alright, I 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 I would like to talk to you one point 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.939
 important 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.750
 I think a footprint race on the day of your 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:25.529
 tender is there for the acij of the secrecy of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.919
 telephone conversations legal conversations 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.680
 is possible or not possible 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.530
 first you have to make the 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.039
 reading of article 5, item 12 of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 constitution of the republic which says 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:44.310
 article 5, item 12 of the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 confidentiality of correspondence and 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.050
 telegraphic communications of data and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.079
 of telephone communications except in the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 case by court order in the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.260
 hypotheses and in the way that the law 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.710
 establish for research purposes 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.610
 criminal or criminal procedural instruction 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.820
 except in the latter case the last 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.939
 If you talk about telephone communications 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.429
 but while the constituent legislator 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.829
 he cited the telephone communications 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:21.630
 he brought two requirements for the purpose of 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:27.200
 criminal investigation or education 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.130
 criminal prosecution beauty then you can 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.240
 breaking communications secrecy 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:39.029
 telephone yes yes beauty since 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.810
 there is an ongoing investigation a 

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:45.139
 criminal investigation in progress 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.069
 judicial right the police investigation or 

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:53.310
 judicial court proceedings process 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.159
 Messrs. telephone communication is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.270
 inviolable yes 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.420
 unless you have an inquiry 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.909
 judicial proceedings are underway 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.759
 The first catch is there, because 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:14.810
 if you have an administrative process 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:18.379
 not only the judicial investigation process 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.519
 criminal proceedings in a court of 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:26.420
