you know a wonderful combination of

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.730 
you know a wonderful combination of
architecture<00:00:36.950> design<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:37.610> aircraft<00:00:38.360> and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
architecture design and aircraft and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.170 
architecture design and aircraft and
something<00:00:39.740> that<00:00:39.920> was<00:00:40.190> going<00:00:40.580> to<00:00:40.670> be<00:00:40.730> timeless

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
something that was going to be timeless

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.140 
something that was going to be timeless
not<00:00:41.900> fleeting<00:00:42.350> there<00:00:43.070> was<00:00:43.160> going<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.370> be<00:00:43.430> sleek

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.740 
not fleeting there was going to be sleek
and<00:00:44.360> beautiful<00:00:44.480> for<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.110> ages<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:46.720> so<00:00:47.720> I

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
and beautiful for the ages and so I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.720 
and beautiful for the ages and so I
think<00:00:47.840> architecture<00:00:48.500> made<00:00:48.800> sense<00:00:49.130> number<00:00:49.520> one

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
think architecture made sense number one

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.360 
think architecture made sense number one
and<00:00:50.030> in<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.720> world<00:00:50.900> of<00:00:50.990> architecture<00:00:51.370> there

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
and in the world of architecture there

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.890 
and in the world of architecture there
are<00:00:52.460> very<00:00:52.700> few<00:00:53.000> names<00:00:53.270> that<00:00:53.480> are<00:00:53.750> as

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
are very few names that are as

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.770 
are very few names that are as
immediately<00:00:54.560> recognizable<00:00:55.460> with<00:00:55.780> quality

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
immediately recognizable with quality

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.889 
immediately recognizable with quality
and<00:00:57.079> vision<00:00:57.590> as<00:00:57.829> Lord<00:00:58.310> foster<00:00:58.730> I've<00:00:59.660> been

and vision as Lord foster I've been

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.130 
and vision as Lord foster I've been
fascinated<00:01:00.440> for<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:01.340> many<00:01:01.489> years<00:01:01.850> by<00:01:02.270> by

flight by aircraft by flying by piloting

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.010 
flight by aircraft by flying by piloting
so<00:01:08.990> for<00:01:09.290> me<00:01:09.470> I'm<00:01:10.240> I'm<00:01:11.240> still<00:01:11.509> completely

hooked if you like on the romance of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.370 
hooked if you like on the romance of
flight<00:01:15.609> and<00:01:16.609> I'm<00:01:16.819> fortunate<00:01:17.179> in<00:01:17.780> terms<00:01:18.170> of

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
flight and I'm fortunate in terms of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.340 
flight and I'm fortunate in terms of
being<00:01:18.560> able<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:19.609> combine<00:01:20.359> the<00:01:20.749> children<00:01:21.170> I

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
being able to combine the children I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.989 
being able to combine the children I
approached<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.429> design<00:01:22.819> from<00:01:24.429> three<00:01:25.429> angles

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
approached the design from three angles

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.959 
approached the design from three angles
first<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.869> all<00:01:26.959> as<00:01:27.049> a<00:01:27.079> pilot<00:01:27.850> secondly<00:01:28.850> as<00:01:28.939> a

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
first of all as a pilot secondly as a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.669 
first of all as a pilot secondly as a
customer<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.990> thirdly<00:01:30.619> as<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.399> designer<00:01:31.880> I

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
customer and thirdly as a designer I

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.389 
customer and thirdly as a designer I
think<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:34.119> influences<00:01:35.119> on<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.420> designer

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
think the influences on the designer

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.639 
think the influences on the designer
come<00:01:37.399> from<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:38.420> different<00:01:38.899> roles<00:01:39.139> that<00:01:39.350> we've

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
come from the different roles that we've

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.830 
come from the different roles that we've
all<00:01:39.859> played<00:01:40.789> at<00:01:41.119> one<00:01:41.329> time<00:01:41.630> or<00:01:41.810> another

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
all played at one time or another

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.169 
all played at one time or another
whether<00:01:42.319> it's<00:01:42.380> piloting<00:01:43.130> an<00:01:43.219> aircraft<00:01:43.700> being

whether it's piloting an aircraft being

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.599 
whether it's piloting an aircraft being
a<00:01:44.270> customer<00:01:44.590> being<00:01:45.590> looked<00:01:45.859> after<00:01:46.100> in<00:01:46.490> an

have that luxury of being you know
totally<00:02:28.420> contained<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.930> aircraft<00:02:31.180> was

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
totally contained the aircraft was

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.170 
totally contained the aircraft was
special<00:02:32.990> because<00:02:33.410> its<00:02:33.920> design<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.790> it's<00:02:34.970> also

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180
