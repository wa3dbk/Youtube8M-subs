00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
get out of here they can actually mimic

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.170

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
for an hour in here there's another 23

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.260 
for an hour in here there's another 23
that<00:02:03.280> aren't<00:02:03.490> accountable<00:02:03.820> for<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.210> that's

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
that aren't accountable for and that's

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.860 
that aren't accountable for and that's
really<00:02:04.480> where<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.960> have<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.890> be<00:02:05.980> accountable

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
so the combination of those two things

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.900 
so the combination of those two things
really<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.090> where<00:02:10.330> it's<00:02:10.510> at

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
really is where it's at

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.550 
really is where it's at
the<00:02:12.910> second<00:02:13.360> biggest<00:02:13.540> thing<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.380> be

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
the second biggest thing is going to be

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.000 
the second biggest thing is going to be
don't<00:02:14.860> set<00:02:15.160> yourself<00:02:15.490> up<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.790> fail<00:02:15.820> in<00:02:17.010> about
