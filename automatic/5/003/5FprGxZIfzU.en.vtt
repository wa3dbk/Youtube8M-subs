this<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.830> really<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.220> how<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> get<00:00:27.000> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
11 of Stevie's right now when I do a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.840 
11 of Stevie's right now when I do a
wall<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.310> better<00:01:29.549> for

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
wall and I do think it's better for

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.010 
wall and I do think it's better for
timing<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.200> 11<00:01:31.890> SCV's<00:01:32.549> gonna<00:01:33.329> send<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
timing to get 11 SCV's gonna send that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.850 
timing to get 11 SCV's gonna send that
one<00:01:34.200> off<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> scout

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
and you do need to get a refinery up at

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.230 
and you do need to get a refinery up at
about<00:01:48.520> 12<00:01:50.010> so<00:01:51.010> that's<00:01:51.730> what<00:01:51.940> I'm<00:01:52.030> gonna<00:01:52.120> be

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
about 12 so that's what I'm gonna be

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:02.880 
about 12 so that's what I'm gonna be
doing<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.640> just<00:02:01.120> use<00:02:01.300> standard<00:02:02.200> stout<00:02:02.470> again

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
doing I just use standard stout again

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.540 
doing I just use standard stout again
whatever<00:02:04.980> gadget

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and right as that 14th SCV pops out I

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.440 
and right as that 14th SCV pops out I
should<00:02:15.740> have<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:15.920> enough<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.760> build<00:02:17.240> my

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
should have just enough to build my

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.940 

and<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.750> you're<00:04:31.960> going<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.170> want<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.440> get<00:04:32.740> your

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
and so you're going to want to get your

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.840 
and so you're going to want to get your
refinery<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.030> 13<00:04:35.430> that's<00:04:36.430> pretty<00:04:36.700> good

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
refinery on a 13 that's pretty good

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.280 
refinery on a 13 that's pretty good
timing<00:04:39.240> so<00:04:40.240> let's<00:04:40.510> go<00:04:40.600> ahead<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.750> do<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:40.990> and

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
timing so let's go ahead and do that and

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.100 
timing so let's go ahead and do that and
see<00:04:44.290> this<00:04:44.560> way<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:45.490> do<00:04:45.760> have<00:04:45.970> continuous<00:04:46.720> SUV

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
see this way you do have continuous SUV

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.290 
see this way you do have continuous SUV
production<00:04:47.620> that's<00:04:48.130> kind<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.460> what<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:48.970> really

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
production that's kind of what I really

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.650 
production that's kind of what I really
like<00:04:49.450> about<00:04:49.480> not<00:04:50.350> walling<00:04:50.740> off<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:52.120> the

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
like about not walling off and the

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.120 
like about not walling off and the
previous<00:04:52.930> one<00:04:53.080> he<00:04:53.170> noticed<00:04:53.470> that<00:04:53.650> there<00:04:53.950> were

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
previous one he noticed that there were

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.240 
previous one he noticed that there were
some<00:04:54.400> gaps<00:04:54.640> every<00:04:55.030> now<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.360> then<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:57.130> are

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
some gaps every now and then you are

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.220 
some gaps every now and then you are
going<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.490> get<00:04:57.610> your<00:04:57.790> orbital<00:04:58.330> command<00:04:58.600> at<00:04:58.780> 15

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
going to get your orbital command at 15

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.260 
going to get your orbital command at 15
instead<00:04:59.740> of<00:04:59.950> 14<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:00.670> once<00:05:00.850> this<00:05:00.970> gets<00:05:01.120> done

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
instead of 14 so once this gets done

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.150 
instead of 14 so once this gets done
that's<00:05:01.960> when<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.260> barracks<00:05:02.620> should<00:05:02.800> get<00:05:02.980> done

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
that's when the barracks should get done

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.060 
that's when the barracks should get done
about<00:05:03.400> and<00:05:04.170> then<00:05:05.170> we<00:05:05.260> can<00:05:05.410> go<00:05:05.710> ahead<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:05.890> build

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
about and then we can go ahead and build

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.180 
about and then we can go ahead and build
that<00:05:06.160> orbital<00:05:06.610> command<00:05:06.790> make<00:05:07.330> sure<00:05:07.360> you<00:05:08.190> fill

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
that orbital command make sure you fill

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:16.530 
that orbital command make sure you fill
up<00:05:09.340> those<00:05:09.780> gas<00:05:12.090> vespi<00:05:13.090> geysers<00:05:15.360> get<00:05:16.360> that

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
up those gas vespi geysers get that

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.300 
up those gas vespi geysers get that
marine<00:05:16.810> off

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
marine off

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.360 
marine off
I<00:05:18.400> did<00:05:19.090> for<00:05:19.390> forget<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.230> send<00:05:20.440> off<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.620> scout<00:05:21.040> but

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
I did for forget to send off a scout but

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
this is really just showing off this

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.500 
this is really just showing off this
build<00:05:24.310> and<00:05:24.700> what<00:05:24.940> you're<00:05:25.090> gonna<00:05:25.180> do<00:05:25.360> when

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
build and what you're gonna do when

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.030 
build and what you're gonna do when
you're<00:05:25.630> going<00:05:25.720> to<00:05:25.810> do<00:05:25.930> an<00:05:26.020> early<00:05:26.290> walk<00:05:26.470> non

performance whatever yeah so that's kind
of<00:05:51.460> how<00:05:51.550> you<00:05:51.580> time<00:05:51.880> that<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.360> i<00:05:52.960> hope<00:05:53.260> the

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
of how you time that and i hope the

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.340 
of how you time that and i hope the
sound<00:05:53.710> works<00:05:53.980> out<00:05:54.190> this<00:05:54.370> time<00:05:54.430> and<00:05:55.170> i<00:05:56.170> hope

in the comments below if you think maybe
there's<00:06:02.830> a<00:06:02.890> way<00:06:02.950> i<00:06:03.040> could<00:06:03.190> improve<00:06:03.580> this<00:06:03.910> if

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
there's a way i could improve this if

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.610 
there's a way i could improve this if
you're<00:06:04.450> kind<00:06:04.780> of<00:06:04.840> more<00:06:05.050> experienced<00:06:05.440> player

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
you're kind of more experienced player

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.840 
you're kind of more experienced player
