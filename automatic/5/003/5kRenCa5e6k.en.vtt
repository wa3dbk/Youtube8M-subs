right<00:01:14.950> on<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.250> drum<00:01:17.160> okay<00:01:18.160> but<00:01:19.060> here's<00:01:19.270> the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
right on the drum okay but here's the

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
thing for that drunk to print the image

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.600 
thing for that drunk to print the image
onto<00:01:22.509> paper<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:23.320> needs<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.979> fill<00:01:24.340> those

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
onto paper it needs to fill those

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.260 
onto paper it needs to fill those
neutral<00:01:25.060> spaces<00:01:25.540> with<00:01:26.229> toner<00:01:26.910> how<00:01:27.910> does<00:01:28.090> that

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
neutral spaces with toner how does that

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.950 
neutral spaces with toner how does that
happen

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
happen

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.749 
happen
by<00:01:29.830> stirring<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.610> toner<00:01:30.880> inside<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.990> hopper

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
by stirring the toner inside the hopper

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.430 
by stirring the toner inside the hopper
the<00:01:33.759> toner<00:01:34.090> is<00:01:34.450> engineered<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
the toner is engineered so that the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.530 
the toner is engineered so that the
friction<00:01:35.710> from<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.160> stirring<00:01:36.700> generates

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
friction from the stirring generates

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.230 
friction from the stirring generates
static<00:01:38.320> electricity<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.850> how<00:01:39.970> does<00:01:40.030> that

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
static electricity so how does that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.230 
static electricity so how does that
toner<00:01:40.510> get<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:40.960> drum<00:01:41.700> well<00:01:42.700> just<00:01:42.880> outside

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
toner get to the drum well just outside

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.940 
toner get to the drum well just outside
the<00:01:43.420> hopper<00:01:43.810> there's<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.140> roller<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.770> gets

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
the hopper there's a roller that gets

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.010 
the hopper there's a roller that gets
covered<00:01:45.250> with<00:01:45.430> toner<00:01:45.790> as<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.540> drum<00:01:46.780> turns

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
covered with toner as the drum turns

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.630 
covered with toner as the drum turns
past<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.650> roller<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.610> toner<00:01:48.909> has<00:01:49.180> no<00:01:49.420> choice

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
past this roller the toner has no choice

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.130 
past this roller the toner has no choice
since<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.880> toner<00:01:52.150> carries<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.690> negative

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
since the toner carries a negative

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.649 
since the toner carries a negative
charge<00:01:53.409> it's<00:01:54.159> attracted<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.270> neutral

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
charge it's attracted to the neutral

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.910 
charge it's attracted to the neutral
spaces<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.530> drum

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
spaces on the drum

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.790 
spaces on the drum
at<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.400> same<00:01:58.640> time<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.570> toner<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.200> repelled

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
at the same time the toner is repelled

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.410 
at the same time the toner is repelled
by<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.070> negative<00:02:01.310> charges<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:02.060> cover<00:02:02.270> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
by the negative charges that cover the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.140 
by the negative charges that cover the
rest<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.930> drum<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.220> toner<00:02:04.490> only

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
rest of the drum so the toner only

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.460 
rest of the drum so the toner only
sticks<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.810> spaces<00:02:06.320> hit<00:02:06.530> by<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.770> laser

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
sticks to the spaces hit by the laser

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.559 
sticks to the spaces hit by the laser
now<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.530> toner<00:02:10.039> forms<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.759> mirror<00:02:11.090> image<00:02:11.450> of

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
now the toner forms a mirror image of
