00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
when it when you compare it to the

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.749 
when it when you compare it to the
console<00:05:56.580> but<00:05:59.699> but<00:06:00.699> it<00:06:00.849> still<00:06:01.060> looks<00:06:01.330> good<00:06:02.759> and

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
console but but it still looks good and

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.290 
console but but it still looks good and
it's<00:06:04.240> lighter<00:06:04.509> it<00:06:04.659> runs<00:06:04.840> really<00:06:05.139> smooth<00:06:06.300> it's

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
it's lighter it runs really smooth it's

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.839 
it's lighter it runs really smooth it's
pretty<00:06:07.599> much<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:08.050> same<00:06:08.229> thing<00:06:08.590> so<00:06:08.949> if<00:06:09.669> you're

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
pretty much the same thing so if you're

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.490 
pretty much the same thing so if you're
a<00:06:09.879> Mortal<00:06:10.210> Kombat<00:06:10.539> fan<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:10.960> you<00:06:11.020> own<00:06:11.199> the<00:06:11.229> V
