00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.160
 I say the planning means 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.970
 Matlik into the Orient in first position after the Kieler 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.909
 in the amount of one cent 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.540
 and Paul the big blinds 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.860
 from two cents to second position 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.879
 after the nerves 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.060
 and I'll give you cards now 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.119
 in this game round but not hope so normal 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.320
 everyone has cards 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.470
 the first one to explain is Lisa da Marc and Paul di Resta Moon and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.120
 Had to put big blinds 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.040
 she has a choice 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.199
 you will also option in English 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.199
 if someone has to explain themselves to the program 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.700
 Lieser Foldit and get out of check is unfortunately not possible because they to 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.910
 at least the use of a Big Plan would have to bring along 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.630
 Anna thinks for a moment 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.700
 Fulda dpa too 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.790
 she stretches out 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.700
 because has the option 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.120
 as considered 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 correctly 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.789
 as Egypt with and brings the commitment in the amount of the b-plan of two cents 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.590
 it's your turn 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.670
 and just call your dad with your text 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.799
 and bring the mission 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.710
 search country 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.390
 likes Colt and goes a penny 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.390
 he was there by morning with a stent 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.100
 Paul has the option he wants to play and check 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.270
 since he has already brought the big blinds of two cents 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.670
 Nobody has increased in this round 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 the bets of all players come in the pot 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 and I do not give a flop 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.909
 In the flop are a clique 5 a clique 6 and a cross Kühni 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.580
 Mark is the first one he has as the first position after the dealer pack 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.360
 the option 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.770
 Market power a bed of 20 cents 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.259
 As a reminder dat so bet is called 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.259
 because it is the first use and is 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.920
 Paul gets out 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.550
 his place is not good enough for him to set Unger to 20 cents 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.989
 because goes rolf-p 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.979
 puts all his chips 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:19.189
 because has brought 4995 cents use 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.689
 you're making a beaver 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.629
 a second increase 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629
 and puts the thousand as a bet 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.699
 Marco is old and is thus 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.839
 because he does not have ten thousand 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.120
 with his chips 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.470
 and see exactly 5312 cents even comes as an insert 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.729
 because and market are and are 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.040
 it can not be set anymore 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.099
 because only one player has protected 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.699
 because the players did not all make the same bet 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.699
 Different PETA are made 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.510
 in the middle in the menu Porto so main place 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.489
 There are already 18 goals 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.549
 because has brought the least use in the last six rounds 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.549
 4995 cents 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.079
 it comes from every player here 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.720
 4995 cents 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.979
 in the menu item 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.979
 4995 of Pannon the em-cup 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.529
 4995 from the small tens of thousands take pop 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.859
 and 4900 Volmer 90 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:31.680
 by Marc Gené 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.150
 in the pot which leads now Sandhausen 993 are included 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.950
 Marquardt the least 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.019
 still 317 cents 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.809
 So come on, make that 3 0 17 cents 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.170
 and 17 cents from you 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.879
 in need of time in addition to port 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.899
 in addition to pop are then 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.899
 600 animals 30 cents 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:04:00.849
 So you keep 4668 cents from your bet 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:04.059
 because the other players have no chance 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.719
 please take it from Cash 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.029
 the link port the for ten thousand 993 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:14.169
 everybody can win 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.319
 or depending on who has the better hand 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.239
 the time 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 from 634 cents 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.039
 or you win 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.039
 of that, no chips are insight percent 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.279
 Mark has the best hand wins everything 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.279
 do you have the best hand do you win everything 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.129
 has the best hand he wins the Men Port 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.289
 and that time pressure is on the market 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.330
 or the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.729
 depending on who has the better hand 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.060
 Are you the same strong you turn the time 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.410
 then we would have some luck Pop currently despite large 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.410
 That sounds like I think we look adorned 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:05:00.050
 so approved because the remaining cards so we can see who won 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.240
 I give the fuel card 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.580
 and then the REWAG card 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.710
 therefore no one can sit anymore 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.889
 because and Mark we are both 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.589
 Oelck be 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:13.529
 and we won 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.469
 because was the first and take 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.469
 he must be the first to reveal his cards 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.599
 the best possible combination for ended 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.289
 are two perpetrators 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.180
 kings 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.360
 and 15 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.600
 to the 10th 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.050
 not bad 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.050
 then DAX you open your cards 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.490
 you have two couples a couple of boys 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.469
 and actually in 15 to the king 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.379
 worse than bands hand 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.379
 his kings are higher than little boys 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.479
 Marquardt also two books 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.250
 Eights and 15 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.689
 to finish the royal Marcus worse than finish 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:53.729
 and luckily 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.589
 Also worse than 2 because your boys are taller than Max 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.409
 as will be written 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.430
 he has won the firm Men Pott 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.960
 Tenure port not involved you won 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.869
 Dada was a paper higher 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:13.869
 like that of mag 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:15.979
 Men pop could 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.949
 Congratulations 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.949
 since port congratulations to you 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.680
 you take your won chips and nothing with it the remaining cards 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.219
 again 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:29.979
 you can remember that 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.740
 that I said as a beginner please play for small bets 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.539
 so that you do not have to lie in the corner under your wound licking 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.250
 I am nobody who says so 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.470
 I told you so but 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.919
 I have a spokesman 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.809
