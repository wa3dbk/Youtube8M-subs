00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.240 

it<00:00:30.300> would<00:00:30.660> still<00:00:30.900> cost<00:00:30.929> around<00:00:31.410> about<00:00:31.529> 330

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
it would still cost around about 330

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.790 
it would still cost around about 330
pounds<00:00:32.550> okay<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.870> big<00:00:34.170> issues

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
pounds okay and one of the big issues

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.490 
pounds okay and one of the big issues
with<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.430> flash<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.870> has<00:00:37.170> an

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
with this flash is that it has an

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.530 
with this flash is that it has an
overheat<00:00:38.250> issue<00:00:38.579> well<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.149> actually<00:00:39.329> an

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
overheat issue well it's not actually an

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.569 
overheat issue well it's not actually an
issue<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.780> an<00:00:39.930> issue<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.410> happens<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.100> every

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
issue is an issue that happens to every

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.209 
issue is an issue that happens to every
flash<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.270> get<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.710> happens<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
flash that you get and what happens is

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.910 
flash that you get and what happens is
this<00:00:44.700> flash<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.840> made<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.710> would<00:00:46.829> be

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this flash was made so that it would be

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.279 
this flash was made so that it would be
able<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> recycle<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.910> fast<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.600> possible<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
able to recycle as fast as possible and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.810 
able to recycle as fast as possible and
with<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.340> kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.770> need<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.070> recycle<00:00:53.370> really

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
with that kind of need to recycle really

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
with that kind of need to recycle really
fast<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:56.120> electricity<00:00:57.120> bits<00:00:57.480> inside<00:00:58.079> end

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
fast it the electricity bits inside end

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
fast it the electricity bits inside end
up<00:00:59.190> heating<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.879> more<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> heat<00:01:00.750> issues<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
up heating up more so the heat issues is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
up heating up more so the heat issues is
not<00:01:01.590> anything<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.000> although<00:01:03.180> if

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
not anything to do with that although if

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
not anything to do with that although if
you<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.870> fill<00:01:04.140> parity<00:01:04.470> blast<00:01:04.799> there

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you put it on fill parity blast there

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
you put it on fill parity blast there
you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.820> feel<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> heat<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.990> put

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you can feel the heat and if you put

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.600 
you can feel the heat and if you put
your<00:01:07.260> skin<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.040> burn<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> little

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
shooting you doing lots of flash

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.039 
shooting you doing lots of flash
photography<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.750> full

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
photography just I have this at full

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
photography just I have this at full
power<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.740> blasting<00:01:20.189> off<00:01:20.340> over<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
power and I'm just blasting off over and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.830 
power and I'm just blasting off over and
over<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.990> recycle<00:01:22.619> recycle

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
over if you have recycle recycle

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.420 
over if you have recycle recycle
rechargeable<00:01:24.840> batteries<00:01:25.229> even<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.590> what

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
rechargeable batteries even and what

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
rechargeable batteries even and what
would<00:01:26.549> happen<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.810> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
would happen is that they because they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.219 
would happen is that they because they
are<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> lower<00:01:28.799> voltage<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:30.240> higher<00:01:30.509> milliamp

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
are a lower voltage but higher milliamp

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
are a lower voltage but higher milliamp
hours<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.040> reason<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.729> similarly

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
hours for some reason that similarly

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
hours for some reason that similarly
made<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.110> heat<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.680> more<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.280> understand<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:35.909> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
made it heat up more I understand but it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730 
made it heat up more I understand but it
means<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.299> recycle<00:01:36.570> faster<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.290> if

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
means it would recycle faster so if

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.109 
means it would recycle faster so if
you're<00:01:37.860> wanting<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.189> faster<00:01:38.520> recycle<00:01:38.939> time

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you're wanting a faster recycle time

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.190 
you're wanting a faster recycle time
definitely<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.680> high<00:01:41.009> milliamp<00:01:41.729> hours

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
definitely go with a high milliamp hours

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
definitely go with a high milliamp hours
or<00:01:43.200> milliamp<00:01:43.799> whoever<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.310> chargeable

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
or milliamp whoever is chargeable

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.480 
or milliamp whoever is chargeable
batteries<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.380> want<00:01:46.560> less<00:01:47.040> heating

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
batteries but if you want less heating

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.440 
batteries but if you want less heating
up<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.920> normal<00:01:49.920> batteries<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.149> enric

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
up go with the normal batteries so enric

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
up go with the normal batteries so enric
what<00:01:51.630> would<00:01:51.750> happen<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.079> people<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.380> be

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
what would happen is people would be

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.260 
what would happen is people would be
using<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.950> outside<00:01:53.430> taking<00:01:53.670> lots<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.970> shorts

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
using this outside taking lots of shorts

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.289 
using this outside taking lots of shorts
maybe<00:01:54.420> doing<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.930> some<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.619> high<00:01:56.490> powered

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
maybe doing like some have high powered

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.319 
maybe doing like some have high powered
flash<00:01:57.600> strobe<00:01:57.899> stuff<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.520> bits<00:02:00.090> inside

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
flash strobe stuff and that bits inside

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.520 
flash strobe stuff and that bits inside
would<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.600> heated<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.409> see

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
would be heated up but as you can see

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.749 
would be heated up but as you can see
I've<00:02:01.680> been<00:02:01.860> shooting<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.369> for<00:02:02.520> quite<00:02:02.729> a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
I've been shooting this for quite a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.209 
I've been shooting this for quite a
while<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.090> still<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.750> actually<00:02:04.259> getting

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
while it's still not actually getting

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.219 
while it's still not actually getting
the<00:02:05.790> temperature<00:02:06.180> gauge<00:02:06.299> hasn't<00:02:06.750> gone<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:07.020> at

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the temperature gauge hasn't gone up at

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.139 
the temperature gauge hasn't gone up at
all<00:02:07.619> yet<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.429> we're<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> keep<00:02:09.030> on

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
all yet so we're just going to keep on

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.369 
all yet so we're just going to keep on
doing<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.539> keep<00:02:09.690> them<00:02:09.810> talking<00:02:09.989> about

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
doing it just keep them talking about

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.660 
doing it just keep them talking about
lots<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.709> other<00:02:10.830> things

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
lots of other things

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
lots of other things
might<00:02:11.880> be<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.030> interest<00:02:12.120> viz<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:13.349> also

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
might be of interest viz I have also

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.199 
might be of interest viz I have also
seen<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> video<00:02:14.280> where<00:02:14.490> somebody<00:02:14.819> using

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
seen a video where somebody using

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.430 
seen a video where somebody using
special<00:02:16.080> type<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:17.160> zinc<00:02:18.440> batteries

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
special type of like zinc batteries

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.580 
special type of like zinc batteries
which<00:02:19.650> have<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.099> one<00:02:21.030> point<00:02:21.360> 6<00:02:21.900> volts<00:02:22.020> like

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
which have a one point 6 volts like

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.180 
which have a one point 6 volts like
normally<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.370> normal<00:02:23.459> AAA<00:02:24.209> battery<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.190> these

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
normally a normal AAA battery like these

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.330 
normally a normal AAA battery like these
Duracell<00:02:27.090> plus<00:02:27.630> para<00:02:27.959> batteries<00:02:28.410> these<00:02:29.040> are

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
Duracell plus para batteries these are

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.550 
Duracell plus para batteries these are
1.5<00:02:30.209> volts<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.810> 1.5<00:02:31.350> volts<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:33.560> 1500

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
1.5 volts so 1.5 volts and 1500

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.479 
1.5 volts so 1.5 volts and 1500
millivolt<00:02:35.100> errors

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
millivolt errors

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.010 
millivolt errors
meanwhile<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> recycle<00:02:36.510> battery<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.930> have

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
meanwhile the recycle battery that have

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.320 
meanwhile the recycle battery that have
gone<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.500> are<00:02:37.680> 1.2<00:02:38.489> volts<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.060> lower

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
gone here are 1.2 volts as a lower

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.699 
gone here are 1.2 volts as a lower
voltage<00:02:39.569> but<00:02:40.410> these<00:02:40.980> were<00:02:41.370> 1,000<00:02:42.380> mm<00:02:43.380> 500

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
voltage but these were 1,000 mm 500

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.949 
voltage but these were 1,000 mm 500
milliamp<00:02:44.550> hours<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:45.480> there's<00:02:45.660> no<00:02:45.780> difference

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
milliamp hours so there's no difference

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.570 
milliamp hours so there's no difference
there<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.500> if<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.739> look<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.130> video<00:02:47.250> which

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
there and if you look in the video which

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.479 
there and if you look in the video which
I'll<00:02:47.700> put<00:02:47.880> there<00:02:48.799> that's<00:02:49.799> showing<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
I'll put there that's showing you the

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.340 
I'll put there that's showing you the
difference<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:50.970> recycle<00:02:51.660> times<00:02:52.019> of

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
difference in recycle times of

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.240 
difference in recycle times of
rechargeable<00:02:53.280> vs.<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:54.540> kind<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.810> battery

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
rechargeable vs. this kind of battery

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.440 
rechargeable vs. this kind of battery
but<00:02:56.250> yeah<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.970> new<00:02:57.269> nikon<00:02:57.810> sb-910<00:02:59.450> what

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
but yeah so the new nikon sb-910 what

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.420 
but yeah so the new nikon sb-910 what
they've<00:03:00.630> done<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:01.049> they've<00:03:01.590> changed<00:03:02.069> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
they've done is they've changed the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.160 
they've done is they've changed the
setting<00:03:02.880> on<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.180> whenever<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.660> heats<00:03:03.930> up

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
setting on this so whenever it heats up

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.350 
setting on this so whenever it heats up
there<00:03:04.860> are<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> internal<00:03:05.760> parts<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.209> heat

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
there are the internal parts of it heat

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.900 
there are the internal parts of it heat
up<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.810> instead<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.890> completely<00:03:08.519> cutting

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
up and instead of a completely cutting

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.390 
up and instead of a completely cutting
out<00:03:09.420> which<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.140> annoyed<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> lot<00:03:11.340> of

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
out which is what annoyed a lot of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.190 
out which is what annoyed a lot of
people<00:03:11.670> with<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.940> they<00:03:12.120> say<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.569> would<00:03:12.810> shoot

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
people with this they say I would shoot

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.420 
people with this they say I would shoot
shoot<00:03:13.410> shoot<00:03:13.440> shoot<00:03:13.650> shoot<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.160> then<00:03:14.250> all<00:03:14.400> of

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
shoot shoot shoot shoot and then all of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.759 
shoot shoot shoot shoot and then all of
a<00:03:14.489> sudden<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.209> just<00:03:15.239> can't<00:03:15.720> take<00:03:16.200> any<00:03:16.470> more

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
a sudden you just can't take any more

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.060 
a sudden you just can't take any more
shots<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.940> going<00:03:18.239> on<00:03:18.329> forever<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.170> I

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
shots and this is going on forever and I

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.470 
shots and this is going on forever and I
and<00:03:20.400> what<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.609> was<00:03:20.730> it's<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:20.970> trying<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.329> make

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
and what it was it's just trying to make

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.120 
and what it was it's just trying to make
sure<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:22.109> flash<00:03:22.440> didn't<00:03:22.859> or<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
sure that your flash didn't or the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.160 
sure that your flash didn't or the
internal<00:03:23.640> mechanisms<00:03:24.540> inside<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.959> flash

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
internal mechanisms inside the flash

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.780 
internal mechanisms inside the flash
didn't<00:03:25.440> heat<00:03:25.590> up<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.980> point<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.370> they

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
didn't heat up to the point that they

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.970 
didn't heat up to the point that they
were<00:03:26.850> getting<00:03:27.120> fried<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.290> were<00:03:28.410> damaging

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
were getting fried and you were damaging

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.620 
were getting fried and you were damaging
the<00:03:29.070> actual<00:03:29.310> flash<00:03:29.489> oh<00:03:29.700> that's<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.120> gone<00:03:30.269> up<00:03:30.420> has

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
the actual flash oh that's a gone up has

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.539 
the actual flash oh that's a gone up has
gone<00:03:30.660> up<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.410> makes<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.859> cool<00:03:32.100> sound<00:03:32.370> oh<00:03:32.489> she

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
gone up and it makes a cool sound oh she

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:40.099 
gone up and it makes a cool sound oh she
whenever<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:32.970> hear<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.390> listen<00:03:38.660> that's<00:03:39.660> cool

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
whenever you hear it listen that's cool

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.930 
whenever you hear it listen that's cool
I'm<00:03:40.440> sure<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.769> think<00:03:40.859> it's<00:03:41.040> cool<00:03:41.190> as<00:03:41.280> well<00:03:41.459> so

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
I'm sure you think it's cool as well so

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.670 
I'm sure you think it's cool as well so
what<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.209> does<00:03:42.359> know<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.840> instead<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.320> just

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
what it does know is instead of just

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.020 
what it does know is instead of just
completely<00:03:44.070> cutting<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.700> having<00:03:44.940> to

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
completely cutting out and having to

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.759 
completely cutting out and having to
wait<00:03:45.180> for<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.510> not<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.170> much<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.410> battery's

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
wait for the not so much the battery's

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.410 
wait for the not so much the battery's
not<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.070> much<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.400> bit<00:03:47.670> here<00:03:47.940> but<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.180> actual

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
not so much this bit here but the actual

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.420 
not so much this bit here but the actual
electronics<00:03:49.380> inside<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.769> cool<00:03:49.950> down<00:03:50.160> it's

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
electronics inside to cool down it's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.150 
electronics inside to cool down it's
just<00:03:50.609> got<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.790> slow<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.690> down<00:03:51.859> so<00:03:52.859> instead<00:03:52.980> of

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
just got to slow it down so instead of

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.520 
just got to slow it down so instead of
being<00:03:53.310> able<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:53.609> 5<00:03:54.329> 4<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.930> second<00:03:55.410> it's

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
being able to do 5 4 to the second it's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.380 
being able to do 5 4 to the second it's
got<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.769> go<00:03:55.859> right<00:03:56.069> can<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.370> do<00:03:56.489> 1/4<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.150> every

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
got to go right can I do 1/4 to every

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.059 
got to go right can I do 1/4 to every
two<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.690> half<00:03:57.900> seconds<00:03:58.380> which<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:58.920> maybe

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
two and a half seconds which is maybe

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.099 
two and a half seconds which is maybe
the<00:03:59.220> big<00:03:59.489> leg<00:03:59.670> whoohoo<00:04:00.090> we<00:04:00.299> fixed<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.780> it's<00:04:00.989> not

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
the big leg whoohoo we fixed it it's not

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.780 
the big leg whoohoo we fixed it it's not
really<00:04:01.319> a<00:04:01.410> fix<00:04:01.680> in<00:04:01.829> any<00:04:01.950> way<00:04:02.100> but<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.519> think

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
really a fix in any way but I think

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.670 
really a fix in any way but I think
these<00:04:03.150> speed<00:04:03.510> lights<00:04:03.720> are<00:04:03.870> made<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.350> fast

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
these speed lights are made to be fast

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.650 
these speed lights are made to be fast
recycable<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.549> just<00:04:05.700> portable<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.540> just

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.509 
recycable and just portable and just
using<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.109> batteries<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:08.220> they<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.459> be

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
using a batteries so they have to be

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.280 
using a batteries so they have to be
able<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.730> take<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.120> whole<00:04:09.359> different<00:04:09.930> types<00:04:10.109> of

before and always be a bit worried can

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.100 
before and always be a bit worried can
you<00:04:22.800> put<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.979> higher<00:04:23.250> voltage

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
you put a higher voltage

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
into something with hoes it totally

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.660 
into something with hoes it totally
damaging<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.360> anyway<00:04:27.930> hopefully<00:04:28.170> no<00:04:28.860> this<00:04:29.370> is

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
damaging it anyway hopefully no this is

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.850 
damaging it anyway hopefully no this is
great<00:04:30.000> like<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:30.330> can<00:04:30.450> feel<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:31.020> can<00:04:31.260> feel<00:04:31.440> kind

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
great like you can feel I can feel kind

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.490 
great like you can feel I can feel kind
of<00:04:32.010> warmth<00:04:32.400> somewhere<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.150> this<00:04:33.540> if<00:04:34.230> you<00:04:34.320> just

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
of warmth somewhere in this if you just

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.350 
of warmth somewhere in this if you just
keep<00:04:34.740> on<00:04:34.950> going<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.460> anyway<00:04:35.700> also<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.270> other

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
keep on going but anyway also the other

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.480 
keep on going but anyway also the other
thing<00:04:36.450> is<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.690> can<00:04:36.840> update<00:04:37.110> your<00:04:37.770> flashes<00:04:38.370> so

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
thing is you can update your flashes so

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.580 
thing is you can update your flashes so
you<00:04:38.580> can<00:04:38.700> do<00:04:38.850> firmware<00:04:39.360> updates<00:04:39.720> but<00:04:40.440> that

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
you can do firmware updates but that

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.410 
you can do firmware updates but that
doesn't<00:04:41.010> change<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.460> overheating<00:04:42.120> problem

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
doesn't change the overheating problem

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.870 
doesn't change the overheating problem
the<00:04:42.480> overheating<00:04:43.020> problem<00:04:43.380> was<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:44.040> technical

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
the overheating problem was a technical

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.540 
the overheating problem was a technical
issue<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.630> was<00:04:45.750> like<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.650> fact<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.310> is<00:04:47.520> a

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
issue it was like the fact that it is a

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.820 
issue it was like the fact that it is a
mechanical<00:04:47.940> problem<00:04:48.600> not<00:04:48.960> again<00:04:49.500> not

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
mechanical problem not again not

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.410 
mechanical problem not again not
anything<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.490> do<00:04:50.550> with<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.790> top<00:04:51.000> bit<00:04:51.210> there

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
anything to do with the top bit there

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.330 
anything to do with the top bit there
but<00:04:52.020> also<00:04:52.230> do<00:04:52.500> with<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.460> pace<00:04:53.640> inside<00:04:55.310> no<00:04:56.310> I

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
but also do with the pace inside no I

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.650 
but also do with the pace inside no I
think<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.790> kind<00:04:56.940> of<00:04:56.970> speeds<00:04:57.210> up<00:04:57.360> as<00:04:57.510> if<00:04:57.630> you

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
think that kind of speeds up as if you

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.740 
think that kind of speeds up as if you
were<00:04:57.870> doing<00:04:58.200> some<00:04:58.700> like<00:04:59.700> also<00:05:00.030> focusing<00:05:00.600> and

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
were doing some like also focusing and

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.060 
were doing some like also focusing and
it's<00:05:00.840> having<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.140> pump<00:05:01.350> out<00:05:01.530> its<00:05:01.710> little

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
it's having to pump out its little

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.550 
it's having to pump out its little
infrared<00:05:02.550> light<00:05:03.150> here<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.720> focus<00:05:04.170> on<00:05:04.410> people

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
infrared light here to focus on people

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.530 
infrared light here to focus on people
that<00:05:05.010> she's<00:05:05.250> using<00:05:05.460> more<00:05:05.790> battery<00:05:06.270> power<00:05:06.450> so

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
that she's using more battery power so

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.050 
that she's using more battery power so
that<00:05:06.660> usually<00:05:06.990> makes<00:05:07.350> it<00:05:07.560> get<00:05:08.370> hotter<00:05:08.640> quicker

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
that usually makes it get hotter quicker

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.630 
that usually makes it get hotter quicker
when<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.140> gets<00:05:10.290> too<00:05:10.530> hot<00:05:10.740> it's<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.370> it's<00:05:11.490> off

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
when it gets too hot it's a it's off

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.490 
when it gets too hot it's a it's off
this<00:05:11.790> front<00:05:12.060> there's<00:05:12.330> like<00:05:12.480> warning<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:13.260> door

that's<00:05:42.900> just<00:05:42.990> like<00:05:43.140> a<00:05:43.400> millionth<00:05:44.400> of<00:05:44.490> a<00:05:44.580> second

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
that's just like a millionth of a second

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.570 
that's just like a millionth of a second
heat<00:05:45.150> no<00:05:45.420> hot<00:05:45.450> there<00:05:45.810> but<00:05:46.350> there<00:05:46.710> I<00:05:47.130> ran<00:05:47.430> the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
heat no hot there but there I ran the

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.340 
heat no hot there but there I ran the
passionate<00:05:48.000> that<00:05:48.300> is<00:05:48.480> war<00:05:48.660> in<00:05:48.840> fact<00:05:48.960> 14<00:05:49.290> the

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
passionate that is war in fact 14 the

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.550 
passionate that is war in fact 14 the
batteries<00:05:49.650> up<00:05:49.830> well<00:05:50.840> actually<00:05:51.840> wait<00:05:52.320> a<00:05:52.380> minute

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
batteries up well actually wait a minute

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.710 
batteries up well actually wait a minute
yes<00:05:53.240> they<00:05:54.240> are<00:05:54.270> properly<00:05:55.220> properly<00:05:56.220> hot<00:05:56.640> oh<00:05:56.880> oh

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
yes they are properly properly hot oh oh

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.990 
yes they are properly properly hot oh oh
yeah<00:05:58.080> oh<00:06:00.260> they<00:06:01.260> smell<00:06:01.320> like<00:06:01.560> burning<00:06:02.000> don't

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
yeah oh they smell like burning don't

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.190 
yeah oh they smell like burning don't
try<00:06:03.270> this<00:06:03.330> too<00:06:03.660> often

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
try this too often

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.690 
try this too often
and<00:06:04.820> yeah<00:06:05.820> so<00:06:06.540> these<00:06:06.930> are<00:06:07.380> the<00:06:07.620> bits<00:06:07.830> which<00:06:08.520> are

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
and yeah so these are the bits which are

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.530 
and yeah so these are the bits which are
hot<00:06:08.940> ah<00:06:09.150> oh<00:06:09.540> yeah<00:06:10.200> and<00:06:11.060> you<00:06:12.060> can<00:06:12.180> really<00:06:12.390> feel

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
hot ah oh yeah and you can really feel

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.660 
hot ah oh yeah and you can really feel
that<00:06:12.570> so<00:06:13.110> now<00:06:13.320> it's<00:06:13.590> just<00:06:13.860> saying<00:06:14.040> we're<00:06:14.370> and

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
that so now it's just saying we're and

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.600 
that so now it's just saying we're and
it's<00:06:14.850> still<00:06:15.120> saying<00:06:15.720> no<00:06:16.080> we're<00:06:16.800> not<00:06:16.830> going<00:06:17.520> to

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
it's still saying no we're not going to

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.270 
it's still saying no we're not going to
let<00:06:17.820> you<00:06:17.910> do<00:06:18.030> any<00:06:18.300> flashes<00:06:19.140> so<00:06:19.950> that<00:06:20.100> was<00:06:20.220> a

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
let you do any flashes so that was a

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.480 
let you do any flashes so that was a
problem<00:06:20.490> with<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.640> nikon<00:06:20.910> d<00:06:21.770> sb900<00:06:22.770> there's

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
problem with the nikon d sb900 there's

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.750 
problem with the nikon d sb900 there's
been<00:06:23.960> 910<00:06:24.960> should've<00:06:25.860> got<00:06:26.130> that<00:06:26.160> so<00:06:26.550> that's<00:06:26.700> a

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
been 910 should've got that so that's a

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.370 
been 910 should've got that so that's a
point<00:06:26.970> where<00:06:27.120> it<00:06:27.210> just<00:06:27.240> guys<00:06:27.480> slows<00:06:27.900> things

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
point where it just guys slows things

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.960 
point where it just guys slows things
down<00:06:28.590> it<00:06:28.980> doesn't<00:06:29.130> mean<00:06:29.280> that<00:06:29.310> you<00:06:29.520> just<00:06:29.550> can't

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
down it doesn't mean that you just can't

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.420 
down it doesn't mean that you just can't
do<00:06:30.150> anything<00:06:30.420> however<00:06:31.110> it<00:06:31.500> is<00:06:31.710> a<00:06:31.740> safety

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
do anything however it is a safety

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.010 
do anything however it is a safety
mechanism<00:06:32.610> and<00:06:33.090> is<00:06:33.180> there<00:06:33.390> to<00:06:33.570> stop<00:06:33.810> the

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
mechanism and is there to stop the

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.500 
mechanism and is there to stop the
internals<00:06:34.740> of<00:06:34.950> your<00:06:35.190> flash<00:06:35.640> getting<00:06:36.150> totally

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
internals of your flash getting totally

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.519 
internals of your flash getting totally
fried<00:06:36.750> it's<00:06:37.260> not

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
fried it's not

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.109 
fried it's not
thing<00:06:37.619> to<00:06:37.709> do<00:06:37.829> with<00:06:37.949> this<00:06:38.099> it's<00:06:38.729> all<00:06:38.849> about<00:06:39.029> the

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:39.119 
thing to do with this it's all about the

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:40.999 
thing to do with this it's all about the
batteries<00:06:39.569> and<00:06:39.809> how<00:06:39.899> it<00:06:40.019> sucks<00:06:40.319> the<00:06:40.559> power<00:06:40.769> out

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
batteries and how it sucks the power out

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.319 
batteries and how it sucks the power out
of<00:06:41.159> the<00:06:41.219> batteries<00:06:41.579> and<00:06:41.609> it<00:06:41.789> heats<00:06:41.999> up<00:06:42.179> the

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:42.329 
of the batteries and it heats up the

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:43.539 
of the batteries and it heats up the
internal<00:06:42.689> mechanisms<00:06:43.169> there

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:43.549 
internal mechanisms there

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:47.509 
internal mechanisms there
hope<00:06:44.549> that<00:06:44.669> helps<00:06:44.939> Cheers
