 facilitate the styling and sublimate 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:36.519
 hair I brush them 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.090
 I take my elastic and I make a 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.440
 low ponytail 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.589
 open your eyes big girls that's 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.930
 a little technical but very fast I 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.390
 place my top 6 ponytail tip down 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.059
 in my ponytail and I go back up the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.680
 ponytail in the loop 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.300
 I pull on the point of montaut psy 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.600
 ponytail so that the ponytail 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.180
 go right through and that's my tail 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.190
 of horse is knocked down I reproduce 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.750
 this step 2 times to form a 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.000
 adorable little bun 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.610
 if you do not have a ponytail topsy 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.920
 you can do it simply with your 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.140
 fingers by creating a small space between 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.460
 the elastic and your head to do it 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.130
 pass your ponytail 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.119
 I fix with bun pins and 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:28.539
 get the locks in the bun and 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:30.340
 it's finished a waterfall twist for 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.770
 to twist his waterfall 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.740
 I take dry oil pure caire dry 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.539
 dove oil in the palm of my hand and I 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.640
 apply it on the long hours for 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.940
 that my hair is silky and nourishes 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.840
 in depth I then brush my 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.399
 hair 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.440
 you probably already know how to make 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.310
 twists but there is a small 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.489
 subtlety 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.920
 look at I choose a section of 

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:56.319
 hair close to the face starting from a 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.619
 side of the stop and then I divide it into 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.259
 two I pass the wick down over 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.069
 the other attention this is where I'm going 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.410
 create the waterfall effect did I leave 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.629
 drop the bottom section and I recover 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.599

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.420
 replace I will pass this new 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.110
 wick in water over the other and so 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.890
 steps until the end of the twist to 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.890
 pretty much to the middle of my head 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.770

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.740
