how<00:00:31.260> does<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.439> all<00:00:31.619> work

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
how does it all work

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.770 
how does it all work
well<00:00:32.250> basically<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.850> connect<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> inductor

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
well basically you connect the inductor

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
well basically you connect the inductor
ring<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> Bluetooth<00:00:34.649> control<00:00:35.130> unit<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
ring to the Bluetooth control unit and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.610 
ring to the Bluetooth control unit and
then<00:00:35.940> toss<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> ring<00:00:36.600> around<00:00:36.719> your<00:00:37.050> neck<00:00:37.320> then

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
then toss the ring around your neck then

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.410 
then toss the ring around your neck then
you<00:00:37.739> simply<00:00:38.100> pop<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.520> either<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.210> both

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
you simply pop in either one or both

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
you simply pop in either one or both
earpieces<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> each<00:00:40.410> year<00:00:40.739> give<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.370> head<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
earpieces and each year give your head a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.010 
earpieces and each year give your head a
little<00:00:41.700> shake<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> falls<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.719> into

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
little shake so that it falls down into

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.900 
little shake so that it falls down into
your<00:00:43.170> ear<00:00:43.350> drum<00:00:43.649> scary<00:00:44.129> sounding<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.610> know<00:00:44.670> but

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
your ear drum scary sounding I know but

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
your ear drum scary sounding I know but
it's<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.510> bad<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.829> pair

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it's really not that bad and then pair

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.010 
it's really not that bad and then pair
your<00:00:47.309> phone<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.789> Bluetooth<00:00:48.270> control<00:00:48.660> unit
