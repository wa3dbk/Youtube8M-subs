00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
also everyone is definitely a little bit

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.840 
also everyone is definitely a little bit
drier<00:00:28.820> but<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.460> lately

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
drier but I will use this but lately

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.370 
drier but I will use this but lately
I've<00:00:32.940> been<00:00:33.059> using<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.480> natural<00:00:33.930> radiance

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
I've been using the natural radiance

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.130 
I've been using the natural radiance
base<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.040> I've<00:00:35.270> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.420> stopped<00:00:36.660> using<00:00:36.870> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
base so I've kind of stopped using it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.840 
base so I've kind of stopped using it
but<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> past<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.399> using<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
but in the past I was using it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
but in the past I was using it
definitely<00:00:39.469> with<00:00:40.469> my<00:00:40.890> old<00:00:41.160> primer<00:00:42.500> but<00:00:43.500> when

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
definitely with my old primer but when

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.799 
definitely with my old primer but when
I'm<00:00:43.860> using<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.520> some<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.180> models<00:00:45.600> or

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I'm using it on some of my models or

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.130 
I'm using it on some of my models or
clients<00:00:46.289> I'll<00:00:46.920> pair<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.780> prep<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
clients I'll pair it with the prep and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.590 
clients I'll pair it with the prep and
prime<00:00:51.590> skin<00:00:52.590> smoother<00:00:53.129> which<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.090> compact

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
prime skin smoother which is the compact

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.990 
prime skin smoother which is the compact
primer<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.190> I've<00:00:56.309> been<00:00:56.520> using

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
primer as you can see I've been using

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.229 
primer as you can see I've been using
mine<00:00:57.300> quite<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.940> really<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.090> this

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
mine quite a bit I really like this

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819 
mine quite a bit I really like this
primer<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.960> gives<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
primer because it gives you a really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.670 
primer because it gives you a really
nice<00:01:01.980> velvety<00:01:02.550> canvas<00:01:03.049> it<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.500> bit

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
nice velvety canvas it is a little bit

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340 
nice velvety canvas it is a little bit
heavy<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.309> daily<00:01:05.850> wear<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.020> pop<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
heavy for daily wear but if you pop it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
heavy for daily wear but if you pop it
onto<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> skin<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.189> lightly<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.540> be

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
onto the skin really lightly it can be

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.830 
onto the skin really lightly it can be
quite<00:01:09.930> nice<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.530> I've<00:01:10.920> been<00:01:11.070> doing<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.840> but

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
quite nice so I've been doing that but

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
quite nice so I've been doing that but
other<00:01:13.200> than<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.369> work

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
other than that I think that they work

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
other than that I think that they work
really<00:01:14.790> well<00:01:14.909> together<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
really well together because you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.340 
really well together because you
definitely<00:01:16.590> need<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.189> great<00:01:18.200> moisture<00:01:19.200> base

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
definitely need the great moisture base

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.719 
definitely need the great moisture base
from<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.210> moisture<00:01:21.659> infusion<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:23.430> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
from the moisture infusion and then this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
from the moisture infusion and then this
lays<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.420> nicely<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.780> top<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.280> can

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
lays really nicely on top of it you can

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.109 
lays really nicely on top of it you can
also<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> compact<00:01:27.509> primer<00:01:27.990> for

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
also use the compact primer for

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.670 
also use the compact primer for
touch-ups<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.259> you've<00:01:31.439> got

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
touch-ups on the go so if you've got

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
touch-ups on the go so if you've got
drier<00:01:32.040> skin<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> great<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.450> it's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
drier skin this is great because it's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.690 
drier skin this is great because it's
not<00:01:33.840> gonna<00:01:33.960> leave<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
not gonna leave you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.319 
not gonna leave you
powdery<00:01:35.700> or<00:01:35.850> show<00:01:36.509> any<00:01:36.930> signs<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.560> dry<00:01:37.770> skin

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
powdery or show any signs of dry skin

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.490 
powdery or show any signs of dry skin
but<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.290> definitely

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
but all in all I think it's definitely

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.859 
but all in all I think it's definitely
something<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.460> people<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:44.420> drier<00:01:45.420> skin

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
something for people with drier skin

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
something for people with drier skin
that<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.159> or<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.790> you're

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that they will really like or if you're

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
that they will really like or if you're
looking<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:49.020> build<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:49.890> full<00:01:50.100> coverage

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
looking to build a more full coverage

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
looking to build a more full coverage
foundation<00:01:51.060> these<00:01:51.210> two<00:01:51.420> are<00:01:51.540> gonna<00:01:51.600> work

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
foundation these two are gonna work

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.649 
foundation these two are gonna work
