00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
I guess I'll start with this up top as a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.600 
I guess I'll start with this up top as a
like<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> little<00:00:50.280> leather<00:00:50.550> handle<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.680> here's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
like a little leather handle and here's
