hey guys Rick Rowley sports rack here

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.429 
hey guys Rick Rowley sports rack here
doing<00:00:18.060> another<00:00:18.270> episode<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.930> what's<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.350> the

box<00:00:19.619> they've<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> Okada<00:00:20.910> project<00:00:21.449> plasma

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
box they've got the Okada project plasma

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080 
box they've got the Okada project plasma
direct<00:00:22.289> ignition<00:00:22.470> coils<00:00:23.189> got<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> box<00:00:23.880> right

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
direct ignition coils got the box right

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.259 
direct ignition coils got the box right
here<00:00:24.300> let's<00:00:24.539> go<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.779> open<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:26.029> alright<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.120 
here let's go and open this up alright I
didn't<00:00:27.900> want<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> show<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.260> guys<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.619> box<00:00:28.920> on

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
didn't want to show you guys the box on

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.230 
didn't want to show you guys the box on
this<00:00:29.250> cuz<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.519> think<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.789> kind<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.060> cool

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
this cuz I think it's kind of cool

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.170 
this cuz I think it's kind of cool
really<00:00:30.630> high<00:00:30.840> quality<00:00:30.949> glossy<00:00:32.180> cardboard

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
really high quality glossy cardboard

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.459 
really high quality glossy cardboard
that<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.420> use<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.320> actually

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that they use on this and I actually

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.750 
that they use on this and I actually
haven't<00:00:34.770> even<00:00:34.829> looked<00:00:35.040> at<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> back<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.640> so

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
haven't even looked at the back here so

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700 
haven't even looked at the back here so
let's<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:35.969> ahead<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.180> look<00:00:36.329> at<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.649> kind<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
let's go ahead and look at that kind of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.750 
let's go ahead and look at that kind of
cool<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:37.890> gives<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.399> graphs<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
cool just gives you some graphs of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.940 
cool just gives you some graphs of
course<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.360> Japanese<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> won't<00:00:40.829> be

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
course it's all in Japanese so won't be

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.170 
course it's all in Japanese so won't be
able<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> read<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.550> basically<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> looks

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
able to read it but basically it looks

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
able to read it but basically it looks
like<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> goes<00:00:42.600> over<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> amperage<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
like it goes over the amperage and the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.090 
like it goes over the amperage and the
voltage<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.329> I'm<00:00:45.690> guessing<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.530> right

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
voltage here I'm guessing all right

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
voltage here I'm guessing all right
let's<00:00:47.489> go<00:00:47.550> ahead<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.760> open<00:00:47.850> these<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.870> one

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
let's go ahead and open these up so one

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.430 
let's go ahead and open these up so one
thing<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.289> wanted<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> let<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.950> guys<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:51.440> was

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
thing I wanted to let you guys know was

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720 
thing I wanted to let you guys know was
a<00:00:52.469> way<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.860> wrapped<00:00:53.250> these<00:00:53.430> actually

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
a way this is wrapped these actually

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.220 
a way this is wrapped these actually
come<00:00:53.879> wrapped<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> actually

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
come wrapped really well I actually

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
come wrapped really well I actually
spent<00:00:55.559> about<00:00:55.680> five<00:00:55.949> minutes<00:00:56.219> unwrapping<00:00:57.030> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
spent about five minutes unwrapping this

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.400 
spent about five minutes unwrapping this
just<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> ready<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
just so I could get it ready for the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.349 
just so I could get it ready for the
video<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.460> top<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.000> we've<00:01:00.149> got

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
video so right on top here we've got

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.939 
video so right on top here we've got
instructions<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.410> we'll<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.620> over<00:01:01.770> those<00:01:01.890> in

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
instructions and we'll go over those in

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.149 
instructions and we'll go over those in
just<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.370> second<00:01:03.229> then<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
just a second then you get this kind of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.510 
just a second then you get this kind of
a<00:01:05.280> cool<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:05.939> plaque<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.830> says<00:01:07.830> equipped

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
a cool little plaque that says equipped

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.410 
a cool little plaque that says equipped
with<00:01:09.650> plasma<00:01:10.650> direct<00:01:11.189> coils<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:12.330> like

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
with plasma direct coils something like

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.420 
with plasma direct coils something like
that<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:12.840> gives<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.369> serial<00:01:14.369> number

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that and then gives you a serial number

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.740 
that and then gives you a serial number
down<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.180> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> cool<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.659> don't

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
down there that's kind of cool I don't

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.230 
down there that's kind of cool I don't
really<00:01:15.990> understand<00:01:16.610> why<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.000> cuz<00:01:18.180> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
really understand why they do that cuz I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.160 
really understand why they do that cuz I
don't<00:01:18.299> think<00:01:18.390> anybody's<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> be

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
don't think anybody's going to be

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.460 
don't think anybody's going to be
removing<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.100> coils<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:21.060> again<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.259> kind

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
removing your coils but again it's kind

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
removing your coils but again it's kind
of<00:01:22.530> cool<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.820> here's<00:01:24.180> what

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
of cool that they do so here's what

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.200 
of cool that they do so here's what
we're<00:01:24.540> looking<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:24.960> now<00:01:25.430> as<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.790> tell<00:01:27.000> if

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
we're looking at now as you can tell if

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
we're looking at now as you can tell if
you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.439> you've<00:01:28.590> seen<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> coil<00:01:29.130> pad

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you know or if you've seen a coil pad

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.510 
you know or if you've seen a coil pad
before<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> guess<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.110> coil<00:01:31.500> individual<00:01:32.220> coil

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
before or I guess a coil individual coil

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.780 
before or I guess a coil individual coil
you<00:01:33.210> know<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> direct<00:01:34.259> replacement

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
you know this is a direct replacement

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.620 
you know this is a direct replacement
the<00:01:35.790> only<00:01:35.939> thing<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> need<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the only thing you're going to need to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.140 
the only thing you're going to need to
do<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.990> take<00:01:37.470> off<00:01:37.650> your<00:01:37.799> stock<00:01:38.100> boot<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> put

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
do is take off your stock boot and put

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.859 
do is take off your stock boot and put
it<00:01:39.270> over<00:01:39.360> here

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it over here

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.539 
it over here
and<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.380> these<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.890> plug<00:01:41.130> directly

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and then these will just plug directly

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
and then these will just plug directly
in<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> existing<00:01:43.110> coil<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.950> does<00:01:44.100> have

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
in to the existing coil it does have

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.039 
in to the existing coil it does have
these<00:01:44.460> stock<00:01:44.820> three<00:01:45.780> prong<00:01:46.020> hookup<00:01:47.420> okay<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
these stock three prong hookup okay and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.960 
these stock three prong hookup okay and
then<00:01:49.290> other<00:01:49.829> than<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.820> like

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
then other than that if it's just like

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
then other than that if it's just like
stock<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.810> think<00:01:52.200> these<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.500> kind<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.799> cool

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
stock so I think these are kind of cool

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.670 
stock so I think these are kind of cool
looking<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> plasma<00:01:54.810> direct<00:01:55.259> sticker

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
looking to get a plasma direct sticker

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.539 
looking to get a plasma direct sticker
on<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.189> want<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> give<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
on there and I just want to give you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.780 
on there and I just want to give you
guys<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.750> 360<00:02:01.320> view<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> they

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
guys a you know 360 view of this so they

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.249 
guys a you know 360 view of this so they
rate<00:02:06.090> these<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:07.259> four<00:02:08.099> times<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.670> voltage<00:02:09.259> in

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
rate these at four times the voltage in

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
rate these at four times the voltage in
your<00:02:10.410> standard<00:02:10.770> coil<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.819> hundred<00:02:12.120> percent

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
your standard coil and a hundred percent

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.130 
your standard coil and a hundred percent
more<00:02:12.599> amperage

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
more amperage

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.930 
more amperage
so<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.040> gonna<00:02:14.160> be<00:02:14.280> very<00:02:14.490> good<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.910> people

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so this is gonna be very good for people

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.300 
so this is gonna be very good for people
running<00:02:15.330> higher<00:02:15.660> boost<00:02:15.990> higher<00:02:16.890> power<00:02:17.190> or

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
running higher boost higher power or

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.710 
running higher boost higher power or
anything<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.880> especially<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:18.540> need<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
anything like that especially we need to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.850 
anything like that especially we need to
get<00:02:18.810> starting<00:02:19.140> up<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.680> high

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
get starting up in the really high

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.900 
get starting up in the really high
numbers

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
numbers

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.630 
numbers
I<00:02:20.940> guess<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.600> stock<00:02:21.840> ignition<00:02:22.290> system<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:23.490> be

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
I guess the stock ignition system can be

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.920 
I guess the stock ignition system can be
pretty<00:02:23.880> weak<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:24.420> by<00:02:24.540> going<00:02:24.750> with

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pretty weak and so by going with

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.600 
pretty weak and so by going with
something<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.310> definitely

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
something like this you can definitely

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.270 
something like this you can definitely
improve<00:02:27.330> not<00:02:27.810> only<00:02:27.840> miles<00:02:28.200> per<00:02:28.410> gallon<00:02:28.770> gas

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
improve not only miles per gallon gas

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.570 
improve not only miles per gallon gas
mileage<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:31.650> power<00:02:31.830> throughout<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.310> entire

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
mileage just power throughout the entire

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.320 
mileage just power throughout the entire
power<00:02:32.820> band<00:02:33.090> which<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.270> great<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.490> alright<00:02:35.490> now

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
power band which is great so alright now

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.140 
power band which is great so alright now
let's<00:02:36.660> move<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.530> instructions<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:41.150> for

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
let's move on to the instructions so for

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.070 
let's move on to the instructions so for
the<00:02:42.240> most<00:02:42.390> part<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.690> will<00:02:42.780> come<00:02:42.959> with

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
the most part it will come with

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.330 
the most part it will come with
everything<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.410> need<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.740> install<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.100> of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
everything you need to install it of

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.460 
everything you need to install it of
course<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.640> will<00:02:44.790> need<00:02:44.970> your<00:02:45.240> stock<00:02:46.140> plug

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
course you will need your stock plug

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.510 
course you will need your stock plug
boot<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.950> shouldn't<00:02:47.100> be<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.250> problem

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
boot but that shouldn't be a problem

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.790 
boot but that shouldn't be a problem
once<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.670> take<00:02:47.850> off<00:02:48.000> your<00:02:48.120> stock<00:02:48.360> coils<00:02:48.990> and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
once you take off your stock coils and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.740 
once you take off your stock coils and
then<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.580> kind<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.820> go<00:02:50.910> over<00:02:50.970> basic

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
then it just kind of go over basic

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.210 
then it just kind of go over basic
instructions<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.380> how<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.560> install<00:02:53.010> this

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
instructions on how to install this

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.100 
instructions on how to install this
where<00:02:54.060> they<00:02:54.209> go<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> car<00:02:54.690> what<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.959> need

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
where they go on the car what you need

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.900 
where they go on the car what you need
to<00:02:55.200> remove<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> get<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:56.010> them<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:56.790> of

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
to remove to get to them and then of

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.550 
to remove to get to them and then of
course<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.330> does<00:02:57.480> tell<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.989> replace<00:02:58.290> your

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
course it does tell you to replace your

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.850 
course it does tell you to replace your
stock<00:02:58.950> plug<00:02:59.550> boot<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.540> put<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.170> new

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
stock plug boot and put it on the new

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.070 
stock plug boot and put it on the new
coil<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.690> instructions<00:03:03.690> are<00:03:03.780> pretty<00:03:03.900> basic

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
coil so instructions are pretty basic

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.080 
coil so instructions are pretty basic
but<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:05.010> installation<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.610> these<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.910> pretty

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
but the installation on these is pretty

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.699 
but the installation on these is pretty
basic<00:03:06.300> if<00:03:06.690> you've<00:03:06.810> ever<00:03:06.959> changed<00:03:07.290> spark<00:03:07.500> plugs

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
basic if you've ever changed spark plugs

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.560 
basic if you've ever changed spark plugs
or<00:03:07.800> anything<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.940> can<00:03:08.970> do<00:03:09.390> this

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
or anything like that you can do this

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.500 
or anything like that you can do this
it's<00:03:09.840> really<00:03:10.260> easy<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.239> going<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.390> be

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
it's really easy so this is going to be

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.870 
it's really easy so this is going to be
great<00:03:12.720> for<00:03:12.840> anybody<00:03:13.050> running<00:03:13.610> high<00:03:14.610> power
