00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.840 
what they call them and I did that to
the<00:06:19.660> top<00:06:19.900> too<00:06:20.260> but<00:06:20.710> they<00:06:20.890> I<00:06:20.920> mean<00:06:21.220> so<00:06:21.400> they<00:06:21.550> look

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
the top too but they I mean so they look

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.620 
the top too but they I mean so they look
darn<00:06:22.420> nice<00:06:22.630> they're<00:06:23.110> good<00:06:23.350> quality<00:06:24.630> charms

you<00:06:25.840> know<00:06:25.960> what<00:06:26.080> I<00:06:26.140> need<00:06:27.270> and<00:06:28.270> I<00:06:28.600> think<00:06:29.050> that's

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
you know what I need and I think that's

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.030 
you know what I need and I think that's
it

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
it

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.280 
it
so<00:06:30.310> I<00:06:30.640> just<00:06:31.150> wanted<00:06:31.390> to<00:06:31.510> share<00:06:31.720> those<00:06:31.990> though

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
so I just wanted to share those though

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.220 
so I just wanted to share those though
these<00:06:32.530> are<00:06:32.830> so<00:06:33.250> I<00:06:33.520> hope<00:06:34.030> I<00:06:34.240> mean<00:06:34.390> ten<00:06:34.690> box<00:06:34.960> I

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
these are so I hope I mean ten box I

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.690 
these are so I hope I mean ten box I
think<00:06:35.590> that's<00:06:35.800> good<00:06:36.100> maybe<00:06:36.310> seven

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
think that's good maybe seven

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.700 
think that's good maybe seven
that's<00:06:39.700> horrible<00:06:40.300> the<00:06:40.540> pricing<00:06:41.020> part<00:06:41.290> is<00:06:41.530> the

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
that's horrible the pricing part is the

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.400 
that's horrible the pricing part is the
hardest<00:06:42.310> part<00:06:42.670> for<00:06:42.760> me<00:06:42.940> I<00:06:43.180> really<00:06:43.900> struggle

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
hardest part for me I really struggle

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.190 
hardest part for me I really struggle
with<00:06:44.500> it<00:06:44.680> I<00:06:45.270> tried<00:06:46.270> it<00:06:46.390> because<00:06:46.720> you<00:06:46.840> know<00:06:46.960> the

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
with it I tried it because you know the

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.350 
with it I tried it because you know the
people<00:06:47.560> that<00:06:47.590> come<00:06:48.070> they're<00:06:48.520> not<00:06:48.550> wealthy

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
people that come they're not wealthy

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.510 
people that come they're not wealthy
people<00:06:49.390> they're<00:06:50.050> like<00:06:50.260> looking<00:06:50.740> for<00:06:51.010> I<00:06:51.220> mean

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
people they're like looking for I mean

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.430 
people they're like looking for I mean
so<00:06:51.730> people<00:06:51.760> probably<00:06:52.240> have<00:06:52.750> money<00:06:53.020> that<00:06:53.230> come

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440
