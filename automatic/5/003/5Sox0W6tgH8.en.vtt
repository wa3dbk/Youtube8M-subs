00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.190
 the latest for today is hot 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 so burning it 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.570
 samsung gear s watch smartphone is not 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.090
 ordinary smartphone that everyone is used to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.220
 company phone companions 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.490
 and they have a separate mobile device 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.070
 here here is the sim card slot with 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.330
 which clock can take 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.130
 calls on them can also call 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.170
 send messages in general everything is like 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.340
 this phone gadget itself is pretty 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.310
 weighty that is, they look at the hands 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.370
 pretty cumbersome that is this 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.890
 Here is a powerful strap rubber stitch 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.660
 it is separated from the clock 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.670
 we can change them but use 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.460
 Some third-party straps are likely 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.629
 you will not be regulated size 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.640
 strap here is such a 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.760
 metal construction that drives 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:06.220
 can be removed completely can be put 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.030
 right size itself firmly clasp 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.740
 metal is such a blob here watch 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.390
 were shown officially presented 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.970
 a week ago, that's why everything is special 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.979
 their specifications have long been known in 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.979
 unlike many wearable devices, they 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.030
 do not work on android and local 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.950
 samsung operating system tizen 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.190
 rather strange decision but by the same token 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.110
 samsung is trying to somehow advance 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.840
 own child 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.220
 The clock screen has a diagonal of 2 inches 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.020
 it's curved super amoled with resolution 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.229
 480 by 360 pixels 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.750
 like previous versions of samsung these 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.390
 hours, too, there is a heart rate sensor 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.310
 so the whole here is this fitness hype 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.079
 it can also be used here 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.030
 special application with whom 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.939
 Samsung support devices 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.820
 and it is convenient for example when you are there 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.049
 running in the morning 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.340
 yourself this giant phone can 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.250
 stay in one watch 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.049
 on the body there is only one button which 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.290
 is the home button and everything else 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.120
 controlled by swipe left right up 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.700
 and down 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.370
 yes hours have made a whole collection of different 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.280
 beautiful dials imitating 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.190
 real watches on them can see it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.739
 immediately and the weather charge level 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.700
 devices inside a dual-core clock 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.650
 1 GHz processor 512 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.319
 megabytes of RAM and 4 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.790
 no gigabytes of internal memory 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.989
 let micro slots beaten by us found 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.700
 it was therefore necessary 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.220
 settle for four 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.379
 gigabyte battery capacity 300 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.700
 milliamps per hour 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.470
 it's hard to say how much work is enough 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.109
 and hours but as long as we stood here and 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.849
 waited for the queue very many of 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.220
 exhibition samples already boarded 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.790
 waterproof housing standard 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.579
 ip67 that is, you can go to the shower 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.970
 there is a slight hit of water they do not harm 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.970
 will cause
