one<00:01:19.229> from<00:01:19.409> 1a<00:01:19.590> auto<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.460> pretty<00:01:21.390> much

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
one from 1a auto you can see pretty much

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.370 
one from 1a auto you can see pretty much
all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> same<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> connection<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.930> exactly

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
all the same the connection is exactly

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.170 
all the same the connection is exactly
the<00:01:25.500> same<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.670> bolt<00:01:26.970> in

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the same so it's going to go in bolt in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.280 
the same so it's going to go in bolt in
and<00:01:27.860> function<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> original

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
and function just like the original

00:01:30.290 --> 00:02:12.280
