00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
survived cancer and now so many

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.569 
survived cancer and now so many
different<00:01:46.409> organizations<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:47.130> asked<00:01:47.369> me<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
people are now wanting to do more

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.680 
people are now wanting to do more
alternative

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
alternative

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.360 
alternative
which<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.260> great<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.800> now<00:01:56.830> they're<00:01:57.070> wanting

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
which is great and now they're wanting

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.320 
which is great and now they're wanting
to<00:01:57.400> create<00:01:57.730> they're<00:01:57.940> doing<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.180> lot<00:01:58.300> of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
to create they're doing a lot of

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.780 
to create they're doing a lot of
research<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:59.020> find<00:01:59.230> less<00:01:59.530> toxic<00:02:00.100> ways<00:02:00.430> of

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
research to find less toxic ways of

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.040 
research to find less toxic ways of
create<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.330> know<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.690> treating<00:02:02.020> cancer

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
create you know of treating cancer

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.750 
create you know of treating cancer
because<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.680> lot<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:02.980> times<00:02:03.250> when<00:02:03.490> you're<00:02:03.610> doing

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
because a lot of times when you're doing

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.500 
because a lot of times when you're doing
chemotherapy<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.320> also<00:02:05.500> now<00:02:05.800> creating

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
chemotherapy it is also now creating

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.330 
chemotherapy it is also now creating
other<00:02:07.510> types<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.990> cancer<00:02:08.290> unfortunately<00:02:09.100> so

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
other types of cancer unfortunately so

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.650 
other types of cancer unfortunately so
now<00:02:09.520> they're<00:02:09.670> trying<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.970> find<00:02:10.210> different

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
now they're trying to find different

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.240 
now they're trying to find different
kind<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:10.869> types<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.440> chemotherapy<00:02:11.650> and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
kind of types of chemotherapy and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.800 
kind of types of chemotherapy and
treatments<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:12.820> you're<00:02:12.970> not<00:02:13.120> creating<00:02:13.570> more

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
treatments so you're not creating more

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.870 
treatments so you're not creating more
cancer<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.500> that's<00:02:14.620> what<00:02:14.860> I'm<00:02:14.950> loving<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.400> is

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
cancer so that's what I'm loving this is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.280 
cancer so that's what I'm loving this is
that<00:02:16.090> they're<00:02:16.180> trying<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.420> find<00:02:16.600> less<00:02:16.810> toxic

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
that they're trying to find less toxic

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.960 
that they're trying to find less toxic
ways<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.740> treating<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.160> cancer<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.760> that's

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
ways of treating the cancer so that's

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.550 
ways of treating the cancer so that's
what<00:02:19.150> I'm<00:02:19.240> loving<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.780> see<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.050> all<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.380> type

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
what I'm loving to see is all this type

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.350 
what I'm loving to see is all this type
of<00:02:20.590> research<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.310> did<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.940> do<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> lot<00:02:22.300> of

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
of research for that did you do a lot of

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.880 
of research for that did you do a lot of
alternative<00:02:22.870> therapy<00:02:23.170> just<00:02:23.350> even<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.680> terms

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
alternative therapy just even in terms

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.740 
alternative therapy just even in terms
of<00:02:24.100> nutrition<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.210> health<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.630> things

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
of nutrition and in health and things

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.000 
of nutrition and in health and things
like<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.140> when<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.380> were<00:02:26.470> while<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.800> was

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
like that when you were while I was

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.770 
like that when you were while I was
doing<00:02:27.130> my<00:02:27.220> chemotherapy<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.910> wasn't<00:02:28.540> able<00:02:28.630> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
doing my chemotherapy I wasn't able to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.570 
doing my chemotherapy I wasn't able to
do<00:02:28.960> that<00:02:29.110> right<00:02:29.500> after<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:29.890> was<00:02:30.100> able<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.370> do

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
do that right after I was able to do

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.700 
do that right after I was able to do
like<00:02:31.330> acupuncture<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.230> Chinese<00:02:32.260> medicine

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
like acupuncture and Chinese medicine

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.320 
like acupuncture and Chinese medicine
things<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.460> that<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:33.940> during<00:02:34.240> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
things like that but during the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.700 
things like that but during the
treatment<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.690> wasn't<00:02:34.960> able<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.230> because<00:02:35.590> they

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
treatment I wasn't able to because they

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.260 
treatment I wasn't able to because they
don't<00:02:35.830> want<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> interfere<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.700> course<00:02:36.970> of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
don't want to interfere of course of

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.610 
don't want to interfere of course of
course<00:02:37.300> but<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:37.750> kind<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:38.050> nice<00:02:38.230> balance

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
course but it's kind of a nice balance

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.570 
course but it's kind of a nice balance
between<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.980> Eastern<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.550> Western

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
between that Eastern and Western

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.460 
between that Eastern and Western
philosophy<00:02:40.210> definitely<00:02:40.750> yes<00:02:41.170> because<00:02:41.290> I'm

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
philosophy definitely yes because I'm

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.300 
philosophy definitely yes because I'm
all<00:02:41.560> about<00:02:41.590> that

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
all about that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.000 
all about that
