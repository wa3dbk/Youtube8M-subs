some of which have been used before and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.179 
some of which have been used before and
someone<00:00:20.910> new<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> MMOs<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.920> weapon<00:00:23.130> is

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
someone new to the MMOs the weapon is

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
hand there on the dagger and pistol and
make<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> also<00:00:30.929> use<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> short<00:00:31.470> boil<00:00:31.679> which

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
make it also use a short boil which

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.520 
make it also use a short boil which
two-handed<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> thieves<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.230> special

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
two-handed so the thieves have special

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.260 
two-handed so the thieves have special
skills<00:00:34.620> became<00:00:34.980> unique<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> them<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
skills became unique to them one of

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.479 
skills became unique to them one of
which<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.630> stealth<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.100> very<00:00:38.219> typical

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
which is stealth this is very typical

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270 
which is stealth this is very typical
first<00:00:38.969> kind<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.300> class<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.230> MMO<00:00:40.590> genre<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
first kind of class of the MMO genre and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970 
first kind of class of the MMO genre and
so<00:00:42.059> within<00:00:42.870> Google's<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.410> stealth<00:00:43.739> has<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so within Google's to stealth has a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.790 
so within Google's to stealth has a
ninja<00:00:44.340> duration<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.320> just<00:00:46.320> basically<00:00:46.559> makes

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
ninja duration and just basically makes

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319 
ninja duration and just basically makes
you<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.190> sneak<00:00:47.370> around<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.090> not

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you so you can sneak around and not

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.450 
you so you can sneak around and not
pellagra<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:49.469> kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.950> typical<00:00:50.280> stuff

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pellagra just kind of the typical stuff

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.680 
pellagra just kind of the typical stuff
you<00:00:50.640> probably<00:00:50.760> kind<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
you probably kind of know what the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.020 
you probably kind of know what the
function<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.250> seconds<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.730> shadow

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
function will be the seconds go shadow

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.240 
function will be the seconds go shadow
step<00:00:54.270> further<00:00:54.989> step<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> teleport

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
step further step is like a teleport

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
step further step is like a teleport
mechanic<00:00:56.640> which<00:00:57.180> allows<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.780> profession<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
mechanic which allows the profession to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.110 
mechanic which allows the profession to
like<00:00:58.530> teleport<00:00:59.039> into<00:00:59.160> battle<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.670> out<00:00:59.910> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
like teleport into battle and out of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.660 
like teleport into battle and out of
battle<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.590> feed<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.980> only<00:01:02.190> shadows

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
battle but the feed can only shadows

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
battle but the feed can only shadows
there<00:01:02.879> where<00:01:03.239> no<00:01:03.270> movement<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.350> actually

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
there where no movement it's actually

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
there where no movement it's actually
possible<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.489> can't<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.760> teleport<00:01:06.270> through

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
possible it can't just teleport through

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.330 
possible it can't just teleport through
light<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> mountain<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.680> something<00:01:08.280> like

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
light up a mountain or something like

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
light up a mountain or something like
that<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:09.030> actually<00:01:09.330> successful<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that has to be actually successful you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.800 
that has to be actually successful you
can<00:01:10.290> walk<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.830> well<00:01:11.390> traps<00:01:12.390> are<00:01:12.510> loving

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
can walk there as well traps are loving

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.090 
can walk there as well traps are loving
UNIX<00:01:13.110> clip<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.439> thieves<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
UNIX clip to the thieves and this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.499 
UNIX clip to the thieves and this
basically<00:01:14.400> allows<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> lay<00:01:15.060> down<00:01:15.090> traps

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
basically allows them to lay down traps

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.240 
basically allows them to lay down traps
and<00:01:15.750> ambush<00:01:16.020> unsuspecting<00:01:16.229> enemies<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and ambush unsuspecting enemies and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.700 
and ambush unsuspecting enemies and
control<00:01:17.610> areas<00:01:18.020> like<00:01:19.020> losing<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> names<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
control areas like losing the names to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.219 
control areas like losing the names to
be<00:01:19.860> honest<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.330> thief<00:01:21.509> also<00:01:21.840> has<00:01:21.990> many

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
be honest so the thief also has many

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.899 
be honest so the thief also has many
unique<00:01:22.560> mechanics<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.790> which<00:01:23.880> is

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
unique mechanics one of which is

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
unique mechanics one of which is
initiative<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> thieves

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
initiative so this is the thieves

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.969 
initiative so this is the thieves
resource<00:01:26.729> mechanic<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> thief<00:01:28.770> will

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
resource mechanic and so the thief will

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
resource mechanic and so the thief will
have<00:01:29.159> 10<00:01:29.640> initiative<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:30.869> refill

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
have 10 initiative and these will refill

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980 
have 10 initiative and these will refill
at<00:01:31.560> array<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> second<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:33.540> first<00:01:33.780> kill

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
at array of one a second your first kill

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.109 
at array of one a second your first kill
always<00:01:34.590> costs<00:01:34.920> no<00:01:35.189> initiative<00:01:35.700> whatsoever

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
always costs no initiative whatsoever

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.630 
always costs no initiative whatsoever
although<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.229> abilities<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.829> cost<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> will

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
although of abilities do cost and will

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520
