00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.980
 stems is still the leader there is a 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.290
 feeling so important that is that of 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.170
 stay here that is something maybe 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.599
 patriot could be the word the fact 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.160
 of betting on the reinvestment order 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.160
 in Peru and to follow this 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.750

 little the spirit of calera the only 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.800
 way that we know forward as 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.650
 society is really working together 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.790

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.040
 bringing out the best in us and improving it 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.240
 of nature to do it together not 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.860
 in an isolated way as we come 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.110
 doing it until now and that's also 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.110
 something that we have learned so much this year 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.269
 as in form think that to be all 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.060
 well to be good has to be 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.799
 all right then it 's like all 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.799
 we grow up not only me 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.360
 the calera takes special care with the 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.020
 environment and is socially 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.020
 responsable 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.790
 two 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.039
 Y 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.529
 and did a lot of sport one of the 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.040
 sports that way is the oars and the oar 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.380
 is this 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.180
 when it competes are 2 km in the first 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.010
 500 meters are members and pass them 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.780
 genres that is about dying you are not going to 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.790
 can one realize that always one 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.380
 can more than you think 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.000
 because of the pace since that experience 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.580
 that I could more than I always believed 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.260
 and where the business has been the same 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.450
 when he started doing business and 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.980
 come the problems you think you do not 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.630
 you can more but if you can more 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.420
 and that experience I was rowing in 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.950
 the strength I have had in my life 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.310
 always look a little more than what one 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.310
