00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello welcome to another tuto Tuesday 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:09.330
 because you asked for it today I'm going to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.049
 draw a tree start drawing from 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.610
 very tenuous way the general form of 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.220
 tree 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.860
 This helps me to make sure it goes 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.800
 to fit on paper and how it's going to 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.950
 develop already having this first 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.610
 I draw a guide then I start to draw 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.599
 it's really going to be an old tree and with 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.599
 personality 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.750
 deleted the lines that no longer serve me 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.600
 I make it visible roots 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.050
 both in the roots and the trunk and 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.570
 branches use straight lines that are going 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.570
 cutting and making the way 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.220
 on this side I'm going to put two more 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:10.590
 trees of different type for these 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.590
 I also use some straight lines 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.160
 and back to my old tree is going to have a 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.150
 hole that may be the house of the bulk 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.150
 what I did the other day 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.420
 do not fill them flat because 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.550
 besides the normal shadows it's going to 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.550
 have knots and cavities 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.080
 the paper that I am using is paper 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.260
 for fine grain drawing this wants 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.050
 say that it has texture this texture is 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.510
 ideal for drawing trees and for 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.770
 get more juice I'm using a 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.880
 lace 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.330
 2b that is somewhat flat at the moment 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.670
 illuminated the tree if you will use it very 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.670
 sharp the grain would hardly be seen 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.759
 in this landscape I will have a first 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.679
 plane with the main tree a second 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.680
 plane that serves me as a medium shot 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.319
 with the other two trees and a third 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.000
 plane that is going to be a distance with a 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.460
 pair of hills 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.120
 the foreground should always be more 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.580
 sharp and contrasting blacks are 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.080
 much more blacks and whites if the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.570
 I would have white whites 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.880
 the intermediate plane is already losing 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.810
 these contrasts and what is the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.080
 distance would look much dimmer and something 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.450
 safo here although we have good eyesight 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.720
 as it is so far away and we are 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.390
 looking through the atmosphere is like 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.790
 contemplate it through a glass something 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.790
 tarnished is going to look a little 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.370
 I use a moldable eraser to give a 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.849
 effect of haze and step a brush for 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.390
 blur and blur what 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.319
 is further back 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.319
 reinforcement the foreground 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.810
 on the hill behind there is another kind of 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.230
 tree are these three cypresses of the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.120
 family of the pines and very 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.660
 characteristic because they are thin and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.260
 tall 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.320
 blurred with the brush and work in the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.120
 fog this was not seen because the hill 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.120
 I needed to be darker 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.400
 remember that the first plane has to 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.690
 contrast with respect to the back 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.570
 so I reinforce it even more 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.880
 I make the leaves as if by piles 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.880
 with the shadows on the side below 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.970
 the intermediate plane has to be more 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.379
 dark that what's up back like that is that 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.379
 I will also reinforce it a bit 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.850
 you are already in the comments 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.850
 tell me what you think 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.690
 if you liked it please give it a like and 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.280
 subscribe to the channel you know where 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.830
 follow me and where are the links 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.830
 See you next Tuesday
