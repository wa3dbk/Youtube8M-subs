00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 what then what are you like swing 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.310
 cross and good I bring you a new 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.290
 non-premium server this server will 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.139
 call the dragons hammer as you see here 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.580
 is this the logo with the initials with 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.950
 the troll cloud that is covering the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.109
 initials but good this one how can 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.880
 see this server to me he called me quite 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.130
 the attention of a start since I saw the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.660
 obvious be the sight pretty worked and 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.939
 I like that because many times 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.010
 you enter a server this and you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.310
 You find a lobby made shit according to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.320
 I saw nothing worked and it was pretty bad 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.790
 impression but here as you can see there 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.070
 are the balloons this is 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.750
 here we have the logo and of course then 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.830
 the games not over there games of the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.320
 hungry' 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.060
 tuchel and since I do not know what's going well 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.470
 that but good 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.530
 survival factions mini games more than 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.500
 you take voice or image I do not know that as 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.330
 want to pronounce it dragon slayer 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.030
 the dragon titan that seems not yet 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.790
 is open like what are you doing or 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.230
 something like that but good the case is 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.150
 there are many games like that 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.030
 they are adding or I like that 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 that's also a Basque one point 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.470
 quite in favor but good as always 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.000
 everything is in the description right now 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.590
 I will show if very above what 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 is the server and others and you why me 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.920
 you are hitting 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.630
 you will not even save to walk here and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.950
 then walk there or just 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.170
 right click 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.939
 to this little book and you get all the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.659
 forest there is from survival or be the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.690
 typical of factions we can even have 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.390
 until the scanner that would be like 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.070
 a one version of the ghost craft no yes 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.070
 yes they saw the crust video that I made 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.869
 recently, that is like a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 version of that not that there is a ghost the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.960
 ghost has to kill all the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.390
 players obviously this ghost is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.789
 invisible and all players must 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.800
 Survive or kill the ghost 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.409
 this one is pretty good I like it 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.060
 quite quite this server not yet 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.580
 has tried some games like this one 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.190
 which is the assassin's dragon that I do not know about 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.899
 what's still here, we have another 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.119
 that has not proven that it is called then the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.030
 baseball are massive as they want to say it 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.799
 but they also have games like games 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.310
 of hunger 'has therefore the typical 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.650
 mini games has hardcore and other other 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.959
 good things there is that I can 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.850
 show is that you are trying to 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.600
 get in but he 's struggling like that 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.340
 has some little problems right now 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.050
 good that can show you we are going to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.240
 try this so- called dragon to 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.790
 see how it is going to be is to see 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.550
 that already comes out in red like it's not there 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.530
 is open to one I do not know sometimes either 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.230
 let me in, they look at him and they leave 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.490
 red letters but the one that we can give them 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.870
 let's go in here hunger games 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.910
 fast or I'm not going to get into any 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.980
 game I'm just going to show you by 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.660
 what then I think I think we should all 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.360
 of knowing games of hunger I do not know I do not know 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.220
 why would I show them and here we have 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.580
 everything is here are all the maps 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.820
 maps for 24 people here of how many 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.210
 people of 48 people and from here of 24 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.310
 people also to see what these says or 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.800
 that the team speak if they want to talk 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.950
 and here there is no longer absolutely 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.980
 nothing 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.780
 this grouper this is good stress here is 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.550
 the map this is the map not what it's called 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.040
 but I think I've already seen it if it's the 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.980
 typical that there there are caves and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.440
 others yes there are a lot of pitfalls to 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.269
 see how many people there are to see 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.370
 over there all the people all my 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.810
 opponents obviously I'm not going to 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.209
 play the full game simply 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.810
 I repeat is to show you are not no 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.730
 not for this complete game like I can 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.129
 do after a special series for 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.989
 Hunger games but good you can 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.849
 do what is being done later 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.690
 fast filling you 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.340
 shogun over there freeman guild gamer with 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.140
 marc 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.060
 well, my opponents come back 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.010
 now that I fixed end if there are enough 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.420
 enough people that is premium or if there 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.579
 one that another that is not premium out there 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.319
 there is a premium 1 but as you see the great 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.579
 most are premium I miss it there 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:11.110
 there's another non-premium dropped another premium 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:15.910
 more time faster to see how it goes 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:18.420
 I do not want to win all seized 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.420
 of everything 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.720
 because here for this 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.470
 you are, you can not even 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.470
 take off joker 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:40.390
 ok nothing at all take off to grab things 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:43.240
 I'm going to hit for good, let's see 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.680
 what maybe when more about 12 minutes or 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.500
 be not no I do not want I do not want to do it very 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.050
 long the battle I thought they were were 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.300
 They were giant caves and I was wrong 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.400
 seem 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.870
 to see there is a person let me see if he could 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.819
 kill someone I want some action 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.159
 so direct I go to the kamikaze because 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.680
 I tell them I want 12 minutes just from 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.180
 video to see how it goes osea 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.710
 how fluid it goes that does not go too messy 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.100
 for my baby, stop coming with pita 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.100
 fax 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.050
 of 70 for all the flash 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.780
 I can hit them 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.780
 good 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.720
 I think we can not do anything 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.000
 we still can not do anything good for 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.010
 here there is nothing 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.560
 I can not hit him, it seems like there's 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.720
 certain time of d 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.590
 like three good so to speak those who 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.500
 you can not hit anyone 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.569
 let's go here 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.740
 come on so I can hit this 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.199
 I do not think it 's the pnc because 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.600
 I would have felt because I do not think that 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.660
 be the 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:57.300
 this has nothing has nothing 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.300
 has the helmet or not 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:15.159
 he is no longer alive 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:16.779
 I have a chance playing the whole game 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.219
 because if you have not put me to think that 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.040
 It is very rare that you touch a sword of 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:22.380
 steel in the pure start 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.690
 well let's see how much I can stand 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.030
 see I do not go up life that more than is 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.680
 no more than that 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.500
 here is someone here someone here 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.350
 someone I'm going for you 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.750
 at the entrance 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:41.220
 or if you are also going to open here to see that 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.220
 I take you I help you 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.580
 I do not forget that this is here 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.660
 what other peace was rightly caught 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.300
 from far away with twitter 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.140
 twitter the feet 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.140
 dance Dance Dance 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.560
 fuck 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.380
 I think it's capacity ended up winning 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.900
 this with the game 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.600
 if I start to think I could even win 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.150
 well this one seemed like if I beat you if you 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.910
 I kill myself 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.460
 I was talking about maybe I was good 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:23.330
 that is practically all arrive as 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:26.780
 a simple above we were not wanted 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.370
 do not a super show but 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.510
 well you ended up gone here as 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.890
 always everything will be the description 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.050
 so that you can enter 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.550
 server and well I hope I have them 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.570
 liked this video and see you until the 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.570
 next war
