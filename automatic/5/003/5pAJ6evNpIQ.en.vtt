know as to his name and pretty much what

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
for a lot of people this isn't really

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
for a lot of people this isn't really
that<00:01:29.970> big<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.329> deal<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.350> can

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that big of a deal because you can

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.719 
that big of a deal because you can
pretty<00:01:31.710> much<00:01:31.799> survive<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.400> dimi

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
pretty much survive because dimi

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.950 
pretty much survive because dimi
obviously<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.600> doing<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.840> very

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
obviously is going to be doing a very

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.230 
obviously is going to be doing a very
small<00:01:34.290> amount<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.650> damage<00:01:35.070> whenever<00:01:36.060> your

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
small amount of damage whenever your

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210 
small amount of damage whenever your
lower<00:01:36.479> health<00:01:36.780> pools<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.500> make<00:01:38.040> sure<00:01:38.070> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
lower health pools and so make sure that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710 
lower health pools and so make sure that
you<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.880> try<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.150> stay<00:01:39.420> keep

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you don't just try and stay keep

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.969 
you don't just try and stay keep
yourself<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.290> hundred<00:01:40.350> percent<00:01:40.530> health

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
yourself at one hundred percent health

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.530 
yourself at one hundred percent health
because<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.729> extra<00:01:42.090> stressful

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
because it's going to be extra stressful

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.270 
because it's going to be extra stressful
when<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> doesn't<00:01:42.899> really<00:01:43.110> need<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.530> now

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
when it doesn't really need to be now

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
when it doesn't really need to be now
shadow<00:01:44.549> spike<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.149> interrupted<00:01:45.390> Demi<00:01:45.960> can

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
shadow spike can be interrupted Demi can

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200 
shadow spike can be interrupted Demi can
and<00:01:46.649> child<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.189> also<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.909> spell

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and child so it can also be a spell

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.639 
and child so it can also be a spell
reflected<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> warrior<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.500> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
reflected if you're a warrior and so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.920 
reflected if you're a warrior and so
that's<00:01:49.799> pretty<00:01:50.070> nice<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.869> said

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that's pretty nice this is as I said

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.690 
that's pretty nice this is as I said
before<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.470> pretty<00:01:52.829> difficult<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.340> solo

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
before this is pretty difficult to solo

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.399 
before this is pretty difficult to solo
and<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> warrior<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.899> would<00:01:55.140> recommend

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and as a warrior I would recommend

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.530 
and as a warrior I would recommend
having<00:01:55.680> definitely<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.579> good<00:01:56.729> gear<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.240> i'm

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
having definitely very good gear and i'm

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.880 
having definitely very good gear and i'm
using<00:01:57.810> second<00:01:58.200> win<00:01:58.350> which<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.680> kind<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
using second win which is kind of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.469 
using second win which is kind of
carrying<00:01:59.280> me<00:01:59.399> through<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
carrying me through this and so I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.060 
carrying me through this and so I
definitely<00:02:01.079> don't<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.770> here

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
definitely don't just go in here

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.440 
definitely don't just go in here
thinking<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.060> able<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> kill<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
thinking you can be able to kill this

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.209 
thinking you can be able to kill this
without<00:02:03.689> really<00:02:03.899> much<00:02:04.110> trouble<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.860> prop

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
without really much trouble as a prop

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.380 
without really much trouble as a prop
warrior<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> would<00:02:05.790> assume<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.240> be

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
warrior I would assume it would be

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.540 
warrior I would assume it would be
significantly<00:02:06.930> easier<00:02:07.020> though<00:02:07.619> now<00:02:08.310> there's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
significantly easier though now there's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.770 
significantly easier though now there's
two<00:02:08.789> main<00:02:08.970> reasons<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.420> you're<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
two main reasons that you're going to

two main reasons that you're going to
want<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.520> another<00:02:11.520> actually<00:02:12.180> three

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
want to do this another actually three

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.559 
want to do this another actually three
one<00:02:13.020> reason

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
one reason

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.729 
one reason
is<00:02:13.629> whenever<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.049> kill<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.319> guy<00:02:14.499> for<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
is whenever you kill this guy for the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.989 
is whenever you kill this guy for the
first<00:02:14.920> time<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.280> imido<00:02:15.549> so<00:02:15.609> you<00:02:15.790> get<00:02:15.909> an

battle pets a very very good battle pet

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.750 
battle pets a very very good battle pet
because<00:02:28.749> it<00:02:29.019> has<00:02:29.139> very<00:02:29.379> high<00:02:29.469> damage<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.489> as

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
because it has very high damage and as

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.599 
because it has very high damage and as
very<00:02:31.060> high<00:02:31.209> attack<00:02:31.450> damage<00:02:31.689> and<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:33.370> just

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
very high attack damage and that just

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.819 
very high attack damage and that just
it's<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.389> very<00:02:34.780> useful<00:02:35.260> pretty<00:02:35.500> much<00:02:35.680> on

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
it's just very useful pretty much on

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.830 
it's just very useful pretty much on
that<00:02:35.859> alone<00:02:36.219> and<00:02:36.549> it's<00:02:36.670> also<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.939> magic<00:02:37.359> pad<00:02:37.599> and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
that alone and it's also a magic pad and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.140 
that alone and it's also a magic pad and
so<00:02:38.439> it's<00:02:38.590> very<00:02:38.739> good<00:02:39.040> i<00:02:39.159> guess<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> glass<00:02:39.669> cannon

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
so it's very good i guess a glass cannon

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.629 
so it's very good i guess a glass cannon
type<00:02:40.389> of<00:02:40.540> type<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.109> pet<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.469> the<00:02:42.159> third<00:02:42.489> reason

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709

and it's very easy to find groups for
him<00:04:14.829> in<00:04:15.129> the<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.759> the<00:04:15.819> pre-made<00:04:16.570> group<00:04:16.780> finder

him in the in the pre-made group finder
and<00:04:17.440> it's<00:04:17.560> also<00:04:17.709> very<00:04:17.979> easy<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.669> want<00:04:18.909> to<00:04:19.060> Seoul

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.759 
and it's also very easy to want to Seoul
him<00:04:19.509> if<00:04:19.719> you<00:04:19.840> have<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.049> right<00:04:20.169> type<00:04:20.409> of<00:04:20.440> class
