00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
even if Derrick Rose was playing and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
even if Derrick Rose was playing and
dying<00:01:44.009> was<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> hundred<00:01:44.610> percent<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.240> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
dying was a hundred percent and you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.450 
dying was a hundred percent and you
ain't<00:01:45.600> done<00:01:46.049> him<00:01:46.200> account<00:01:46.500> Kirk<00:01:46.890> Hinrich<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.430> a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
ain't done him account Kirk Hinrich as a

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.370 
ain't done him account Kirk Hinrich as a
player<00:01:47.759> he's<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> joke<00:01:48.299> will<00:01:48.479> player<00:01:48.689> anyway<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
player he's a joke will player anyway I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200 
player he's a joke will player anyway I
didn't<00:01:49.979> count<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.549> even<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.820> those<00:01:50.939> two

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
didn't count that but even if those two

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.819 
didn't count that but even if those two
guys<00:01:51.390> were<00:01:51.659> healthy<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.049> still<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.590> matter

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
guys were healthy and still what matter

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.039 
guys were healthy and still what matter
the<00:01:53.040> heat<00:01:53.250> would<00:01:53.490> win<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> heats

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the heat would win I think the heats

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.780 
the heat would win I think the heats
just<00:01:55.170> coasting<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:56.009> right<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.280> against<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
just coasting by right now against the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.249 
just coasting by right now against the
Bulls<00:01:57.000> because<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.509> know<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> Bulls<00:01:57.960> can't

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
Bulls because they know the Bulls can't

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.780 
Bulls because they know the Bulls can't
beat<00:01:58.409> them<00:01:58.880> they<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:01.320> long<00:02:01.619> as

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
beat them they know that so as long as

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.060 
beat them they know that so as long as
LeBron<00:02:02.790> James<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.299> playing<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.920> going

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
LeBron James is playing it's not going

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.069 
LeBron James is playing it's not going
to<00:02:05.159> happen<00:02:05.280> for<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.700> derrick<00:02:05.969> rose<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.960> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
to happen for you derrick rose and I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.050 
to happen for you derrick rose and I
think<00:02:07.350> Derrick<00:02:07.649> Rose<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.280> starting<00:02:08.970> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
think Derrick Rose is starting to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.750 
think Derrick Rose is starting to
realize<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.599> i<00:02:09.629> think<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.400> it's<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.670> be

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
realize that i think is it's going to be

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.940 
realize that i think is it's going to be
difficult<00:02:11.970> yeah<00:02:12.780> I'm<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:13.080> saying<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.680> be

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
difficult yeah I'm not saying it to be

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.800 
difficult yeah I'm not saying it to be
main<00:02:14.069> or<00:02:14.280> upset<00:02:14.670> anybody<00:02:14.910> out<00:02:15.300> there<00:02:15.540> I'm<00:02:15.660> just

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
main or upset anybody out there I'm just

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.199 
main or upset anybody out there I'm just
if<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.590> look<00:02:16.770> at<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.010> that's<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> way<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
if you look at it that's the way it

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.940 
if you look at it that's the way it
looks<00:02:18.420> Derrick<00:02:18.810> Rose<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.230> possibly<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
looks Derrick Rose is possibly going to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.540 
looks Derrick Rose is possibly going to
have<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.220> go<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> another<00:02:20.670> team<00:02:22.459> possibly<00:02:23.459> do

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
have to go to another team possibly do

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.570 
have to go to another team possibly do

that because I know there are probably a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.460 
that because I know there are probably a
four<00:02:26.819> year<00:02:27.060> age<00:02:27.239> difference<00:02:27.269> for<00:02:27.900> James<00:02:28.170> and
