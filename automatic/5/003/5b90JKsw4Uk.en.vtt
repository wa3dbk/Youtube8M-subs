00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.800
 of everything 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.360
 one hour 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.390
 all 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.590
 when I can 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.610
 in this tutorial I will explain how 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.010
 change boot logo 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.410
 windows 8 for that we're going to need the 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.030
 ex tour program then singer that I'm going to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.570
 leave in comments the link to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.610
 download and we will execute it and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.830
 We give the back picture and select the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.290
 image that we want we want food for 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.260
 one that we want to put on the logo of 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.660
 boot we selected the area to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.050
 select what is going to be done in 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.390
 the image and we give the button this 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.339
 step number 2 where they will transform the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:07.170
 image bmp age then something everything 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:10.409
 an a3 generate butrich and generate the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.130
 Celebes automatically and then we 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.620
 let's make a backup of our 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.420
 windows image by default by itself a 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.830
 will start well does not show us well 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.740
 image to have a copy of our 2 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.329
 default 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.440
 we give you a click and before we go we go 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.870
 to go to the pasta 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.610
 in this way and we are going to select the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.690
 turn it on off 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:44.800
 sandra an eyelash and we give to 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.350
 to the button button once restarted in 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.520
 theory should already come our our 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.850
 logo but we will see that it appears 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.150
 down on the right on the label 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.150
 windows 8 of the version and such for 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.810
 remove I have put another program that is 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:09.430
 call my music and water marker editor and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.950
 that I will also put in comments 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.380
 so you can download it and execute it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.480
 in administrator mode we give plinius 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.890
 settings will take a while and it's already 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.630
 would be to take it away what is 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.630
 the bottom mark of 128
