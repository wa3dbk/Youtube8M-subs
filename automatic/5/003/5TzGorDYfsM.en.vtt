00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
Minecraft Pocket Edition probably will

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.010 
Minecraft Pocket Edition probably will
not<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.559> red<00:00:40.770> stone<00:00:41.040> until<00:00:41.280> next<00:00:41.579> year<00:00:42.020> so

shoot build it in the sky so you guys

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
shoot build it in the sky so you guys
can<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.579> how<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.880> works<00:02:00.060> better<00:02:00.649> it's<00:02:01.649> going

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
can see how this works better it's going

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.730 
can see how this works better it's going
to<00:02:01.950> break<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.939> build<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
to break that you just build a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.719 
to break that you just build a
three-block<00:02:04.740> platform

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.390 

so<00:02:09.629> then<00:02:09.840> there's<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.769> a<00:02:11.099> little

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
so then there's going to be a little

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.600 
so then there's going to be a little
space<00:02:11.700> where<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.150> door<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.629> going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.319> be

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
space where the door is going to be

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.289 
space where the door is going to be
that's<00:02:14.610> where<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.879> doors<00:02:15.090> going<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:20.299> wait

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
that's where the doors going to be wait

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.470 
that's where the doors going to be wait
that's<00:02:21.540> right<00:02:21.659> i<00:02:21.840> forgot<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.470> block<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:24.330> will

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that's right i forgot a block you will

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420 
that's right i forgot a block you will
also<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.260> most<00:02:25.470> important<00:02:26.010> thing<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.310> don't

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
also the most important thing you don't

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.100 
also the most important thing you don't
need<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> water<00:02:26.910> bucket<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.450> forgot<00:02:27.870> it's

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
need a water bucket I forgot it's

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.520 
need a water bucket I forgot it's
different<00:02:29.269> water<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.569> how<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.049> contraption

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
different water is how this contraption

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.619 
different water is how this contraption
works<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.519> in<00:02:32.610> order<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.849> switch<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.480> need

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
works but in order to switch you need

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.619 
works but in order to switch you need
ice<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.410> hope<00:02:34.739> oh<00:02:35.040> yes<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.180> also<00:02:36.329> need

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
ice and I hope oh yes and you also need

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.649 
ice and I hope oh yes and you also need
glowstone<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.799> order<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.909> activate<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
glowstone in order to activate the

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.839 
glowstone in order to activate the
switch<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.860> glowstone<00:02:41.340> will<00:02:41.519> basically

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
switch so the glowstone will basically

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.530 
switch so the glowstone will basically
be<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.150> button<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.720> you'll<00:02:42.900> press<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.819> let's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
be the button that you'll press so let's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.960 
be the button that you'll press so let's
just<00:02:45.840> pull<00:02:46.230> make<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.650> switch<00:02:46.890> right<00:02:47.099> there<00:02:49.970> so

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
just pull make the switch right there so

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.309 
just pull make the switch right there so
I'm<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.180> place<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.599> ice<00:02:51.750> down<00:02:52.049> last

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
I'm going to place the ice down last

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.479 
I'm going to place the ice down last
because<00:02:52.680> hopefully<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.069> doesn't<00:02:53.250> melt

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
because hopefully it doesn't melt

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.930 
torture so anyway let's just continue
making<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.540> path<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:47.250> water's<00:03:47.639> going<00:03:47.819> to

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
making the path the water's going to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.839 
making the path the water's going to
travel<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:50.069> you're<00:03:50.370> probably<00:03:50.609> already

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
travel to and you're probably already

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.759 
travel to and you're probably already
understanding<00:03:51.599> now<00:03:51.720> how<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.049> works<00:03:52.260> probably

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
understanding now how it works probably

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.729 
understanding now how it works probably
one<00:03:52.889> of<00:03:52.919> those<00:03:53.069> Oh<00:03:54.019> moments<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:55.169> that's<00:03:55.410> how<00:03:55.620> it

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
one of those Oh moments so that's how it

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.509 
one of those Oh moments so that's how it
works<00:03:56.329> yes<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:58.010> basically<00:03:59.010> what's<00:03:59.250> going<00:03:59.459> to

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
works yes so basically what's going to

works yes so basically what's going to
happen<00:03:59.790> is<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.030> water<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.359> going<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.599> run<00:04:00.780> down

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
happen is the water is going to run down

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.670 
happen is the water is going to run down
here<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.560> go<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.209> torch<00:04:03.480> break<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.470> torch

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
here and go to the torch break the torch

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.800 
here and go to the torch break the torch
when<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:04.949> water<00:04:05.129> hits<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.579> Santana<00:04:05.879> fall<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
when the water hits it Santana fall and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.199 
when the water hits it Santana fall and
the<00:04:07.590> door<00:04:07.799> will<00:04:08.099> disappear<00:04:08.639> but<00:04:08.819> i'll<00:04:08.970> just

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
the door will disappear but i'll just

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.580 
the door will disappear but i'll just
show<00:04:09.389> you<00:04:09.419> so<00:04:09.810> anyway<00:04:10.019> how<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.199> switch<00:04:10.470> is

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
show you so anyway how the switch is

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.800 
show you so anyway how the switch is
going<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.799> work<00:04:10.919> you<00:04:11.579> could<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:11.819> use<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.269> water

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
going to work you could just use a water

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.370 
going to work you could just use a water
bucket<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.440> just<00:04:13.709> put<00:04:14.549> water<00:04:14.760> there<00:04:15.169> but<00:04:16.169> I've

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
bucket and just put water there but I've

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.500 
bucket and just put water there but I've
decided<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.280> make<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.459> like<00:04:17.700> a<00:04:17.729> switch<00:04:18.209> like

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
decided to make it like a switch like

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.650 
decided to make it like a switch like
thing<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.109> he<00:04:20.070> put<00:04:20.370> ice<00:04:20.579> here

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
thing so he put ice here

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.130 
thing so he put ice here
and<00:04:21.870> then<00:04:22.200> we<00:04:23.300> could<00:04:24.300> block<00:04:24.570> here<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:24.960> water

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
and then we could block here so water

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.930 
and then we could block here so water
doesn't<00:04:25.230> flood<00:04:25.740> inside<00:04:26.100> we<00:04:26.220> put<00:04:26.400> ice<00:04:26.580> there

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
doesn't flood inside we put ice there

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.240 
doesn't flood inside we put ice there
and<00:04:27.240> then<00:04:27.930> we<00:04:28.020> put<00:04:28.230> glow<00:04:28.470> stone<00:04:28.740> on<00:04:28.890> top<00:04:28.920> of<00:04:29.190> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
and then we put glow stone on top of the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.120 
and then we put glow stone on top of the
ice<00:04:30.170> glowstone<00:04:31.170> will<00:04:31.380> eventually<00:04:31.800> melt<00:04:32.010> the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
ice glowstone will eventually melt the

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.110 
that's how it works so a door that has
activated<00:05:28.440> my<00:05:28.620> switch<00:05:28.860> pretty<00:05:29.190> cool<00:05:29.340> I'll

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
activated my switch pretty cool I'll

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.720 
activated my switch pretty cool I'll
just<00:05:30.450> go<00:05:30.810> ahead<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.020> play<00:05:31.230> it<00:05:31.260> again<00:05:31.730> once

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
just go ahead and play it again once

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:39.830 
just go ahead and play it again once
