00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.700
 [Music] 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.319
 we are in world era 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.030
 we all expect the same as Argentina 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.679
 bring the world cup good by 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.000
 that the idea is to talk to the girls of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.040
 female soccer club so that we 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.230
 tell how they live it good from here 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.830
 from your place as a river player 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.630
 how are you living brasil-2014 well very 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.300
 well for being very emotional I feel that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.609
 Argentina from minor to major and I think that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.099
 It is not that far to lift the cup like 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.080
 it was thought before for now calm no 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820
 because it's the first round let's say 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.180
 lateral that was easier on the papers 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.260
 it was not so easy inside the court and 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 if we change training habits 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.700
 to see the matches we 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.890
 We would gather either to have lunch out with 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.809
 the girls of the national team always 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.370
 we join parties and more than anything 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.170
 I have feelings as very 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.940
 skin flower because I know what it is to be 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.770
 inside a court I have the pleasure of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.340
 to be able to do it every Sunday and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.070
 train and seeing what sometimes some 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.420
 he does not move he decides to inm podés 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 get close a little play the ball 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.629
 something I do not know is like feelings 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.000
 they are all together 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.280
 and not so much I'm not looking so much for the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.619
 theme of the times but here with the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.950
 girls are scoring in the picks 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.590
 tour all with my companions also from 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.000
 school I tell them pass me the results 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.970
 had the so far had the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.610
 world cup favorite of the entire world 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.560
 I think van persie's header 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.080
 holland against Spain I liked it 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.590
 much outside of Argentina the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.650
 colombian of james s 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.290
 the volley was nice goal the one of james 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.290
 greater the one of colombia business of 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.720
 australia the best one by james rodríguez 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.580
 and if Argentina is not the champion because 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.250
 select posts 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.640
 Holland but I think it 's Argentina 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.160
 without a doubt if it says by France of here in 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.900
 South America I like Colombia but 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.930
 without holland is doing a world 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.620
 spectacular I love usa out there 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.660
 another selection that likes apart colombia 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.960
 I love the coach this storm 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.330
 it's good holland I like a lot 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.600
 more personally I like the game that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.640
 and I see a candidate has to follow the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.890
 players or it can be the same the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.830
 cutest player that you think of the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.540
 world and the player that you partner that 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.340
 It really is the best so far 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.920
 the one that stood out the most in all of these 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.770
 matches the one that is more than stressed 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.459
 more I think it's james rodríguez 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.340
 colombia and the cutest for me but 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.620
 for me it is andújar but because of 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.590
 before 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.049
 at a cute level 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.970
 uuuu has a rasta boy that 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.300
 It looks nice and 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.100
 as a player I like benzema de france 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.430
 and the most outstanding according to Argentina without 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.080
 I doubt it is messi and it's cuter 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.020
 is that I do not remember I 've been 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.630
 I ask for help of the player's harrows on 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.420
 to play 5 of us maria garro that you 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.800
 choose the same one also if that does not 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:14.490
 I agree the name so if you do not know 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:17.290
 I do not see the face but the number does not 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.500
 find out who is then 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.019
 and good and I'm looking to choose and well then 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.530
 yes because I love how he plays the 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.799
 second charm 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.920
 the most outstanding I find di Maria in 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.590
 the delivery that is physically comfortable 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.920
 for the team the 90 minutes and the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.060
 cutest player back we voted it to 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.330
 Javier seems to be winning 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.330
