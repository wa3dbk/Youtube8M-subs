everybody<00:00:29.060> doing<00:00:29.300> this<00:00:29.420> morning

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.210 

I<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:43.450> dug<00:00:43.630> a<00:00:43.660> very<00:00:44.050> rare<00:00:44.440> hammered

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
I just dug a very rare hammered

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.610 
I just dug a very rare hammered
I<00:00:45.250> think<00:00:46.090> it's<00:00:46.210> one-of-a-kind<00:00:46.540> it's<00:00:47.350> called<00:00:47.530> a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
I think it's one-of-a-kind it's called a

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.190 
I think it's one-of-a-kind it's called a
taco<00:00:48.010> hammer

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.590 

there's<00:00:55.200> a<00:00:56.810> there's<00:00:57.810> a<00:00:57.960> hammer<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:59.420> was<00:01:00.420> cut

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
there's a there's a hammer that was cut

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.480 
there's a there's a hammer that was cut
in<00:01:00.690> half<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.860> got<00:01:01.890> tacos

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
in half and then they got tacos

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.479 
in half and then they got tacos
somewhere<00:01:02.850> along<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.240> line<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.630> it's<00:01:04.020> a<00:01:04.489> very

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
somewhere along the line so it's a very

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.600 
somewhere along the line so it's a very
rare<00:01:05.730> taco<00:01:06.060> hammer<00:01:08.330> but<00:01:09.950> I'm<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.190> sure<00:01:11.400> if

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
rare taco hammer but I'm not sure if

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
rare taco hammer but I'm not sure if
we'll<00:01:11.730> be<00:01:11.880> able<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.060> unfold<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.570> taco<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.440> not

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
we'll be able to unfold that taco or not

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550 
we'll be able to unfold that taco or not
so<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.540> might<00:01:15.690> be<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.080> state<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.440> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so that just might be the state that it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:30.790 
so that just might be the state that it
stays<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:17.730> like<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.960> taco<00:01:19.170> hammer

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800

bigger one secure about confident not

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.110 
bigger one secure about confident not
confident<00:02:37.209> at<00:02:37.269> all<00:02:38.549> it's<00:02:39.549> not<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.849> size<00:02:40.090> that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
confident at all it's not the size that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.629 
confident at all it's not the size that
matters<00:02:40.390> though<00:02:41.019> it's<00:02:41.650> how<00:02:41.829> you<00:02:41.889> use<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.549> this

is this I think it is the size of my
problem

possibly dig it is a Roman I can see the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.420 
possibly dig it is a Roman I can see the
writing<00:04:10.140> on<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:11.030> on<00:04:12.030> one<00:04:12.090> side<00:04:12.950> but<00:04:13.950> look<00:04:14.310> how

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
writing on it on one side but look how

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.090 
writing on it on one side but look how
thin<00:04:14.879> this<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:17.479> that<00:04:18.479> is<00:04:18.660> crazy<00:04:19.049> thin<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:20.039> that

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
thin this is that is crazy thin and that

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.170 
thin this is that is crazy thin and that
thing<00:04:20.280> was<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.609> end<00:04:20.729> I<00:04:20.880> don't<00:04:20.940> even<00:04:21.090> think

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
thing was on the end I don't even think

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.640 
thing was on the end I don't even think
it's<00:04:21.389> possible<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.780> pick<00:04:21.959> up<00:04:24.380> lucky<00:04:25.380> for<00:04:25.560> me

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.780 
though it's probably flat and that's why
I<00:04:28.560> got<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.949> signal<00:04:29.310> but<00:04:29.460> man<00:04:29.759> is<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.090> thin

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
there's only one reason that this show

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.290 
there's only one reason that this show
would<00:05:12.320> be<00:05:12.380> out<00:05:12.620> here<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.550> it<00:05:13.790> had<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.180> have

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
would be out here and it had to have

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.290 
would be out here and it had to have
