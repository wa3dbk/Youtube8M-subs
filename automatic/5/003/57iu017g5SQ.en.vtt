00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
shooting pace here the chemistry and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060 
shooting pace here the chemistry and
it's<00:01:00.149> working<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.870> him<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.770> manage<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
further cells fro and we go through and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
further cells fro and we go through and
here<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.049> go<00:01:04.080> down<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.739> one<00:01:04.949> ourselves<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
here we go down and with one ourselves a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
here we go down and with one ourselves a
pen<00:01:05.519> away<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.540> muscular<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.990> chance

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
pen away and this is muscular a chance

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440 
pen away and this is muscular a chance
to<00:01:07.500> step<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.159> make<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.369> goal<00:01:08.760> number<00:01:08.909> 18

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
to step up and make it goal number 18

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.530 
to step up and make it goal number 18
and<00:01:09.720> secure<00:01:10.500> us<00:01:10.650> also<00:01:10.860> another<00:01:11.340> gold<00:01:11.820> upgrade

wave but we can't break him down and it

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.800 
wave but we can't break him down and it
was<00:03:33.610> getting<00:03:33.820> for<00:03:34.150> free<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.540> we<00:03:34.630> just

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
was getting for free and we just

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.260 
was getting for free and we just
couldn't<00:03:34.989> break<00:03:35.590> him<00:03:35.620> down<00:03:35.830> shoot<00:03:36.790> hitting

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
couldn't break him down shoot hitting

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.020 
couldn't break him down shoot hitting
the<00:03:37.330> par<00:03:37.600> hit<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.080> crossbar<00:03:38.640> him<00:03:39.640> putting<00:03:39.880> in

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the par hit the crossbar him putting in

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.520 
the par hit the crossbar him putting in
last<00:03:40.209> one<00:03:40.390> tackles<00:03:40.780> we<00:03:40.870> just<00:03:41.050> cannot<00:03:41.320> break

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
last one tackles we just cannot break

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.990 
last one tackles we just cannot break
him<00:03:41.680> down<00:03:41.709> it's<00:03:42.100> just<00:03:42.160> carrying<00:03:42.730> on<00:03:42.790> I'm

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
him down it's just carrying on I'm

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.850 
him down it's just carrying on I'm
thinking<00:03:43.420> we<00:03:43.630> got<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.080> get<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.350> second<00:03:44.709> ghost

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
thinking we got to get a second ghost

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.220 
thinking we got to get a second ghost
and<00:03:45.040> we've<00:03:45.160> got<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.489> open<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.760> lead<00:03:45.970> up

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
and we've got to open the lead up

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.630 
and we've got to open the lead up
because<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.320> fear<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.800> worth<00:03:47.980> if<00:03:48.220> we<00:03:48.310> don't<00:03:48.519> get

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
because I fear the worth if we don't get

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.190 
because I fear the worth if we don't get
more<00:03:48.760> soon<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:49.300> feel<00:03:49.510> like<00:03:49.690> someone<00:03:50.110> will

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
more soon I just feel like someone will

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.740 
more soon I just feel like someone will
go<00:03:50.320> against<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.300> that's<00:03:52.540> what

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
go against this and that that's what

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.540 
go against this and that that's what
eventually<00:03:53.140> happens<00:03:53.590> we<00:03:53.739> do<00:03:53.950> take<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.190> few<00:03:54.430> more

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
eventually happens we do take a few more

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.150 
eventually happens we do take a few more
shots<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:55.450> one<00:03:55.690> going<00:03:56.019> off<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.620> bart<00:03:56.860> post

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
shots that one going off the bart post

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.640 
shots that one going off the bart post
and<00:03:57.580> we<00:03:57.670> just<00:03:57.820> can't<00:03:58.000> do<00:03:58.269> it<00:03:58.300> and<00:03:59.110> this<00:03:59.320> is<00:03:59.470> all

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
and we just can't do it and this is all

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.050 
and we just can't do it and this is all
the<00:03:59.769> first<00:03:59.980> type<00:04:00.280> of<00:04:00.310> pressure<00:04:00.610> it's<00:04:00.910> just

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
the first type of pressure it's just

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.820 
the first type of pressure it's just
happening<00:04:01.540> just<00:04:01.780> happening<00:04:02.050> for<00:04:02.200> ending<00:04:02.530> for

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
happening just happening for ending for

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.250 
happening just happening for ending for
this<00:04:03.010> time<00:04:03.190> keep<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:03.760> scooping<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.239> up<00:04:04.390> and

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
this time keep of scooping it up and

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.320 
this time keep of scooping it up and
then<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.739> when<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.010> happens<00:04:06.340> here<00:04:07.120> it

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
then this is when it happens here it

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.600 
then this is when it happens here it
comes<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.780> 73rd<00:04:08.320> crews<00:04:08.980> lets<00:04:09.310> off<00:04:09.489> an

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
comes in the 73rd crews lets off an

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.880 
comes in the 73rd crews lets off an
absolute<00:04:10.030> cruise<00:04:10.360> missile<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.500> I'm<00:04:11.620> thinking

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
absolute cruise missile and I'm thinking

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.790 
absolute cruise missile and I'm thinking
 he's<00:04:13.209> done<00:04:13.480> it<00:04:13.660> we<00:04:14.050> should<00:04:14.290> we've<00:04:14.650> been

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
 he's done it we should we've been

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.259 
 he's done it we should we've been
punished<00:04:15.130> for<00:04:15.250> not<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.550> killing<00:04:15.790> her<00:04:15.850> chances

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
punished for not to killing her chances

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.560 
punished for not to killing her chances
but<00:04:16.989> not<00:04:17.290> we<00:04:18.160> come<00:04:18.400> into<00:04:18.549> life<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.330> like

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
but not we come into life and just like

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.599 
but not we come into life and just like
my<00:04:19.810> Munich<00:04:20.380> last<00:04:20.590> night<00:04:20.769> they<00:04:21.130> come<00:04:21.340> straight

could be new

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.920 
could be new
earlier<00:04:26.760> why<00:04:26.940> could<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.270> should<00:04:27.480> not<00:04:27.720> come
