00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.860 
it's under the brake light looking at it
from<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> back<00:02:22.310> build<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.430> triangle<00:02:23.850> piece<00:02:24.090> at

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
from the back build a triangle piece at

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.910 
from the back build a triangle piece at
these<00:02:25.110> two<00:02:26.150> out<00:02:27.150> brackets<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.320> bent<00:02:28.710> them

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
these two out brackets and I bent them

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.330 
these two out brackets and I bent them
so<00:02:29.070> they<00:02:29.250> go<00:02:29.400> into<00:02:29.520> place<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.680> I'm<00:02:31.680> using<00:02:31.950> all

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
so they go into place and I'm using all

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.730 
so they go into place and I'm using all
like<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.360> metal<00:02:33.810> mount<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.260> from<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
like this metal mount is from the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.560 
like this metal mount is from the
original<00:02:35.360> setup

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
original setup

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.900 
original setup
I<00:02:36.740> took<00:02:37.740> me<00:02:37.980> about<00:02:38.100> an<00:02:38.220> hour<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.520> half<00:02:38.700> to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
I took me about an hour and a half to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.850 
I took me about an hour and a half to
build<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.900> big<00:02:40.020> pain<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.380> butt

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
build this it's a big pain in the butt

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.760 
build this it's a big pain in the butt

plate<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.220> drilled<00:02:44.880> out<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.150> holes<00:02:46.100> these<00:02:47.100> two

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
plate I drilled out the holes these two

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.220 
plate I drilled out the holes these two
holes<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.940> originally<00:02:48.540> had<00:02:48.690> those<00:02:48.870> kind<00:02:49.170> of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
holes that originally had those kind of

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.860 
holes that originally had those kind of
screws<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.710> I<00:02:49.830> put<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> bolt<00:02:50.570> all<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.630> way

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
screws in it I put a bolt all the way

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.480 
screws in it I put a bolt all the way
through<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.800> would<00:02:52.980> grab<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:54.440> L<00:02:55.440> or<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.890> L

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
through so it would grab the L or the L

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.200 
through so it would grab the L or the L
brackets<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:58.200> are<00:02:58.320> connected<00:02:58.710> right<00:02:58.890> here

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
brackets that are connected right here

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.190 
brackets that are connected right here
so<00:03:00.210> this<00:03:00.390> thing<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:02.790> mounted<00:03:03.480> moving<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
the plate there is that little I mean I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.490 
the plate there is that little I mean I
can<00:03:37.620> bust<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.980> off<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.430> one<00:03:38.610> who<00:03:38.700> later<00:03:38.910> but

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
I'm just hoping that the plate doesn't

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.310 
I'm just hoping that the plate doesn't
vibrate<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.300> hit<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.540> which<00:03:42.810> doesn't<00:03:43.200> sound
