skeleton quest was right around the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.399 
bouncing bushes we like no bushes
that's<00:05:00.060> what<00:05:00.240> earns<00:05:00.449> us<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.719> me<00:05:00.870> throw<00:05:01.080> bricks

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
that's what earns us the me throw bricks

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.260 
that's what earns us the me throw bricks
anyways<00:05:02.069> I<00:05:02.370> don't<00:05:02.460> know<00:05:02.580> what<00:05:02.789> you<00:05:02.909> guys<00:05:03.060> were

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
anyways I don't know what you guys were

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.749 
anyways I don't know what you guys were
just<00:05:03.479> thinking<00:05:03.919> now<00:05:04.919> it<00:05:05.129> was<00:05:05.310> brought<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.669> my

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
just thinking now it was brought to my

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.189 
just thinking now it was brought to my
attention<00:05:05.789> that<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.509> use<00:05:06.629> the<00:05:06.810> cluster

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
attention that you can use the cluster

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.839 
attention that you can use the cluster
bow<00:05:07.349> on<00:05:07.529> these<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:08.279> items<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.639> require

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
bow on these the items that require

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.969 
bow on these the items that require
three<00:05:09.360> shots<00:05:09.659> guess<00:05:10.080> what<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.469> cluster<00:05:10.830> bow

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
three shots guess what the cluster bow

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.459 
three shots guess what the cluster bow
handles<00:05:11.490> three<00:05:11.699> arrows<00:05:11.969> at<00:05:12.090> a<00:05:12.150> time<00:05:12.389> so<00:05:13.080> I

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
handles three arrows at a time so I

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.230 
handles three arrows at a time so I
highly<00:05:13.919> recommend<00:05:14.340> using<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.699> cluster<00:05:15.090> bow

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
highly recommend using the cluster bow

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.659 
highly recommend using the cluster bow
or<00:05:15.479> you<00:05:15.750> can<00:05:16.020> use<00:05:16.199> our<00:05:16.319> soften<00:05:16.919> up<00:05:17.039> method<00:05:17.430> we

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
or you can use our soften up method we

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.390 
or you can use our soften up method we
call<00:05:17.879> it<00:05:17.939> the<00:05:18.029> Roseanne<00:05:18.449> Barr<00:05:18.710> method<00:05:19.710> if<00:05:20.339> you

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
call it the Roseanne Barr method if you

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.890 
call it the Roseanne Barr method if you
really<00:05:20.699> think<00:05:20.939> you'll<00:05:21.089> figure<00:05:21.270> out<00:05:21.389> why<00:05:21.659> it's

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
really think you'll figure out why it's

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.769 
really think you'll figure out why it's
a<00:05:21.960> softening<00:05:22.469> method<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.389> we'll<00:05:24.389> go<00:05:24.539> ahead

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 
a softening method and we'll go ahead

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.200 
a softening method and we'll go ahead
and<00:05:25.169> label<00:05:25.620> all<00:05:26.069> of<00:05:26.099> those<00:05:26.370> our<00:05:26.580> mark<00:05:26.939> all<00:05:27.120> of

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
maybe it switched when we switched to

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.829 
maybe it switched when we switched to
Sam<00:05:47.069> I<00:05:47.219> don't<00:05:47.550> know<00:05:47.699> regardless<00:05:48.240> he<00:05:48.810> was
