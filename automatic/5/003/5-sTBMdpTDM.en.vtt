from last year and one question that
often<00:00:09.960> comes<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.590> why<00:00:10.800> can't<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.400> remove

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
often comes up is why can't we remove

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.629 
often comes up is why can't we remove

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
drinkable because it is saltwater and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000 
drinkable because it is saltwater and
it's<00:00:24.090> considered<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.720> very<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:25.289> costly

it<00:00:29.279> desalinate<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.119> Desalle<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:31.279> don't

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it desalinate or Desalle and I don't

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.749 
it desalinate or Desalle and I don't
know

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
know

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090 
know
I<00:00:32.790> believe<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> desalinate<00:00:34.100> desalinate

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
I believe it to desalinate desalinate

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.319 
I believe it to desalinate desalinate
that's<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> thought<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that's what I thought but it is of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.619 
that's what I thought but it is of
course<00:00:36.570> desalinization

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
course desalinization

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.180 
course desalinization
what<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> time<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.530> think<00:00:40.950> it's

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
what was that in time I think it's

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.069 
what was that in time I think it's
desalination<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:42.390> anyone<00:00:42.660> wants<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> look

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
desalination if anyone wants to look

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.660 
desalination if anyone wants to look
this<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.739> you'll<00:00:43.860> find<00:00:44.010> I'm<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.250> we

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
this up I think you'll find I'm right we

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.830 
this up I think you'll find I'm right we
did<00:00:44.850> look<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.539> said<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
did look it up and it said the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.779 
did look it up and it said the
desalinization<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.280> where

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
desalinization but I don't know where

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.420 
desalinization but I don't know where
you're<00:00:47.969> gonna<00:00:48.149> we<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.430> Lockheed

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
you're gonna we now have Lockheed

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
technology which could solve the water

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.610 
technology which could solve the water
problem<00:00:59.699> they<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.570> been<00:01:00.750> developing<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
problem they have been developing a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.460 
problem they have been developing a
process<00:01:02.609> which<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.910> basically<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.480> thin<00:01:03.899> carbon

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
process which is basically a thin carbon

process which is basically a thin carbon
membrane<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.850> basically<00:01:06.570> regular

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

holes<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> nanometer<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.640> size

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
holes in it that are a nanometer in size

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.870 
holes in it that are a nanometer in size
that<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> billionth<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.189> meter<00:01:11.460> Louis

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that is a billionth of a meter Louis

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.740 
that is a billionth of a meter Louis
which<00:01:12.510> actually<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.880> they<00:01:14.880> essentially<00:01:15.450> work

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
which actually are they essentially work

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
which actually are they essentially work
like<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> sieve<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.310> sift<00:01:17.610> out

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
like a sieve and you can just sift out

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820 
like a sieve and you can just sift out
the<00:01:18.119> salt<00:01:18.420> essentially<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> do

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the salt essentially is what you can do

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.130 
the salt essentially is what you can do
and<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.700> technology<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.630> developed

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and if this technology can be developed

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.510 
and if this technology can be developed
one<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> issues<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.009> now<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.369> that

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
one of the issues right now is that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.999 
one of the issues right now is that
these<00:01:24.180> membranes<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.170> delicate<00:01:25.830> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
these membranes are so delicate that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.399 
these membranes are so delicate that
even<00:01:26.460> working<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.299> makes<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.049> likely

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
even working with them makes them likely

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
even working with them makes them likely
to<00:01:28.680> tear<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.610> even<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
to tear and you don't even get to the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
to tear and you don't even get to the
point<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.600> even<00:01:30.689> being<00:01:30.840> able<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.290> employ<00:01:31.590> them

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
point of even being able to employ them

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
point of even being able to employ them
this<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> huge<00:01:33.450> breakthrough<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this could be a huge breakthrough in the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
this could be a huge breakthrough in the
removal<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.829> salt<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:35.729> ocean<00:01:36.030> water<00:01:36.060> which

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
removal of salt from ocean water which

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.420 
removal of salt from ocean water which
some<00:01:36.900> say<00:01:37.079> could<00:01:37.140> solve<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.950> drinking<00:01:38.310> water

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
some say could solve the drinking water

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.480 
some say could solve the drinking water
problem<00:01:38.909> yeah<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.920> step<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> right

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
problem yeah it it's a step in the right

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.649 
problem yeah it it's a step in the right
direction<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:42.000> course<00:01:42.210> there's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> lot<00:01:42.540> of

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
direction of course there's a lot of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.139 
direction of course there's a lot of
questions<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.619> well<00:01:44.340> how<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> pump<00:01:44.939> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
questions as to well how do you pump it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.109 
questions as to well how do you pump it
to<00:01:45.270> people<00:01:45.600> inland<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.530> um<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.759> know<00:01:47.909> who's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
to people inland right um you know who's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030

you care at all that this is Lockheed a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.130 
you care at all that this is Lockheed a
weapons<00:01:55.380> manufacturer<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:57.090> working<00:01:58.049> on

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
weapons manufacturer that is working on

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.719 
weapons manufacturer that is working on
this<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> rather<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> different

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
this would you rather it be a different

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.160 
this would you rather it be a different
company<00:02:00.090> or<00:02:00.299> would<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> rather<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.810> solve

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
company or would you rather just solve

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.899 
company or would you rather just solve
the<00:02:01.290> problem<00:02:01.680> well<00:02:02.159> we've<00:02:02.340> talked<00:02:02.579> about<00:02:02.820> this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the problem well we've talked about this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.209 
the problem well we've talked about this
before<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.420> mean<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> seems<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
before I mean it seems like the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.130 
before I mean it seems like the
companies<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.939> don't<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.479> involved<00:02:07.049> in

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
companies that we don't want involved in

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.839 
companies that we don't want involved in
projects<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.979> unfortunately<00:02:08.640> other

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
projects like this unfortunately other

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.660 
projects like this unfortunately other
ones<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> resources<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
ones that have the resources to do it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
ones that have the resources to do it
so<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.930> can't<00:02:13.349> think

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
so you know I can't think

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.030 
so you know I can't think
and<00:02:14.010> how<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:16.770> create

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and how this is going to you know create

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.560 
and how this is going to you know create
more<00:02:17.310> weapons<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.760> are<00:02:17.880> gonna<00:02:17.970> kill<00:02:18.270> people

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
more weapons that are gonna kill people

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.270 
more weapons that are gonna kill people
this<00:02:18.720> could<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.230> something<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.190> they

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
this could just be something that they

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.460 
this could just be something that they
see<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> huge<00:02:20.970> profit<00:02:21.360> maker<00:02:21.540> certainly<00:02:22.320> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
see as a huge profit maker certainly and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.870 
see as a huge profit maker certainly and
good<00:02:22.590> for<00:02:22.740> them<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.520> pull<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.790> off

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
good for them if they can pull it off

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.190 
good for them if they can pull it off
and<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.540> something<00:02:24.900> good

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
and do something good

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960 
and do something good
yeah<00:02:25.320> there's<00:02:25.590> varied<00:02:26.220> views<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:26.940> I

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
yeah there's varied views on that but I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.130 
yeah there's varied views on that but I
think<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.270> interesting<00:02:27.420> technology

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
think it's interesting technology

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.270 
think it's interesting technology
nonetheless<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.710> we<00:02:28.770> also<00:02:28.920> need<00:02:29.130> better

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
nonetheless and we also need better

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.640 
nonetheless and we also need better
technology<00:02:29.880> for<00:02:29.910> reusing<00:02:30.570> wastewater<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
technology for reusing wastewater and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.590 
technology for reusing wastewater and
turning<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.160> into<00:02:32.220> water<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.240> is

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
turning that into water that that is

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.290 
turning that into water that that is
drinkable<00:02:34.020> right
