a lot better on these videos so this

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.110 
a lot better on these videos so this
videos<00:00:39.230> topic<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.770> on<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.250> cranial<00:00:40.820> nerves

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
videos topic is on the cranial nerves

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.380 
videos topic is on the cranial nerves
and<00:00:41.480> we<00:00:41.899> have<00:00:42.020> 12<00:00:42.350> pair<00:00:43.010> of<00:00:43.280> cranial<00:00:43.940> nerves<00:00:44.149> in

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
and we have 12 pair of cranial nerves in

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.470 
and we have 12 pair of cranial nerves in
our<00:00:44.480> body<00:00:44.749> are<00:00:45.309> two<00:00:46.309> arising<00:00:46.999> from<00:00:47.210> our

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
our body are two arising from our

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.739 
our body are two arising from our
cerebrum<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.050> 10<00:00:48.679> from<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:49.129> brain<00:00:49.699> stem<00:00:49.969> so

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
cerebrum and 10 from the brain stem so

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.720 
cerebrum and 10 from the brain stem so
12<00:00:51.050> cranial<00:00:51.589> nerves<00:00:51.949> which<00:00:52.129> means<00:00:52.370> that<00:00:52.550> they

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
12 cranial nerves which means that they

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.450 
12 cranial nerves which means that they
come<00:00:52.969> from<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.269> brain<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.129> I'm<00:00:55.129> only<00:00:55.280> going

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
come from the brain and I'm only going

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.790 
come from the brain and I'm only going
to<00:00:55.489> show<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:55.899> where<00:00:56.899> these<00:00:57.050> cranial<00:00:57.589> nerves

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
to show you where these cranial nerves

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.340 
to show you where these cranial nerves
are<00:00:57.949> located<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:58.579> they<00:00:58.699> just<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.969> anatomy<00:00:59.350> so

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
are located so they just the anatomy so

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.779 
are located so they just the anatomy so
I'm<00:01:00.409> going<00:01:00.589> to<00:01:00.620> draw<00:01:00.859> out<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.129> brain<00:01:01.609> a

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
I'm going to draw out a brain a

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.049 
I'm going to draw out a brain a
posterior<00:01:02.479> view<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.499> brain<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:05.000> a

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
posterior view of the brain and a

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.600 
posterior view of the brain and a
posterior<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.659> yeah<00:01:06.159> inferior<00:01:07.159> view<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.520> the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
posterior and yeah inferior view of the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.110 
posterior and yeah inferior view of the
brain<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:09.020> can<00:01:09.080> see<00:01:09.260> a<00:01:09.290> cerebrum<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:10.120> two

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
brain you can see a cerebrum and two

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.750 
brain you can see a cerebrum and two
hemispheres<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:14.620> also<00:01:15.620> here<00:01:15.860> is<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.159> medulla

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
hemispheres and also here is the medulla

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.420 
hemispheres and also here is the medulla
oblongata<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.510> palms

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
oblongata and the palms

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.820 
oblongata and the palms

many functions in Paris parasympathetic
nervous<00:03:03.750> system<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.890> arises<00:03:05.250> also<00:03:05.670> from

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
nervous system and it arises also from

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.410 
nervous system and it arises also from
the<00:03:06.090> medulla<00:03:06.390> oblongata<00:03:10.640> no<00:03:11.640> 11<00:03:12.150> the

where<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> spinal<00:03:15.930> cords<00:03:16.230> begins<00:03:16.770> is<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
where the spinal cords begins is the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.640 
where the spinal cords begins is the
accessory<00:03:18.600> nerve<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:21.540> finally<00:03:21.930> no<00:03:22.050> 12<00:03:22.440> is

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
accessory nerve and finally no 12 is

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.740 
accessory nerve and finally no 12 is
actually<00:03:22.860> situated<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:24.180> under<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.570> glove

actually situated just under the glove
of<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:26.209> glossopharyngeal<00:03:27.209> nerve<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.320> it's

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
of the glossopharyngeal nerve and it's

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.060 
of the glossopharyngeal nerve and it's
called<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.799> hypoglossal<00:03:29.370> nerve<00:03:29.790> nerve<00:03:30.239> 12<00:03:31.070> so

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
called the hypoglossal nerve nerve 12 so

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.240 
called the hypoglossal nerve nerve 12 so
let's<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.430> another<00:03:33.290> view<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.530> where<00:03:35.130> these

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
let's have another view of where these

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.850 
let's have another view of where these
cranial<00:03:35.790> nerves<00:03:36.030> are<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.959> where<00:03:37.560> they<00:03:37.680> come

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
cranial nerves are and where they come

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.360 
cranial nerves are and where they come
out<00:03:38.100> from<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:39.120> we'll<00:03:39.269> cut<00:03:39.630> out<00:03:40.190> we'll<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.220> a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.340 
mid sagittal view of the actual
brainstem<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:45.030> if<00:03:45.209> we<00:03:45.360> take<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.630> brain<00:03:45.930> stem<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
brainstem so if we take a brain stem and

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.940 
brainstem so if we take a brain stem and
cut<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:48.049> half<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.350> look<00:03:49.590> at<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.739> from<00:03:49.799> a

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
cut it in in half and look at it from a

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.610 
cut it in in half and look at it from a
lateral<00:03:50.310> angle<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:53.070> medial<00:03:53.430> aspect<00:03:54.440> this<00:03:55.440> is

lateral angle the medial aspect this is

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.930 
lateral angle the medial aspect this is
what<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:55.980> would<00:03:56.070> look<00:03:56.130> like<00:03:57.680> well<00:03:58.680> not<00:03:59.640> exactly

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
what it would look like well not exactly

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.280 
what it would look like well not exactly
like<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.390> but<00:04:00.450> similar<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:03.299> remember

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
like this but similar so and remember

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.810 
like this but similar so and remember
the<00:04:04.440> first<00:04:04.650> two<00:04:04.890> cranial<00:04:05.280> nerves<00:04:05.459> arise

the first two cranial nerves arise
mister<00:04:06.290> cerebrum<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.470> we<00:04:07.590> won't<00:04:07.799> talk<00:04:08.040> about

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
mister cerebrum so we won't talk about

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.800 
mister cerebrum so we won't talk about
it<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.760> brainstem<00:04:09.239> we'll<00:04:09.420> start<00:04:09.690> with

now<00:05:05.729> I'm<00:05:05.909> not<00:05:06.120> drawing<00:05:06.389> up<00:05:06.659> this<00:05:06.870> sensory<00:05:07.349> and

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
now I'm not drawing up this sensory and

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.110 
now I'm not drawing up this sensory and
motor<00:05:08.719> nerves<00:05:09.719> I'm<00:05:09.990> just<00:05:10.169> drawing<00:05:10.409> where<00:05:11.120> all

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
motor nerves I'm just drawing where all

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.809 
motor nerves I'm just drawing where all
the<00:05:12.389> nerves<00:05:12.629> are<00:05:12.870> roughly<00:05:13.229> located<00:05:13.949> just<00:05:14.580> to

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
the nerves are roughly located just to

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.969 
the nerves are roughly located just to
let<00:05:15.389> you<00:05:15.509> know<00:05:15.539> ah

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
let you know ah

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.749 
let you know ah
so<00:05:17.849> no<00:05:18.120> 6<00:05:18.689> the<00:05:18.930> abdul<00:05:19.379> Sattar<00:05:19.740> is<00:05:20.009> located<00:05:20.580> also

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
so no 6 the abdul Sattar is located also

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.670 
so no 6 the abdul Sattar is located also
ran<00:05:21.270> around<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.539> pons<00:05:21.779> and<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.139> abuser

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
ran around the pons and the abuser

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.820 
ran around the pons and the abuser
nucleus<00:05:23.129> and<00:05:23.340> that<00:05:23.900> facial<00:05:24.900> new<00:05:25.169> curve

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
nucleus and that facial new curve

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.499 
nucleus and that facial new curve
actually<00:05:26.039> wraps<00:05:26.520> around<00:05:26.789> the<00:05:27.150> abducens

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
actually wraps around the abducens

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.200 
actually wraps around the abducens
nucleus<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.349> here's<00:05:28.590> a<00:05:28.680> facial<00:05:29.159> nerve<00:05:29.370> nerve<00:05:29.729> 7

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
nucleus so here's a facial nerve nerve 7

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.050 
nucleus so here's a facial nerve nerve 7
and<00:05:30.889> nucleus<00:05:31.889> is<00:05:32.069> the<00:05:32.849> facial<00:05:33.360> nucleus<00:05:35.060> now

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
and nucleus is the facial nucleus now

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.510 
and nucleus is the facial nucleus now
just<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.569> very<00:05:36.779> back<00:05:37.050> where<00:05:37.379> the<00:05:37.589> cerebellum

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
just the very back where the cerebellum

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.749 
just the very back where the cerebellum
is<00:05:38.669> that's<00:05:39.509> actually<00:05:39.690> where<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.319> the

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
is that's actually where the the

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.730 
is that's actually where the the
vestibular<00:05:41.759> nucleus<00:05:42.210> is<00:05:42.419> so<00:05:42.690> this<00:05:42.960> this<00:05:43.469> must

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
vestibular nucleus is so this this must

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.779 
vestibular nucleus is so this this must
be<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.009> particular<00:05:44.460> cochlear<00:05:45.270> nerve<00:05:46.430> nerve<00:05:47.430> 8

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
be the particular cochlear nerve nerve 8

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.540 
be the particular cochlear nerve nerve 8
and<00:05:48.680> here's<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.830> vestibular<00:05:50.370> nucleus<00:05:50.819> just

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
and here's the vestibular nucleus just

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.640 
and here's the vestibular nucleus just
where<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:55.310> medulla<00:05:56.310> oblongata<00:05:56.370> is<00:05:56.819> we<00:05:57.419> have

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
where the medulla oblongata is we have

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.589 
where the medulla oblongata is we have
protruding<00:05:58.650> out<00:05:58.800> the<00:05:59.599> glossopharyngeal

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:06.290 
protruding out the glossopharyngeal
nerve<00:06:01.349> nerve<00:06:01.919> 9<00:06:04.520> and<00:06:05.520> it<00:06:05.639> comes<00:06:05.939> in<00:06:06.060> contact

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
nerve nerve 9 and it comes in contact

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.980 
nerve nerve 9 and it comes in contact
with<00:06:06.599> the<00:06:06.930> nucleus<00:06:07.819> referred<00:06:08.819> to<00:06:09.060> as<00:06:09.300> the
