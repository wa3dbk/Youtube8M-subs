00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
I don't have too much of a problem like

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.410 
I don't have too much of a problem like
my<00:01:07.890> record<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.310> pretty<00:01:08.700> good<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
this team I didn't think he was gonna be

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.130 
this team I didn't think he was gonna be
the<00:01:58.259> best<00:01:58.619> false<00:01:59.009> nine<00:01:59.280> he<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.540> flawless

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the best false nine he was flawless

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
the best false nine he was flawless
bumper<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.009> got<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.189> upgraded<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:02.759> love

bumper we have got the upgraded one love
expensive<00:02:04.049> probably<00:02:04.500> wouldn't<00:02:04.829> recommend

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
expensive probably wouldn't recommend

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190 
expensive probably wouldn't recommend
getting<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.790> green<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.719> kind<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.020> want

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
getting a green one I just kind of want

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
getting a green one I just kind of want
to<00:02:07.320> try<00:02:07.530> them<00:02:07.649> out<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.310> fair<00:02:08.489> he<00:02:09.030> scored

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to try them out to be fair he scored

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.020 
to try them out to be fair he scored
like<00:02:09.629> four<00:02:10.020> goals<00:02:10.319> which<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.340> really<00:02:11.700> really

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
like four goals which is really really

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.940 
like four goals which is really really
good

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
good

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.869 
good
for<00:02:13.129> a<00:02:13.180> sentiment<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:14.450> he's<00:02:15.020> still<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:15.640> 67<00:02:16.640> k

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
for a sentiment but he's still like 67 k

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.380 
for a sentiment but he's still like 67 k
I<00:02:17.180> think<00:02:17.810> he's<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.110> almost<00:02:18.349> 18<00:02:19.099> CVM<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.000> it

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
I think he's like almost 18 CVM so it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.330 
I think he's like almost 18 CVM so it
might<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.720> worth<00:02:21.019> just<00:02:21.260> getting<00:02:22.010> one<00:02:22.280> but

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
might be worth just getting one but

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.729 
might be worth just getting one but
really<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.239> right<00:02:23.540> hand<00:02:23.660> side<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:24.379> link<00:02:24.560> up

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
really on the right hand side to link up

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.850 
really on the right hand side to link up
very<00:02:25.010> nicely<00:02:25.250> with<00:02:25.459> Lucas<00:02:26.030> Lucas<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.840> one<00:02:27.739> of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
very nicely with Lucas Lucas is one of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.830 
very nicely with Lucas Lucas is one of
my<00:02:27.980> favorite<00:02:28.519> right<00:02:28.760> wing's<00:02:29.000> actually<00:02:29.569> he's

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
my favorite right wing's actually he's

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.920 
my favorite right wing's actually he's
so<00:02:30.200> strong<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.090> he's<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.330> good<00:02:32.540> at<00:02:32.569> shooting

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
so strong and he's so good at shooting

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.900 
so strong and he's so good at shooting
by<00:02:33.080> strong<00:02:33.380> acting<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:33.980> overall<00:02:34.519> good<00:02:34.700> not

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
by strong acting like overall good not

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.850 
by strong acting like overall good not
actual<00:02:35.420> strength<00:02:35.720> because<00:02:36.080> that's<00:02:36.530> probably

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
actual strength because that's probably

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.380 
actual strength because that's probably
one<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.010> his<00:02:37.099> weaker<00:02:37.550> points<00:02:37.730> he<00:02:37.940> does<00:02:38.180> get

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
one of his weaker points he does get

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.570 
one of his weaker points he does get
occasionally<00:02:38.959> pushed<00:02:39.200> off<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.190> majority

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
occasionally pushed off but the majority

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.690 
occasionally pushed off but the majority
of<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.060> time<00:02:41.299> you're<00:02:41.989> faster<00:02:42.769> than<00:02:42.799> their

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
of the time you're faster than their

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.180 
of the time you're faster than their
defender<00:02:44.330> which<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.750> perfect<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:45.920> we<00:02:46.040> have

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
defender which is perfect then we have

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.390 
defender which is perfect then we have
Royce<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.239> think<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:47.750> guys<00:02:47.930> know<00:02:48.260> by<00:02:49.040> now

usually<00:03:50.750> like<00:03:51.049> doing<00:03:51.290> this<00:03:51.350> because<00:03:51.560> I

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
usually like doing this because I

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.500 
usually like doing this because I
actually<00:03:52.340> wanted<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.760> save<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.239> squad

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
actually wanted to save this squad

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.140 
actually wanted to save this squad
because<00:03:53.720> if<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.530> do<00:03:54.590> two<00:03:54.859> squads<00:03:55.220> in<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.940> row

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
because if I do two squads in a row

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.110 
because if I do two squads in a row
there<00:03:56.870> are<00:03:57.019> pretty<00:03:57.620> much<00:03:57.829> flawless<00:03:58.190> like<00:03:58.910> I
