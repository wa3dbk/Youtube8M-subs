00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.639
 welcome to the riots explanation of smooth spirits 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 This hilarious game for the entire family requires a clear mind and high 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.779
 reaction speed 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.779
 you can play the game with what 8 players play 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.419
 goal of the game 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.699
 each card turned over 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 then everyone tries the right thing for work at the same time as quickly as possible 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.470
 from tate 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.470
 I was the first to do a pin card 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.350
 who makes a mistake must pay a card to the winner 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 who has the most cards at the end of the game 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.980
 the play material 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.840
 put all objects in a circle on the table everyone can do very well 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.040
 Shoot all playing cards and submit this shoot covered state pool table 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.250
 now we can start 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.100
 the course of the game 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.610
 That it is rich in the poster card to allow all players the card at the same time 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.450
 see 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.770
 everyone is not trying to pick up the object of tate as quickly as possible 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.730
 this card is shown in the correct color 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.960
 if there is no object in the correct color on the card, the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.250
 players take the item that is not dealt on the card 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.720
 and whose color is also not shown on the map 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.870
 lisa was the first to grab the right item 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.870
 she puts the card on the table in front of her as a reward 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.480
 then she rehearses the next card of the covered state first 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.210
 note nobody is allowed to grab more than one item 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 samantha accidentally a wrong item 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.280
 They now need a kick after previously won cards to the winner of the round 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.100
 to give 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.280
 if she had not won any cards together before then she does not have to enter any cards 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.110
 to deliver 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.750
 end of the game 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.070
 the game has ended asten covered state is still empty 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.210
 everyone counts his cards 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.210
 Lisa is the most and has won 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.269
 variant for advanced 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.900
 used the following extras of game rules to make the game more difficult 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.809
 if a book is depicted on the turned card, the players must not 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:22.960
 grabbing an item 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.559
 but the objects sought 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.449
 if there is no book on the card, the players must do it as usual 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.119
 wanted item 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.969
 pay attention 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.969
 no one may make more than one attempt per card 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.349
