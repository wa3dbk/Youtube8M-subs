00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.480
 the key stage of the Sarthe circuit 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.320
 country of the Loire to unfold in great 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.360
 part in mayenne 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.130
 the jimmy sarthois engoulvent of the team 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.750
 sojasun has long been part of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.430
 escaped at the head of the race before 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 crack in the last laps we 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:29.880
 we met her after the race so 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 that he gives us his impressions very 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.850
 very difficult today with more 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.570
 the headwind practically all their 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 almost all day 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.690
 difficulties that happens soon enough 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.559
 in the stage I think you world has 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 really finished at larache this is true 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.750
 it's still a very beautiful step with 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.010
 I think the best who can 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.039
 speak out on the final so a good 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 step today for the show at 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.039
 end of this stage is the runner 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.320
 of europcar pierre rolland which was 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.850
 imposed with panache to pre-in-pail this 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.110
 victory over mayennaise lands him 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.110
 allows to seize the yellow jersey 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.170
 real bunker first victory of the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.540
 season and that's exactly what happened 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.000
 because we will arrive at 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.930
 important period with cork in 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.510
 fifteen days 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.010
 and then here is arriving on the circuit 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.360
 it was a pleasant surprise to see 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.200
 that he was much harder than the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.270
 previous years 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.760
 and that's the tactics it was to send 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.510
 Kevin who was well placed and then after 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.920
 was checked 1 returned there twenty 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.770
 runners with me that I did not know 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.899
 but who was driving very well and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.659
 and when I saw that it was coming back 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.450
 in the last round I decided down from 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.740
 give everything to leave alone and then that's it 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.280
 after c 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.030
 I do not know I differ 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 5 km or 6 alone and that's not it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.350
 complicated we give everything and we do the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.900
 the point after which if it is not returned 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.250
 that there were riders stronger and 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.150
 and there I managed to resist back from 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.280
 what was left of the pack 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.380
 it's been a few years since the api the a7 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.780
 this game on the clock 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.210
 malek balloon kronos played on it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.310
 the anzin a circuit with an arrival 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.200
 like that it changes things a bit and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.090
 it's not worse 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.010
 they cortes general counselor and mayor 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.820
 Pre-en-Pail looks forward to victory 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.890
 rolland stone 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.420
 it's a ligÃ©rien it's actually 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.610
 you're happy it's a good 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.570
 notoriety with good I think a beautiful 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.400
 circuit and that was good for them for 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.410
 the beefy as we say yes we are 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.730
 pleasantly surprised well was expecting this 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.470
 who is the world despite all the fact 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.550
 to be at the top on the sporting level 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.320
 it's ideal 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.750
 in terms of the tendency to go - 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.040
 because the audience does not make me 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.300
 to park and everything is so we had a 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.950
 little bit scared because you're there good 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.420
 plus the fact that he was doing relatively 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.220
 cold today we had a little bit of 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.860
 snow this morning despite tons was very 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.940
 surprised because in all the laces 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.530
 especially from the coast and the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.570
 butchering of the woods there were people 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.800
 everywhere on the side the bikers was 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.100
 obliged to make these cards and 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.170
 when the runners arrive and so we 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.730
 was very very pleasant surprise of this 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.740
 side of it a lot of public 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.720
 at the end of the four days of racing 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.610
 pierre rolland wins the 61st edition 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.610
