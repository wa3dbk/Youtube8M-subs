00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:22.950
 when I arrived in Rome at the age of 26 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.140
 I fell almost soon enough 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.020
 without realizing it 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.190
 in what could be called the 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:38.730
 whirlwind of worldliness but I didn't want to 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:44.760
 to simply be with mountain I wanted 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:49.790
 become the king of the worldly I do not 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.790
 I just wanted to go to parties 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.520
 I wanted to have the power to make them fail 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.300
 and all settled under the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:29.990
 chatter is noise, silence 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:35.000
 and feeling, emotion and fear 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:39.780
 the sparse inconstant flashes and of 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.940
 beauty and then the wretched squalor 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.940
 and the miserable man
