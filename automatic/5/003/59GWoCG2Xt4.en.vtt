00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.060
 in the vicinity of the cathedral hill 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.790
 the route was cut to arm for some 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.700
 hours a brief asphalt circuit like this 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.650
 my tail the audi 4 gave lectures something 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.720
 that we check sitting in the armchair 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.880
 right for a few minutes 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.770
 fortunately it rained all day 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.020
 something ideal to enjoy the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.240
 controlled skids let that that 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.490
 same day he said that when he got back on and 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.870
 driving the car felt that he was 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.870
 causing him like a glove 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.060
 for those of us who enjoy the management and 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.920
 we are very far from the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.109
 skills of my tail was a 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.120
 unforgettable experience especially 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.250
 because these Ben group cars were not 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.950
 Easy to handle with your manual box 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.959
 abrupt turbochargers and very little 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.409
 electronic assistance in all

 they apply to the floor in a bestial way and 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.709
 is in control of landslides 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.230
 the key to not losing speed in the 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.730
 competition maybe remembering the time 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.370
 in which the public crowded in 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.980
 crowds on the roads my tail will 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.930
 goes from the car with great precision and even 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.680
 brake with the right foot to avoid losing 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.680
 engine turns 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.540
