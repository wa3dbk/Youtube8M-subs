removal tool I'm not liking this thing
too<00:00:57.809> much<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:59.399> basically<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.850> leg<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:03.180> lock

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
too much it's basically a leg you lock

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
too much it's basically a leg you lock
it<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.229> probably<00:01:04.769> switch<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it down in there and probably switch the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
it down in there and probably switch the
drill<00:01:05.280> hole<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.640> something<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:07.320> does<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
drill hole or something it does have a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.090 
drill hole or something it does have a
really<00:01:07.920> cool<00:01:08.189> device<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.409> vice<00:01:11.070> grip

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
really cool device this is a vice grip

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.859 
really cool device this is a vice grip
adapter<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.180> I'll<00:01:12.270> show<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.450> how<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.780> works

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.149 

here's<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.679> vise<00:01:16.829> grip<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:18.799> basically<00:01:19.799> takes

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
here's the vise grip and basically takes

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.830 
here's the vise grip and basically takes
place<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> adjusting<00:01:21.299> screw<00:01:21.539> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> vise

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
place of the adjusting screw in the vise

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.789 
place of the adjusting screw in the vise
grip<00:01:26.210> then<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.329> can<00:01:27.539> attach<00:01:28.319> the<00:01:28.530> slide

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
grip then you can attach the slide

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:39.120 
grip then you can attach the slide
hammer<00:01:29.039> to<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.289 

pretty<00:01:40.130> cool<00:01:40.310> attachment<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:41.000> could<00:01:41.150> see

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
pretty cool attachment I could see

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.440 
pretty cool attachment I could see
myself<00:01:41.450> using<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:42.790> while<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.909> tabs<00:01:44.180> than

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
myself using it while the tabs than

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.910 
myself using it while the tabs than
anything<00:01:44.630> that's<00:01:44.900> bent<00:01:45.170> inwards<00:01:45.619> where<00:01:45.860> you

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
anything that's bent inwards where you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.700 
anything that's bent inwards where you
can't<00:01:46.159> get<00:01:46.310> behind<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:47.290> another<00:01:48.290> cool<00:01:48.680> thing

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
can't get behind it another cool thing

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.520 
can't get behind it another cool thing
that<00:01:49.040> came<00:01:49.400> with<00:01:49.580> this<00:01:49.820> kid<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.690> sigh<00:01:51.020> :

pull<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.530> can<00:02:30.650> see<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.040> crane<00:02:31.220> reversed

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
pull you can see that the crane reversed

pull you can see that the crane reversed
only<00:02:32.060> lets<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:33.350> jaws<00:02:33.620> go<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.220> far<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:36.319> if

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
only lets the jaws go in so far so if

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.170 
only lets the jaws go in so far so if
you're<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> ring<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.040> would<00:02:37.160> tighten<00:02:37.970> this

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
you're on a ring you would tighten this

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.229 
you're on a ring you would tighten this
down<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:39.170> they<00:02:39.290> were<00:02:39.350> taught<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.940> here<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.209> a
