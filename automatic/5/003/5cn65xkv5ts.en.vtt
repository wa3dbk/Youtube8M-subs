00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
used to be pissed off when I lose a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.899 
used to be pissed off when I lose a
gunfight<00:01:30.509> flinching<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.440> then<00:01:32.039> I<00:01:32.130> look<00:01:32.399> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
gunfight flinching and then I look and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.690 
gunfight flinching and then I look and
then<00:01:33.179> calling<00:01:33.920> my<00:01:34.920> Reaper<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:37.830> then<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.369> look

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
then calling my Reaper and then I look

then calling my Reaper and then I look
and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.420> noticed<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.640> my<00:01:41.640> enemy<00:01:42.209> had

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
and then I noticed that my enemy had

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.230 
and then I noticed that my enemy had
toughness<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.799> i<00:01:44.220> lost<00:01:44.459> the<00:01:44.729> gun<00:01:44.940> fight

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
toughness on and i lost the gun fight

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.499 
toughness on and i lost the gun fight
because<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> toughness<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.869> question<00:01:49.470> is

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
because of toughness the question is

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.029 
because of toughness the question is
will<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.539> be<00:01:51.810> flinching<00:01:53.119> wouldn't<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.330> be<00:01:54.509> no

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
will it be flinching wouldn't just be no

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.219 
will it be flinching wouldn't just be no
penalty<00:01:56.039> because<00:01:56.789> if<00:01:57.239> it's<00:01:57.420> no<00:01:57.690> penalty<00:01:58.379> for

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
penalty because if it's no penalty for

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.410 
penalty because if it's no penalty for
someone<00:02:01.229> shooting<00:02:01.679> first<00:02:02.039> like<00:02:02.879> if<00:02:03.030> someone
