more<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.430> less<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.760> an<00:01:26.910> I<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.840> thinking

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
more or less like an I was thinking

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.390 
more or less like an I was thinking
about<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.380> environment<00:01:28.620> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.220> it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
about the environment and then it's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
about the environment and then it's
turned<00:01:29.790> into<00:01:29.910> something<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.900> bit<00:01:31.200> more

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
turned into something a little bit more

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.580 
turned into something a little bit more
personal<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.160> you<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.720> how<00:01:33.870> we<00:01:34.170> as

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
personal but you know it's how we as

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.870 
personal but you know it's how we as
humans<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.430> cannot<00:01:36.440> destroy<00:01:37.440> what<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.830> have<00:01:38.070> we

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
will affect coming generations what most

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.130 
will affect coming generations what most
people<00:01:45.150> don't<00:01:45.240> care<00:01:45.540> since<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.670> we

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140
