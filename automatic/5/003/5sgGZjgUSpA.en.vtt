Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and that's

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.790 
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and that's
basically<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.949> difference<00:00:58.570> this<00:00:59.570> phone

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.780 

because<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.760> normal<00:01:05.390> Galaxy<00:01:06.140> s4<00:01:06.830> looks<00:01:07.460> a

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
because the normal Galaxy s4 looks a

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.580 
because the normal Galaxy s4 looks a
little<00:01:08.030> bit<00:01:08.330> like<00:01:08.510> this<00:01:08.780> wait<00:01:09.050> a<00:01:09.080> second<00:01:09.500> I

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
little bit like this wait a second I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
little bit like this wait a second I
have<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.890> somewhere

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
have it somewhere

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.060 
have it somewhere
normal<00:01:11.510> s4<00:01:12.380> will<00:01:12.650> look<00:01:12.830> like<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:13.960> glossy

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
normal s4 will look like that so glossy

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.149 
normal s4 will look like that so glossy
and<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:16.520> one<00:01:16.790> with<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:17.720> letter<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.920> looks

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
and this one with this letter it looks

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.560 
and this one with this letter it looks
pretty<00:01:19.520> cool<00:01:19.760> in<00:01:19.940> my<00:01:19.970> opinion

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
pretty cool in my opinion

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.980 
pretty cool in my opinion
so<00:01:21.110> that's<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.650> Samsung<00:01:22.159> Galaxy<00:01:22.340> s4<00:01:22.990> Black

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
so that's the Samsung Galaxy s4 Black

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.219 
so that's the Samsung Galaxy s4 Black
Edition
