00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.980
 today I give you all the 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.330
 reasons of the world for never again 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.650
 bought the frozen small bites 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.940
 when you receive your friends I watch 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.710
 how to make salmon puff pastry 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.910
 smoked with ricotta a nice little 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.910
 whipped cream with lemon 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:35.570
 to start I'm going to mix together 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:38.800
 ricotta a little honey with 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.800
 a tablespoon of chives 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.140
 I like mixing without children 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.650
 I 'm going to murder some salt and 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.110
 pepper 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.790
 I'll put that aside here I have a 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.140
 puff pastry obviously 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.180
 because it's so bad 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.400
 idea of â€‹â€‹venturing and pranking at the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.770
 house style house we know for that 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.830
 it's that Alex years and if I'm good 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.640
 so the papeete gelatine here and there here I 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.260
 smoked salmon 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.430
 please to the image of a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.810
 fishmonger near you then 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.520
 bought homemade smoked salmon it's worth 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.050
 so much trouble and at the grocery store at 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.479
 who at the top of the conflict but it's 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.830
 really really less good there everything 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:27.700
 we're going to do is turn off the whole 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:29.470
 dough surface with smoked salmon a 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.750
 once the surface of my paw is 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.610
 completely garnished with smoked salmon 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.500
 all I have left to do is 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:46.780
 of state marks lagging on salmon 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:48.580
 marinated in this phase go to notice 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.550
 I'm not one to do too much 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.890
 I do not know when it's a bit rustic 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.060
 iturra I did not miss need the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.650
 spatula on but it's like that then we 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:09.500
 let go in state 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:09.710
 to the good motion there still remains of this 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.420
 world 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:19.940
 this time I 'm going to wash the same 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:25.180
 joys even do it by hand but I 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.180
 tall sall and randomly 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.580
 today I just laughed at myself 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.630
 with seeing our palaces not serious it is 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.300
 a little bit quirky but to see them 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.800
 in the end, it's going to be super beautiful 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.130
 all I have to do is 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.310
 to roll like a pudding in the day 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.310
 door 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:52.850

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.510
 it's his beautiful was hastily smoke is 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.600
 what am I going to do I hope this 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.850
 either on foot or you want to cut the ends 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.000
 like that we can also say gp exceed it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.280
 I cut the excellent alexandre and there 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.959
 I will make little ones small 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.400
 sections of slices actually that I 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.400
 will put them on a plate accusing 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 you 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.250
 so once they are close by is 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.300
 what we are going to do is like to put 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.950
 fridge for about twenty minutes 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.720
 for the puff pastry to be well 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.280
 very cold and then after that we go 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.140
 return for 20 minutes in a 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:52.650
 85 degree oven I will show you 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:54.900
 the result of all this is about a 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.459
 twenty minutes that this info 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.489
 cooking is perfect outside and 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.690
 christian inside it is well cooked 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.040
 club since it will stay to do in fact 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.989
 it's to make whipped cream at 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.410
 lemon here I have half an hour of crem to 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.720
 whip 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:13.739
 I have to put the juice of half a lemon to 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:19.769
 inside also dry hair 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:34.620
 those years of salt and pepper and I 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:38.060
 desired with all the jute bracket goes 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.860
 to taste just for me is enough salt 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.720
 it's perfect so we went to 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.400
 the stage where we want alex steen with what 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.400
