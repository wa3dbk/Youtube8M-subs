00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
feel like this painting is a really good

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.890 
feel like this painting is a really good
example<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:19.730> like<00:00:20.730> during<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> process<00:00:21.630> I'm

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
example of like during the process I'm

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.599 
example of like during the process I'm
like<00:00:22.050> oh<00:00:22.230> my<00:00:22.529> word<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.010> thing<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> not

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
like oh my word this thing is not

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.900 
like oh my word this thing is not
turning<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.920> similar<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> kind<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:26.519> my

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
turning out similar to kind of like my

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490 
turning out similar to kind of like my
last<00:00:27.180> painting<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.900> believe<00:00:28.230> that's

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
last painting and I believe that's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.099 
last painting and I believe that's
because<00:00:28.680> I'm<00:00:29.330> overworking<00:00:30.330> it

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
because I'm overworking it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.749 
because I'm overworking it
I'm<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.560> letting<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> watercolor<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:32.700> of

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.360 
much I feel like I got the skin tone
when<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.410> was<00:01:21.500> all<00:01:21.620> said<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.890> done<00:01:21.980> down

when it was all said and done down

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.280 
when it was all said and done down
pretty<00:01:22.700> well<00:01:22.970> which<00:01:23.570> is<00:01:23.750> funny<00:01:23.960> because<00:01:24.110> I

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
pretty well which is funny because I

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.800 
pretty well which is funny because I
wasn't<00:01:24.470> even<00:01:24.740> concerned<00:01:25.190> with<00:01:25.370> that<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
wasn't even concerned with that the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.950 
wasn't even concerned with that the
colors<00:01:27.740> here<00:01:28.250> are<00:01:28.280> basically<00:01:28.910> the<00:01:29.420> yellow<00:01:29.750> and

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
colors here are basically the yellow and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.070 
colors here are basically the yellow and
red<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.710> teeny<00:01:31.370> bit<00:01:31.760> of<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.030> blue<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.900> give

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
red with a teeny bit of the blue to give

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.750 
red with a teeny bit of the blue to give
the<00:01:33.230> breath<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.800> get<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:34.070> Brown<00:01:34.280> kind<00:01:34.670> of

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
the breath to get that Brown kind of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:43.260 
the breath to get that Brown kind of
look

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.649 

I<00:01:44.490> feel<00:01:45.490> like<00:01:45.670> during<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.210> painting<00:01:46.539> I<00:01:46.630> was

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
I feel like during this painting I was

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.190 
I feel like during this painting I was
reworking<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.710> lot<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.250> stuff<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:49.479> still<00:01:50.020> feel

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
reworking a lot of stuff I still feel

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.560 
reworking a lot of stuff I still feel
somewhat<00:01:50.799> uncomfortable<00:01:51.159> with<00:01:51.939> watercolor<00:01:52.479> I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
somewhat uncomfortable with watercolor I

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.050 
somewhat uncomfortable with watercolor I
definitely<00:01:53.409> haven't<00:01:53.679> mastered<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.700> by<00:01:54.880> any

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
definitely haven't mastered it by any

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.660 
definitely haven't mastered it by any
means<00:01:55.179> so<00:01:55.929> a<00:01:55.960> lot<00:01:56.289> of<00:01:56.319> this<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.710> just<00:01:56.740> reworking

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
means so a lot of this is just reworking

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.179 
means so a lot of this is just reworking
and<00:01:58.140> removing<00:01:59.140> where<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.380> messed<00:01:59.710> up<00:01:59.950> because

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
and removing where I messed up because

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.609 
and removing where I messed up because
if<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:00.549> if<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:00.880> dab<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.420> paper<00:02:02.289> towel

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
if you if you dab it with a paper towel

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.649 
if you if you dab it with a paper towel
quick<00:02:02.950> enough<00:02:03.189> you<00:02:03.399> can<00:02:03.789> kind<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.149> erase<00:02:04.420> what

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
quick enough you can kind of erase what

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.029 
quick enough you can kind of erase what
you<00:02:04.750> just<00:02:04.929> did<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.380> long<00:02:05.409> as<00:02:05.709> you're<00:02:05.829> quick

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
you just did as long as you're quick

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:12.400 
you just did as long as you're quick
enough

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.150 

I<00:02:13.030> definitely<00:02:14.030> wish<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.720> had<00:02:15.110> left<00:02:15.410> more<00:02:15.800> white

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
I definitely wish I had left more white

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.790 
I definitely wish I had left more white
like<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.000> paper<00:02:17.300> showing<00:02:17.660> through<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.290> feel

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
like the paper showing through I feel

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.620 
like the paper showing through I feel
like<00:02:18.980> that's<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.060> problem<00:02:20.270> I've<00:02:20.420> been<00:02:20.480> having

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
like that's the problem I've been having

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.190 
like that's the problem I've been having
so<00:02:21.020> far<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.560> I've<00:02:21.890> been<00:02:22.460> painting<00:02:23.360> over<00:02:23.750> where

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.000 
so far is I've been painting over where
it<00:02:24.470> should<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:25.040> be<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.280> plain<00:02:25.670> white<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:27.170> I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
it should just be a plain white and I

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.830 
it should just be a plain white and I
feel<00:02:28.310> like<00:02:28.460> it<00:02:28.610> takes<00:02:28.880> away<00:02:29.210> from<00:02:29.240> what

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
feel like it takes away from what

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.440 
feel like it takes away from what
watercolor<00:02:30.530> really<00:02:30.860> does<00:02:31.100> for<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> painting

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
watercolor really does for a painting

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:42.140 
watercolor really does for a painting
when<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.470> overwork<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.370> that

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:55.490 

you

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.140 

so<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> don't<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.980> use<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> little<00:02:57.490> white<00:02:57.700> paint

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
so I don't I use a little white paint

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.320 
so I don't I use a little white paint
right<00:02:58.390> here<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.990> add<00:02:59.260> highlights<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.940> then

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
right here to add highlights and then

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.420 
right here to add highlights and then
that<00:03:01.540> white<00:03:02.260> paint<00:03:02.560> stroke<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.040> did<00:03:03.190> right

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
that white paint stroke I did right

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.000 
that white paint stroke I did right
there<00:03:03.610> on<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> eye<00:03:03.880> on<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.110> left<00:03:05.620> or<00:03:05.950> right

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
there on the eye on the left or right

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.850 
there on the eye on the left or right
eye<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> mistake<00:03:07.840> because<00:03:08.050> I<00:03:08.410> got<00:03:08.680> too

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
eye that was a mistake because I got too

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.610 
eye that was a mistake because I got too
dark<00:03:09.160> where<00:03:09.700> your<00:03:10.600> skin<00:03:10.870> should<00:03:11.140> be<00:03:11.200> kind<00:03:11.560> of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
dark where your skin should be kind of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.100 
dark where your skin should be kind of
folding<00:03:12.220> out<00:03:12.340> towards<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.660> had<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.990> use

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
folding out towards you so I had to use

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.750 
folding out towards you so I had to use
white<00:03:14.350> right<00:03:14.590> there<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.400> definitely<00:03:15.640> a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
white right there and it's definitely a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.180 
white right there and it's definitely a
mistake<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.270> noticed<00:03:16.750> but<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.650> know<00:03:17.800> it<00:03:18.040> is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
mistake I noticed but you know it is

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:27.810 
mistake I noticed but you know it is
what<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:19.060> guess<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.410> right<00:03:26.440> here<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:27.130> was

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
what it is I guess so right here I was

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.060 
what it is I guess so right here I was
way<00:03:28.150> too<00:03:28.210> dark<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.470> right<00:03:29.620> side<00:03:29.890> of<00:03:30.010> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
way too dark on the right side of the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.390 
way too dark on the right side of the
face<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:31.450> basically<00:03:32.320> all<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.740> this<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:33.130> me

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
face and basically all of this is me

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.290 
face and basically all of this is me
doing<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.750> water<00:03:35.020> wash<00:03:35.380> over<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.950> face

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
doing a just a water wash over the face

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.640 
doing a just a water wash over the face
trying<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.450> remove<00:03:37.840> some<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.290> paint

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
trying to remove some of that paint

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.280 
trying to remove some of that paint
because<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.370> way<00:03:39.610> too<00:03:39.670> dark<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.540> made

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
because it is just way too dark it made

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.500 
because it is just way too dark it made
the<00:03:41.500> face<00:03:41.680> look<00:03:41.890> really<00:03:42.130> splotchy<00:03:42.490> I<00:03:42.880> got<00:03:43.240> rid

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
these water spots are kind of coming to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.500 
these water spots are kind of coming to
life<00:04:10.470> with<00:04:10.890> like<00:04:11.280> little<00:04:11.820> characters<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.480> I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
life with like little characters that I

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.009 
so right here I'm using a black pin to
do<00:04:18.130> outlines<00:04:18.669> at<00:04:19.120> add<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.449> little<00:04:19.840> bit<00:04:19.989> more

detail<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.430> drawing<00:04:21.729> I<00:04:22.060> feel<00:04:22.479> like<00:04:22.570> this

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
detail to the drawing I feel like this

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.379 
detail to the drawing I feel like this
will<00:04:22.870> also<00:04:22.960> help<00:04:23.410> tie<00:04:23.770> in<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.550> illustrations

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389

you can tell it was the one product I
found<00:04:58.720> that<00:04:58.900> would<00:04:59.020> actually<00:04:59.350> work<00:04:59.500> on<00:04:59.710> the

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
found that would actually work on the

found that would actually work on the
watercolor<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.419> also<00:05:01.600> had<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:01.870> ballpoint

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
watercolor so and I also had a ballpoint

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.050 
watercolor so and I also had a ballpoint
tip<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:02.980> could<00:05:03.160> get<00:05:03.280> really<00:05:03.430> detailed<00:05:03.700> with

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
tip so I could get really detailed with

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:13.220 
tip so I could get really detailed with
things<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.690> felt<00:05:04.900> like<00:05:04.990> they<00:05:05.139> were<00:05:05.169> great

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.670 

I<00:05:14.330> tried<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.720> use<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.820> paint<00:05:17.820> washes<00:05:18.090> as<00:05:18.680> kind

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
I tried to use the paint washes as kind

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680 
I tried to use the paint washes as kind
of<00:05:19.740> look<00:05:20.190> at<00:05:20.340> their<00:05:20.460> shape<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:21.060> see<00:05:21.360> what<00:05:21.510> kind

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
of look at their shape and see what kind

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.260 
of look at their shape and see what kind
of<00:05:21.750> things<00:05:22.050> they<00:05:22.410> look<00:05:23.130> like<00:05:23.340> like<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.060> little

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
of things they look like like the little

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.660 
of things they look like like the little
bird<00:05:24.450> up<00:05:24.630> there<00:05:24.840> for<00:05:25.050> example<00:05:25.290> this<00:05:25.980> face<00:05:26.340> how

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
bird up there for example this face how

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.490 
bird up there for example this face how
it<00:05:26.790> kind<00:05:26.940> of<00:05:27.000> goes<00:05:27.060> like<00:05:27.660> where<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.990> dark<00:05:28.230> spot

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
it kind of goes like where the dark spot

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.890 
it kind of goes like where the dark spot
is<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:29.280> blue<00:05:29.520> real<00:05:29.880> blue<00:05:30.150> dark<00:05:30.450> I<00:05:30.630> knew<00:05:30.750> that's

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
is the blue real blue dark I knew that's

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.550 
is the blue real blue dark I knew that's
kind<00:05:31.290> of<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.410> recessive<00:05:31.890> point<00:05:32.370> for<00:05:32.760> an<00:05:32.850> eye<00:05:33.560> but

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
kind of a recessive point for an eye but

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.440 
kind of a recessive point for an eye but
I<00:05:34.740> thought<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:35.070> was<00:05:35.130> kind<00:05:35.370> of<00:05:35.400> fun<00:05:35.610> looking<00:05:36.240> for

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
I thought it was kind of fun looking for

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.380 
I thought it was kind of fun looking for
kind<00:05:37.020> of<00:05:37.110> these<00:05:37.610> images<00:05:38.610> inside<00:05:39.150> the

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
kind of these images inside the

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:47.710 
kind of these images inside the
watercolor

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:06:46.070 

you

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.350 

so<00:06:47.080> overall<00:06:47.410> I<00:06:47.530> felt<00:06:47.889> like<00:06:48.100> this<00:06:48.280> was<00:06:48.550> a<00:06:48.820> pretty

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
so overall I felt like this was a pretty

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.870 
so overall I felt like this was a pretty
good<00:06:49.949> self-portrait

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
good self-portrait

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.790 
good self-portrait
it's<00:06:52.300> kind<00:06:52.509> of<00:06:52.539> fun<00:06:52.720> to<00:06:52.750> look<00:06:52.960> at<00:06:53.169> I<00:06:53.470> feel<00:06:53.680> like

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
it's kind of fun to look at I feel like

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.330 
it's kind of fun to look at I feel like
it<00:06:53.919> captures<00:06:54.400> me<00:06:54.780> it<00:06:55.780> looks<00:06:56.020> like<00:06:56.199> me<00:06:56.440> so<00:06:56.979> I

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
it captures me it looks like me so I

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.430 
it captures me it looks like me so I
would<00:06:57.639> definitely<00:06:58.060> consider<00:06:58.330> the<00:06:58.630> success<00:06:59.080> a

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
would definitely consider the success a

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.060 
would definitely consider the success a
success<00:06:59.530> and<00:07:00.509> I<00:07:01.509> don't<00:07:02.380> know<00:07:02.560> I<00:07:02.590> feel<00:07:02.770> like<00:07:02.949> I

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
success and I don't know I feel like I

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.590 
success and I don't know I feel like I
overworked<00:07:03.610> it<00:07:03.820> a<00:07:03.850> little<00:07:04.030> bit<00:07:04.180> in<00:07:04.300> the<00:07:04.389> face

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
overworked it a little bit in the face

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.420 
overworked it a little bit in the face
but<00:07:05.080> that's<00:07:05.229> just<00:07:05.380> me<00:07:05.560> still<00:07:05.949> getting<00:07:06.190> used<00:07:06.340> to

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430
