00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:12.500
 I will clarify today 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.500
 how to make a homemade backlight for 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.639
 keyboard 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:37.830
 for the manufacture of lighting used 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:37.830
 ordinary cable channels do 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.000
 holes 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:18.790
 and insert the LED is better to do it 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 tweezers well I show how this one is there 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.180
 enters 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:40.720
 tweezers of course from the inside we connect 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.720
 LEDs 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:04.899
 we solder wires in parallel 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:08.100
 solder it to the standard 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.100
 connector pins 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.870
 where will the adapter be connected 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:40.880
 he looks everyone knows how she looks 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.880
 something like this from 3 to 12 volts 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:56.970
 on the back cap 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:05.810
 double-sided tape which 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.810
 the store is full and all this is possible with success 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:20.430
 peel off a convenient place LEDs 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.900
 Men can be used or purchased 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.760
 or from old already broken children 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.659
 toys 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.659
 also lighters and all that 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.690
 can be a large led thread 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.760
 already 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.220
 the polarity must be followed by a plus or minus 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:23.130
 If you want you can be greenish little blue 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:29.449
 little white and yellow nothing complicated 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:35.600
 this is not well, as I have already shown it all 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.600
 can be done within an hour 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:21.399
 optionally can be put in chains 

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:21.399
 switch 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.050
 in the end, we get such a highlight 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:47.510
 at night in the evening no one bothers color all 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.510
 it is seen 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.030
 everything is convenient 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.900
 most importantly enjoy 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.830
 of having done it yourself on this 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.830
 perhaps all
