okay<00:00:01.589> so<00:00:01.650> through<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.129> years<00:00:02.280> I've<00:00:02.520> seen<00:00:02.669> lots

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay so through the years I've seen lots

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.180 
okay so through the years I've seen lots
of<00:00:03.030> videos<00:00:03.090> on<00:00:03.720> base<00:00:04.230> slap<00:00:04.529> technique<00:00:04.770> and

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
of videos on base slap technique and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.070 
of videos on base slap technique and
sometimes<00:00:05.580> they<00:00:06.060> focus<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.509> very<00:00:06.690> advanced

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
sometimes they focus on very advanced

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.080 
sometimes they focus on very advanced
techniques<00:00:07.470> sometimes<00:00:08.309> they<00:00:08.519> have<00:00:08.670> players

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
techniques sometimes they have players

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.820 
techniques sometimes they have players
that<00:00:09.360> are<00:00:09.480> basically<00:00:10.260> showing<00:00:10.559> off<00:00:10.679> their

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
that are basically showing off their

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.459 
that are basically showing off their
chops<00:00:11.070> other<00:00:11.759> times<00:00:12.030> very<00:00:12.090> basic<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:13.259> what<00:00:13.440> I

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
chops other times very basic but what I

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.919 
chops other times very basic but what I
haven't<00:00:13.830> seen<00:00:13.980> very<00:00:14.160> much<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.849> videos<00:00:15.630> that

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
haven't seen very much of is videos that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.599 
haven't seen very much of is videos that
talk<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.410> intermediate<00:00:16.740> techniques<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
talk about intermediate techniques and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.550 
talk about intermediate techniques and
really<00:00:17.880> break<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.119> down<00:00:18.270> piece<00:00:19.140> by<00:00:19.170> piece<00:00:19.350> and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
really break it down piece by piece and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.290 
really break it down piece by piece and
show<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.980> how<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> practice<00:00:20.369> them<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.150> can

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
show you how to practice them so you can

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.210 
show you how to practice them so you can
you<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.630> really<00:00:21.779> learn<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.830> with<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.070> in

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
you can really learn it so with that in

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.349 
you can really learn it so with that in
mind<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.490> thought<00:00:23.640> I'd<00:00:23.789> throw<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.119> video

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
mind I thought I'd throw this video

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.910 
mind I thought I'd throw this video
together<00:00:24.510> we'll<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.019> if<00:00:25.230> anyone<00:00:25.560> finds<00:00:25.769> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
together we'll see if anyone finds it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.070 
together we'll see if anyone finds it
useful<00:00:26.330> what<00:00:27.330> I'm<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> cover<00:00:27.720> today<00:00:28.050> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
useful what I'm going to cover today is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.599 
useful what I'm going to cover today is
what<00:00:28.560> some<00:00:28.710> people<00:00:28.830> call<00:00:29.130> machine-gun

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
what some people call machine-gun

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.849 
what some people call machine-gun
triplets<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.109> triplets<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.619> could<00:00:31.740> be

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
triplets it can be triplets it could be

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.319 
triplets it can be triplets it could be
sixteenth<00:00:32.250> notes<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.759> depends<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.149> how

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
sixteenth notes it really depends on how

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.060 
sixteenth notes it really depends on how
you<00:00:33.360> incorporate<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> into<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> song<00:00:34.829> but

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
you incorporate it into the song but

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.160 
you incorporate it into the song but
having<00:00:35.760> said<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.540> technique<00:00:36.930> where

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
having said that it's a technique where

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
having said that it's a technique where
basically<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.250> doing<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.940> sort<00:00:39.059> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
basically you are doing this sort of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
basically you are doing this sort of
thing<00:00:40.129> okay

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
thing okay

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.459 
thing okay
so<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.450> sort<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.719> motion<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
so this sort of motion and I'm going to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.600 
so this sort of motion and I'm going to
show<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> different<00:00:43.739> ways<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.160> using<00:00:44.190> it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
show you different ways of using it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.139 
show you different ways of using it
really<00:00:45.450> comes<00:00:45.629> down<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.440> sequence

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
really comes down to a sequence

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.979 
really comes down to a sequence
different<00:00:48.149> people<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> differently<00:00:48.809> but

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
different people do it differently but

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.920 
different people do it differently but
this<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.200> how<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.010> mute<00:00:50.969> my<00:00:51.149> hand<00:00:51.449> like

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
this is how I do it I mute my hand like

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.439 
this is how I do it I mute my hand like
so<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.879> very<00:00:54.059> important<00:00:54.360> I'll

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
so you can see it's very important I'll

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479 
so you can see it's very important I'll
show<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> why<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.260> few<00:00:55.410> minutes<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
show you why in just a few minutes the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
show you why in just a few minutes the
first<00:00:56.520> motion<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.480> slap<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.079> case

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
first motion is just a slap in this case

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
first motion is just a slap in this case
to<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> e<00:00:58.530> string<00:00:58.949> or<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> string<00:00:59.910> excuse

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to the e string or the a string excuse

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360 
to the e string or the a string excuse
me<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> slide<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.770> fingers<00:01:02.010> across<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
me you slide your fingers across the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.359 
me you slide your fingers across the
whole<00:01:02.520> fretboard<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.500> then<00:01:04.500> back<00:01:04.739> here

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
whole fretboard up here then back here

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.100 
whole fretboard up here then back here
and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:05.909> finally<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> pop<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.750> case<00:01:06.960> on

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and then finally a pop in this case on

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
and then finally a pop in this case on
the<00:01:07.200> g<00:01:07.350> string<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> four<00:01:08.640> motions

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the g string so the four motions

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.289 
the g string so the four motions
together<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:10.939> now<00:01:11.939> when<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.180> learning

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
together are now when you're learning

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.390 
together are now when you're learning
this<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.470> encourage<00:01:13.619> people<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
this I really encourage people just to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.390 
this I really encourage people just to
keep<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> strings<00:01:15.060> muted<00:01:15.330> otherwise<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.020> get

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
keep the strings muted otherwise you get

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.649 
keep the strings muted otherwise you get
you<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.520> into<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:17.820> kinds<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.119> bad<00:01:18.299> sounds

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you get into all kinds of bad sounds

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.670 
you get into all kinds of bad sounds
you're<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:18.930> sure<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.650> so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you're not sure what to do with it so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320 
you're not sure what to do with it so
the<00:01:20.130> best<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:20.939> keep<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the best way to do that is just keep the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.539 
the best way to do that is just keep the
strings<00:01:21.540> muted<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.409> learn<00:01:23.159> how<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.369> get

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
strings muted and just learn how to get

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
strings muted and just learn how to get
the<00:01:23.610> percussion<00:01:24.210> sound<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.049> hitting<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the percussion sound out of hitting the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:36.109 
the percussion sound out of hitting the
strings<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:28.790> like<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:34.280> now<00:01:35.280> some<00:01:36.000> people

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
strings just like that now some people

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
strings just like that now some people
practices<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.020> they<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.290> faster<00:01:37.470> doing

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
practices so they get faster doing

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.260 
practices so they get faster doing
continuously<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.939> where<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
continuously that's where you get that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.490 
continuously that's where you get that
kind<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.659> machine<00:01:39.930> gun<00:01:40.110> sound

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
kind of machine gun sound

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200 
kind of machine gun sound
I<00:01:40.590> don't<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.369> practice<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.030> much

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I don't really practice that so much

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.450 
I don't really practice that so much
because<00:01:42.829> personally<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.070> knocking<00:01:44.280> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
because personally I'm not knocking it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.440 
because personally I'm not knocking it
but<00:01:44.610> personally<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.030> don't<00:01:45.060> find<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.420> very

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
but personally I don't find it very

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.260 
but personally I don't find it very
musical<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> focus<00:01:47.310> more<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.850> doing<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
musical what I focus more on is doing it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.749 
musical what I focus more on is doing it
three<00:01:48.540> times<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.470> three<00:01:49.860> hits<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.430> rapid

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
three times you know three hits in rapid

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.950 
three times you know three hits in rapid
succession<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.270> four<00:01:51.420> hits<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.659> rapid

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
succession or four hits in rapid

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
succession or four hits in rapid
succession<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.280> being<00:01:53.399> done<00:01:53.520> this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
succession and then just being done this

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.740 
succession and then just being done this
more<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.880> an<00:01:53.939> accent<00:01:54.329> piece<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.659> you're

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
more of an accent piece and you're

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.819 
more of an accent piece and you're
playing<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.290> more<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.590> kind<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
playing so it's more of this kind of

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.740 
playing so it's more of this kind of
thing<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:59.430> once<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> place<00:02:00.659> where

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
thing so once you get to a place where

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.209 
thing so once you get to a place where
you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.140> build<00:02:01.320> up<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.409> speed<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you can build up the speed on this and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.300 
you can build up the speed on this and
you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.200> do<00:02:04.200> maybe<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.530> succession<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.130> that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you can do maybe a succession like that

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.429 
you can do maybe a succession like that
fairly<00:02:05.640> rapidly<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> want<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> try<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
fairly rapidly then you want to try to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.080 
fairly rapidly then you want to try to
play<00:02:07.680> around<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> rhythm<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.580> before

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
play around with the rhythm of it before

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.710 
play around with the rhythm of it before
you<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.660> focus<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.080> trying

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
you really focus on trying

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.690 
you really focus on trying
open<00:02:10.899> up<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.080> note<00:02:11.290> just<00:02:12.220> play<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.580> rhythm

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
open up a note just play with the rhythm

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.130 
open up a note just play with the rhythm
of<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.240> try<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.480> make<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> little<00:02:13.960> bit

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
of it and try to make it a little bit

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.870 
of it and try to make it a little bit
more<00:02:14.260> musical<00:02:14.770> than<00:02:14.800> just<00:02:15.160> something<00:02:15.640> that's

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
more musical than just something that's

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.950 
more musical than just something that's
automatic<00:02:23.760> okay<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.600> when<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.870> get

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
automatic okay so when you get

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.480 
automatic okay so when you get
comfortable<00:02:26.440> with<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.620> motion<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.280> it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
comfortable with that motion and it

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.620 
comfortable with that motion and it
takes<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> little<00:02:27.790> bit<00:02:27.880> practice<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:28.540> you'll

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
takes a little bit practice but you'll

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.810 
takes a little bit practice but you'll
find<00:02:28.780> eventually<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.350> do<00:02:29.530> then<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:30.490> time<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
find eventually you do then it's time to

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.250 
find eventually you do then it's time to
just<00:02:30.970> start<00:02:31.210> playing<00:02:31.840> around<00:02:32.020> with<00:02:32.200> different

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
just start playing around with different

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.140 
just start playing around with different
strings<00:02:32.800> playing<00:02:33.370> around<00:02:33.520> different<00:02:33.760> notes

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
strings playing around different notes

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.340 
strings playing around different notes
opening<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.750> piece<00:02:34.900> by<00:02:34.930> piece

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
opening it piece by piece

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.680 
opening it piece by piece
when<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.190> find<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.610> you're<00:02:36.820> starting<00:02:37.600> to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
when you find that you're starting to

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.360 
when you find that you're starting to
open<00:02:37.840> up<00:02:38.050> individual<00:02:38.620> notes<00:02:38.830> as<00:02:39.040> opposed<00:02:39.310> to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
open up individual notes as opposed to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.770 
open up individual notes as opposed to
muting<00:02:39.670> everything<00:02:40.060> it'll<00:02:40.480> get<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.630> little

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
muting everything it'll get a little

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.360 
muting everything it'll get a little
awkward<00:02:41.200> at<00:02:41.290> first<00:02:41.320> but<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> trick<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.340> just

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
awkward at first but the trick is just

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.260 
awkward at first but the trick is just
to<00:02:42.550> keep<00:02:42.760> with<00:02:42.970> it

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
to keep with it

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.690 
to keep with it
it's<00:02:43.900> hard<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.170> explain<00:02:44.440> how<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.740> mute<00:02:45.010> right

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
it's hard to explain how to mute right

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.310 
it's hard to explain how to mute right
after<00:02:46.000> playing<00:02:46.209> each<00:02:46.420> song<00:02:46.690> because<00:02:46.930> your

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
after playing each song because your

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.710 
after playing each song because your
hands<00:02:47.500> kind<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.709> figure<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.040> out<00:02:48.220> in<00:02:48.370> time

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
hands kind of figure that out in time

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.449 
hands kind of figure that out in time
but<00:02:49.720> just<00:02:49.900> practice<00:02:50.290> doing<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.040> at<00:02:51.160> different

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
but just practice doing it at different

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.100 
but just practice doing it at different
strings<00:02:51.760> opening<00:02:52.300> up<00:02:52.390> different<00:02:52.480> notes<00:02:52.870> and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
strings opening up different notes and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.270 
strings opening up different notes and
before<00:02:53.770> you<00:02:53.830> know<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.100> you'll<00:02:54.250> be

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
before you know it you'll be

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830 
before you know it you'll be
incorporating<00:02:54.850> into<00:02:54.970> your<00:02:55.030> music<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.780> what

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
incorporating into your music and what

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.030 
incorporating into your music and what
that<00:02:56.020> means<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.440> instead<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.770> playing

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
that means is instead of playing

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.800 
that means is instead of playing
something<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.400> this<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:01.360> can<00:03:01.540> throw<00:03:01.720> in

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
something like this you can throw in

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.930 
something like this you can throw in
that<00:03:01.900> accent

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.840 

[Music]

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.760 

so<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:15.970> adds<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.330> spice<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.350> your<00:03:17.380> slap

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
so it adds to a spice to your slap

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.830 
so it adds to a spice to your slap
playing<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.670> once<00:03:18.850> again<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.450> review

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
playing so once again just to review

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.550 
playing so once again just to review
really<00:03:20.080> quick<00:03:20.310> you're<00:03:21.310> muting<00:03:21.670> slap<00:03:22.630> slap

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
really quick you're muting slap slap

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.610 
really quick you're muting slap slap
slap<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:26.160> practice<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.930> try<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:28.990> make<00:03:29.500> it

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
slap up practice that try to make it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.040 
slap up practice that try to make it
musical<00:03:30.040> by<00:03:30.190> playing<00:03:30.430> with<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.670> rhythm<00:03:34.050> and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
musical by playing with the rhythm and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:43.530 
musical by playing with the rhythm and
then<00:03:35.320> finally<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:42.670> get<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.880> idea<00:03:43.120> played<00:03:43.420> on

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
then finally you get the idea played on

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.670 
then finally you get the idea played on
different<00:03:43.810> strings<00:03:44.020> play<00:03:44.320> at<00:03:44.410> different

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
different strings play at different
