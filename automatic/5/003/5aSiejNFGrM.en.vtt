were great dad I think that it's a team
deal<00:04:56.740> we<00:04:57.220> said<00:04:57.250> we<00:04:57.670> were<00:04:57.790> going<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.000> bring<00:04:58.210> 64

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
minutes I think it was a team effort I

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.040 
minutes I think it was a team effort I
thought<00:05:06.970> we<00:05:07.120> did<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.270> great<00:05:07.510> job<00:05:07.540> in<00:05:07.840> the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
thought we did a great job in the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.080 
thought we did a great job in the
kicking<00:05:08.410> game<00:05:08.440> we<00:05:09.130> might<00:05:09.310> have<00:05:09.490> out<00:05:09.610> returned

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
kicking game we might have out returned

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.240 
kicking game we might have out returned
that<00:05:10.330> team<00:05:10.570> which<00:05:10.870> is<00:05:11.050> really<00:05:11.410> hard<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.710> do<00:05:12.010> and

that team which is really hard to do and

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.190 
that team which is really hard to do and
I<00:05:12.580> thought<00:05:12.790> Alexis<00:05:13.330> stepped<00:05:13.630> up<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.020> did<00:05:14.140> a

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200
