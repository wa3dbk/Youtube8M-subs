00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.459 

this<00:00:04.870> is<00:00:05.050> liquidambar<00:00:05.770> cyrus<00:00:06.640> of<00:00:06.850> fluo

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:07.469 
this is liquidambar cyrus of fluo

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:12.720 
this is liquidambar cyrus of fluo
american<00:00:08.469> sweet<00:00:08.860> gum<00:00:09.100> and<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:12.400> know<00:00:12.520> there's

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
american sweet gum and you know there's

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.910 
american sweet gum and you know there's
two<00:00:12.969> varieties<00:00:13.660> that<00:00:13.690> seem<00:00:14.170> to<00:00:14.289> be<00:00:14.440> used<00:00:14.709> the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
two varieties that seem to be used the

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.689 
two varieties that seem to be used the
most<00:00:15.190> in<00:00:15.459> our<00:00:15.610> area<00:00:16.000> Palo<00:00:16.720> Alto<00:00:16.840> and<00:00:17.529> I<00:00:18.340> believe

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
most in our area Palo Alto and I believe

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.630 
most in our area Palo Alto and I believe
festival<00:00:19.449> so<00:00:20.140> there's<00:00:20.470> a<00:00:20.740> number<00:00:21.520> of

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
festival so there's a number of

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.260 
festival so there's a number of
different<00:00:22.030> varieties<00:00:22.180> but<00:00:24.090> those<00:00:25.090> are

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
different varieties but those are

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.120 
different varieties but those are
probably<00:00:25.480> two<00:00:25.900> of<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:26.050> more<00:00:26.230> common<00:00:26.289> ones<00:00:26.920> I

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
probably two of the more common ones I

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.400 
probably two of the more common ones I
see<00:00:27.400> and<00:00:27.670> especially<00:00:28.050> great<00:00:29.050> fall<00:00:29.380> color

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
see and especially great fall color

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.459 
see and especially great fall color
varieties<00:00:30.340> so<00:00:30.610> I'll<00:00:31.240> get<00:00:31.450> into<00:00:31.600> what's<00:00:31.960> really

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
varieties so I'll get into what's really

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.560 
varieties so I'll get into what's really
nice<00:00:32.619> about<00:00:32.680> this<00:00:33.100> tree<00:00:33.670> probably<00:00:34.329> the

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
nice about this tree probably the

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.350 
nice about this tree probably the
biggest<00:00:35.250> distinction<00:00:36.250> on<00:00:36.610> this<00:00:36.820> tree<00:00:37.120> are<00:00:37.329> the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
biggest distinction on this tree are the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.319 
biggest distinction on this tree are the
two<00:00:37.750> things<00:00:38.020> its<00:00:38.440> form<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:39.610> can<00:00:39.790> see<00:00:40.060> that

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
two things its form you can see that

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.450 
two things its form you can see that
there's<00:00:40.870> two<00:00:40.930> trees<00:00:41.470> here<00:00:41.800> there's<00:00:42.070> actually

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
there's two trees here there's actually

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.490 
there's two trees here there's actually
a<00:00:42.489> third<00:00:42.820> one<00:00:43.060> in<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.300> background<00:00:43.810> but<00:00:44.380> you

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
a third one in the background but you

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.410 
a third one in the background but you
see<00:00:44.710> how<00:00:44.860> vertical<00:00:45.520> they<00:00:45.700> are<00:00:45.880> they<00:00:46.120> have<00:00:46.270> this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
see how vertical they are they have this

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.680 
see how vertical they are they have this
nice<00:00:46.720> vertical<00:00:47.399> stature<00:00:48.399> or<00:00:48.940> habit<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.390> growth

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
nice vertical stature or habit of growth

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.220 
nice vertical stature or habit of growth
there<00:00:50.500> those<00:00:50.950> are<00:00:51.190> probably<00:00:51.550> only<00:00:52.300> 10<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:52.960> 12

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
there those are probably only 10 to 12

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.819 
there those are probably only 10 to 12
feet<00:00:53.440> wide<00:00:53.470> but<00:00:54.190> they're<00:00:54.430> 30<00:00:54.809> feet<00:00:55.809> plus<00:00:56.290> tall

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
feet wide but they're 30 feet plus tall

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.690 
feet wide but they're 30 feet plus tall
and<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.930> they<00:00:59.110> really<00:00:59.440> look<00:00:59.649> nice<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.250> groves

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
and so they really look nice and groves

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.829 
and so they really look nice and groves
or<00:01:01.090> in<00:01:01.270> groupings<00:01:01.780> like<00:01:02.020> you<00:01:02.200> see<00:01:02.410> here

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
or in groupings like you see here

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.590 
or in groupings like you see here
secondly<00:01:05.100> probably<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.369> best<00:01:06.759> fall<00:01:07.240> color

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
secondly probably the best fall color

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.550 
secondly probably the best fall color
tree<00:01:08.459> hands<00:01:09.459> down<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.329> in<00:01:10.689> a<00:01:10.840> reliable

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
tree hands down and in a reliable

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.120 
tree hands down and in a reliable
fashion<00:01:11.799> we're<00:01:12.459> in<00:01:12.609> the<00:01:12.729> Bay<00:01:12.880> Area<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.479> set<00:01:13.810> in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
fashion we're in the Bay Area and set in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.510 
fashion we're in the Bay Area and set in
California<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:16.060> hot<00:01:16.270> inland<00:01:16.659> valley<00:01:16.929> and

California and a hot inland valley and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.489 
California and a hot inland valley and
we<00:01:18.520> only<00:01:18.670> get<00:01:18.999> in<00:01:19.209> the<00:01:19.299> high<00:01:19.479> 20s<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.319> low<00:01:20.469> 30s

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
we only get in the high 20s to low 30s

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.609 
we only get in the high 20s to low 30s
during<00:01:21.249> the<00:01:21.429> winter<00:01:21.880> but<00:01:22.539> these<00:01:22.840> still<00:01:23.200> in

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
during the winter but these still in

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.459 
during the winter but these still in
fall<00:01:24.100> produce<00:01:24.609> quite<00:01:25.029> a<00:01:25.060> show<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.719> it's

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
fall produce quite a show and it's

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.709 
fall produce quite a show and it's
really<00:01:26.950> impressive<00:01:28.649> that<00:01:29.649> said<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.539> this

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
really impressive that said that so this

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.929 
really impressive that said that so this
is<00:01:31.899> a<00:01:31.929> popular<00:01:32.529> tree<00:01:32.859> as<00:01:33.039> a<00:01:33.099> result<00:01:33.579> of<00:01:33.789> that

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
is a popular tree as a result of that

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.569 
is a popular tree as a result of that
the<00:01:34.209> vertical<00:01:34.569> stature<00:01:35.020> they<00:01:35.889> don't<00:01:36.069> get<00:01:36.310> into

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
the vertical stature they don't get into

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.429 
the vertical stature they don't get into
your<00:01:36.729> neighbor's<00:01:37.119> yard<00:01:37.329> so<00:01:37.719> much<00:01:37.929> widthwise

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
your neighbor's yard so much widthwise

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.029 
your neighbor's yard so much widthwise
and<00:01:39.569> like<00:01:40.569> here<00:01:40.869> they've<00:01:41.079> kind<00:01:41.499> of<00:01:41.619> defined

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
and like here they've kind of defined

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.709 
and like here they've kind of defined
the<00:01:42.219> edge<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.579> this<00:01:42.670> property<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.299> like<00:01:43.569> how

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
the edge of this property I like how

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.459 
the edge of this property I like how
they've<00:01:43.929> been<00:01:44.079> used<00:01:44.409> that<00:01:44.619> way<00:01:44.859> but<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:46.469> so

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
they've been used that way but the so

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.469 
they've been used that way but the so
let's<00:01:47.649> get<00:01:47.859> into<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.520> other<00:01:48.639> side<00:01:49.060> or<00:01:49.329> the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
let's get into the other side or the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.949 
let's get into the other side or the
not-so-great<00:01:50.109> side<00:01:50.499> of<00:01:50.709> this<00:01:50.829> tree<00:01:51.959> probably

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
not-so-great side of this tree probably

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.739 
not-so-great side of this tree probably
has<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.619> singular<00:01:54.249> worst<00:01:54.669> root<00:01:55.029> system<00:01:55.539> I've

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
has the singular worst root system I've

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:56.849 
has the singular worst root system I've
ever<00:01:56.079> encountered

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
ever encountered

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.489 
ever encountered
if<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.520> ever<00:01:57.729> look<00:01:58.060> underneath<00:01:58.329> a<00:01:58.959> mature

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
if you ever look underneath a mature

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.919 
if you ever look underneath a mature
grouping<00:02:00.099> of<00:02:00.249> these<00:02:00.429> I'll<00:02:01.149> take<00:02:01.419> a<00:02:01.450> look<00:02:01.779> and

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
grouping of these I'll take a look and

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.959 
grouping of these I'll take a look and
see<00:02:02.169> if<00:02:02.259> these<00:02:02.469> are<00:02:02.679> doing<00:02:03.159> what<00:02:03.340> I'm<00:02:03.489> telling

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
see if these are doing what I'm telling

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.499 
see if these are doing what I'm telling
you<00:02:04.090> about<00:02:04.209> but<00:02:05.069> if<00:02:06.069> you<00:02:06.399> ever<00:02:06.579> try<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:06.999> get<00:02:07.329> in

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
you about but if you ever try and get in

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.050 
you about but if you ever try and get in
and<00:02:07.749> do<00:02:07.899> any<00:02:08.080> additional<00:02:08.979> landscaping<00:02:09.340> around

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
and do any additional landscaping around

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.890 
and do any additional landscaping around
these<00:02:10.660> trees<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.470> roots<00:02:11.740> are<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:12.400> intense<00:02:12.900> so

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
these trees the roots are so intense so

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.100 
these trees the roots are so intense so
shallow<00:02:15.420> so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
shallow so

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.740 
shallow so
just<00:02:17.710> overwhelming<00:02:18.670> two<00:02:18.880> other<00:02:19.060> plants<00:02:19.690> that

it's<00:02:20.050> very<00:02:20.380> hard<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.950> grow<00:02:21.130> other<00:02:21.430> plants<00:02:21.970> in

unless<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.510> establish<00:02:26.110> those<00:02:26.350> when<00:02:26.650> they're

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.160 
young but even over time I mean it's I'm
saying<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:30.760> not<00:02:31.180> because<00:02:31.600> that's<00:02:31.810> what<00:02:32.050> I'm

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
saying this not because that's what I'm

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.530 
saying this not because that's what I'm
looking<00:02:32.530> at<00:02:32.680> but<00:02:32.740> it's<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:33.730> common<00:02:34.270> those

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
looking at but it's just so common those

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.690 
looking at but it's just so common those
down<00:02:34.840> those<00:02:35.350> trees<00:02:35.710> I'm<00:02:35.920> looking<00:02:36.280> at<00:02:36.430> don't

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
down those trees I'm looking at don't

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.640 
down those trees I'm looking at don't
have<00:02:36.910> any<00:02:37.090> significant<00:02:37.840> plants<00:02:38.170> around<00:02:38.440> their

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
have any significant plants around their

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.770 
have any significant plants around their
trunks<00:02:39.070> either<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:40.210> ones<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.660> are

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
trunks either and the ones that are

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.890 
trunks either and the ones that are
they're<00:02:41.020> struggling<00:02:42.060> because<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.570> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
they're struggling because of that the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.350 
they're struggling because of that the
root<00:02:44.080> system<00:02:44.590> just<00:02:45.070> literally<00:02:45.580> strangles<00:02:46.180> out

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
root system just literally strangles out

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.140 
root system just literally strangles out
other<00:02:46.600> plants<00:02:47.170> secondly<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.459> becomes<00:02:48.970> a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
other plants secondly that becomes a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.060 
other plants secondly that becomes a
real<00:02:49.720> problem<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:50.560> any<00:02:50.709> paving<00:02:51.990> lawn

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
real problem for any paving lawn

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.430 
real problem for any paving lawn
anything<00:02:54.070> like<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:55.000> these<00:02:55.690> trees<00:02:56.020> really

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
anything like that so these trees really

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.229 
anything like that so these trees really
don't<00:02:56.739> like<00:02:56.950> company<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.459> guess<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.090> what

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
don't like company I guess this is what

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.630 
don't like company I guess this is what
it<00:02:58.360> boils<00:02:58.390> down<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.959> their<00:02:59.500> roots<00:02:59.800> are<00:03:00.070> really

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
it boils down to their roots are really

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.479 
it boils down to their roots are really
a<00:03:00.760> headache<00:03:01.350> secondly<00:03:02.350> they<00:03:02.650> produce<00:03:02.890> what<00:03:03.340> we

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
a headache secondly they produce what we

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.630 
a headache secondly they produce what we
call<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.000> spiky<00:03:04.510> balls<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.590> their<00:03:05.830> seed<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.580> a

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
call the spiky balls so their seed is a

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.120 
call the spiky balls so their seed is a
round<00:03:07.320> probably<00:03:08.320> inch<00:03:08.530> inch<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.100> half

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
round probably inch inch and a half

diameter<00:03:10.620> spiky<00:03:11.820> little<00:03:12.820> ball<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.660> as<00:03:13.840> it

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
diameter spiky little ball that as it

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.220 
diameter spiky little ball that as it
dries<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.440> falls<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.550> ground<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.300> mass<00:03:16.810> in

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
dries it falls to the ground and mass in

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.260 
dries it falls to the ground and mass in
some<00:03:17.530> years<00:03:17.860> especially<00:03:18.190> as<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.700> tree<00:03:19.000> gets

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
some years especially as a tree gets

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.259 
some years especially as a tree gets
bigger<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:20.320> get<00:03:20.470> hundreds<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.190> these<00:03:21.400> falling

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
bigger you get hundreds of these falling

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.350 
bigger you get hundreds of these falling
on<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.570> ground<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:24.400> hurt<00:03:24.700> your<00:03:24.880> feet<00:03:25.180> if

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
on the ground and they hurt your feet if

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.449 
on the ground and they hurt your feet if
you<00:03:25.510> step<00:03:25.840> on<00:03:26.049> them<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.620> they're<00:03:27.130> just<00:03:27.160> a

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
you step on them and they're just a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.090 
you step on them and they're just a
general<00:03:27.940> nuisance<00:03:28.530> maintenance<00:03:29.530> nuisance

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
general nuisance maintenance nuisance

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.390 
general nuisance maintenance nuisance
and<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.910> because<00:03:31.810> they're<00:03:32.080> not<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.320> leaf<00:03:32.769> these

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
and and because they're not a leaf these

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.550 
and and because they're not a leaf these
can<00:03:33.640> continue<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.330> drop<00:03:34.540> for<00:03:34.870> months<00:03:35.290> and

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
can continue to drop for months and

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.880 
can continue to drop for months and
that's<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.920> other<00:03:36.010> thing<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.700> get<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:36.880> long

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
that's the other thing so you get a long

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.509 
that's the other thing so you get a long
litter<00:03:38.890> cycle<00:03:39.519> out<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.970> those<00:03:40.150> spiky<00:03:40.870> balls

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
litter cycle out of those spiky balls

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.890 
litter cycle out of those spiky balls
not<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.700> mention<00:03:42.910> they<00:03:43.180> don't<00:03:43.330> look<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:43.690> great

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
not to mention they don't look so great

those<00:03:47.500> two<00:03:47.769> things<00:03:47.799> alone<00:03:48.519> are<00:03:48.880> enough<00:03:48.910> that

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
those two things alone are enough that

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.660 
those two things alone are enough that

way I would tell you to look at using

way I would tell you to look at using
these<00:03:56.320> is<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:56.830> you've<00:03:57.010> got<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.250> slope<00:03:57.760> or<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.090> big

these is if you've got a slope or a big

open area where the roots don't matter

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
and the cleanup of those spiky balls

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.520 
and the cleanup of those spiky balls
don't<00:04:03.760> matter<00:04:04.060> that's<00:04:04.720> probably<00:04:05.140> your<00:04:05.290> best

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
don't matter that's probably your best

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.060 
don't matter that's probably your best
bet<00:04:06.180> or<00:04:07.180> you've<00:04:07.480> got<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.690> larger<00:04:08.260> residence<00:04:08.830> and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
bet or you've got a larger residence and

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.550 
bet or you've got a larger residence and
at<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.340> back<00:04:09.519> of<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.880> property<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.959> want

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
at the back of the property you want

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.380 
at the back of the property you want
some<00:04:11.799> vertical<00:04:12.160> interest<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:12.970> some<00:04:13.150> great

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
some vertical interest and some great

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.870 
some vertical interest and some great
fall<00:04:13.690> color<00:04:13.720> I'd<00:04:14.350> say<00:04:14.680> that's<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.160> way<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.519> use

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
fall color I'd say that's the way to use

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.150 
fall color I'd say that's the way to use
these<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.450> enjoy<00:04:16.810> them<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.290> keep<00:04:17.590> them<00:04:17.799> away

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
these and enjoy them is keep them away

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.819

from where people are where you would

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
have to maintain them and put them far

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.050 
have to maintain them and put them far
enough<00:04:24.970> away<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.510> where<00:04:26.099> you<00:04:27.099> can<00:04:27.280> also<00:04:27.460> enjoy

that<00:04:28.300> nice<00:04:28.510> form<00:04:28.990> I've<00:04:29.260> seen<00:04:29.590> these<00:04:29.770> paired

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
that nice form I've seen these paired

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.629 
that nice form I've seen these paired
with

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
with

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.730 
with
redwoods<00:04:30.969> I've<00:04:31.210> done<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.569> myself<00:04:31.810> years<00:04:32.319> ago

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
redwoods I've done that myself years ago

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.100 
redwoods I've done that myself years ago
and<00:04:33.039> they're<00:04:33.669> beautiful<00:04:34.210> next<00:04:34.449> to<00:04:34.569> redwoods

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
and they're beautiful next to redwoods

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.020 
and they're beautiful next to redwoods
because<00:04:35.469> of<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.710> dark<00:04:35.979> color<00:04:36.039> of<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.550> redwood

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
because of the dark color of the redwood

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.230 
because of the dark color of the redwood
with<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.479> fall<00:04:38.110> color<00:04:38.409> of<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.770> tree<00:04:39.240> looks

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
with the fall color of this tree looks

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.769 
with the fall color of this tree looks
great<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.860> that's<00:04:42.249> a<00:04:42.550> way<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.120> think<00:04:43.509> about

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:43.779 
great so that's a way to think about

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:47.129 
great so that's a way to think about
using<00:04:44.020> those<00:04:44.409> in<00:04:44.620> design<00:04:45.090> what<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.270> avoid<00:04:46.539> I've

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
using those in design what to avoid I've

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.689 
using those in design what to avoid I've
already<00:04:47.499> said<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:47.979> keep<00:04:48.189> them<00:04:48.430> away<00:04:48.669> from

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
already said is keep them away from

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.010 
already said is keep them away from
paving<00:04:49.479> lawns<00:04:50.289> and<00:04:50.770> tight<00:04:51.669> areas<00:04:52.120> where<00:04:52.360> where

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
paving lawns and tight areas where where

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.689 
paving lawns and tight areas where where
you're<00:04:53.139> trying<00:04:53.379> to<00:04:53.560> learn<00:04:53.979> also<00:04:54.249> other

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
you're trying to learn also other

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.489 
you're trying to learn also other
planting<00:04:55.330> areas<00:04:55.749> if<00:04:55.960> you're<00:04:56.110> going<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.289> put

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:56.499 
planting areas if you're going to put

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.529 
planting areas if you're going to put
these<00:04:57.180> in<00:04:58.180> at<00:04:58.419> all<00:04:58.629> just<00:04:59.349> know<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.919> long<00:05:00.159> term

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
these in at all just know that long term

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.939 
these in at all just know that long term
other<00:05:01.539> plants<00:05:02.080> probably<00:05:02.560> aren't<00:05:02.740> going<00:05:02.889> to

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
other plants probably aren't going to

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.309 
other plants probably aren't going to
survive<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.639> best<00:05:03.939> plant<00:05:04.270> around<00:05:04.719> this<00:05:04.990> for

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
survive the best plant around this for

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.450 
survive the best plant around this for
me<00:05:05.469> is<00:05:05.680> vinca<00:05:06.099> minor<00:05:06.340> or<00:05:06.939> some<00:05:07.500> very<00:05:08.500> wiry<00:05:08.860> easy

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
me is vinca minor or some very wiry easy

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.429 
me is vinca minor or some very wiry easy
to<00:05:09.699> grow<00:05:09.909> ground<00:05:10.270> cover<00:05:10.569> underneath<00:05:11.080> them

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:11.439 
to grow ground cover underneath them

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.059 
to grow ground cover underneath them
that<00:05:11.469> can<00:05:11.830> take<00:05:12.039> some<00:05:12.069> shade<00:05:12.580> as<00:05:12.849> these<00:05:13.449> mature

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
that can take some shade as these mature

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.290 
that can take some shade as these mature
so<00:05:15.069> that's<00:05:15.250> what<00:05:15.460> I<00:05:15.490> can<00:05:15.580> tell<00:05:15.789> you<00:05:16.029> about

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
so that's what I can tell you about

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.959 
so that's what I can tell you about
these<00:05:16.659> long-term<00:05:17.620> -<00:05:18.009> I've<00:05:18.340> seen<00:05:18.729> these

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
these long-term - I've seen these

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.760 
these long-term - I've seen these
they're<00:05:19.300> fairly<00:05:19.599> drought<00:05:20.020> tolerant<00:05:20.650> you

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
they're fairly drought tolerant you

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.950 
they're fairly drought tolerant you
don't<00:05:20.979> want<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.580> do<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:21.939> to<00:05:22.180> them<00:05:22.389> but<00:05:22.629> if<00:05:22.779> you

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
don't want to do that to them but if you

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.829 
don't want to do that to them but if you
get<00:05:23.259> into<00:05:23.529> a<00:05:23.560> low<00:05:23.800> water<00:05:24.069> situation<00:05:24.939> these<00:05:25.539> can

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:25.839 
get into a low water situation these can

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.980 
get into a low water situation these can
probably<00:05:26.110> survive<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:27.039> and<00:05:27.509> with<00:05:28.509> some<00:05:28.719> very

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
probably survive that and with some very

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.929 
probably survive that and with some very
moderate<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.830> low<00:05:30.009> water<00:05:30.279> once<00:05:30.669> they're

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939 
moderate to low water once they're

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.730 
moderate to low water once they're
established<00:05:31.089> they're<00:05:31.810> pretty<00:05:32.020> good<00:05:32.229> survivor

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740
