00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.980

 if you are the winner and have not done so 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.240
 one of these things 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.030
 will be canceled will be chosen other 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.340
 person to win right and I will 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.410
 explain that everyone has hanaq pay 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.660
 and attention is not understood back 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.630
 video to try to understand why 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.810
 a lot of people doing wrong because the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.060
 people want an online one that is online 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.220
 I will give an example here with mine as the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.430
 handrail you come from an oil on the handrail 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.920
 It goes all the way out of oil again you 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.380
 grab the hunter turn the slide out of 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.550
 kick you take in the presence of flip 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.950
 rockslide and get off the railing and thence 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.959
 You have to take another one to be picked up online 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.060
 It was everything that you got right in that time. 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.640
 no mistake you hit these maneuvers 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.090
 They had cut the video it is a line 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.390
 Okay, what I'm telling you is right. 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.970
 tail slide the guy hit the cut soft 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.800
 short face hits a flip the guy wakes up 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.050
 it's getting all cut 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.600
 Not that we do not want to edit 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.450
 you can have only edit dinha can 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.030
 send with music with collor action more 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.970
 without cuts from one maneuver to another 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.890
 leaves there pure leaves without editing this 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.410
 part because many people are 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.450
 sending things with the ikea cut goes 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.630
 a lot of people happen like that 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.489
 and go few people send it right goes 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.459
 to be almost annulled 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.420
 So it's for everyone to send lines in 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.400
 court 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.049
 pay close attention explaining well 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.290
 slow here to hope everyone 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.880
 understand is okay is the desire is to make the video 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.560
 because sometimes the person does not 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.450
 can understand and interpret what 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.500
 it is written that he is already doing something 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.280
 so wrong to have trouble who I 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.310
 Father, who sees what you did to these 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.930

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.769
