what<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:13.700> both<00:01:13.970> know<00:01:14.030> your<00:01:14.600> body<00:01:14.780> is

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
what you and I both know your body is

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.649 
what you and I both know your body is
approaching<00:01:15.590> its<00:01:15.710> limit<00:01:16.130> but<00:01:17.120> when<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:17.300> said

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
approaching its limit but when I said

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.380 
approaching its limit but when I said
half<00:01:17.870> a<00:01:18.080> year<00:01:18.470> I<00:01:18.700> wasn't<00:01:19.700> talking<00:01:20.060> about<00:01:20.120> your

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
half a year I wasn't talking about your

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.580 
half a year I wasn't talking about your
lifespan<00:01:22.540> what<00:01:23.540> do<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.660> mean<00:01:26.080> we<00:01:27.080> can't<00:01:27.350> get

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590
