neck I'm just going to finger coma just

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.940

a<00:01:51.899> little<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:53.390> just<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.840> kind<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.320> see

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.200 

even<00:01:58.950> though<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.490> paddle<00:01:59.820> brush<00:01:59.939> would

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
even though I think a paddle brush would

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.630 
even though I think a paddle brush would
give<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.840> natural<00:02:01.350> look<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:02.399> hair<00:02:02.610> is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
give it a more natural look the hair is

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.199 
give it a more natural look the hair is
very<00:02:02.820> soft<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:04.020> too<00:02:04.320> shiny<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:08.910> think

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
very soft it's not too shiny and I think

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.170 
very soft it's not too shiny and I think
because<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.780> length<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.910> won't<00:02:11.910> really

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
