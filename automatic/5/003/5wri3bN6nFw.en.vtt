great<00:00:02.639> natural<00:00:03.000> harmonic<00:00:03.689> lick<00:00:03.959> indy<00:00:04.500> i'll<00:00:05.370> be

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
great natural harmonic lick indy i'll be

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.950 
great natural harmonic lick indy i'll be
playing<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:05.910> on<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> Telecaster<00:00:06.720> because<00:00:06.870> I'm

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
playing it on a Telecaster because I'm

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.419 
playing it on a Telecaster because I'm
dropping<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.379> sixth<00:00:07.649> string<00:00:07.799> down<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.130> D<00:00:08.280> to

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
dropping the sixth string down to D to

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.490 
dropping the sixth string down to D to
accommodate<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.090> lick<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:10.230> could<00:00:10.380> use

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
accommodate this lick and you could use

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.080 
accommodate this lick and you could use
any<00:00:10.530> hardtail<00:00:11.130> guitar<00:00:11.460> just<00:00:11.610> happen<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.910> grab

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
any hardtail guitar just happen to grab

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.940 
any hardtail guitar just happen to grab
this<00:00:12.269> one<00:00:12.480> I'll<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.200> playing<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> bridge

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this one I'll be playing on the bridge

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.680 
this one I'll be playing on the bridge
pickup<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> little<00:00:15.150> bit<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.360> distortion

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
pickup with a little bit of distortion

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.779 
pickup with a little bit of distortion
just<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> get<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> grind<00:00:16.800> sound<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.520> you

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
just to get a grind sound to this you

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.189 
just to get a grind sound to this you
could<00:00:17.910> play<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.180> absolutely<00:00:18.660> clean<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.109> would

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
could play it absolutely clean it would

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.429 
could play it absolutely clean it would
be<00:00:19.289> beautiful<00:00:20.300> okay<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.359> here's<00:00:21.990> how<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> lick

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
be beautiful okay so here's how the lick

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.870 
be beautiful okay so here's how the lick
goes<00:00:22.680> you're<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> be<00:00:23.130> playing<00:00:23.400> directly

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
goes you're going to be playing directly

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.070 
goes you're going to be playing directly
above<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.330> frets<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.750> you're<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:24.960> familiar

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
above the frets if you're not familiar

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.689 
above the frets if you're not familiar
with<00:00:25.289> natural<00:00:25.680> harmonics<00:00:26.220> that's<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.640> you

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
with natural harmonics that's how you

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.700 
with natural harmonics that's how you
have<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> play<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.449> most<00:00:27.660> part<00:00:27.960> you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
have to play them for the most part you

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.170 
have to play them for the most part you
start<00:00:29.070> off<00:00:29.250> well<00:00:29.609> let<00:00:29.730> me<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.000> demonstrate

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.540 

and<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.320> big<00:00:37.470> challenge<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and the big challenge on this is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.310 
and the big challenge on this is
probably<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> keep<00:00:39.330> everything<00:00:39.690> ringing

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
probably just to keep everything ringing

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.680 
probably just to keep everything ringing
because<00:00:40.650> you<00:00:40.860> can't<00:00:41.100> play<00:00:41.310> flat<00:00:41.640> fingered<00:00:42.090> but

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
because you can't play flat fingered but

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.120 
because you can't play flat fingered but
you<00:00:42.810> still<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.320> very<00:00:43.650> very<00:00:43.890> careful

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
you still have to be very very careful

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.650 
you still have to be very very careful
astrak--<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.850> tightrope<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.540> need

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
astrak-- in a tightrope because you need

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.780 
astrak-- in a tightrope because you need
a<00:00:45.690> lot<00:00:45.810> of<00:00:45.840> open<00:00:46.200> string<00:00:46.470> noise<00:00:46.650> your<00:00:47.520> first

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
a lot of open string noise your first

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.310 
a lot of open string noise your first
harmonic<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:49.140> f-sharp<00:00:50.810> notice<00:00:51.810> that<00:00:51.930> where

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
harmonic that f-sharp notice that where

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.830 
harmonic that f-sharp notice that where
I<00:00:52.350> pick<00:00:52.739> along<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> length<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.520> string

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
I pick along the length of string

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.869 
I pick along the length of string
affects<00:00:54.840> how<00:00:55.080> much<00:00:55.470> that<00:00:56.010> harmonic<00:00:56.460> comes<00:00:56.670> out

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
affects how much that harmonic comes out

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.950 
affects how much that harmonic comes out
so<00:00:57.090> you've<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.450> find<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.900> right

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so you've got to find just the right

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.650 
so you've got to find just the right
spot<00:00:58.430> now<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> problem<00:00:59.850> with<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> Telecaster

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
spot now the problem with the Telecaster

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.960 
spot now the problem with the Telecaster
is<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:01.470> above<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> pickup<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.670> I

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
is that it's right above the pickup so I

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.670 
is that it's right above the pickup so I
have<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.570> careful<00:01:03.930> I'm<00:01:03.989> gonna<00:01:04.080> tap<00:01:04.410> on<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
have to be careful I'm gonna tap on the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380 
have to be careful I'm gonna tap on the
pickup<00:01:04.890> humbuckers<00:01:05.880> wouldn't<00:01:06.119> give<00:01:06.210> us<00:01:06.300> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
pickup humbuckers wouldn't give us that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.430 
pickup humbuckers wouldn't give us that
problem<00:01:06.690> because<00:01:06.780> it'd<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:06.930> positioned

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
problem because it'd be positioned

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.410 
problem because it'd be positioned
differently<00:01:10.790> now<00:01:11.790> you're<00:01:11.940> hearing<00:01:12.240> some

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
differently now you're hearing some

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.540 
differently now you're hearing some
weird<00:01:12.450> overtones<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.649> those<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.040> natural

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
weird overtones well those are natural

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.760 
weird overtones well those are natural
harmonics<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.990> proper<00:01:16.740> tune<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
harmonics are not in proper tune so a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
harmonics are not in proper tune so a
finger<00:01:20.100> first<00:01:20.520> finger<00:01:20.790> first<00:01:21.509> finger<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
finger first finger first finger the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.010 
finger first finger first finger the
third<00:01:22.649> thing

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.889 

rhythmically<00:01:26.829> one<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.640> two<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.149> three<00:01:28.210> and

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
rhythmically one and two and three and

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.830 
rhythmically one and two and three and
four<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:30.189> you<00:01:30.310> go<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.609> start<00:01:30.820> again<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
four and you go and start again the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.630 
four and you go and start again the
trickiest<00:01:35.289> harmonic<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:35.950> capture<00:01:36.399> would<00:01:36.490> be

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
trickiest harmonic the capture would be

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.440 
trickiest harmonic the capture would be
the<00:01:36.880> last<00:01:37.719> f-sharp<00:01:38.259> harmonic<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:40.179> notice

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
the last f-sharp harmonic and you notice

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.669 
the last f-sharp harmonic and you notice
how<00:01:40.569> it's<00:01:40.719> really<00:01:40.869> out<00:01:41.079> of<00:01:41.109> tune<00:01:41.319> I<00:01:41.500> just

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
how it's really out of tune I just

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:42.660 
how it's really out of tune I just
mentioned<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.039> you<00:01:42.159> that<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.340> overtone

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
mentioned to you that the overtone

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.109 
mentioned to you that the overtone
series<00:01:42.909> on<00:01:43.539> a<00:01:43.569> vibrating<00:01:44.049> string

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
series on a vibrating string

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.980 
series on a vibrating string
mathematically<00:01:46.119> is<00:01:46.209> correct<00:01:46.569> but<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.959> our

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
mathematically is correct but to our

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.230 
mathematically is correct but to our
ears<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:48.429> sound<00:01:48.819> right

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.450 

a<00:01:52.680> little<00:01:53.680> been<00:01:53.799> behind<00:01:53.979> enough<00:01:54.220> if<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.340> want

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
a little been behind enough if you want

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.160 
a little been behind enough if you want
to<00:01:54.549> get<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.729> tune<00:01:54.939> but<00:01:55.479> that's<00:01:55.659> how<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.840> lick

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
to get in tune but that's how that lick

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.380 
to get in tune but that's how that lick
sounds<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:57.220> encourage<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.759> take<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
sounds and I encourage you to take the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.359 
sounds and I encourage you to take the
natural<00:01:58.840> harmonics<00:01:59.500> that<00:01:59.619> occur<00:01:59.829> at<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.979> 12th

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
natural harmonics that occur at the 12th

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.279 
natural harmonics that occur at the 12th
5th<00:02:01.119> 7th<00:02:01.899> 4th<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.979> then<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> varying<00:02:03.670> degree

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
5th 7th 4th and then to a varying degree

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.539 
5th 7th 4th and then to a varying degree
you<00:02:05.289> have<00:02:05.439> all<00:02:05.649> these<00:02:05.860> down<00:02:06.070> in<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.340> lower

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
you have all these down in the lower

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.210 
you have all these down in the lower
frets<00:02:07.110> bass<00:02:08.110> players<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.590> access<00:02:09.009> those<00:02:09.160> a

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
frets bass players can access those a

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.320 
frets bass players can access those a
little<00:02:09.340> more<00:02:09.489> readily<00:02:09.849> because<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.239> their

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
little more readily because of their

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.699 
little more readily because of their
long<00:02:10.539> scale<00:02:10.929> it's<00:02:11.170> easier<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.440> get<00:02:11.530> them<00:02:11.650> to

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
long scale it's easier to get them to

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.830 
long scale it's easier to get them to
come<00:02:11.890> out<00:02:12.069> but<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:12.760> can<00:02:12.910> utilize<00:02:13.269> those<00:02:13.450> again

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
come out but we can utilize those again

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.530 
come out but we can utilize those again
the<00:02:13.989> only<00:02:14.140> issue<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.580> intonation<00:02:15.580> but<00:02:15.940> for<00:02:16.510> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the only issue is intonation but for a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.420 
the only issue is intonation but for a
great<00:02:16.810> effecting<00:02:17.319> with<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.500> Wang<00:02:17.739> bar<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.250> hear

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430
