much about Stetson and that sort of

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.300 
much about Stetson and that sort of
stuff<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.560> know<00:03:42.680> they<00:03:42.859> were<00:03:42.950> played<00:03:43.160> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
time so you know it's never really

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.210

bothered<00:04:37.020> me<00:04:37.199> I<00:04:37.320> like<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.770> said<00:04:37.949> apart<00:04:38.130> it's

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
bothered me I like I said apart it's

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.650 
bothered me I like I said apart it's
probably<00:04:38.460> suited<00:04:38.699> in<00:04:38.759> yeah<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.419> like

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660

getting<00:04:39.900> on<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.199> you<00:04:40.440> know<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.949> playing<00:04:41.460> the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
getting on in you know and playing the

getting on in you know and playing the
game<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.060> not<00:04:42.479> worrying<00:04:42.810> too<00:04:42.900> much<00:04:43.020> about<00:04:43.139> any

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
game and not worrying too much about any

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.409 
game and not worrying too much about any
other<00:04:43.710> things<00:04:44.009> it's<00:04:44.820> probably<00:04:44.940> freed<00:04:45.240> up<00:04:45.360> a

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
other things it's probably freed up a

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.089 
other things it's probably freed up a
little<00:04:45.539> bit<00:04:45.660> more<00:04:45.810> time<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.080> you<00:04:46.979> know

media<00:04:49.020> little<00:04:49.229> bit<00:04:49.320> mortar<00:04:49.650> takes<00:04:49.889> up<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.070> lot

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190
