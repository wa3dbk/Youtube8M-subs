00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.800
 We imagine such a beautiful unboxing 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.559
 you like a sega mega drive 2 retro gamers 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.500
 from the 90s remembers this very well 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.340
 the device is the dream of all the boys a gift 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.320
 also the star of the TV program to a single 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.289
 reality led by sergey suponev 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.529
 today we they talk the thing is that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.650
 this prefix 2014 release 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.760
 how come sega actually 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.690
 back in the late 90s, if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.960
 in 1997, she stopped supporting mega 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.850
 drive 2 and switched to your new one 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.230
 the project and already there was sega saturn 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 then sega dreamcast 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.480
 but at the same time sega continues to give and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.710
 sell licenses to third parties 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 who release these consoles 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.719
 accordingly the prefix can be said 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.409
 licensed because released by 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.500
 license is logical here is this model 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.100
 released by the Chinese manufacturer don 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.189
 muang 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.080
 electronics i really think not 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.390
 it is worth being embarrassed that companies 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.430
 Chinese do not know how the river was planned 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.110
 as violently as Chinese and therefore 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.729
 The prefix is ​​quite a quality 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.850
 let's finally open let's see what 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.210
 inside here we see first hand himself 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210
 block 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.300
 it is with us 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.080
 instruction manual warranty 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.960
 coupon which is also here for one year 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.770
 if mishina two joysticks advertising 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.850
 wire booklet which audio video 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:02.700
 ordinary with me and the power supply that is 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:06.180
 respectively, exactly the same set as 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.000
 and the 90s for the only one 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.850
 the difference is that when you went 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.820
 original mega drive 2 days in 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.860
 kit went kadrish sonic super hedgehog 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.680
 now it's not here but replaced it 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.100
 all business to other bonuses 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.200
 the fact is that the manufacturer has built in 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.810
 this beautiful prefix as you see 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.390
 on and no different from the one that was 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.150
 in the nineties that is essentially 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.150
 it is only released again 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.980
 manufacturer sewed here 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.430
 in memory already seventy five games 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.540
 i.e. she first works cartridges 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.470
 as usual as usual prefix but with 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.110
 this if you turn it on without a cartridge 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.150
 the menu will offer seventy five games on 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.070
 choice a bit later we prefix last 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.150
 see for yourself 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:10.110
 while I can only say that 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.799
 and the joysticks and power supply are all saved 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.319
 in the original design is full 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.430
 mega drive which can be great 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:24.409
 firstly a gift to retro gamers the same 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.659
 most he will give a lot of hours of fun 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.700
 those who spend their leisure time in the country, for example 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.170
 or just hang out with guys 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.939
 companies on the spire 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.129
 good old road rage or mortal 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:40.440
 kombat here well, and finally in the third it 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.200
 a good gift such a visual aid 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.340
 for the younger generation because 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.299
 no secret that many believe that the best 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.989
 games are already created because the graphics 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.510
 then was weak and accordingly 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.280
 developers put on gameplay on 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.620
 replayability so good 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.849
 introduce representatives of the younger 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:10.849
 generations with the prefix from the golden age 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:15.000
 Namely Sergey corner Well for now 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:17.669
 I propose to finish the theory and go 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.449
 already directly to practice disable 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.449
 this set-top box
