00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hi last time I chatted with 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.719
 friends and I have them I did not 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 not a little bit of this health scandal of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 health all that good after little my friends they 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.380
 are more very Cartesian at wanting 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640
 proofs and that's fine and good everything 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.670
 that to say that I was talking to them about 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.619
 the irradiation of in supermarkets 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 because I had heard for example 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.390
 llp the free thinker 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.790
 what a super activist who does not hesitate to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.760
 point out the problems and therefore 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.950
 I had heard 3pl mp and others 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 people who said yeah ok buy 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.610
 bio is better than not throw better but 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 he advised not to buy in the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.700
 supermarkets because all foods 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.230
 would be irradiated do it should 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 prefer to buy them in a small 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.059
 duo shop no big distribution 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.129
 so I discussed this and my friends and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.840
 good more than skeptical after 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.309
 they know and where all the spirits of a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 urban legend 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.769
 all the people who have blogs 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.049
 informative about health nutrition I 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.520
 think their goal is not 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.630
 to discredit with false information 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.549
 so I think we all have to gain 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.740
 whether it is the public and those who 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.689
 are fighting to check the info because 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.020
 that in addition to all his friends janet a 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.210
 posing in apples 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.390
 so in a company that manufactures 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.330
 organic quality apples and another 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.509
 friend who worked in setting 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.810
 supermarket shelf of these same apple 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.630
 so that's what they told me 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.450
 good listening dream why not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.770
 theories but then we can certify you 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.780
 that our apples are organic they are 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.450
 show had put him in crates and 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.100
 then my buddy take them out the crates 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.520
 it is mutated on the shelf at disposal 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.310
 client 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.280
 so there was no process of 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.409
 say goodbye to sion in the supermarket 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.929
 ok I'm saying go check it out so 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.939
 this is already the truth if we ever 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.100
 bed we hear it I think we can say 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.610
 that it's exaggerated to see you even as his 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.799
 fake tits 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.679
 all products in supermarket are only 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.030
 not irradiated 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.410
 after maybe some strengths of the coup 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.209
 we're going a little bit to see what it's like 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.540
 irradiation story so dropped on 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.360
 wikipedia food irradiation so 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.519
 actually it's about exposing the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.220
 foods to ionizing radiation 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.660
 to reduce microorganisms good in 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.510
 does it serve that are better 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.519
 keep it that keeps this process has 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.430
 been licensed by the food and drug 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.680
 administration and the department of 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.510
 United States agriculture is 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.110
 accepted by the WHO for food 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.890
 human 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.260
 after scientific research 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.209
 intensive good for me it's not 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.829
 proof of anything because 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.810
 it's the same time they do 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.840
 to eat shit or who are inhabited 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.230
 for 30 years in asbestos or who 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.030
 what about the medoc who is killing you for me? 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.920
 it's not say it's sources 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.940
 official that's what we can say 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.989
 here was that there is a 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.420
 difference is that sterilization 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.160
 machintruc good here's the goal is that it 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.720
 can be kept better and where then why 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.549
 some people shows us this from 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.489
 finger because I'm going to go to 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.370
 advantages and disadvantages and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.670
 advantages is that it is quickly the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.200
 mold it keeps longer 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.200
 neutralization of the germinal power of 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.900
 tubercles so here is the point of view 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.940
 mercantile consumers are 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.359
 content I even think that this 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.930
 kind of drift can take place because 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.370
 consumer expectations reflected 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.590
 I bought this fruit three days later 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.030
 it was rotten thing here in the times 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.709
 if the consumer also with his 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.109
 demands that pushes the system to go 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.900
 to things not necessarily tic top 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.320
 for health then disadvantages but 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.940
 in fact at higher doses of 6 kg 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.280
 will 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.890
 the irradiation slightly degraded since 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.600
 minh as well as other nutrients 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.490
 thus decreasing the nutritional qualities 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.830
 of the product we can have 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.120
 it can have a negative impact on the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.580
 taste the smell feels does not care a bit 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.810
 in France the wedding party of 10 kg gray is 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.840
 authorized for treatments the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.010
 rice flour cereals spices have 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.660
 already that is to say that in France we 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.150
 authorizes annick and vitamins 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.400
 grain of rice and tassel dose of 5 kg 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.090
 We have not been exceeded for the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.790
 meat and fish 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.650
 so that 's just all the bacteria 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.080
 yeah so also a disadvantage that's 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.540
 that the organisms irradiated at these doses 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.550
 can no longer managed but what prevents 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.440
 their cultivation by the consumer 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.680
 obviously it suits those who have to 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.450
 sell products we can 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.090
 replant after can not return to 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.340
 the shiny kid merchants so that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.820
 that's why uc has been transformed into 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.620
 hulk good x-ray machin the union 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.330
 European ionization treatment 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.980
 foodstuffs is subject to 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.300
 special regulations 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.550
 currently five countries of the union 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.830
 European Union to authorize irradiation 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.600
 food belgium france country 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.669
 low italy and united kingdom 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.070
 the other countries of the european union 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.590
 no irradiated food 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.000
 and why then some countries of 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.800
 the European Union allows 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.960
 radiation for other products 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.650
 that those who are treated 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.060
 by France 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.310
 so the united kingdom practice 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.770
 irradiation speak for vegetables 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.560
 fruits cereals and fish 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.540
 will prefer to see the radiation threshold 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.820
 but maybe that's why at the 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.560
 junk food in fact often I would have him 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.660
 do not necessarily have to supplement 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.270
 vitamins or other enough to eat 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.060
 balanced all that we see the contributions 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.580
 ok we have to check if we do not have to 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.620
 mix nutrients and inputs with 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.090
 the interior so the united kingdom 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.210
 practice irradiation for 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.130
 vegetables fruits cereals and fish 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.410
 these products can then flow 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.090
 freely in the European Union or 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.250
 well be incorporated into dishes 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.770
 cooked or in other products 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.160
 agri - foodstuffs of countries not allowing 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.720
 not irradiation of these elements so there 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.900
 I think we can say that it is a 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.970
 making fun of 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.490
 the more it means that you can 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.460
 find with vegetables in France 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.160
 in a dish prepared irradiated vegetables 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.759
 because they walked in the union 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.699
 European 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.210
 a fucking mouth a little more one in 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.340
 la France 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.530
 the following foods may be 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.520
 subjected to ionization treatment 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.520
 well here you go see them a trick 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.520
 so that's a really good question 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.610
 she was for example those who in 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.080
 speak it's true you have to be called 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.930
 also to inquire at this level 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.789
 then just do not say that in 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.750
 the whole supermarket everything is irradiated 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.460
 because I say it but how they 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.590
 s are passed in the hangar before 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.080
 put in shelves what a kind of 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.430
 machine for all irradiated no it's 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.430
 not go into the supermarket so in 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.380
 fact it is the ski is pointed 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.240
 it's the distribution system 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.210
 because I have proof for example that 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.020
 my friend's apples they are organic and 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.960
 they arrive 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.539
 without being irradiated in the face of 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.150
 consumers so not everything is not 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:16.539
 irradiated in supermarkets but yes 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:20.800
 it's a real question we're going to say 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:22.810
 bad food makes it a site and the little 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.919
 precision because we will be precise 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.919
 go ciao
