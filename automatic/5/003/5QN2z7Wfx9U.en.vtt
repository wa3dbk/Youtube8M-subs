00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
see them again in about a year or so yes

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.870 
see them again in about a year or so yes
they<00:02:26.709> have<00:02:26.829> to<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:27.040> maintained<00:02:27.459> through<00:02:27.730> that

and then we'll have to go over them

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.830 
and then we'll have to go over them
again

year in the water the socks were a
little<00:02:58.810> heavier<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.640> what<00:03:00.819> do<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:00.970> see<00:03:01.120> here

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
little heavier so what do you see here

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.820 
little heavier so what do you see here
we've<00:03:01.480> got<00:03:01.600> some<00:03:01.780> barnacles<00:03:02.140> we've<00:03:02.530> got<00:03:02.680> some

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
we've got some barnacles we've got some

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.309 
we've got some barnacles we've got some
starfish<00:03:03.400> but<00:03:04.090> we've<00:03:04.209> also<00:03:04.390> got<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> whole<00:03:05.020> lot

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
starfish but we've also got a whole lot

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.070 
starfish but we've also got a whole lot
of<00:03:05.350> very<00:03:05.709> healthy-looking<00:03:06.160> mussels<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:08.020> I

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
of very healthy-looking mussels and I

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.890 
of very healthy-looking mussels and I
look<00:03:08.290> at<00:03:08.410> them<00:03:08.560> for<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.800> nice<00:03:08.980> smooth<00:03:09.280> shell

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
look at them for the nice smooth shell

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.479 
look at them for the nice smooth shell
and<00:03:10.900> see<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.110> check<00:03:11.440> mark<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.920> shell<00:03:12.220> it

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
and see a check mark in the shell it

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.979 
and see a check mark in the shell it
would<00:03:12.730> be<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.030> size<00:03:13.570> when<00:03:13.840> they<00:03:13.930> were

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
would be the size when they were

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.130 
would be the size when they were
initially<00:03:14.350> deployed<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:16.300> that<00:03:16.510> line<00:03:16.840> right

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
initially deployed so that line right

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.729 
initially deployed so that line right
there

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
there

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.800 
there
it's<00:03:18.190> like<00:03:18.400> growth<00:03:18.700> rings<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.239> tree<00:03:19.330> when

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
it's like growth rings on a tree when

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.259 
it's like growth rings on a tree when
every<00:03:20.380> time<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.709> disturb<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.790> gets<00:03:22.060> a

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
every time you disturb it it it gets a

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.110 
every time you disturb it it it gets a
little<00:03:23.080> indentation<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.040> shell<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:24.910> when

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
little indentation in the shell so when

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.670 
little indentation in the shell so when
they<00:03:25.239> came<00:03:25.450> out<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.870> water<00:03:26.110> at<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.350> seed

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
they came out of the water at the seed

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.640 
they came out of the water at the seed
stage<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.730> set<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.209> line<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:29.230> then<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:29.470> put

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
stage and set that line and then we put

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.430 
stage and set that line and then we put
it<00:03:29.739> back<00:03:29.890> in<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.310> continue<00:03:30.640> growing<00:03:31.030> yeah<00:03:31.930> so

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
it back in to continue growing yeah so

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.979 
it back in to continue growing yeah so
this<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.700> that's<00:03:33.910> one<00:03:34.150> year's<00:03:34.420> growth<00:03:34.480> right

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
this so that's one year's growth right

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:46.140 
this so that's one year's growth right
there<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:45.130> know<00:03:45.220> one<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.579> things<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.910> find

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
there you know one of the things I find

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.449 
there you know one of the things I find
fascinating<00:03:46.390> about<00:03:46.930> mussels<00:03:47.530> is<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.920> we're

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
fascinating about mussels is that we're

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.759 
fascinating about mussels is that we're
able<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:48.790> take<00:03:49.060> them<00:03:49.269> out<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.600> water<00:03:49.780> and

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
able to take them out of the water and

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.310 
able to take them out of the water and
they<00:03:50.950> still<00:03:51.190> stay<00:03:51.370> fresh

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
they still stay fresh

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.289 
they still stay fresh
that's<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.500> mussels<00:03:54.310> natural<00:03:54.700> ability<00:03:55.150> they

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
that's the mussels natural ability they

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.530 
that's the mussels natural ability they
have<00:03:55.329> a<00:03:55.510> tightly<00:03:56.230> closing<00:03:56.680> shell<00:03:56.950> that

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
have a tightly closing shell that

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.819 
have a tightly closing shell that
retains<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.750> moisture<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.260> liquid<00:03:59.560> within

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
retains the moisture and liquid within

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.979 
retains the moisture and liquid within
the<00:03:59.950> shell<00:04:00.160> they'll<00:04:00.430> stay<00:04:00.670> alive<00:04:01.510> out<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
the shell they'll stay alive out of the

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.170 
the shell they'll stay alive out of the
water<00:04:02.200> for<00:04:02.500> two<00:04:03.010> weeks<00:04:03.250> without<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.670> problem

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
water for two weeks without a problem

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.509 
water for two weeks without a problem
which<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.959> great<00:04:05.200> for<00:04:05.530> us<00:04:05.560> as<00:04:05.890> consumers<00:04:06.280> I

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
which is great for us as consumers I

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.130 
which is great for us as consumers I
mean<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.030> allows<00:04:07.269> you<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.540> get<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.840> ashore

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
mean that allows you to get it ashore

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.960 
mean that allows you to get it ashore

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.370 

now<00:04:23.640> when<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.970> hung<00:04:24.300> these<00:04:24.540> socks<00:04:24.990> the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
now when you hung these socks the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.080 
now when you hung these socks the
muscles<00:04:25.770> were<00:04:25.890> on<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.160> inside<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.880> sock

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
muscles were on the inside of the sock

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.760 
muscles were on the inside of the sock
but<00:04:27.390> now<00:04:27.540> they're<00:04:27.720> on<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.900> outside<00:04:28.410> how<00:04:28.650> does

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
but now they're on the outside how does

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.390 
but now they're on the outside how does
that<00:04:28.920> happen

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
that happen

with Bissell thread and pull themselves

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.530 
with Bissell thread and pull themselves
out<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.040> they've<00:04:41.220> they've<00:04:41.790> all<00:04:41.940> moved<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.420> the
