I<00:00:22.420> mean<00:00:23.320> it<00:00:23.500> suspends<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:25.060> major<00:00:25.270> part<00:00:25.540> on

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
I mean it suspends the major part on

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.650 
I mean it suspends the major part on
itself<00:00:26.020> and<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.970> surface<00:00:27.970> of<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.150> water

itself and the surface of the water

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.630 
itself and the surface of the water
I<00:00:28.689> mean<00:00:29.650> it<00:00:29.770> actually<00:00:29.830> would<00:00:30.220> be<00:00:30.250> certainly

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
I mean it actually would be certainly

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.930 
I mean it actually would be certainly
this<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:33.840> what'll<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:34.870> be<00:00:34.960> line<00:00:35.140> here

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this and what'll it be line here

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.299 
this and what'll it be line here

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
mesh pattern what a buzzer as we see in

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.560 
mesh pattern what a buzzer as we see in
UK<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.989> next<00:00:59.290> one<00:00:59.469> I<00:00:59.500> would<00:00:59.770> see<00:01:00.010> would<00:01:00.910> be<00:01:00.969> a

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
UK the next one I would see would be a

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.740 
UK the next one I would see would be a
sugar<00:01:02.440> lump<00:01:02.620> buzzer<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.089> yellow<00:01:04.449> version

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
sugar lump buzzer this is yellow version
