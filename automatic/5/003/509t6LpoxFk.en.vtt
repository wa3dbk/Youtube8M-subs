alright<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.140> run<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.860> 64-bit<00:01:11.610> mode<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
alright so run this in 64-bit mode and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.310 
alright so run this in 64-bit mode and
run<00:01:13.770> benchmarks<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:17.630> geekbench<00:01:18.630> provides<00:01:19.110> an

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
run benchmarks and geekbench provides an

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.120 
run benchmarks and geekbench provides an
overall<00:01:20.090> benchmark<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:21.509> system<00:01:22.130> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
overall benchmark for your system so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
overall benchmark for your system so
it's<00:01:23.340> fish<00:01:23.549> running<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> we've<00:01:24.360> got<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> geek

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
it's fish running and we've got a geek

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.830 
it's fish running and we've got a geek
adventure<00:01:25.049> school<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.790> 6080<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:27.090> that's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
adventure school of 6080 for that's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.590 
adventure school of 6080 for that's
pretty<00:01:28.290> good<00:01:28.759> my<00:01:29.759> mac<00:01:29.939> pro<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:30.479> around

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
pretty good my mac pro is right around

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.749 
pretty good my mac pro is right around
12,000<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.860> compares<00:01:32.250> pretty<00:01:32.490> good<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
12,000 so it compares pretty good to

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.660 
12,000 so it compares pretty good to
that<00:01:32.939> as<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> processor

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that as you can see it's got a processor

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
that as you can see it's got a processor

thousand three hundred and sixty six so

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.450 
thousand three hundred and sixty six so
six<00:01:53.430> thousand<00:01:54.000> 84<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> pretty<00:01:56.009> good<00:01:56.189> score

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
six thousand 84 is a pretty good score

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.289 
six thousand 84 is a pretty good score
for<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.649> 11<00:01:58.649> inch<00:01:58.770> notebook<00:01:59.670> so
