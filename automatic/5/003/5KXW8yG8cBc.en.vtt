00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
you can just hear them and they look for

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.259 
you can just hear them and they look for
a<00:02:45.840> real<00:02:46.019> quick<00:02:48.799> lifeguard<00:02:51.019> click<00:02:52.019> on<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.349> and

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
a real quick lifeguard click on it and

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.550 
a real quick lifeguard click on it and
if<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.599> your<00:02:54.660> first<00:02:54.930> time<00:02:55.049> doing<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.379> I

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
if this is your first time doing it I

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.770 
if this is your first time doing it I
I'm<00:02:56.190> guessing<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.730> sure<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.239> only<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
I'm guessing this sure to have only the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.710 
I'm guessing this sure to have only the
getting<00:02:58.049> started<00:02:58.200> one<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.459> if<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.209> click<00:03:00.480> it

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
getting started one and if you click it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.099 
getting started one and if you click it
sometimes<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.500> will<00:03:01.590> go<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:03.540> computer

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
sometimes it will go on my computer

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.160 
sometimes it will go on my computer
always<00:03:04.680> up<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.430> doesn't<00:03:05.989> open<00:03:06.989> it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
always up and it doesn't open it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.650 
always up and it doesn't open it
