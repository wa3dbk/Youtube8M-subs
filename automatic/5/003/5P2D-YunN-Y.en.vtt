00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.460

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.260

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.910
 I did not want to cry and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.410
 we do not want to inflict ourselves weeping when we 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.640
 of the massacre what I did not realize everything 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.019
 simply but today I realize 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.000
 a little bit more so it's true that 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.070
 the emotion is linked and 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.840
 that's all that's offered to me it's 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.430
 beautiful and that's why I am 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.989
 born to thank I did not even thank 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.409
 all the people who support me 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.899

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.359

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.499
 remembered mainly the 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.439
 miss france company that did a lot 

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:16.149
 to know that this is a daydream 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.649
 for all the girls so the 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.439
 preparation it was so so 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.429
 beautiful so intense but beautiful to 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.189

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:27.759

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.750

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.459
 programs are on the program these 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.299

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.709
 I'm going to rest so I can start 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.450
 the 2014 year in shape so I'm 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:43.539
 still maybe enjoy being at home 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.420
 me for a little bit but camille at the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.099
 bar after a day you start 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.390
 now realized the year that awaits you 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.570
 for this year 2014 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.370
 I started but it is true that it is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.600
 it's difficult it's difficult to 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.580
 realize we are miss france because 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 it's something that happens from the day 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.640
 in the aftermath of a second to another 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.340
 so it's true that it's really very 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.110
 difficult now yes I realize 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 necessarily seeing all these people 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.920
 who come but to meet me 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.690
 today these people who me 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.760
 support it's true we start to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.380
 realize the charges is there for after 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.660
 such a bag to what we already imagine the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.640
 end saying it's going to last a year 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.440
 necessarily if it means that a year and 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.940
 all the old miss want 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.740
 start again so to really 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.750
 take full advantage because we will have to 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.340
 regret not be afraid for not need not 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.930
 stop at what I mean 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.180
 some people some smearers 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.370
 so really enjoy because it's 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.510
 what I intend to do so 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.920
 and finally to finish a last word 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.810
 to all the messages you receive on 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.100
 facebook precisely in response to 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.290
 racist attacks were victims 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.580
 now we see you all chipboard 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.750

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.680
 enjoy what you see them you see them 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.570
 besides these messages 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160
 so yes I read the messages of support 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.810
 embarrassing 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.330
 the iba the racist messages or whatever 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.860
 it is neither insults message but Thursday 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.850
 the support messages I encountered 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.340
 recently a lady who was doing a 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.840
 action and which was gaining momentum 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.700
 it's a lady who makes a picture with 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.100
 are his children who are mestizo and 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.170
 everyone each year like this and one for 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.210
 show that cosmopolitan France is 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.500
 really a beautiful France and that's it 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.570
 will have to do it because it's with the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.190
 globalization it's going to go in this 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.540
 meaning so here it is thanks a lot in 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.930
 any case all the people who me 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.730
 support 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.830
 it's really warm to my heart 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.590
 here we are I am not alone in 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.170
 this case me for my part I'm going to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.420
 take I do not listen to all these 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.190
 messages that can sometimes be very 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.540
 naughty but all that is I think about 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.960
 apart from some people it's difficult 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.370
 to live 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.350
 so we support each other 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.580
 elbows and that's it we hope everything 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.440
 simply change the minds of 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.480
 people who do not like today 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.880
 and that's with time maybe they 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.300
 will change their minds thanks to me at least 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.300
 I hope so
