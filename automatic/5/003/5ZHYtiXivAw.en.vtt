breaks<00:04:15.920> down<00:04:16.100> on<00:04:16.340> Troy<00:04:16.459> scarf<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.450> speed

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
breaks down on Troy scarf is you speed

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.550 
breaks down on Troy scarf is you speed
time<00:04:18.229> only<00:04:19.070> at<00:04:19.190> level<00:04:19.519> 50<00:04:19.940> with<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.539> 135<00:04:21.320> base

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
time only at level 50 with a 135 base

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.469 
time only at level 50 with a 135 base
speed<00:04:21.799> Pokemon<00:04:22.280> just<00:04:22.760> because<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.090> way<00:04:23.240> that

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
speed Pokemon just because the way that

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.820 
speed Pokemon just because the way that
like<00:04:23.660> there's<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.960> speed<00:04:24.229> difference<00:04:24.530> between

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
like there's a speed difference between

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.190 
like there's a speed difference between
level

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200

TM level 100 so with a choice scarf it

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.680 
TM level 100 so with a choice scarf it

brings you up to 200 5.5 speed Pokemon

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.350 
brings you up to 200 5.5 speed Pokemon
rounds<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.020> down<00:04:31.230> 205<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.430> 135<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.300> a

speedy nature so I mean you at least

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.190 
speedy nature so I mean you at least
have<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.670> speed<00:04:35.970> tie<00:04:36.150> there<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.780> got<00:04:36.930> speed

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
have a speed tie there and you got speed

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.810 
have a speed tie there and you got speed
everything<00:04:37.590> else<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.250> amazing<00:04:38.460> thing

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
everything else that the amazing thing

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.030 
everything else that the amazing thing
about<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.180> set<00:04:39.450> is<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:40.140> out<00:04:40.380> speed<00:04:40.770> and

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
about this set is that you out speed and

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.490 
about this set is that you out speed and
one-hit<00:04:41.730> ko<00:04:41.880> greninja<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:42.990> it's<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.350> really

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
one-hit ko greninja so it's a really

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.380 
one-hit ko greninja so it's a really
cool<00:04:43.740> greninja<00:04:44.100> check<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.700> potentially

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
cool greninja check and potentially

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.420 
cool greninja check and potentially
counter<00:04:45.720> if<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.050> like<00:04:46.290> get<00:04:46.650> them<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:47.010> predict

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
counter if you like get them to predict

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.830 
counter if you like get them to predict
into<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.730> bad<00:04:47.940> move<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.390> they<00:04:48.450> don't<00:04:48.660> have

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
into a bad move and they don't have

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.020 
into a bad move and they don't have
enough<00:04:49.050> damage<00:04:49.200> because<00:04:49.620> malamar<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.580> it

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
enough damage because malamar and it

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.730 
enough damage because malamar and it
also<00:04:51.180> does<00:04:51.540> have<00:04:51.570> countering<00:04:52.170> potential<00:04:52.590> like

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
also does have countering potential like

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.680 
also does have countering potential like
say<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.010> predict<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.670> dark<00:04:53.880> pulse<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.510> bring

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
say you predict the dark pulse you bring

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.330 
say you predict the dark pulse you bring
in<00:04:54.810> malamar<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.620> mean<00:04:55.740> screen<00:04:55.920> just<00:04:56.160> still

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
in malamar that mean screen just still

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.100 
in malamar that mean screen just still
stays<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.730> dart<00:04:56.940> typing<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.540> you<00:04:57.780> just<00:04:57.960> use

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
stays the dart typing and you just use

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.750 
stays the dart typing and you just use
superpower<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.680> out<00:04:58.950> speed<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.460> catch<00:04:59.640> it

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
superpower you out speed it you catch it

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.000 
superpower you out speed it you catch it
off-guard<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.270> blow<00:05:00.480> it<00:05:00.600> up<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:00.900> that's<00:05:01.560> kind

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
off-guard you blow it up and that's kind

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.380 
off-guard you blow it up and that's kind
of<00:05:02.070> how<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.220> win<00:05:02.460> with<00:05:02.610> malamar<00:05:03.030> right<00:05:03.180> there

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
of how you win with malamar right there

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.810 
of how you win with malamar right there
so<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:04.200> lot<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.770> cool<00:05:04.950> play<00:05:05.130> vacuum<00:05:05.280> potential

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
so a lot of cool play vacuum potential

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.000 
so a lot of cool play vacuum potential
just<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.390> little<00:05:06.720> takes<00:05:07.320> a<00:05:07.410> little<00:05:07.590> bit<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.890> get

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
just a little takes a little bit to get

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.070 
just a little takes a little bit to get
going<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.550> can<00:05:08.730> use<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.270> maybe<00:05:09.420> score<00:05:09.690> 1<00:05:09.900> 2

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
going you can use it to maybe score 1 2

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.640 
going you can use it to maybe score 1 2

against<00:05:23.490> frail<00:05:24.390> Pokemon<00:05:24.840> early<00:05:25.140> and<00:05:25.350> then<00:05:25.530> it

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
against frail Pokemon early and then it

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.900 
against frail Pokemon early and then it
can<00:05:25.770> ramp<00:05:25.980> up<00:05:26.100> against<00:05:26.370> some<00:05:26.550> really<00:05:26.760> strong

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
can ramp up against some really strong

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.610 
can ramp up against some really strong
Pokemon<00:05:27.360> later<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:27.840> then<00:05:28.230> we<00:05:28.350> might<00:05:28.470> as<00:05:28.530> well

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
Pokemon later and then we might as well

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.230 
Pokemon later and then we might as well
just<00:05:28.740> talk<00:05:28.950> about<00:05:29.190> double<00:05:29.550> set<00:05:29.760> that

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240
