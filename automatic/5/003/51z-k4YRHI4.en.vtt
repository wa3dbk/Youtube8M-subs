00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
me a little wiggle room but so that can

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.410

go<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.950> above<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> spark<00:01:17.670> plug<00:01:17.880> wires

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.550 

through<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> first<00:01:22.140> one

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
through there to get it the first one

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
through there to get it the first one
then<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> second<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.390> go

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
then to get it the second one you go

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.170 
then to get it the second one you go
under<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.080> distributor<00:01:25.590> cap<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
under the distributor cap with it and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.319 
under the distributor cap with it and
sort<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.659> snake<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> bolt

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
sort of snake it to the to the bolt

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.560 
sort of snake it to the to the bolt
right<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.909> pop<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.360> off

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
right there so I'm going to pop this off

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.880 
right there so I'm going to pop this off
usually<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.930> remove<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> distributor<00:01:34.560> cap

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
usually I remove the distributor cap

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.310 
usually I remove the distributor cap
also<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:36.360> myself<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> little<00:01:36.869> extra

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
also to get myself just a little extra

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.810 
also to get myself just a little extra
room<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> thing<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.189> trying<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
room to get the thing out trying not to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.630 
room to get the thing out trying not to
get<00:01:39.000> any<00:01:39.240> crud<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.540> falls<00:01:40.049> off<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.770> into

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
get any crud that falls off of this into

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.380 
get any crud that falls off of this into
the<00:01:41.759> distributor<00:01:42.270> cap<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:44.240> if<00:01:45.240> you're

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the distributor cap and if you're

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.539 
the distributor cap and if you're
careful<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.409> reuse<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.860> gasket<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> has

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
careful you can reuse the gasket it has

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
careful you can reuse the gasket it has
a<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.880> super<00:01:48.210> thick<00:01:48.420> cardboard<00:01:48.750> gasket

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
reused the gasket finally it seems to go

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.940 
reused the gasket finally it seems to go
bad<00:02:02.070> every<00:02:02.869> couple<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.960> years<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.500> rather

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
bad every couple of years and rather

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.370 
bad every couple of years and rather
than<00:02:05.189> replace<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.780> clean<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.200> off

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
than replace it that I just clean it off

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.410 
than replace it that I just clean it off
because<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.280> replaced<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.300> new

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
because I think if I replaced it the new

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.490 
because I think if I replaced it the new
one<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.629> get<00:02:09.780> dirty<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> same<00:02:10.349> thing

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
one would get dirty and the same thing

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.680 
one would get dirty and the same thing
would<00:02:10.619> happen

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
would happen

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.570 
would happen
so<00:02:13.200> we'll<00:02:13.770> take<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.070> off<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.340> we'll<00:02:14.430> take<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
so we'll take it off and we'll take a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.390 
so we'll take it off and we'll take a
look<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.530> alright<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.890> removed<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
look at it alright I have removed the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.460 
look at it alright I have removed the
EGR<00:02:17.670> valve<00:02:18.060> from<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.540> hole<00:02:18.810> remove<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
EGR valve from the hole remove the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.740 
EGR valve from the hole remove the
distributor<00:02:19.800> cap<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.460> get<00:02:20.610> at<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.120> then

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
distributor cap to get at it and then

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.620 
distributor cap to get at it and then
it's<00:02:22.050> plugged<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.590> by<00:02:22.850> one<00:02:23.850> wire<00:02:24.090> connector

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
it's plugged in by one wire connector

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.320 
it's plugged in by one wire connector
you<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.930> loosen<00:02:25.620> up<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.090> restraining<00:02:27.090> clip

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
you just loosen up the restraining clip

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.070 
you just loosen up the restraining clip
pop<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.440> loose<00:02:29.450> take<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.540> look<00:02:30.690> at<00:02:30.810> what<00:02:30.930> you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
pop it loose take a look at what you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.470 
pop it loose take a look at what you
have<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:31.800> we're<00:02:32.720> concerned<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:33.930> is

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
have now what we're concerned with is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.380 
have now what we're concerned with is
this<00:02:36.480> bottom<00:02:37.610> hole<00:02:38.610> right<00:02:38.910> there<00:02:38.970> which<00:02:39.240> is

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
this bottom hole right there which is

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.230 
this bottom hole right there which is
the<00:02:39.420> valve<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.960> thing<00:02:40.170> opens<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.650> closes

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
the valve that thing opens and closes

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.960 
the valve that thing opens and closes
the<00:02:42.240> EGR<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.950> whole<00:02:44.130> thing<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.400> an<00:02:44.520> electric

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the EGR this whole thing is an electric

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.820 
the EGR this whole thing is an electric
motor<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.270> opens<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.050> closes<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.500> valve

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
motor that opens and closes that valve

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.650 
motor that opens and closes that valve
sometimes<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.910> valve<00:02:48.120> will<00:02:48.210> get<00:02:48.360> stick<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
sometimes that valve will get stick the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.840 
sometimes that valve will get stick the
littles<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.050> get<00:02:49.170> stuck<00:02:49.410> either<00:02:49.980> wide<00:02:50.310> open<00:02:50.730> or

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
littles to get stuck either wide open or

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.780 
littles to get stuck either wide open or
a<00:02:50.910> little<00:02:51.120> bit<00:02:51.210> open<00:02:52.430> I'm<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.730> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
a little bit open I'm just going to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.100 
a little bit open I'm just going to
clean<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.150> out<00:02:54.270> as<00:02:54.510> best<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.870> can

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
clean it out as best I can

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.720 
clean it out as best I can
I'm<00:02:55.380> going<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.560> use<00:02:55.650> some<00:02:55.830> wd-40<00:02:56.370> which<00:02:56.610> is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
I'm going to use some wd-40 which is

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.150 
I'm going to use some wd-40 which is
pretty<00:02:56.880> harmless<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.020> then<00:02:58.290> stick<00:02:58.800> an<00:02:58.920> allen

too<00:03:11.400> gasket<00:03:12.740> still<00:03:13.740> looks<00:03:13.920> pretty<00:03:14.160> good<00:03:15.200> it's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
too gasket still looks pretty good it's

too gasket still looks pretty good it's
shiny<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.720> as<00:03:18.720> long<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.020> torque<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.350> down

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
shiny and as long as you torque it down

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.220 
shiny and as long as you torque it down
properly<00:03:20.240> it'll<00:03:21.240> last<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.600> long<00:03:21.750> time<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.170> you

can remove the thing and put it back on
without<00:03:24.000> having<00:03:24.300> to<00:03:24.360> buy<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> new<00:03:24.600> gasket

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
without having to buy a new gasket

without having to buy a new gasket
alright<00:03:27.750> if<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:27.930> take<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.200> look<00:03:28.320> at<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.590> valve

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
alright if we take the look at the valve

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.570 
alright if we take the look at the valve
right<00:03:29.970> here<00:03:30.650> try<00:03:31.650> opening<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.190> closing<00:03:32.490> it

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
right here try opening and closing it

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.160 
right here try opening and closing it
just<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.850> see<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> action<00:03:33.480> on<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:33.990> see

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
just to see the action on it you can see

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.770 
just to see the action on it you can see
this<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:34.830> gets<00:03:35.220> stuck<00:03:35.490> open<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:36.300> shouldn't<00:03:36.660> do

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
this one gets stuck open it shouldn't do

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.740 
this one gets stuck open it shouldn't do
that<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.910> we're<00:03:39.090> just<00:03:39.120> going<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.360> soak<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.720> with

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
that so we're just going to soak it with

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.840 
that so we're just going to soak it with
some<00:03:39.959> wd-40<00:03:40.470> spin<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.310> around<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.580> little<00:03:41.640> bit

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
some wd-40 spin it around a little bit

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.460 
some wd-40 spin it around a little bit
open<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.330> close<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.510> until<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.020> opens<00:03:43.140> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
open it and close it until it opens and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.970 
open it and close it until it opens and
closes<00:03:43.650> freely<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.880> then<00:03:45.000> put<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.270> back<00:03:45.300> in

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
closes freely and then put it back in

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.080 
closes freely and then put it back in
hopefully<00:03:46.980> that'll<00:03:47.160> fix<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.489> way<00:03:47.610> my<00:03:47.730> van<00:03:47.910> is

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
hopefully that'll fix the way my van is

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.390 
hopefully that'll fix the way my van is

that's<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.199> there<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.710> then<00:04:25.979> just<00:04:26.009> spin<00:04:26.639> it

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
that's in there and then just spin it

little<00:04:27.720> open<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.050> close<00:04:28.199> it<00:04:28.379> now<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.280> can

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
little open and close it now I can

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.159 
little open and close it now I can
really<00:04:29.940> feel<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.270> opening<00:04:30.629> closing<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:31.080> lot

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
really feel it opening closing a lot

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.350 
really feel it opening closing a lot
better<00:04:31.410> now

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
better now

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.629 
better now
still<00:04:33.360> getting<00:04:33.569> stuck<00:04:33.900> though<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:34.639> spinning

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
still getting stuck though so spinning

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.719 
still getting stuck though so spinning
it<00:04:35.729> around<00:04:35.810> opening<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:36.900> closing<00:04:37.199> it<00:04:37.319> and<00:04:37.729> do

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
it around opening and closing it and do

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.420 
it around opening and closing it and do
this<00:04:38.849> for<00:04:39.620> quite<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.650> while<00:04:40.889> sometimes<00:04:41.310> I'll

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
this for quite a while sometimes I'll

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.159 
this for quite a while sometimes I'll
even<00:04:41.460> soak<00:04:41.879> it<00:04:42.030> if<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.330> was<00:04:42.479> really<00:04:42.659> bad<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
even soak it if it was really bad in the

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.879 
even soak it if it was really bad in the
past<00:04:43.379> I<00:04:43.530> would<00:04:43.620> soak<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:44.009> overnight<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:46.800> to

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
past I would soak it overnight just to

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.999 
past I would soak it overnight just to
make<00:04:47.039> sure<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.310> breaks<00:04:47.610> everything<00:04:47.909> loose<00:04:49.009> but

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
make sure it breaks everything loose but

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.320 
make sure it breaks everything loose but
now<00:04:50.159> that's<00:04:50.490> some<00:04:50.729> good<00:04:50.849> action<00:04:51.030> right<00:04:51.300> there

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
now that's some good action right there

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.499 
now that's some good action right there
some<00:04:51.750> good<00:04:51.900> EGR<00:04:52.319> action<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.940> hopefully<00:04:54.360> we<00:04:54.479> can

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
some good EGR action so hopefully we can

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.089 
some good EGR action so hopefully we can
not<00:04:57.509> just<00:04:57.539> sneak<00:04:58.020> by<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.289> emission<00:04:58.710> steps<00:04:58.949> but

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
not just sneak by the emission steps but

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.320 
not just sneak by the emission steps but
actually<00:04:59.400> be<00:04:59.520> blowing<00:04:59.819> clean<00:05:00.030> air<00:05:00.180> for

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
actually be blowing clean air for

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.399 
actually be blowing clean air for

sold it to a private party I could get
$750<00:05:16.530> for<00:05:16.680> it<00:05:16.800> but<00:05:17.659> let's<00:05:18.659> rather<00:05:18.840> keep<00:05:19.110> it

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
$750 for it but let's rather keep it

extremely boring amount of time and I'll

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:34.990 
extremely boring amount of time and I'll
put<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:33.719> back<00:05:33.780> on<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.259> we'll<00:05:34.440> see<00:05:34.469> if<00:05:34.620> it<00:05:34.710> runs

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
put it back on and we'll see if it runs

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.249
