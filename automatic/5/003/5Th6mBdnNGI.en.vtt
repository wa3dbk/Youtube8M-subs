00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.759
 hi today i'm going to make something with you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.290
 from catering kitchen I had already promised one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.540
 some tips to give that 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.849
 catering kitchens can be used 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.330
 This makes it easier to cook faster 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.000
 Cook 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 but there are also very useful tips 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.199
 from which you are simply very tasty 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.750
 can cook with very few resources 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 today we are going to make something with meat 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.500
 meat what I use like to explain 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.330
 you don't have to use it 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 In addition, it is true that you can choose to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.529
 to eat it with bread 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.309
 potatoes rice you the best 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.140
 finds 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.450
 for us today it is potatoes and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 supple to the whole week I try 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.110
 always exchange things with you and we 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 haven't eaten much potatoes yet 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.950
 so with this i would like it 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.950
 eat potatoes so let's start 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.190
 what do you need 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.750
 meat that you like best 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.219
 what is possible with staying easy 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 so I stick to that already 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.550
 I think being marinated is really cool 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.829
 nice the stadholder like that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 tomatoes they have about 3 pieces of garlic 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.690
 fresh from a bottle or not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.590
 what you like most is that chaos 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.960
 thanks to shredder olive oil and it you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.330
 not to mention one of my most 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 favorite things that are and everywhere 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.979
 you need all of this and we'll go 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.150
 I'll start showing you 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.150
 what we are going to do with this 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.630
 we start by cutting the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 vegetables is the punch ' 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.659
 are also doing it in different ways 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.500
 I still do this on my own 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 way 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.950
 turn the tomato on the shelf 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.210
 then you have to think around 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.429
 Basically it does not really matter 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.770
 because as air from entering to each other with 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.549
 wella strong taste releases rock itself 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.549
 get used 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.180
 enemy this doesn't have to be that you go 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.290
 see it soon within the court 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.290
 doesn't really matter that much 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.549
 that is what this is the time to do 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.510
 cut garlic if you are fresh 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.510
 used garlic 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.280
 we start with a dash of olive oil 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.110
 just let us get well for a while 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.090
 in this we now pack the bacon in my 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.090
 case 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.620
 it is not a way of slapping 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.680
 bake as you would normally do before 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.190
 advice given locally or by fried 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.340
 bacon 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.690
 image or finito fried bacon yes he 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.430
 is not an issue and we are going to 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.640
 just alternate baking and out of the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.640
 get a pan 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.850
 how often would you actually not discover 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.400
 batteries 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.490
 some laying cleaned again 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.260
 the same goes it just a blow than it 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.260
 fire low and write 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:51.440
 put a little olive oil and 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.049
 online aspect advice the house what 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.060
 namely the basis 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:04.900
 does not really run another love too 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.900
 waiting for it to become something 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.140
 use the garlic 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.070
 or fried 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.780
 the fallback 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.100
 and wait 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:43.380
 we do but also in the belly 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.580
 home go with your glasses to the boarding school 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.880
 here we take off 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.949
 when sauce will form so me 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.570
 love to make but i don't and 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.940
 tomato sauce 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.830
 in this case so that's why I chose 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.960
 for 3 timeouts but never does tomatoes 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.960
 may add you as you wish 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.370
 last but not least naturally ate you 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.800
 and I am always very much about it 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:17.760
 my because I just like that gent 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.080
 own pieces based on what your dish 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.039
 we now only have to do is the 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.039
 add bacon 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.370
 do bacon the tube when you see 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.840
 I cut them into smaller pieces 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.460
 and again you understand him toys said why 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.290
 you don't have to master everything 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.640
 likes it 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.740
 what you really have to do now 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.450
 is that they then cover the dishes 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.340
 that's where i put the clock 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.500
 so that you can now put a lid on the pan 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.960
 do it so late and sort with 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.390
 sauce so that I also have very large ones 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.610
 lids eh 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.830
 use it forever my splash people 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.300
 I put it on it and then I have it 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.880
 of those 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:01.010
 oven pins and lids and those 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.640
 I put it here again and that way 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.800
 simmer it 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.840
 so it's actually ready and you can 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.360
 it's now it works 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.740
 will last between 5 and 10 minutes 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.850
 I'm going to show you later that it 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.850
 result how it is 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.880
 this is what it looks like next to one 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.680
 slightly reduced 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.690
 as you can see the tomatoes are now one 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.530
 bit broken cake also what I own it 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.750
 tastiest finds 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.910
 so just 5 minutes let super 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.340
 making laughter a little further boil 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:32.780
 that you actually have slightly thicker sauce 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.520
 gets a little darker 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.820
 I once loved a moment with this man 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.820
 to do 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:47.320
 for if you like the end result 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:47.320
 bacon bits with a wonderful scent 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.070
 and lots of meat 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.319

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.000

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.400
 with anything and everything 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.870
