00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
like it has a nice kind of doing this to

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.990 
like it has a nice kind of doing this to
it<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.050> then<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:53.040> powder<00:01:53.190> set<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:53.760> going<00:01:53.910> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it and then for powder set I'm going to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.210 
it and then for powder set I'm going to
go<00:01:54.150> in<00:01:54.390> again<00:01:54.990> with<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> infallible<00:01:55.680> powder

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220

and that is in color beige drought I

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.960 
and that is in color beige drought I
believe<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.830> probably<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> deeper

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
believe they probably have a deeper

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.030 
believe they probably have a deeper
color<00:02:03.120> commute<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.870> just<00:02:04.170> had<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.830> just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
color commute but I just had like I just

Saund<00:04:30.620> concealer<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.830> this<00:04:31.919> is<00:04:32.010> very<00:04:32.190> light<00:04:32.460> I

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
Saund concealer and this is very light I

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.430 
Saund concealer and this is very light I
do<00:04:32.760> not<00:04:33.090> cover<00:04:33.360> all<00:04:33.449> my<00:04:33.690> blemishes<00:04:33.900> but<00:04:34.380> I

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
do not cover all my blemishes but I

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.990 
do not cover all my blemishes but I
think<00:04:34.710> this<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.010> great<00:04:35.160> for<00:04:35.400> day<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.610> day<00:04:35.820> if

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
think this is great for day to day if

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.180 
think this is great for day to day if
you<00:04:36.120> do<00:04:36.300> need<00:04:36.570> more<00:04:36.720> coverage<00:04:37.229> let<00:04:37.949> me<00:04:38.070> know

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.610 
you do need more coverage let me know
and<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.669> will<00:04:38.910> try<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.539> put<00:04:39.750> together<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:40.260> newer

and I will try to put together a newer

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.740 
and I will try to put together a newer
version<00:04:40.919> of<00:04:41.310> my<00:04:41.520> powder<00:04:41.760> routine<00:04:42.180> including

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
version of my powder routine including

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.870 
version of my powder routine including
concealer<00:04:43.289> but<00:04:43.889> I'm<00:04:43.979> pretty<00:04:44.190> much<00:04:44.340> gonna<00:04:44.580> buff

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
concealer but I'm pretty much gonna buff

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.400 
concealer but I'm pretty much gonna buff
the<00:04:45.090> deeper<00:04:45.389> tone<00:04:45.539> all<00:04:45.810> over<00:04:46.020> my<00:04:46.139> face<00:04:46.380> and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
the deeper tone all over my face and

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.070 
the deeper tone all over my face and
then<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:47.010> use<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.340> golden<00:04:47.850> tone<00:04:48.090> as<00:04:48.510> a<00:04:48.570> center

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
then you use the golden tone as a center

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.740 
then you use the golden tone as a center
highlight<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:50.090> I'm<00:04:51.090> gonna<00:04:51.240> let<00:04:51.449> it<00:04:51.539> bake<00:04:51.720> for

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
highlight and I'm gonna let it bake for

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.020
