begin I'm not gonna criticize her

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.020 
begin I'm not gonna criticize her
character<00:00:32.160> because<00:00:32.460> she<00:00:32.610> seems<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
character because she seems like a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.660 
character because she seems like a
really<00:00:33.329> genuine<00:00:33.809> person<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.520> see

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
really genuine person and like I can see

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
really genuine person and like I can see
that<00:00:35.790> she<00:00:35.969> genuinely<00:00:36.180> wants<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.750> help<00:00:36.840> people

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that she genuinely wants to help people

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.280 
that she genuinely wants to help people
and<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:37.710> that's<00:00:38.070> great<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.960> fact<00:00:40.170> of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and I think that's great but the fact of

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
and I think that's great but the fact of
the<00:00:40.379> matter<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.860> don't<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.760> she's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the matter is I don't think she's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.799 
the matter is I don't think she's
qualified<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.879> giving<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> advice

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
qualified to to be giving the advice

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.200 
qualified to to be giving the advice
she's<00:00:46.170> giving<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.520> giving<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> like

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
she's giving and to be giving it like

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.410 
she's giving and to be giving it like
its<00:00:48.600> fact<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.550> her<00:00:50.820> personal

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
its fact not like it's her personal

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
its fact not like it's her personal
opinion<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.160> it's

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
opinion because that's what it is it's

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.389

it's some huge fact and I know a lot of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
it's some huge fact and I know a lot of
people<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.309> she's<00:00:59.730> not<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
people do this and like she's not the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.009 
people do this and like she's not the
first<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.449> by<00:01:00.809> all<00:01:00.989> by<00:01:01.320> any<00:01:01.530> means<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:01.980> um<00:01:02.219> I

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
videos and I was like this is a bad idea

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.900

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
this I'm not gonna do this so I mean

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.370 
this I'm not gonna do this so I mean
honestly<00:03:18.299> she<00:03:18.540> had<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> opposite<00:03:19.260> effect

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
honestly she had the opposite effect

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.440 
honestly she had the opposite effect
that<00:03:19.950> then<00:03:20.459> she<00:03:20.880> wanted<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.360> me<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:22.470> i<00:03:23.450> don't

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
should be saying the things she's saying

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.330 
should be saying the things she's saying
or<00:03:32.370> rather<00:03:33.260> people<00:03:34.260> should<00:03:34.470> not<00:03:34.620> take<00:03:35.010> her<00:03:35.220> as

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
or rather people should not take her as

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.509 
or rather people should not take her as
