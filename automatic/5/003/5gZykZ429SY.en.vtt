00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
check and new paint obviously or I

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.490 
check and new paint obviously or I
should<00:00:25.850> say<00:00:26.029> a<00:00:26.060> lack<00:00:26.390> thereof<00:00:26.960> because<00:00:27.170> this

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
should say a lack thereof because this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.790 
should say a lack thereof because this
guy<00:00:27.680> has<00:00:27.980> an<00:00:28.300> amazingly<00:00:29.300> small<00:00:30.289> amount<00:00:30.680> of

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
like it I don't know why I like this for

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.389

Ultron<00:00:36.859> even<00:00:37.129> though<00:00:37.190> it<00:00:37.280> doesn't

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
Ultron even though it doesn't

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.549 
Ultron even though it doesn't
necessarily<00:00:38.120> look<00:00:38.269> exactly<00:00:38.659> like<00:00:38.899> Ultron

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
necessarily look exactly like Ultron

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.250 
necessarily look exactly like Ultron
other<00:00:39.800> than<00:00:40.039> the<00:00:40.159> head<00:00:40.370> I<00:00:40.659> think<00:00:41.659> it's<00:00:41.929> okay

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
other than the head I think it's okay

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.430 
other than the head I think it's okay
alright<00:00:43.039> so<00:00:43.069> he<00:00:43.429> stands<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:44.109> little<00:00:45.109> over<00:00:45.289> six

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
alright so he stands a little over six

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.950 
alright so he stands a little over six
and<00:00:45.559> a<00:00:45.649> half<00:00:45.679> inches<00:00:46.159> tall<00:00:46.429> that<00:00:46.809> puts<00:00:47.809> him

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
and a half inches tall that puts him

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.229 
and a half inches tall that puts him
maybe<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.350> hair<00:00:48.649> taller<00:00:48.979> than<00:00:49.549> either<00:00:49.909> these

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
maybe a hair taller than either these

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.029 
maybe a hair taller than either these
guys<00:00:50.479> that<00:00:50.690> are<00:00:50.749> also<00:00:50.989> in<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.289> same<00:00:51.379> batch<00:00:51.829> of

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
guys that are also in the same batch of

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.669 
guys that are also in the same batch of
figures<00:00:52.749> depend<00:00:53.749> on<00:00:53.839> how<00:00:53.959> you<00:00:54.019> angle<00:00:54.559> their

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
figures depend on how you angle their

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.869 
figures depend on how you angle their
heads<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:54.979> everything<00:00:55.370> they're<00:00:55.519> all<00:00:55.639> about

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
heads and everything they're all about

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.340 
heads and everything they're all about
the<00:00:56.030> same<00:00:56.239> height<00:00:56.479> just<00:00:56.809> to<00:00:56.899> give<00:00:57.019> you<00:00:57.139> an<00:00:57.199> idea

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
the same height just to give you an idea

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.430 
the same height just to give you an idea
and<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.699> compare<00:00:59.119> him<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.299> the<00:00:59.479> monger<00:01:00.049> build<00:01:00.319> a

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
and to compare him to the monger build a

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.979 
and to compare him to the monger build a
figure<00:01:00.859> he<00:01:01.459> comes<00:01:01.729> up<00:01:01.909> to<00:01:02.119> just<00:01:02.359> without<00:01:02.629> chest

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
figure he comes up to just without chest

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.520 
figure he comes up to just without chest
level<00:01:03.489> so<00:01:04.870> everything<00:01:05.870> is<00:01:05.960> just<00:01:05.990> about<00:01:06.200> in

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
level so everything is just about in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.800 
level so everything is just about in
scale<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.190> really<00:01:07.820> like<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.120> head<00:01:08.300> sculpt<00:01:08.660> here

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
scale I really like the head sculpt here

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.810 
scale I really like the head sculpt here
for<00:01:09.020> Ultron<00:01:09.500> it's<00:01:09.800> much<00:01:10.220> better<00:01:10.430> than<00:01:10.700> the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
for Ultron it's much better than the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.270 
for Ultron it's much better than the
legendary<00:01:11.210> rider's<00:01:11.690> version<00:01:12.200> looks<00:01:12.920> pretty

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
legendary rider's version looks pretty

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.270 
legendary rider's version looks pretty
good<00:01:13.870> now<00:01:14.870> here's<00:01:15.230> where<00:01:15.410> we<00:01:15.590> have<00:01:15.620> a<00:01:15.770> problem

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
good now here's where we have a problem

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.830 
good now here's where we have a problem
the<00:01:16.520> entire<00:01:16.820> thing<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.180> molded<00:01:17.600> in<00:01:17.720> this

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
the entire thing is molded in this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.200 
the entire thing is molded in this
Marbley<00:01:18.320> silver<00:01:18.860> plastic<00:01:19.160> it's<00:01:19.610> like<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:19.820> white

Marbley silver plastic it's like a white
gold<00:01:20.510> actually<00:01:21.140> because<00:01:21.830> it's<00:01:21.980> got<00:01:22.700> a

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
gold actually because it's got a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.810 
gold actually because it's got a
whiteness<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.510> it<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.840> is<00:01:24.170> uh<00:01:24.520> not<00:01:25.520> really

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
whiteness to it that is uh not really

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.430

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
the way silver is silver is darker more

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.680

nope ain't decent sculpt work on the

Ultron<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.400> don't<00:03:11.939> know<00:03:12.000> if<00:03:12.060> that's<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.269> good

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
Ultron I don't know if that's a good

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.490 
Ultron I don't know if that's a good
thing<00:03:12.449> or<00:03:12.719> a<00:03:12.780> bad<00:03:12.870> thing

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
thing or a bad thing

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.979 
thing or a bad thing
it<00:03:13.949> will<00:03:14.189> pass<00:03:14.459> as<00:03:14.790> an<00:03:14.939> Ultron<00:03:15.239> figure<00:03:15.659> but

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
it will pass as an Ultron figure but

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.929 
it will pass as an Ultron figure but
don't<00:03:16.290> expect<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.769> be<00:03:16.799> blown<00:03:17.040> away<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.759> just

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
don't expect to be blown away it's just

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.300 
don't expect to be blown away it's just
gonna<00:03:18.299> be<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> nice<00:03:18.840> spot<00:03:19.199> filler<00:03:19.530> for<00:03:19.829> Ultron

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
gonna be a nice spot filler for Ultron

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.520 
gonna be a nice spot filler for Ultron
and<00:03:21.060> maybe<00:03:21.449> a<00:03:21.540> hint<00:03:21.750> at<00:03:22.049> what<00:03:22.229> we<00:03:22.349> can<00:03:22.470> expect

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and maybe a hint at what we can expect

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.569 
and maybe a hint at what we can expect
to<00:03:22.949> see<00:03:22.979> in<00:03:23.489> upcoming<00:03:23.879> movies<00:03:24.689> hopefully<00:03:25.579> I'm

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
to see in upcoming movies hopefully I'm

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.089 
to see in upcoming movies hopefully I'm
thinking<00:03:27.150> Ultron's<00:03:27.599> gonna<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:28.049> tied<00:03:28.409> into<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
thinking Ultron's gonna be tied into the

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.759 
thinking Ultron's gonna be tied into the
ant-man<00:03:29.340> storyline<00:03:30.030> probably<00:03:30.689> since<00:03:30.959> they're

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
ant-man storyline probably since they're

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.429 
ant-man storyline probably since they're
heavily<00:03:32.310> connected<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.060> then<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.810> will<00:03:34.139> end

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
heavily connected and then that will end

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.409 
heavily connected and then that will end
up<00:03:34.590> filtering<00:03:35.040> into<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.430> Avengers<00:03:36.150> but

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
up filtering into the Avengers but

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.330 
up filtering into the Avengers but
that's<00:03:36.659> just<00:03:36.870> my<00:03:36.989> guess<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.769> we'll<00:03:37.919> see

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
that's just my guess so we'll see

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.309 
that's just my guess so we'll see
either<00:03:38.849> way<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.180> have<00:03:39.359> an<00:03:39.599> Ultron<00:03:39.840> figure<00:03:40.169> in

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
either way you have an Ultron figure in

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.990 
either way you have an Ultron figure in
