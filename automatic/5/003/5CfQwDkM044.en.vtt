00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:09.625
 One hundred years ago ... 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:11.319
 ... after the war. 

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:13.639
 Our founders created a system ... 

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:15.999
 ... which, according to their faith, maintains peace. 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.558
 Our society has been divided into five groups. 

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.318
 We can only survive in one way, 

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:25.278
 if you all find the right place for him. 

00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:26.878
 Testing everyone ... 

00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:28.438
 ... to find out who we are ... 

00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:29.797
 ... and where we belong. 

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:31.237
 Take your farewell to your family. 

00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:33.837
 Are you nervous? 

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:35.157
 No. 

00:00:36.827 --> 00:00:38.037
 I'm scared. 

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:40.997
 Are you ready? 

00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:55.879
 Your results were not satisfactory. 

00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:56.635
 Impossible. 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.395
 It's not impossible, it's very rare. 

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:02.643
 You can control and overcome your fears. 

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:05.154
 These are called Initiated. 

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:06.834
 BASED ON A GLOBAL BESTSELLER 

00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:09.634
 It doesn't fit into any category. 

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:11.394
 They can't control it. 

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:14.733
 You can't trust anyone. 

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:17.273
 To survive, you have to hide in one of the groups. 

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:27.021
 Welcome to the Bold. 

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:30.803
 Initiates. 

00:01:31.512 --> 00:01:32.555
 We will watch ... 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.111
 ... to see who you really are. 

00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:35.672
 You made a mistake in choosing the Bold. 

00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:39.512
 They'll know about you. 

00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:42.917
 I know who you are. 

00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:47.351
 - Are you afraid of height? - Everyone is afraid of something. 

00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:49.111
 But you do not. 

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:50.831
 Fear is alert. 

00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:52.673
 This makes it dangerous. 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.632
 The initiator is a threat to the system. 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.632
 It is not safe until it is removed. 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.630
 He'll kill you. 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.430
 We have to be prepared for everything. 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.476
 The world is changing. 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.189
 You have to decide who you will be loyal to. 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.397
 I have lived all my life according to your rules. 

00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:19.270
 No longer. 

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.788
 The initiator
