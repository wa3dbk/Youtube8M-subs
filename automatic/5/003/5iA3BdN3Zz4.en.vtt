good
you<00:00:36.510> might<00:00:36.750> grind<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.290> rivet<00:00:37.649> off<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.649> make

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
you might grind that rivet off and make

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.819 
you might grind that rivet off and make
a<00:00:40.980> new<00:00:41.250> seal<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:43.129> I'm<00:00:44.129> gonna<00:00:45.230> try<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> tighten

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
a new seal here I'm gonna try to tighten

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
a new seal here I'm gonna try to tighten
these<00:00:46.950> roots<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.760> little<00:00:47.969> bit<00:00:48.180> with<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
these roots up a little bit with a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.670 
these roots up a little bit with a
hammer<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.399> punch<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.870> theory<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.410> I'll

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
hammer a punch and my theory is I'll

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.880 
hammer a punch and my theory is I'll
squeeze<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.430> bit<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.760> spread<00:00:54.120> this

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
squeeze it a little bit and spread this

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
squeeze it a little bit and spread this
gasket<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.309> sandwich<00:00:56.699> between<00:00:57.030> there<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
gasket this sandwich between there out a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.709 
gasket this sandwich between there out a
little<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.059> put<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:00.390> new<00:01:00.510> grease

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
little bit and then put some new grease

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.470 
little bit and then put some new grease
in<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:01.890> happens<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.180> got

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
in it and see what happens all right got

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.870 
in it and see what happens all right got
the<00:01:03.510> little<00:01:03.840> new<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:04.229> gasket<00:01:04.409> made<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.220> had

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the little new little gasket made I had

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.580 
the little new little gasket made I had
to<00:01:05.970> use<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> screw<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.960> never<00:01:07.200> read<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to use a screw because I never read it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.190 
to use a screw because I never read it
that<00:01:07.740> long<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.080> used<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.549> ball<00:01:11.549> peen<00:01:11.850> hammer

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
tighten up and spread that gasket out

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.890 
tighten up and spread that gasket out
now<00:01:20.939> we'll<00:01:21.119> stick<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.869> how

now we'll stick it in there and see how

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.190 
now we'll stick it in there and see how
tight<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:23.240> somewhere<00:01:24.240> amongst<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.869> mess

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
it back in uh I know me time to put it

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.710 
it back in uh I know me time to put it
in<00:02:03.370> right<00:02:03.550> now<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.700> thing<00:02:04.090> was<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> Booker<00:02:04.600> to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
in right now that thing was a Booker to

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:30.230 
in right now that thing was a Booker to
get<00:02:04.870> out

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.360 

well<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.480> don't<00:02:31.750> know<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.110> was<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> fail<00:02:32.980> but

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
well I don't know is that was a fail but

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.700 
well I don't know is that was a fail but
it<00:02:33.520> wasn't<00:02:33.850> exactly<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.360> great<00:02:34.750> success<00:02:35.350> either

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.030 

maybe<00:02:38.710> we<00:02:38.890> better<00:02:39.070> see<00:02:39.400> if<00:02:39.520> we<00:02:39.640> can<00:02:40.860> figure<00:02:41.860> out

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
maybe we better see if we can figure out

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.120 
maybe we better see if we can figure out
how<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.220> make<00:02:42.460> that<00:02:42.640> one<00:02:42.850> work<00:02:44.790> we'll<00:02:45.790> see
