00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
young man but again yes he is 19 and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.079 
young man but again yes he is 19 and
he's<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> start<00:00:58.739> playing<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.370> romance

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and so it's still going to be a learning

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
and so it's still going to be a learning
process<00:01:02.760> from<00:01:03.420> anything<00:01:03.659> you<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.379> from

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
process from anything you do from

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.280 
process from anything you do from
playing<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:05.940> high<00:01:06.090> school<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> college<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
playing from high school to college it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.780 
playing from high school to college it
had<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.440> be<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> learning<00:01:07.890> process<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
had to be a learning process which is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.270 
had to be a learning process which is
why<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.270> there's<00:01:09.479> time<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.560> together<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
why so there's time to get together and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
why so there's time to get together and
actually<00:01:11.760> everything<00:01:12.299> store<00:01:12.540> gelling<00:01:13.020> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
actually everything store gelling so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
actually everything store gelling so
it's<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> process<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.700> Kim<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.180> I

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it's going to be a process to Kim but I

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.450 
it's going to be a process to Kim but I
think<00:01:15.630> everything<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.619> he's<00:01:16.799> learned<00:01:17.130> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
think everything that he's learned and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
think everything that he's learned and
grown<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.940> around<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.200> will<00:01:19.350> prepare

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
grown up around that you will prepare

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.520 
grown up around that you will prepare
him<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.690> their<00:01:21.690> potential<00:01:22.110> move<00:01:22.320> in

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
him for that their potential move in

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.870 
him for that their potential move in
order<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.399> can<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.640> closed

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
forever he goes if he doesn't wind up
