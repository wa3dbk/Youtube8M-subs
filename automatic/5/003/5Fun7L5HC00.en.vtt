these<00:01:00.930> patients<00:01:01.380> would<00:01:01.530> come<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.820> I

these patients would come in and what I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.060 
these patients would come in and what I
always<00:01:03.090> described<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.720> a<00:01:03.840> deflated<00:01:04.559> state<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
always described is a deflated state it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.980 
always described is a deflated state it
was<00:01:05.160> almost<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:05.910> just<00:01:06.090> while<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
was almost like they just while the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.389 
was almost like they just while the
stuffing<00:01:07.410> was<00:01:07.500> knocked<00:01:07.740> out<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> them<00:01:08.220> and

stuffing was knocked out of them and

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.490 
stuffing was knocked out of them and
those<00:01:08.790> patients<00:01:09.030> from<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.170> surgical

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
those patients from a surgical

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.170 
those patients from a surgical
standpoint<00:01:10.860> were<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.399> easiest<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.880> treat

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
standpoint were the easiest to treat

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780 
standpoint were the easiest to treat
because<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.840> was<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.140> loose<00:01:13.710> skin<00:01:14.040> now

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
because it was all loose skin now

because it was all loose skin now
however<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:15.540> seeing<00:01:15.810> more<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:16.110> more

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
however we're seeing more and more

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.690

they won't lose the weight as quickly as
a<00:01:28.740> result<00:01:29.190> we're<00:01:29.369> seeing<00:01:29.399> patients<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.210> are

bypass surgery and therefore we're

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.699 
patients you know 100 pounds of weight
is<00:02:32.520> not<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.209> same<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.540> every<00:02:33.630> patient<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.260> lot

it's<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.840> know<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.050> very<00:02:37.590> much<00:02:37.829> like<00:02:38.280> when<00:02:38.700> I
