and<00:00:18.150> DNA<00:00:19.039> because<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.130> wanted<00:00:20.519> to<00:00:20.580> know<00:00:20.789> who<00:00:20.999> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
was where I came from I thought that if

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.700

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
I analyzed my DNA I could find out who I

I analyzed my DNA I could find out who I
was<00:00:29.210> who<00:00:30.210> my<00:00:30.449> parents<00:00:30.659> were<00:00:31.580> and<00:00:32.580> I<00:00:32.730> thought

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
was who my parents were and I thought

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
was who my parents were and I thought
that<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.390> knew<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.920> then<00:00:34.920> I'd<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.370> what

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that if I knew that then I'd know what
