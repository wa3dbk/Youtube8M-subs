00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:14.366
 Because of the noise it must be very close 

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:19.171
 Wanting to get out of that darkness 

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:24.772
 Terror and fright suffocate me 

00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:29.875
 Adrenaline feels tremor 

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:34.989
 Panicking a miracle waits 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.146
 Feeling that the pulse is accelerating 

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:43.664
 I knew the fear going around 

00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:47.627
 Knocking on my door without control 

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:49.484
 Despair 

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:54.072
 Labyrinths in slow motion 

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:57.938
 Screaming to see the solution 

00:00:57.938 --> 00:01:04.771
 Silent 

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.362
 Confusion makes me despair 

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:12.789
 By wanting to imagine what's outside 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.238
 That pretend to be worse 

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:18.671
 I'm measuring my breathing 

00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:21.688
 Each step that I do not give 

00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:26.786
 The time is paralyzed 

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:31.976
 And for the blood that runs in my veins 

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:36.266
 Suffering poisons me 

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:40.743
 I knew the fear going around 

00:01:40.743 --> 00:01:44.583
 Knocking on my door without control 

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:46.663
 Despair 

00:01:46.663 --> 00:01:51.044
 Labyrinths in slow motion 

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:55.001
 Screaming to see the solution 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:02:01.139
 Silent 

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:12.895
 Something changed inside me 

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:17.715
 Seeing that fear mocks the reason 

00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:26.141
 My heart beats stronger when the risk is in my mind 

00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:31.178
 Test my value 

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:53.583
 I knew the fear going around 

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:57.252
 Going out of control 

00:02:57.252 --> 00:02:59.276
 Despair 

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:03.705
 Labyrinths in slow motion 

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:07.731
 Screaming to see the solution 

00:03:07.731 --> 00:03:09.462
 Silent 

00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:11.988
 You are mocking my reason 

00:03:11.988 --> 00:03:14.649
 This damn feeling 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:24.395
 You are testing my value forever
