about four mines show up that's probably

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.720 
about four mines show up that's probably
just<00:03:32.989> because<00:03:33.110> elites<00:03:33.860> been<00:03:34.160> going<00:03:34.459> really

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
standard it takes about two hours for it

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.360

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
a PBR something and you needed to record

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.879 
a PBR something and you needed to record
video<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.289> if<00:05:15.289> you<00:05:15.320> wanted<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.710> make<00:05:15.860> a

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
video and if you wanted to make a

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.980 
video and if you wanted to make a
montage<00:05:16.160> or<00:05:16.520> something<00:05:16.910> this<00:05:17.270> would<00:05:17.479> be<00:05:17.510> a<00:05:17.630> lot

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
montage or something this would be a lot

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.960 
montage or something this would be a lot
easier<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.710> make<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:18.889> montage<00:05:19.190> if<00:05:19.669> you<00:05:19.789> had

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
easier to make a montage if you had

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.390 
easier to make a montage if you had
something<00:05:20.240> like<00:05:20.419> this<00:05:20.630> so<00:05:21.530> that<00:05:21.889> might<00:05:22.100> be<00:05:22.130> one

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
something like this so that might be one

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.589 
something like this so that might be one
of<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.610> perks<00:05:22.820> that<00:05:23.150> would<00:05:23.330> spell<00:05:24.320> check<00:05:25.599> okay

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
of the perks that would spell check okay

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.880 
of the perks that would spell check okay
so<00:05:27.020> I<00:05:27.380> guess<00:05:27.650> that's<00:05:28.010> it<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:29.349> all<00:05:30.349> the<00:05:30.590> videos

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
so I guess that's it so all the videos

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.500 
so I guess that's it so all the videos
