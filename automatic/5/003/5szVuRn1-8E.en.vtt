00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.639
 making a pre video intro should always do that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.050

 back here in this jacket we are one 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.989
 lost in the desert and we are at the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.090
 search for a temple that we don't have 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.340
 found or some other life form 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.920
 which we did not find but has 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.760
 found march we have serious who have me 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:03.180

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.430
 even worth it is not worth it 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.290
 worth knowing why because he didn't tell me 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.869
 nothing strong then I would take some 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 of holes here but I don't take every 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.680
 Tuscan eye what else because maybe 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.330
 then we need what we do now 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.030
 we have to go and find some people 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:33.000
 because here these are chickens 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.490
 they hid aside while we 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.680
 daring we are traveling around the world with 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.680
 two hearts and see where we are now 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:56.119
 and they don't want it anymore what we do 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:00.360
 march ends here the tavern is nice but 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:09.270
 little hopes am to them I have to god the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.540
 they must find it and wait for one 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.360
 moment I saw a hole but more than that 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.980
 else if then when we all go to 0 0 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.310
 we must let the others escape 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.310
 before 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.850

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.510
