00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.059
 sometimes it takes a slightly different perspective and things as a whole 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:12.909
 understand 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.450
 That's the case with this bus 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.730
 because it is not so easy to understand 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.949
 This VW T4 has 522 pips 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.699
 but since he is supposed to be such a great first time actually 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.790
 economical and robust maybe 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.320
 and as much fun as possible should not be more 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.180
 his 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.810
 Clarify Tyler disagrees and puts the CC 4 9 93 on the wheels REM 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.739
 Player to but i 4 with Porsche 9 93 engine 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.130
 Let us take the time to take a closer look 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.390
 it is not much what the sewage treatment plants Sion see from what is different on the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 at first glance because behind has an air scoop on a normal t4 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.950
 no sense 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.010
 after all, he has his engine in front 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.900
 then she quotes is that different who sits at Thomas Vecsey's BI Turbo engine 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.630
 in the stern 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.110
 behind the huge 19-inch alloy wheels grab the tame the Porsche 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.110
 after in the funny contest 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 a rare opportunity without question this c4 viewed from the front 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.900
 can 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.450
 because when the Citi 4 9 93 is on the move then the perspectives shift 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.450
 once more 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 a ca 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.800
 the Porsche specialist Institute Engine makes said 522 hp and 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.509
 mobilized 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.920
 whopping 675 Newton meters of torque 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.670
 2025 kilograms of unladen weight will be a minor matter 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.790
 and on the high-speed line southern Italian Nardo 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.970
 it is only the air resistance that is the enemy of Citi 4 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.739
 273 karma are still top speed 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.739
 a more than respectable result 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.060
 thanks four-wheel drive and continue to doubt dandies is banged free 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.569
 and team doctor and the sprint to 100 pace 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.569
 after five high 1 second story 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.529
 the deliberately restrained outer shows in the stand hardly more than one 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.449
 visibly lowered bus 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.489
 Minimalism also prevails in the interior Schalthebels instruments come from 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.379
 Overall, the pop-trio exudes the brittle charm of a Porsche 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.379
 race car 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.269
 However, the sports bucket seats of Recaro are above almost any criticism 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.269
 also about the claim to comfort on long hauls 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.669
 for the passengers in the back seats, there is a DVD systems on request 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:15.309
 where actually the luggage belongs in the engine makes itself wide 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.579
 and provides an acoustic background 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.309
 NBA makes the stereo look old dapd 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:30.719
 dct 4 9 93 is a real exception in the automobile 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.479
 landscape 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.839
 a question of perspective Bonn that is for sure whether the price for the power 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.839
 Boost 168 thousand euros 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.729
 that will probably only be lovers as a bargain 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.159
 KÃ¼hnert he expects that at least 25 of these lovers in the 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.159
 next year to his customers include values 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.909
 No 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:53.450
 why does he say
