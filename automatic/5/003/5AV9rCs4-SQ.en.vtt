the bluff on the bluff overlooking the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.259 
the bluff on the bluff overlooking the
water<00:00:21.990> rather<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.670> I'll<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.000> kind<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269

filming around at the clouds and I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.429 
filming around at the clouds and I
noticed<00:00:27.900> something<00:00:28.769> very<00:00:28.800> very<00:00:29.460> strange

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
noticed something very very strange

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:42.470 
noticed something very very strange
something<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.550> shouldn't<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:41.480> you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
something that just shouldn't be you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750 
something that just shouldn't be you
just<00:00:42.690> tell<00:00:42.989> me<00:00:43.230> if<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.950> those<00:00:44.129> perfectly

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

symmetrical<00:00:45.770> triangles<00:00:46.770> belong<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> sky

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
symmetrical triangles belong in the sky

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.090 
symmetrical triangles belong in the sky
whether<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.460> clouds<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:53.180> metallic<00:00:54.180> UFOs

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
whether they be clouds or metallic UFOs

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.930 
whether they be clouds or metallic UFOs
you<00:00:56.100> know<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:57.270> doesn't<00:00:57.510> matter<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:59.699> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you know it doesn't matter this is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
you know it doesn't matter this is
really<00:01:00.270> freaky<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.289> know<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.070> think

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
really freaky I don't know what to think

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.490 
really freaky I don't know what to think
of<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.550> exactly<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.719> say<00:01:04.260> it's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of this exactly I'm not gonna say it's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.649 
of this exactly I'm not gonna say it's
one<00:01:04.830> thing<00:01:05.100> or<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.729> another<00:01:06.299> thing

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
one thing or it's not another thing

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.550 
one thing or it's not another thing
because<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> is

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
because I really don't know what it is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
because I really don't know what it is
but<00:01:11.840> yeah<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.110> look<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.040> decide<00:01:14.850> for

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
but yeah just look at it and decide for

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.320 
but yeah just look at it and decide for
yourself<00:01:16.189> I've<00:01:17.189> taken<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.090> Photoshop

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
yourself I've taken this in Photoshop

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.310 
yourself I've taken this in Photoshop
and<00:01:19.700> I've<00:01:20.700> cut<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.360> triangle<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
and I've cut out the triangle and I

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.030 
and I've cut out the triangle and I
flipped<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> around<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:25.110> seems<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.830> all

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
flipped it around and it seems to be all

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
flipped it around and it seems to be all
hurt<00:01:26.939> almost<00:01:27.509> perfectly<00:01:28.110> symmetrical<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
hurt almost perfectly symmetrical as you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.590 
hurt almost perfectly symmetrical as you
can<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.299> all<00:01:30.900> sides<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:33.150> pretty

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
can see here on all sides that is pretty

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.319 
can see here on all sides that is pretty
strange<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.900> wraps<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:38.180> think<00:01:39.180> what

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
strange so that wraps that up think what

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.539 
strange so that wraps that up think what
you<00:01:39.509> will<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.070> what<00:01:41.430> to
