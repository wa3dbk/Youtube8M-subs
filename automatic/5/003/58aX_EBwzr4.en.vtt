to<00:02:00.070> be<00:02:00.189> made<00:02:00.400> 100<00:02:01.119> 150<00:02:01.810> years<00:02:01.960> ago<00:02:02.200> which<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.680> a

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
to be made 100 150 years ago which is a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.399 
to be made 100 150 years ago which is a
leased<00:02:03.520> machinery<00:02:04.060> as<00:02:04.210> possible<00:02:04.690> people

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
leased machinery as possible people

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.100 
leased machinery as possible people
should<00:02:05.770> get<00:02:05.950> involved<00:02:06.549> in<00:02:07.299> physically<00:02:07.900> making

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
should get involved in physically making

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.440 
should get involved in physically making
something<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:09.009> means<00:02:09.190> something<00:02:09.550> more<00:02:10.119> we

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
something so it means something more we

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.630 
something so it means something more we
take<00:02:10.630> blocks<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.080> clay<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:11.620> slice<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:11.980> up

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
take blocks of clay we slice it up

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.809 
take blocks of clay we slice it up
we<00:02:12.940> make<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.390> into<00:02:13.540> big<00:02:13.690> flat<00:02:13.989> sheets<00:02:14.459> we<00:02:15.459> stamp

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
we make it into big flat sheets we stamp

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.510 
we make it into big flat sheets we stamp
large<00:02:16.569> battles<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.319> small<00:02:17.560> petals<00:02:17.950> out<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.370> it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
large battles and small petals out of it

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.410 
large battles and small petals out of it
we<00:02:19.330> put<00:02:19.569> those<00:02:19.720> two<00:02:20.080> together<00:02:21.060> take<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> circle

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
we put those two together take a circle

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.080 
we put those two together take a circle
of<00:02:22.690> clay<00:02:22.900> out<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.380> middle<00:02:23.680> make<00:02:24.610> them<00:02:24.880> into

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
of clay out of the middle make them into

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.760 
of clay out of the middle make them into
flower<00:02:25.300> shapes<00:02:25.630> put<00:02:26.170> them<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.500> kiln

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
flower shapes put them in the kiln

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.009 
flower shapes put them in the kiln
they're<00:02:27.250> fired<00:02:27.580> then<00:02:28.239> they'll<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.690> their

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
they're fired then they'll have their

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.640 
they're fired then they'll have their
their<00:02:30.010> corks<00:02:30.340> put<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.569> then<00:02:32.410> they'll<00:02:32.530> be

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
their corks put in and then they'll be

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.740 
their corks put in and then they'll be
packaged<00:02:33.040> up<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.819> go<00:02:33.940> down<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.480> Terra

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
packaged up to go down to the Terra

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.740 
packaged up to go down to the Terra
London<00:02:35.200> where<00:02:36.190> they'll<00:02:36.459> have<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.030> metal

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
London where they'll have the metal

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.449 
London where they'll have the metal
spikes<00:02:38.230> put<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.650> them<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.040> then<00:02:39.160> they'll<00:02:39.310> be
