00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.920 
that yeah this is telling you that in
between<00:03:39.459> these<00:03:40.459> two<00:03:40.700> arrows<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:41.510> are<00:03:41.570> kind

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
between these two arrows that are kind

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.930 
between these two arrows that are kind
of<00:03:41.989> pointing<00:03:42.350> towards<00:03:42.590> each<00:03:42.680> other<00:03:42.799> in<00:03:43.100> this

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
of pointing towards each other in this

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.280 
of pointing towards each other in this
open<00:03:44.269> area<00:03:44.360> everything<00:03:44.930> that's<00:03:45.079> in<00:03:45.200> between

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
open area everything that's in between

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.650 
open area everything that's in between
there<00:03:45.739> will<00:03:46.340> be<00:03:46.459> fully<00:03:46.730> affected<00:03:47.329> by<00:03:47.600> the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
there will be fully affected by the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.150 
there will be fully affected by the
joint<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.230> makes<00:03:48.380> sense<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.739> everything

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
joint that makes sense and everything

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.000 
joint that makes sense and everything
that's<00:03:49.310> in<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.519> red<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:51.049> completely

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
that's in the red is is completely

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.710 
that's in the red is is completely
static<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.610> then<00:03:53.180> everything<00:03:53.420> that's

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
static and then everything that's

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.789 
static and then everything that's
between<00:03:53.989> these<00:03:54.290> two<00:03:54.609> is<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:56.299> blended<00:03:56.720> area<00:03:57.049> so

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
between these two is the blended area so

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.729 
between these two is the blended area so
I<00:03:58.130> also<00:03:58.370> have<00:03:58.670> an<00:03:58.790> option<00:03:58.940> here<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.510> push<00:04:00.500> the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
I also have an option here to push the

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.920 
I also have an option here to push the
neighboring<00:04:01.160> angles<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:02.329> turn<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.690> off

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
neighboring angles I can turn that off

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.920 
neighboring angles I can turn that off
and<00:04:03.320> actually<00:04:03.799> make<00:04:03.950> these<00:04:05.079> cross<00:04:06.079> each<00:04:06.320> other

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
and actually make these cross each other

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.690 
and actually make these cross each other
sometimes<00:04:08.930> that's<00:04:09.200> useful<00:04:09.410> but<00:04:10.160> most<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.609> the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
sometimes that's useful but most of the

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.330 
sometimes that's useful but most of the
time<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.420> have<00:04:11.650> pushed<00:04:12.650> neighboring<00:04:13.040> angles

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
time you have pushed neighboring angles

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.120 
time you have pushed neighboring angles
on<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.670> what<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:14.090> does<00:04:14.239> is<00:04:14.299> say<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.980> grab<00:04:15.980> this

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
on and what that does is say I grab this

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.279 
on and what that does is say I grab this
one<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.489> move<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.970> up<00:04:17.090> notice<00:04:17.840> it's<00:04:17.989> pushing

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
one and move it up notice it's pushing

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.069 
one and move it up notice it's pushing
the<00:04:18.590> other<00:04:18.709> one<00:04:19.209> it<00:04:20.209> doesn't<00:04:20.510> let<00:04:20.600> me<00:04:20.660> get<00:04:20.780> go

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
the other one it doesn't let me get go

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.920 
the other one it doesn't let me get go
past<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.620> same<00:04:21.950> thing<00:04:22.160> with<00:04:22.280> these<00:04:22.520> I<00:04:22.820> can<00:04:23.180> have

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
past it same thing with these I can have

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.950 
past it same thing with these I can have
it<00:04:24.080> push<00:04:24.669> so<00:04:25.669> I<00:04:26.000> don't<00:04:26.270> I<00:04:26.419> don't<00:04:26.479> end<00:04:26.810> up

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
it push so I don't I don't end up

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.880 
it push so I don't I don't end up
telling<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.530> both<00:04:28.370> include<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.180> exclude

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
telling it to both include and exclude

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.550 
telling it to both include and exclude
that<00:04:30.890> area<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.400> geometry<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.990> I've<00:04:33.229> got<00:04:33.380> that

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
that area the geometry so I've got that

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.060 
that area the geometry so I've got that
the<00:04:34.340> other<00:04:34.490> thing<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.960> can<00:04:36.080> do<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.770> control

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
the other thing that I can do to control

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.390 
the other thing that I can do to control
how<00:04:37.580> things<00:04:37.880> look<00:04:38.390> on<00:04:38.539> on<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.229> viewport<00:04:39.620> here

how things look on on the viewport here

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.070 
how things look on on the viewport here
is<00:04:40.580> if<00:04:40.759> I<00:04:40.850> go<00:04:41.000> up<00:04:41.030> here<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.660> option<00:04:41.930> menu

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
is if I go up here to the option menu

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.820 
is if I go up here to the option menu
and<00:04:42.290> click<00:04:42.440> customize<00:04:42.979> drawing<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.610> get<00:04:44.449> this

can see and this and this one's

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.730 
can see and this and this one's
particularly<00:05:10.610> useful<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.570> seeing<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.500> way

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
particularly useful and seeing the way

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.710 
particularly useful and seeing the way
the<00:05:12.949> weight<00:05:13.190> map<00:05:13.400> are<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.210> waiting<00:05:14.600> is

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
the weight map are the the waiting is

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.510 
the weight map are the the waiting is
being<00:05:14.990> applied<00:05:15.169> to<00:05:15.289> the<00:05:15.500> geometry<00:05:15.979> you're

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
being applied to the geometry you're

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.490 
being applied to the geometry you're
probably<00:05:16.729> already<00:05:16.910> familiar<00:05:17.030> if<00:05:17.479> you<00:05:17.600> used<00:05:17.840> if

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
probably already familiar if you used if

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.700 
probably already familiar if you used if
you've<00:05:18.710> used<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.070> deform<00:05:20.020> tool<00:05:21.020> in<00:05:21.260> dead

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
you've used the deform tool in dead

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.650 
you've used the deform tool in dead
studio<00:05:22.039> to<00:05:22.610> seeing<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.090> points<00:05:23.479> on<00:05:23.630> the

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
studio to seeing the points on the

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.689 
studio to seeing the points on the
surface<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.440> give<00:05:24.889> you<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.039> feedback<00:05:25.280> about

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
surface that give you the feedback about

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.629 
surface that give you the feedback about
how<00:05:25.850> how<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.570> zones<00:05:26.990> are<00:05:27.199> going<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.380> fit

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
how how the zones are going to fit

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.750 
how how the zones are going to fit
that's<00:05:28.639> also<00:05:29.060> here<00:05:29.690> but<00:05:30.050> we've<00:05:30.770> gone<00:05:31.010> a<00:05:31.460> step

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
that's also here but we've gone a step

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.730 
that's also here but we've gone a step
further<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.479> giving<00:05:33.080> you<00:05:33.169> the<00:05:33.349> ability<00:05:33.440> to

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
further and giving you the ability to

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.969 
further and giving you the ability to
see<00:05:33.949> the<00:05:34.190> wireframes<00:05:34.820> and<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.870> also<00:05:36.020> see<00:05:36.380> the

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
see the wireframes and to also see the

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.670 
see the wireframes and to also see the
solid<00:05:37.520> shading<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.060> this<00:05:38.900> is<00:05:39.110> this<00:05:39.530> is

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
solid shading and this is this is

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.379 
solid shading and this is this is
probably<00:05:40.009> the<00:05:40.160> most<00:05:40.370> useful<00:05:40.520> you<00:05:41.000> get<00:05:41.090> the

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
probably the most useful you get the

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.180 
probably the most useful you get the
most<00:05:41.660> exact<00:05:42.139> be<00:05:42.349> honest<00:05:42.620> it's<00:05:42.800> really<00:05:43.070> nice

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
most exact be honest it's really nice

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.129 
most exact be honest it's really nice
and<00:05:43.490> then<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:44.000> can<00:05:44.120> also<00:05:44.300> change<00:05:44.690> you<00:05:45.050> know

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
and then you can also change you know

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.409 
and then you can also change you know
how<00:05:45.320> a<00:05:45.349> pic<00:05:45.650> do<00:05:45.830> I<00:05:45.860> want<00:05:46.099> that<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:46.370> be<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:47.270> can

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
how a pic do I want that to be you can

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.070 
how a pic do I want that to be you can
still<00:05:47.599> see<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:47.870> surface<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.440> then<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.930> can

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
still see the surface and then you can

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.810 
still see the surface and then you can
change<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.530> color<00:05:51.740> of<00:05:51.949> the<00:05:52.370> line<00:05:52.580> that's

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
change the color of the line that's

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.870 
change the color of the line that's
drawn<00:05:53.090> to<00:05:53.510> show<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.800> boundary<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:55.610> can<00:05:55.760> have

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
drawn to show the boundary you can have

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.240 
drawn to show the boundary you can have
that<00:05:56.000> either<00:05:56.120> be<00:05:56.300> lines<00:05:56.539> or<00:05:56.840> or<00:05:57.130> points<00:05:58.130> and

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
that either be lines or or points and

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.330 
that either be lines or or points and
then<00:05:58.580> also<00:05:59.560> whether<00:06:00.560> or<00:06:00.710> not<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:00.949> want<00:06:01.159> the

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
then also whether or not you want the

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.029 
then also whether or not you want the
bone<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:02.030> show<00:06:02.270> you<00:06:02.330> the<00:06:02.930> axes<00:06:03.380> I<00:06:03.409> basically

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
bone to show you the axes I basically

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.529 
bone to show you the axes I basically
give<00:06:04.430> you<00:06:04.520> some<00:06:04.699> of<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:04.909> what<00:06:05.210> are<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.360> other

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
give you some of the what are the other

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.570 
give you some of the what are the other
options<00:06:05.599> there<00:06:06.199> well<00:06:06.680> you've<00:06:06.830> got<00:06:07.010> solid

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
options there well you've got solid

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.189 
options there well you've got solid
color<00:06:07.909> and<00:06:08.180> it'll<00:06:08.389> just<00:06:08.419> change<00:06:08.780> the<00:06:08.990> white

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
color and it'll just change the white

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.439 
color and it'll just change the white
yeah<00:06:09.680> or<00:06:09.889> you<00:06:10.130> can<00:06:10.220> see<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.639> acts<00:06:11.240> of<00:06:11.419> the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
yeah or you can see the acts of the

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.210 
yeah or you can see the acts of the
colors<00:06:11.840> that<00:06:11.870> represent<00:06:12.050> the<00:06:12.470> axes<00:06:12.889> of<00:06:13.039> that

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
colors that represent the axes of that

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.849 
colors that represent the axes of that
bone<00:06:13.400> so
