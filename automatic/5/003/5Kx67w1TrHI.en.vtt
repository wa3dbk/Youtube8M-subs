00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
this looks crazy but actually that's why

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.700 
this looks crazy but actually that's why
I<00:00:09.210> try<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.570> obstacle<00:00:09.929> instead<00:00:10.260> because<00:00:10.590> it

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
I try this obstacle instead because it

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:20.360 
I try this obstacle instead because it
looks<00:00:10.889> more<00:00:11.099> interesting

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.640

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.000 

look<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.790> my<00:01:50.910> son<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.360> watch<00:01:51.480> me<00:01:51.660> follow<00:01:52.010> the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010

yeah

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.440 

you<00:02:07.430> could<00:02:07.580> probably<00:02:07.670> do<00:02:07.940> this<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.270> mean<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
you could probably do this I mean the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.530 
you could probably do this I mean the
only<00:02:08.539> problem<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:10.240> since<00:02:11.240> you're<00:02:11.420> not

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
only problem is that since you're not

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.300 
only problem is that since you're not
tall<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.170> can't<00:02:12.380> reach<00:02:12.500> as<00:02:12.620> high<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.100> some

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
tall you can't reach as high so some

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.880 
tall you can't reach as high so some
parts<00:02:13.610> might<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.420> little<00:02:15.050> scary<00:02:15.440> because

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
parts might be a little scary because

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.620 
parts might be a little scary because
you<00:02:16.070> can<00:02:16.220> I'm<00:02:16.520> hanging<00:02:16.850> up<00:02:16.910> high<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.420> it's<00:02:17.540> not

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
you can I'm hanging up high so it's not

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.300 
you can I'm hanging up high so it's not
I<00:02:17.840> have<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:17.990> balance<00:02:20.320> but<00:02:21.320> my<00:02:21.770> kids<00:02:21.980> do<00:02:22.130> this
