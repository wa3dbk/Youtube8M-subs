00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
currently have you think that there's no

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.399 
currently have you think that there's no
point<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.570> having<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.930> slimmed<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.259> version

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
point in having a slimmed down version

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
point in having a slimmed down version
let<00:01:23.369> me<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.790> mean<00:01:23.970> honestly<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> past

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
let me know I mean honestly in the past

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
let me know I mean honestly in the past
there<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.500> no<00:01:25.619> reason<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
there really was no reason for it but I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160 
there really was no reason for it but I
guess<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.450> try<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.630> move<00:01:27.930> more

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
guess they do it to try to move more

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.990 
guess they do it to try to move more
