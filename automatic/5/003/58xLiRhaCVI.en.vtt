hey guys this is what week with another

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.400 
hey guys this is what week with another
quick<00:00:08.790> corner<00:00:09.210> tutorial<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.080> time<00:00:10.260> I'm

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
quick corner tutorial this time I'm

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.410 
quick corner tutorial this time I'm
going<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.590> show<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.770> how<00:00:11.129> to<00:00:11.190> hook<00:00:12.150> up

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
going to show you how to hook up

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.840 
going to show you how to hook up
orientation<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.350> Cronus<00:00:13.980> son<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
orientation of Cronus son with a

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.859 
orientation of Cronus son with a
environment<00:00:15.629> map<00:00:15.890> so<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.090> create<00:00:18.360> just

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
environment map so if we create just

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.630 
environment map so if we create just
turn<00:00:19.140> us<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.440> you<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.279> have<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> new

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
turn us on you can see we have a new

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.750 
turn us on you can see we have a new
sound<00:00:20.940> that's<00:00:21.180> no<00:00:21.330> longer<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.660> gizmo<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.320> has<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
sound that's no longer a gizmo it has a

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.790 
sound that's no longer a gizmo it has a
son<00:00:23.760> object<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.780> a<00:00:24.870> target<00:00:25.290> so<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.530> can

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
son object and a target so you can

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.350 
son object and a target so you can
freeform<00:00:26.400> lay<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.880> move<00:00:27.270> it<00:00:27.390> around<00:00:27.980> okay<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
freeform lay just move it around okay so

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.840 
freeform lay just move it around okay so
let's<00:00:30.360> say<00:00:30.600> that<00:00:30.930> I<00:00:31.380> load<00:00:31.950> some<00:00:32.279> environment

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
let's say that I load some environment

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.930 
let's say that I load some environment
map<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:35.420> displayed<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> viewport<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
map and displayed in the viewport and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
map and displayed in the viewport and
for<00:00:38.940> example<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:39.720> just<00:00:39.930> something<00:00:40.290> in

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
for example I want just something in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
for example I want just something in
viewport<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.820> use<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.150> quickly

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
viewport that I can use to quickly

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.780 
viewport that I can use to quickly
rotate<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:42.930> map<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.130> case<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.610> have

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
rotate the map or in this case I have

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.110 
rotate the map or in this case I have
jpg<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.540> want<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.649> also<00:00:47.100> some<00:00:47.399> real

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
jpg so I want to have so also some real

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.840 
jpg so I want to have so also some real
sunlight<00:00:48.540> because<00:00:49.170> JPEG<00:00:50.040> has<00:00:50.220> no<00:00:50.399> dynamic

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
sunlight because JPEG has no dynamic

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.229 
sunlight because JPEG has no dynamic
range<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> orientation<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
range and I want the orientation of the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.420 
range and I want the orientation of the
krona<00:00:54.510> son<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.649> son<00:00:55.680> disc<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
krona son and my son disc on the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.889 
krona son and my son disc on the
environment<00:00:57.000> always<00:00:57.680> synchronized<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.899> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
environment always synchronized so the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.900 
environment always synchronized so the
first<00:01:01.110> thing<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.350> need<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.250> select

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
first thing we need to do is just select

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.649 
first thing we need to do is just select
and<00:01:03.210> link<00:01:03.420> pick<00:01:04.079> this<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:04.589> link<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.339> our<00:01:05.659> sanam

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and link pick this and link up our sanam

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.069 
and link pick this and link up our sanam
jack<00:01:06.899> onto<00:01:07.350> its<00:01:07.469> target<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.700> once<00:01:09.569> we<00:01:09.749> rotate

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
jack onto its target so once we rotate

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.020 
jack onto its target so once we rotate
it<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.909> Sun<00:01:12.179> rotates<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:13.259> its<00:01:13.469> target

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
it now the Sun rotates with its target

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.370 
it now the Sun rotates with its target
next<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.209> I'm<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.749> isolate<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
next thing I'm going to isolate the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
next thing I'm going to isolate the
selection<00:01:16.579> I'm<00:01:17.579> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.920> align<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.520> first

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
selection I'm going to align it so first

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.209 
selection I'm going to align it so first
I<00:01:21.840> need<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.969> focus<00:01:23.969> on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.689> target<00:01:24.929> I'm<00:01:25.889> going

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
I need to focus on the target I'm going

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.190 
I need to focus on the target I'm going
to<00:01:26.310> align<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.759> target<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:27.329> it<00:01:27.450> exactly

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
to align the target so it exactly

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.649 
to align the target so it exactly
intersects<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.399> first<00:01:29.969> going<00:01:30.149> to<00:01:30.270> bring<00:01:30.479> our

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
intersects I'm first going to bring our

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.169 
intersects I'm first going to bring our
Sun<00:01:30.899> here<00:01:31.369> align<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.399> target<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
Sun here align the target so it

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.179 
Sun here align the target so it
intersects<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.779> the<00:01:33.899> Sun<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.439> now<00:01:34.979> I'm

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
intersects with the Sun and now I'm

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
intersects with the Sun and now I'm
going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.459> align<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> Sun<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.569> it's<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.139> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
going to align the Sun so it's in the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.969 
going to align the Sun so it's in the
exactly<00:01:37.979> same<00:01:38.099> line<00:01:39.229> okay<00:01:40.259> once<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.459> is<00:01:41.609> done

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
exactly same line okay once this is done

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.489 
exactly same line okay once this is done
I'm<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.249> select<00:01:44.459> the<00:01:44.700> target<00:01:45.439> go<00:01:46.439> to

to the environment and we need to arrive
a<00:02:31.560> little<00:02:31.710> expression<00:02:32.220> which<00:02:33.210> is<00:02:33.420> basically

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.210 

before<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.500> z-rotation<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:38.370> write<00:02:38.850> read<00:02:40.220> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
before the z-rotation we write read to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.270 
before the z-rotation we write read to
deck<00:02:42.120> which<00:02:42.630> basically<00:02:43.050> converts<00:02:43.560> radians<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
deck which basically converts radians to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.920 
deck which basically converts radians to
degrees<00:02:45.140> thanks<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.650> town<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
degrees thanks to the town for this and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.560 
degrees thanks to the town for this and
we<00:02:48.930> gather<00:02:49.200> divided<00:02:49.800> by<00:02:51.620> 360<00:02:52.620> because<00:02:53.570> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
we gather divided by 360 because the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.980 
we gather divided by 360 because the
range<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.320> offset<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:56.330> zero<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:57.720> while

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
range of you offset is zero to one while

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.520 
range of you offset is zero to one while
the<00:02:58.230> range<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.680> rotation<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.820> zero<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.530> 360

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
the range of rotation is zero to 360

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.330 
the range of rotation is zero to 360
once<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.580> done<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:02.940> hit<00:03:03.030> connect<00:03:03.330> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
once this is done we hit connect and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
once this is done we hit connect and
oops<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.670> did<00:03:06.030> something<00:03:06.510> something<00:03:07.380> wrong<00:03:07.680> I

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
oops I did something something wrong I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.010 
oops I did something something wrong I
just<00:03:09.360> quickly<00:03:09.810> ah<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:11.190> typo<00:03:11.820> reg<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.840> deck

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
just quickly ah here typo reg to deck

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.880 
just quickly ah here typo reg to deck
update<00:03:13.940> here<00:03:14.940> we<00:03:15.060> go<00:03:15.240> so<00:03:16.110> now<00:03:16.140> if<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.680> rotate

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
update here we go so now if I rotate

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.960 
update here we go so now if I rotate
this<00:03:17.540> our<00:03:18.770> environment<00:03:19.770> map<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.220> rotating

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
this our environment map is rotating

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.490 
this our environment map is rotating
exactly<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.260> same<00:03:22.530> way<00:03:22.709> as<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.070> Sun<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:24.500> so

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
exactly the same way as the Sun and so

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.720 
exactly the same way as the Sun and so
if<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.250> get<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:27.630> any<00:03:27.840> angle<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:29.010> look<00:03:29.250> through

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
if I get to any angle and I look through

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.030 
if I get to any angle and I look through
and<00:03:29.970> my<00:03:30.090> son<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:30.630> always<00:03:31.140> aligned<00:03:31.620> with<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
and my son it's always aligned with the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.880 
and my son it's always aligned with the
Sun<00:03:32.250> disk<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.900> our<00:03:34.110> environment<00:03:34.709> map

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
Sun disk on the on our environment map

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.940 
Sun disk on the on our environment map
if<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.580> do<00:03:35.970> not<00:03:36.120> if<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.540> maybe<00:03:37.230> are<00:03:37.590> afraid

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
if you do not if you maybe are afraid

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.280 
if you do not if you maybe are afraid
that<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.190> will<00:03:38.310> accidentally<00:03:39.030> move<00:03:39.420> your<00:03:39.959> son

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
that you will accidentally move your son

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.979 
that you will accidentally move your son
and<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:41.040> will<00:03:41.250> become<00:03:41.610> misaligned<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.810> can

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
and it will become misaligned you can

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.670 
and it will become misaligned you can
always<00:03:43.230> go<00:03:43.530> here<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.750> here<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:46.050> hierarchy

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
always go here and here a hierarchy

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.360 
always go here and here a hierarchy
parent<00:03:47.040> link<00:03:47.190> info<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.850> enable<00:03:48.810> these<00:03:48.930> locks

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
parent link info and enable these locks

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.150 
parent link info and enable these locks
so<00:03:50.370> now<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.730> cannot<00:03:51.209> move<00:03:51.690> or<00:03:52.050> rotate<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.890> Sun

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
so now you cannot move or rotate the Sun

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.320 
so now you cannot move or rotate the Sun
but<00:03:53.489> if<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.209> rotate<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.700> target<00:03:56.700> object<00:03:56.850> it

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
but if you rotate the target object it

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.930 
but if you rotate the target object it
will<00:03:57.540> still<00:03:57.870> rotate<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.950> Sun<00:03:59.160> as<00:03:59.370> well<00:03:59.580> so<00:03:59.790> it

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
will still rotate the Sun as well so it

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.340 
will still rotate the Sun as well so it
will<00:04:00.120> always<00:04:00.360> remain<00:04:01.350> aligned<00:04:03.110> okay<00:04:04.110> and

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
will always remain aligned okay and

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.729 
will always remain aligned okay and
obviously<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.850> maybe<00:04:06.120> find<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
obviously if you maybe find that the

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.310 
obviously if you maybe find that the
target<00:04:08.220> object<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.730> too<00:04:09.330> small<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.810> viewport

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
target object is too small in viewport

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.280 
target object is too small in viewport
you<00:04:10.980> can<00:04:11.190> always<00:04:11.640> just<00:04:12.060> use<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.930> daylight

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
you can always just use the daylight

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.159 
you can always just use the daylight
system<00:04:13.730> which<00:04:14.730> if<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.300> set<00:04:17.150> we<00:04:18.150> put<00:04:18.989> here

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
system which if you set we put here

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.800 
system which if you set we put here
Cronus<00:04:19.560> on<00:04:19.820> which<00:04:20.820> if<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.120> set<00:04:21.330> your<00:04:21.419> manual

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
Cronus on which if you set your manual

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.659 
Cronus on which if you set your manual
mode<00:04:22.019> it's<00:04:22.290> exactly<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.950> same<00:04:23.160> thing<00:04:23.400> here

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
mode it's exactly the same thing here

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.469 
mode it's exactly the same thing here
the<00:04:23.730> Sun<00:04:24.120> here's<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.140> target<00:04:26.120> target<00:04:27.120> rotate

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
the Sun here's the target target rotate

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.710 
the Sun here's the target target rotate
to<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.660> Sun<00:04:27.840> as<00:04:27.960> well<00:04:28.169> and

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
to the Sun as well and

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.900 
to the Sun as well and
basically<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:31.200> it's<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.190> same<00:04:32.430> thing<00:04:32.730> as

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
basically it's it's the same thing as

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.880 
basically it's it's the same thing as
this<00:04:33.150> but<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.690> have<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.020> nice<00:04:34.320> large

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
this but you have this nice large

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.120 
this but you have this nice large
compass<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.940> can<00:04:36.150> orient<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.500> that's<00:04:37.950> it

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
compass that you can orient so that's it

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.460 
compass that you can orient so that's it
for<00:04:38.340> this<00:04:38.490> short<00:04:38.760> tutorial<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:39.390> hope<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.260> found
