00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.060 
in the past 10 years fuel prices have
risen<00:01:28.080> about<00:01:28.380> two<00:01:28.619> hundred<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> fifty

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
risen about two hundred and fifty

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
risen about two hundred and fifty
percent<00:01:29.579> while<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> average<00:01:30.600> income<00:01:30.810> has

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
risen only about five percent so what

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.969 
risen only about five percent so what
that<00:01:33.420> means<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.900> basically<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:34.860> not

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that means is basically you are not

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.039 
that means is basically you are not
making<00:01:35.159> any<00:01:35.520> more<00:01:35.729> money<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.689> paying

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
making any more money but you are paying

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.719 
making any more money but you are paying
out<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> whole<00:01:37.500> lot<00:01:37.680> more<00:01:37.860> repairs<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.520> fuel

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
out a whole lot more repairs and fuel

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
out a whole lot more repairs and fuel
all<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:40.020> buying<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.439> more

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
all because what you are buying is more

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.340 
all because what you are buying is more
expensive<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.250> lower<00:01:41.490> quality<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.170> wait

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
expensive and lower quality we can wait

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.719 
expensive and lower quality we can wait
for<00:01:43.560> something<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> happen<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.430> hope<00:01:44.579> that

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
for something to happen and hope that

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.219 
for something to happen and hope that
the<00:01:44.850> prices<00:01:45.210> will<00:01:45.329> come<00:01:45.479> down<00:01:45.540> which<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:45.990> not

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the prices will come down which is not

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.109 
the prices will come down which is not
likely<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.520> something<00:01:47.790> about<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
likely or we can do something about it

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.899
