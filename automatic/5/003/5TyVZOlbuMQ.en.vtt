00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 Welcome to another one is on 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.710
 and review and testing sequence in things 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.390
 leibrock instruments and products the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 I can recommend to you 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.289
 I present you today that I need 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.779
 I do not really have to test it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.119
 because I have to be a little longer 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.929
 I also have for other brands with the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.940
 same active ingredient is used and that is 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.570
 a very good joint support joint 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.460
 Protection and relations is a whole 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.170
 great topic in bodybuilding you can do that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 Train hard for a long time 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.870
 then rather injuries then it just means 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.520
 just a step back and we 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.780
 want to avoid that if it is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.239
 we do not want to happen 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.520
 Of course you can get there too 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.590
 look what happens and how I can 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.850
 Unfortunately no fan needs to be given and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.430
 Every case has to be for yourself too 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 be diagnosed and therefore here for 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.409
 doctor or liz and smart on the internet me 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.260
 I'm not the doctor I 've got there 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.869
 somehow never bitch on English doctors 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.570
 that's me here last year 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.520
 but I recommend you I do not 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.740
 right because I'm just 14 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.320
 head because i have bad experiences 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.380
 made with first here 's three 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.090
 first because of a problem and comes 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.790
 often they mean no that is 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.360
 hinders but in any case goes to 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.520
 doctor 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.829
 I have to say a video unfortunately I have to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.150
 That's why they say it now and plastically 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.400
 if they do, they act in an injury 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.040
 For example, you have many problems 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.470
 shoulder how to get out of there what has to 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.110
 I do yes I can recommend things 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.090
 Exercising curls goes on the cable train 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860
 and do exercises for the rotations 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.630
 I hide here briefly in exercises 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 then you can look at everyone now 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.920
 case very important that can do with it 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.470
 make wholesale 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.840
 that's right, and yes, the low-lying one 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.430
 musculature the cell phone rotors down there 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.140
 you can not really put on mask 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.840
 You have to work out that strength 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.890
 because of the different whole 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.509
 Shoulder the shoulder is a very 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.550
 complex muscle the case is the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.959
 all the time back and forth is very moving 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.030
 there can be everywhere back and forth 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.519
 and that are very complex on the muscle and 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.340
 here are four shoulder heads turning and 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.620
 all that a big topic and yes 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.790
 unfortunately there are now and then complicated 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.750
 things are also complicated injuries 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.310
 but that's another topic for everyone 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.780
 Fall back to joint support 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.160
 is clumsily protection of physical red 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.000
 actually a very cheap variant 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.250
 and applies to me is just only 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.170
 times a day to my diet I would 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.720
 now in deficit am there because dived 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.260
 last on otherwise in masses 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.510
 not necessarily phase but has the mask 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.420
 phase in any case to which 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:06.040
 injury then no matter when en masse 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:08.829
 so now people to the product yamada 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.650
 by mike rodgers is called the whole 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:16.090
 It is the active ingredient is practically one 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.070
 Plant tastes like shit it tastes 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.600
 really bad 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.329
 I think that with water always or with 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.100
 a shaker me anyway always such a 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.500
 small supreme court if I mean all 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.430
 things along with so then comes 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.700
 that also does not taste good with pure 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.560
 But it does not matter who the am 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.810
 is cry or complain about who is due 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.190
 the taste should grandma go and should 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.640
 the ship on the cheek burst 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.609
 to let 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.250
 then I can watch the video again 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.280
 have my hand box here so that looks 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.360
 house here we are other I reject 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.710
 like to know the idea to 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:58.000
 berlin and although it is so funny brown 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.000
 not only tastes is modest that was 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.880
 pretty funny in any case 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.830
 I hurt our little bit 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.930
 shoulder little knee know her there 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.840
 So everyone does not really kneel 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.340
 I made rodale squats with 140 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.780
 kilo so deep loud lantzsch is so beautiful 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.150
 just protect the knees know 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.990
 they do not scream like that now 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.669
 is normal for crying during training 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.300
 that gives me a little pig yes 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.070
 this is the school's knowledge now and then 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.230
 this is what I have that speaks 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.330
 Business plans from down here in the 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.940
 shoulder goes in that is with many 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.410
 People of the case that the biceps tendon 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.820
 inflamed here is a shoulder in it 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.930
 the point where it was their fault 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.040
 That's what it's all about 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.830
 really be careful because if that 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.210
 shoulder once broken one is trained 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.150
 yes next you do not want to complete 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.770
 stop and you let the most 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.450
 I really keep it that way 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.270
 Most of the people you mistake and 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.100
 then this can really be roche and 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.750
 then it will not even go away 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.110
 was also when it is time away then only 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.030
 so short away and then it's back 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.620
 you have to be very careful what the 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.000
 shoulder concerns of bayer once you 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.000
 Here is the first pain 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.710
 directly directly direct since less 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.169
 idiots directly down from the weight 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.810
 just press 20-30 kilos 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.910
 Less done when stinging weeks 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.190
 do not come then you are closed anyway 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.020
 but if you know what 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.630
 no longer feels that you can do that too 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.460
 not never never train 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.669
 train on the pain so how 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.110
 said pain pain comes or you 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.630
 feel here with develop the shoulder 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.220
 20 kilos down the bench press 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.200
 Bench press is what exercises mostly 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.820
 caused these problems of 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.990
 conveyor alumni there are those 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.300
 shoulder so another 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.140
 layers there is another theory 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.750
 and so it's just definite 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.990
 so to 99 percent that at bank press 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.350
 you get the pain here as well 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.150
 keep third so top post so 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.830
 probably my tip if you something 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.200
 have your shoulder will just enter 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.820
 negative but only negative bench press 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.550
 and there you have the shoulder again 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.500
 turned off as far as possible and it 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.190
 gives more direction to our chest direction 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.610
 Act 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.440
 Dreetz and so on and so on e mail 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.100
 you go up the positive ones 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.840
 Impressions flat bank thus of flat railway 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.700
 to positive is always the fault 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.500
 sea level and then agreed the 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.840
 School of the rule of law and we want that 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.480
 of course not 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.040
 So certainly vegas is 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.930
 I can recommend the product 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.180
