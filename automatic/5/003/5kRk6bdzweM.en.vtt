00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.250
 hello everyone I'm in the map 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.079
 gray ben to show you that we can 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.310
 return to the roof after patch so 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.320
 I am here on the map 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.560
 wink at my mate dry 10 cfp at 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 passage therefore in fact on the railing 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.120
 with the shield once we are 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
 on it we do it here where I am 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 they actually put back an invisible wall 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.730
 but this one does not go all the way 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.710
 down to the corner and so if you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.149
 go into the corner hop we made a 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.360
 double jump it's you again on the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.610
 roof 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.739
 good it was bad this game no misfortune 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.940
 patched and there is a hole also 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.469
 it is a second solution to the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.050
 shield aisles directly to the hole 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.730
 but that I'll show you that in second 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 and then has the first stage of the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.819
 realization is already mounted on the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.010
 railing deploy the shield the most 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:09.510
 close to possible here is wall goodness 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.070
 up on it if it's okay if 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.020
 I took it well it's better here 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.460
 little penny lightly the right is 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.540
 double jump to hang the ledge 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.150
 invisible as I told you in 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.710
 the angle so in fact we bypass the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.050
 invisible barrier that is left by 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.850
 the right and the double art sony a little 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.400
 shot on the left to be on the roof 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.800
 you are at the top of the roof of the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.060
 map of the magny if so in after no 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.780
 dog since actually it's from 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.550
 the after patch so from there 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.410
 now you can go slide 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.440
 on the roof you can ride a small 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.850
 little so here here you can a little 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.530
 shortly afterwards of course you put in 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 this part there see our species of 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.510
 krups that in fact you do not fall in the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.410
 piece makes it down time and I 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.230
 will actually show you that there is a 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.720
 kind of hole between two barriers 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.370
 invisible actually see there I can more 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.930
 move forward so if I run I have a 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.610
 invisible barrier in front of me where I 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.740
 am it's a hole and there of course I do not 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.080
 can not move more than that so in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.340
 this kind of hole wash and ben 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.110
 actually this is the second solution 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.670
 to go directly 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.959
 so that's what I'm going to show you 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.430
 rents they put two barriers 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.340
 invisible on either side but in fact 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.530
 it is 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.870
 I bet a hole I do not know how 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.370
 they have a place at sam years did 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.629
 its true as said my friend fp like 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.550
 if indeed we were left 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.000
 opportunity to go guess if she 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.700
 is something else 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.310
 Anyway, that's how it's second 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.080
 solution so always since the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.690
 shield so pivot slightly to 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.370
 right and then sow double jump for himself 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.940
 let's go backstage and in this hole that's it 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.560
 blues is on the roof again 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.150
 here is the after patch 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.799
 to go on the roof of tomorrow dean of 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.330
 two different ways here in the 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.330
 green card lead to see you soon
