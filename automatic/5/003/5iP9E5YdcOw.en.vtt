hi<00:00:03.840> I'm<00:00:04.200> Wes<00:00:04.529> Crawford<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.339> now<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:06.060> we<00:00:06.210> have

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
hi I'm Wes Crawford and now that we have

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.530 
hi I'm Wes Crawford and now that we have
our<00:00:06.569> head<00:00:07.170> on<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.470> drum<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.280> we've<00:00:08.910> tightened

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
our head on a drum and we've tightened

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.990 
our head on a drum and we've tightened
it<00:00:09.660> up<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:10.139> want<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.440> actually<00:00:10.830> find<00:00:11.580> out<00:00:11.790> if

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
it up we want to actually find out if

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.289 
it up we want to actually find out if
the<00:00:12.179> head<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.870> tune<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.349> itself<00:00:13.469> and

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
the head is in tune with itself and

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.820 
the head is in tune with itself and
basically<00:00:15.299> we're<00:00:15.690> finding<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.260> did<00:00:16.590> we

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
basically we're finding out did we

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.640 
basically we're finding out did we
actually<00:00:17.359> tighten<00:00:18.359> all<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.600> lugs<00:00:18.990> equally

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
actually tighten all the lugs equally

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.679 
actually tighten all the lugs equally
because<00:00:20.070> if<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.430> did<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.240> sound<00:00:21.449> in

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
because if we did it's going to sound in

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.230 
because if we did it's going to sound in
tune<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.080> itself<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.340> way<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:24.210> this

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
tune with itself and the way we do this

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.650 
tune with itself and the way we do this
is<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.680> create<00:00:26.340> somewhat<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> nodal

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
is we can create somewhat of a nodal

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.120 
is we can create somewhat of a nodal
point<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.910> drum<00:00:30.240> by<00:00:31.050> pressing<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:31.980> an

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
point on the drum by pressing in with an

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
point on the drum by pressing in with an
equal<00:00:32.489> amount<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.880> tension<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
equal amount of tension right in the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.069 
equal amount of tension right in the
center<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> drum<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:36.059> helps<00:00:36.600> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
center of the drum and this helps to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
center of the drum and this helps to
keep<00:00:37.290> different<00:00:37.649> parts<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> head<00:00:38.640> from

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
keep different parts of the head from

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
keep different parts of the head from
vibrating<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.750> much<00:00:40.100> when<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> strike<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
vibrating as much when you strike a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.119 
vibrating as much when you strike a
different<00:00:42.930> part<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> head<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.649> instance

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
different part of the head for instance

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340 
different part of the head for instance
if<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.700> want<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> listen<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> sound<00:00:46.020> right

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
if I want to listen to the sound right

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
if I want to listen to the sound right
here<00:00:46.680> next<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.309> lug<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.000> going

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
here next to this lug and I'm going

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.360 
here next to this lug and I'm going
about<00:00:48.539> an<00:00:48.780> inch<00:00:49.140> into<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.100> drum<00:00:50.340> head<00:00:52.370> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
about an inch into the drum head it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
about an inch into the drum head it
helps<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.879> keep<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.210> other<00:00:54.930> side<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> drum

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
helps to keep the other side of the drum

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.560 
helps to keep the other side of the drum
from<00:00:55.710> vibrating<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.460> much<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.910> you're<00:00:57.059> hearing

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
from vibrating as much so you're hearing

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.510 
from vibrating as much so you're hearing
a<00:00:57.600> little<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.199> truly<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.309> sounding

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
a little more truly what it's sounding

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.960 
a little more truly what it's sounding
like<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.549> test

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
like right here and then we can test

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
like right here and then we can test
opposite<00:01:06.689> sides<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.880> drum<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.689> how

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
opposite sides of the drum and see how

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
opposite sides of the drum and see how
they<00:01:10.200> compare<00:01:16.280> then<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.430> make<00:01:17.610> adjustments<00:01:18.240> as

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
they compare then we make adjustments as

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.609 
they compare then we make adjustments as
necessary<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:19.200> felt<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.130> needed<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:21.619> adjust

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
necessary I felt that I needed to adjust

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.830 
necessary I felt that I needed to adjust
particularly<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.759> lug<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> little

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
particularly this lug make it a little

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.860 
particularly this lug make it a little
tighter<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.409> higher

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:39.850 

I<00:01:37.360> felt<00:01:38.360> these<00:01:38.510> are<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:38.780> little<00:01:38.900> higher<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.740> I'll

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
I felt these are a little higher so I'll

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:54.340 
I felt these are a little higher so I'll
actually<00:01:40.160> loosen<00:01:40.730> them<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.880> little<00:01:41.090> bit<00:01:53.350> and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
actually loosen them a little bit and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.250 
actually loosen them a little bit and
again<00:01:54.710> what<00:01:55.370> we're<00:01:55.520> listening<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:56.120> is<00:01:56.390> not<00:01:56.990> so

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
again what we're listening to is not so

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.460 
again what we're listening to is not so
much<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:58.460> tone<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.810> drum<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.320> we're

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
much the tone of the drum but we're

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.870 
much the tone of the drum but we're
listening<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.800> these<00:02:00.860> overtones<00:02:01.640> these

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
listening to these overtones these

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.290 
listening to these overtones these
little<00:02:02.150> high<00:02:02.330> rings<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.170> sometimes<00:02:04.130> they<00:02:05.030> are

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
little high rings and sometimes they are

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.410 
little high rings and sometimes they are
a<00:02:05.420> better<00:02:05.660> indicator<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.590> how<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.640> tune<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.330> is

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
a better indicator of how in tune it is

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.170 
a better indicator of how in tune it is
with<00:02:08.660> itself<00:02:09.250> because<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.700> don't<00:02:10.910> want<00:02:11.090> to

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
with itself because you don't want to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.330 
with itself because you don't want to
hit<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.510> different<00:02:11.990> areas<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.890> drum<00:02:13.160> and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
hit on different areas of the drum and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.130 
hit on different areas of the drum and
get<00:02:13.550> different<00:02:13.730> sounds<00:02:14.360> if<00:02:14.510> you're<00:02:14.930> like

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
get different sounds if you're like

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:26.970 
get different sounds if you're like
equally<00:02:15.770> away<00:02:16.220> from<00:02:16.520> far<00:02:17.060> away<00:02:17.090> from<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.780> edge

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.440 

again<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.190> need<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.520> back<00:02:28.730> these<00:02:28.910> off<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.180> little

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
again I need to back these off a little

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:47.410 
again I need to back these off a little
bit<00:02:45.160> that's<00:02:46.160> what<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.459> snares<00:02:46.790> off<00:02:47.060> we're

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
bit that's what the snares off we're

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.120 
bit that's what the snares off we're
doing<00:02:47.660> all<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.170> with<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> snares<00:02:48.830> off

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
doing all of this with the snares off

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.600 
doing all of this with the snares off
that<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.450> snare<00:02:50.750> wires<00:02:51.350> are<00:02:51.739> not<00:02:52.010> touching

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
that is the snare wires are not touching

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.490 
that is the snare wires are not touching
the<00:02:52.730> bottom<00:02:52.880> head<00:02:53.270> so<00:02:53.690> we<00:02:53.780> can<00:02:53.959> hear<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.170> tone

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
the bottom head so we can hear the tone

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.040 
the bottom head so we can hear the tone
better<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.550> not<00:02:55.730> get<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.420> interference<00:02:56.959> of

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
better and not get the interference of

the snares back on we can see what it
sounds<00:03:04.520> like<00:03:04.550> when<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:07.100> tune<00:03:07.340> all<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.880> your
