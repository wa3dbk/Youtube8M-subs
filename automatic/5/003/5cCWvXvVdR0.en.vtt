00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
draw and suck and draw and you don't

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.510 
draw and suck and draw and you don't
have<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.869> do<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.140> thing<00:01:47.890> with<00:01:48.010> your<00:01:48.130> eyebrows

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
have to do the thing with your eyebrows

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.039 
have to do the thing with your eyebrows
when<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.119> do<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.270> don't<00:01:49.420> know<00:01:49.570> why<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:49.780> did<00:01:50.020> that

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
when you do I don't know why I did that

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.969 
when you do I don't know why I did that
anyway<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.220> draw<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:52.090> note<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.110> bend<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.799> is

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
anyway so to draw a note and bend it is

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:06.590 
anyway so to draw a note and bend it is
the<00:01:54.310> easiest<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.810> floor

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.580 

and<00:02:07.600> I'll<00:02:07.689> turn<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.080> side<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.470> can

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
and I'll turn to the side so you can

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.190 
and I'll turn to the side so you can
kind<00:02:08.769> of<00:02:08.800> see<00:02:08.979> what<00:02:09.099> my<00:02:09.250> jaw<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.569> neck<00:02:10.660> and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
kind of see what my jaw and neck and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:26.670 
kind of see what my jaw and neck and
face<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.709> doing<00:02:11.860> while<00:02:12.129> I'm<00:02:12.220> doing<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:25.680> so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
face is doing while I'm doing it so

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.120 
face is doing while I'm doing it so
that's<00:02:27.430> bending<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.120> note<00:02:28.299> when<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.840> make<00:02:28.989> that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:44.330 

when<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.190> make<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.489> sound<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.760> on<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.970> five

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.850 

so<00:02:45.810> that's<00:02:46.810> basically<00:02:47.170> how<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.379> bend<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.680> note

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
so that's basically how to bend a note

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.800 
so that's basically how to bend a note
and<00:02:48.040> it's<00:02:48.370> easier<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.910> lower<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
and it's easier on the lower on the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:09.240 
and it's easier on the lower on the
lower<00:02:49.989> notes<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:53.110> two<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.470> anyway

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
lower notes so the one the two so anyway

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.340 
lower notes so the one the two so anyway
and<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.269> heard<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.630> hit<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.870> couple<00:03:11.260> of

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
and you you heard that I hit a couple of

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.379 
and you you heard that I hit a couple of
the<00:03:11.560> notes<00:03:12.010> on<00:03:12.250> accident<00:03:12.730> more<00:03:13.120> than<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.299> know

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
the notes on accident more than you know

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.870 
the notes on accident more than you know
more<00:03:13.630> than<00:03:13.750> one<00:03:13.930> note<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:15.370> know<00:03:15.459> occasionally

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
more than one note you know occasionally

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.610 
more than one note you know occasionally
you'll<00:03:16.000> do<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.269> but<00:03:16.599> what's<00:03:17.200> nice<00:03:17.349> about<00:03:17.380> the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
you'll do that but what's nice about the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.140 
you'll do that but what's nice about the
harmonica<00:03:18.099> is<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.900> um<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.819> mean<00:03:21.819> it<00:03:21.910> doesn't

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
harmonica is that um I mean it doesn't

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.729 
harmonica is that um I mean it doesn't
you<00:03:22.359> know<00:03:22.450> doesn't<00:03:22.630> make<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:22.989> huge<00:03:23.290> difference

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
you know doesn't make a huge difference

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.009 
you know doesn't make a huge difference
in<00:03:24.310> some<00:03:24.880> songs<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.359> mean<00:03:25.389> some<00:03:25.630> songs<00:03:25.840> it's

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
in some songs I mean some songs it's
