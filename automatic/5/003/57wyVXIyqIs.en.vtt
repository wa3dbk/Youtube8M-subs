00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
out to get proper nutrition so we can

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.820 
out to get proper nutrition so we can
look<00:02:39.970> our<00:02:40.180> best<00:02:40.330> feel<00:02:40.900> our<00:02:41.140> best<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.680> our

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
best now you know when you go through

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.940 
best now you know when you go through
the<00:02:43.600> drive-thru<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.230> get<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.440> milkshake<00:02:44.830> in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
the drive-thru and get the milkshake in

the drive-thru and get the milkshake in
the<00:02:45.010> burger<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.400> fries<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.850> don't<00:02:46.360> feel

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the burger and the fries you don't feel

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.630 
the burger and the fries you don't feel
your<00:02:47.050> best<00:02:47.260> after<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.800> it's<00:02:47.920> impossible<00:02:48.130> you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
your best after that it's impossible you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.670 
your best after that it's impossible you
feel<00:02:48.790> disgusting<00:02:49.360> feel<00:02:49.510> all<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.260> Third's<00:02:50.530> you

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
feel disgusting feel all the Third's you

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.070 
feel disgusting feel all the Third's you
can<00:02:50.800> bloated<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.310> gross<00:02:52.200> okay<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.910> one<00:02:55.660> one

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
can bloated and gross okay so one one

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.199 
can bloated and gross okay so one one
other<00:02:56.230> thing<00:02:56.410> we<00:02:56.500> need<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.709> understand<00:02:57.190> it's<00:02:58.120> a

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
other thing we need to understand it's a

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.320 
other thing we need to understand it's a
law<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.540> thermodynamics<00:02:59.410> okay<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.330> that's

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
law of thermodynamics okay and that's

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.360 
law of thermodynamics okay and that's
just<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.570> fancy<00:03:01.780> way<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.080> saying<00:03:02.230> energy<00:03:03.190> is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
just a fancy way of saying energy is

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.740 
just a fancy way of saying energy is
energy<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.880> there's<00:03:04.030> two<00:03:04.180> things<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.480> can<00:03:04.630> do

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
energy and there's two things you can do

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.220 
energy and there's two things you can do
with<00:03:04.900> it

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
with it

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.250 
with it
what<00:03:05.920> are<00:03:06.100> they<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:07.270> can<00:03:07.420> store<00:03:07.720> energy<00:03:07.930> for

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
what are they you can store energy for

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.460 
what are they you can store energy for
later<00:03:08.410> or<00:03:08.800> you<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.550> burn<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.320> only

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
later or you can burn it it's the only

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.720 
later or you can burn it it's the only
thing<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.739> can<00:03:11.830> do<00:03:11.920> with<00:03:12.010> energy<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.489> doesn't

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
thing you can do with energy it doesn't

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.790 
thing you can do with energy it doesn't
matter<00:03:12.850> if<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:14.290> know<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.440> piece<00:03:14.650> of

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
matter if it's you know a piece of

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.900 
matter if it's you know a piece of
firewood<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.489> log<00:03:16.239> or<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:17.640> gallon<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.730> gasoline

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
firewood a log or a gallon of gasoline

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.770 
firewood a log or a gallon of gasoline
energy<00:03:19.810> can<00:03:19.989> be<00:03:20.110> stored<00:03:20.170> or<00:03:20.739> burned<00:03:21.750> for<00:03:22.750> fuel

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
energy can be stored or burned for fuel

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.320 
energy can be stored or burned for fuel
okay<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.690> eat<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.019> calorie

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
okay so you eat a calorie

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.150 
okay so you eat a calorie
you're<00:03:27.870> either<00:03:28.080> going<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.350> burn<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.740> calorie

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
there's a very specific way of doing

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.800 
there's a very specific way of doing
that<00:04:16.770> so<00:04:17.010> we're<00:04:17.430> not<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.580> getting<00:04:18.360> bigger<00:04:18.540> to

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
that so we're not just getting bigger to

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.479 
that so we're not just getting bigger to
get<00:04:18.959> bigger<00:04:19.230> we're<00:04:19.650> getting<00:04:19.950> bigger<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.220> we

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
get bigger we're getting bigger so we

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.430 
get bigger we're getting bigger so we
build<00:04:21.180> muscle<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.840> achieve<00:04:22.080> our<00:04:22.200> ideal

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
build muscle and achieve our ideal

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.380 
build muscle and achieve our ideal
physique<00:04:22.590> same<00:04:23.460> thing<00:04:23.670> if<00:04:23.820> you're<00:04:23.940> maybe<00:04:24.180> too

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
physique same thing if you're maybe too

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.760 
physique same thing if you're maybe too
big<00:04:24.420> right<00:04:24.870> now<00:04:24.900> you're<00:04:25.170> too<00:04:25.320> heavy<00:04:25.500> you're

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
big right now you're too heavy you're

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.970 
big right now you're too heavy you're
fat<00:04:25.980> you<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:27.650> cellulite<00:04:28.650> going<00:04:28.860> on

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
fat you have that cellulite going on

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.760 
fat you have that cellulite going on
then<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.730> need<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.090> burn<00:04:31.820> fat<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.090> get

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
then you need to burn fat and get

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.590 
then you need to burn fat and get
lighter<00:04:34.770> become<00:04:35.460> lighter<00:04:35.760> be<00:04:36.030> fit<00:04:36.210> fast<00:04:36.390> and

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
lighter become lighter be fit fast and

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.420 
lighter become lighter be fit fast and
strong<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.990> lighter<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:38.160> there's<00:04:38.340> different
