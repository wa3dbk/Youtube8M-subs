00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.260
 NADA - For clean performance. 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.960
 The World Anti-Doping Code (WADC) 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.640
 is a uniform set of rules 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.240
 and serves to harmonize 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.160
 the anti-doping work worldwide. 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.440
 This was first introduced in 2003 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.880
 and is considered one of the most important milestones 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880
 for fair and clean sport. 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 The National Anti-Doping Code (NADC) 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 is the Germany-wide implementation based 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.960
 the WADA code 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.480
 and was first published in 2004. 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.020
 To meet current requirements, 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.740
 became the anti-doping code for 2015 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.460
 fundamentally revised. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.300
 The future rules are fair, 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.080
 more flexible, sharper and leaner. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.760
 One of the most important changes 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.540
 is the insertion of new prohibitions in Article 2. 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.600
 With article 2.9 will be available immediately 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 the offense as a violation 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.760
 against anti-doping regulations. 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.200
 A professional or athletic handling 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 with an athlete coach, 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.020
 the self a violation 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.440
 has committed against anti-doping rules, 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.340
 is prohibited under the new article 2.10 from 2015. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.040
 In addition, Article 2.4 has been amended, 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.460
 that three reporting and control failures 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.460
 within 12 months 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460
 lead to a violation. 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.120
 And not as before within 18 months. 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.380
 The new WADA code contains a new standard 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.860
 for investigative and intelligence work 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.160
 That means the investigation 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.960
 and investigations into potential doping violations 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.900
 even without a positive analysis result 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.500
 strengthened and unified internationally. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.160
 The NADA will be starting in 2015 all competition controls 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
 take over the German associations. 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.360
 As regulated in Article 5.2.3. 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.640
 The aim is a uniform control system 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 of training and competition controls 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.300
 reach in Germany. 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.720
 In the new rules 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.580
 the sanction system was tightened. 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.400
 In case of intentional violation 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.040
 against anti-doping regulations 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.220
 applies a rule block of 4 years. 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.180
 The under certain circumstances of the case 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.920
 can be reduced. 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.240
 In coordination with WADA, NADA is in place 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.380
 the possibility through so-called leniency 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.380
 at timely and comprehensive 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.140
 Confession of the athlete 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.340
 set a reduction of the lock. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.760
 If the offense is confessed in advance, 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.600
 may vary depending on the nature and extent of doping abuse 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 a shortened procedure. 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.260
 A publication of the sanctions 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.980
 is a mandatory part of the procedure from 2015 onwards. 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.320
 In addition, the limitation period has changed 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.920
 Article 17 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.740
 In the future, this will be extended from 8 to 10 years. 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.720
 The protection of minors was strengthened. 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 A publication of sanctions 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180
 for minors is not mandatory. 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.100
 Likewise, special athletes are friendly 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.100
 Requirements for the proof of fault 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.580
 for minors. 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.120
 Privacy is still 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120
 an important topic of NADA. 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.380
 Personal data of athletes 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.740
 be based on the national 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.660
 and European data protection laws, 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.900
 inter alia, the Federal Data Protection Act, 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.380
 for organization and implementation 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.080
 used by controls. 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.960
 The NADA CODE is the legal basis 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.960
 for a fair sport in Germany. 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.820
 For clean athletes, transparent success 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.540
 and honest results. 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.840
 NADA - 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.620
 For clean performance 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.720
