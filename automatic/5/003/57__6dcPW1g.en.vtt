00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.260 

okay<00:00:03.360> so<00:00:03.419> we'll<00:00:03.750> do<00:00:03.929> just<00:00:03.959> general<00:00:04.770> summary<00:00:05.759> of

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
okay so we'll do just general summary of

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.060 
okay so we'll do just general summary of
stuff<00:00:07.099> when<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.490> what<00:00:08.970> kind<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.300> formula

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
stuff when to you what kind of formula

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:20.260 
stuff when to you what kind of formula
okay<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.130> one<00:00:11.790> category<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:13.849> combined<00:00:17.840> gas<00:00:18.840> law

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
okay so one category is combined gas law

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.140 
okay so one category is combined gas law
and<00:00:21.500> that's<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.800> p1<00:00:23.430> p1<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.699> goes<00:00:27.000> for

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and that's the p1 p1 and this goes for

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.090 
and that's the p1 p1 and this goes for
charles<00:00:27.630> law<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> bottners<00:00:28.769> law<00:00:29.869> example

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.979 

this<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.550> when<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.750> particular<00:00:37.500> gas

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
this is when you have one particular gas

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.470 
this is when you have one particular gas
changing<00:00:39.989> states<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:41.520> volume<00:00:41.969> changes

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
changing states the volume changes

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080 
changing states the volume changes
volume<00:00:43.170> pressure<00:00:43.440> moles<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:44.280> temperature<00:00:44.850> or

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
volume pressure moles or temperature or

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
volume pressure moles or temperature or
a<00:00:45.600> combination<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.280> four<00:00:47.780> change<00:00:49.399> one<00:00:50.399> of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
a combination of all four change one of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.220 
a combination of all four change one of
them<00:00:50.700> you're<00:00:50.879> asked<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.449> plus<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> rest

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
them you're asked about plus the rest

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.369 
them you're asked about plus the rest
they<00:00:52.530> give<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> numerical<00:00:53.690> changes<00:00:54.690> okay<00:00:55.320> so

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
they give you numerical changes okay so

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:07.280 
they give you numerical changes okay so
this<00:00:55.649> has<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.100> change<00:00:57.500> ideal<00:00:58.500> gas<00:00:58.710> law

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.090 

this<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:09.120> use<00:01:11.900> whenever<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.560> again

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
this one you use whenever you have again

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.090 
this one you use whenever you have again
one<00:01:14.430> gas<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:16.260> can<00:01:16.410> use<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.710> two<00:01:16.920> different

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
one gas you can use in two different

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.250 
one gas you can use in two different
cases<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.790> easier<00:01:18.180> type<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.870> when<00:01:19.050> you<00:01:19.110> have

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
cases the easier type is when you have

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.960 
cases the easier type is when you have
one<00:01:19.290> particular<00:01:19.620> gas<00:01:20.870> there<00:01:21.870> could<00:01:22.260> be

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
one particular gas there could be

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.790 
one particular gas there could be
variations<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.480> it<00:01:24.510> but<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.230> density<00:01:25.650> or

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
variations on it but with the density or

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.980 
variations on it but with the density or
the<00:01:26.070> molar<00:01:26.280> mass<00:01:26.580> being<00:01:27.030> involved<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the molar mass being involved in the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.440 
the molar mass being involved in the
problem<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.430> density<00:01:29.910> and<00:01:30.060> molar<00:01:30.210> mass

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
problem and the density and molar mass

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
problem and the density and molar mass
are<00:01:30.690> hidden<00:01:31.050> inside<00:01:31.850> moles<00:01:32.850> usually<00:01:34.460> but

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
are hidden inside moles usually but

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.590 
are hidden inside moles usually but
otherwise<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:35.940> straightforward<00:01:36.180> but

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
otherwise that's straightforward but

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.770 
otherwise that's straightforward but
this<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:37.050> often<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.970> want<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> say<00:01:39.540> always

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
this can often all I want to say always

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.740 
this can often all I want to say always
but<00:01:39.990> often<00:01:40.680> appears<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.250> dolts<00:01:41.640> lot<00:01:41.850> kind<00:01:42.690> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
but often appears in dolts lot kind of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.650 
but often appears in dolts lot kind of
questions<00:01:43.490> okay<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> variation<00:01:45.150> on<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.510> the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
questions okay a variation on this the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.410 
questions okay a variation on this the
real<00:01:45.930> gas<00:01:49.340> we're<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.580> not<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.210> do

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
real gas we're really not going to do

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.710 
real gas we're really not going to do
calculations<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.710> real<00:01:52.890> gas<00:01:53.540> this<00:01:54.540> is

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
calculations with the real gas this is

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
calculations with the real gas this is
more<00:01:54.990> conceptual<00:01:55.760> so<00:01:56.760> know<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.240> difference

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
more conceptual so know the difference

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.290 
more conceptual so know the difference
between<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.200> real<00:01:58.530> gas<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.040> ideal<00:01:59.340> gas<00:01:59.550> the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
between a real gas and ideal gas the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.030 
between a real gas and ideal gas the
most<00:02:00.600> common<00:02:01.110> though<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.650> could<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
most common though you could have a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.240 
most common though you could have a
calculation<00:02:02.720> you've<00:02:03.720> seen<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.800> previous

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
calculation you've seen or on a previous

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.150 
calculation you've seen or on a previous
test<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.760> calculation<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:07.130> with<00:02:08.130> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
test a on a calculation like this with a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.310 
test a on a calculation like this with a
compressibility<00:02:08.940> factor<00:02:09.570> for<00:02:09.780> ideal<00:02:10.080> gases

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
compressibility factor for ideal gases

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.910 
compressibility factor for ideal gases
one<00:02:10.860> or<00:02:11.190> close<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.150> had<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.530> gave

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
one or close to one I had I gave

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.180 
one or close to one I had I gave
everybody<00:02:14.280> PV<00:02:15.120> N<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.630> T<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.080> had<00:02:16.890> them

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
everybody PV N and T and had them

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.780 
everybody PV N and T and had them
calculate<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.770> ask<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.010> asked<00:02:20.340> them<00:02:20.430> if<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.700> was

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
calculate and ask I asked them if it was

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.729 
calculate and ask I asked them if it was
a<00:02:20.820> real<00:02:21.060> gas<00:02:21.270> or<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.380> they<00:02:22.500> had<00:02:22.650> to

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
a real gas or not and so they had to

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.910 
a real gas or not and so they had to
calculate<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:24.080> compressibility<00:02:25.080> factor<00:02:25.590> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
calculate a compressibility factor and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.920 
calculate a compressibility factor and
if<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.160> didn't<00:02:26.489> get<00:02:26.930> one<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.890> was<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> real<00:02:29.250> gas

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
if they didn't get one it was a real gas

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.140 
if they didn't get one it was a real gas
so<00:02:31.100> that's<00:02:32.100> really<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> only<00:02:32.459> calculation

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
so that's really the only calculation

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.940 
so that's really the only calculation
otherwise<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.989> happens<00:02:34.380> at<00:02:35.510> high<00:02:36.510> pressure<00:02:36.950> or

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
otherwise it happens at high pressure or

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.130 
otherwise it happens at high pressure or
very<00:02:38.370> low<00:02:38.550> temperatures<00:02:40.010> or<00:02:41.010> both

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.290 

better<00:02:44.950> if<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.080> one<00:02:47.080> means<00:02:47.440> ideal<00:02:47.830> not<00:02:48.820> one

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
better if it's one means ideal not one

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.350 
better if it's one means ideal not one
means<00:02:49.990> real<00:02:50.290> or<00:02:50.710> not<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.160> do<00:02:51.510> okay<00:02:54.150> okay<00:02:55.150> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
means real or not I do okay okay the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.120 
means real or not I do okay okay the
other<00:02:55.570> whole<00:02:56.020> stop<00:02:56.380> they<00:02:56.620> stop<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.070> is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
other whole stop they stop so this is

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.510 
other whole stop they stop so this is
mixtures<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:00.940> gases<00:03:01.890> it's<00:03:02.890> usually<00:03:03.130> pretty

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
mixtures of gases it's usually pretty

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.800 
mixtures of gases it's usually pretty
obvious<00:03:03.610> because<00:03:04.120> there's<00:03:04.360> more<00:03:04.540> than<00:03:04.690> one

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
obvious because there's more than one

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.920 
obvious because there's more than one
guess<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:06.610> these<00:03:06.820> are<00:03:07.060> tough<00:03:07.300> because<00:03:07.570> we

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
guess but these are tough because we

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.550 
guess but these are tough because we
don't<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.490> chapter<00:03:09.850> we<00:03:10.240> rarely<00:03:10.600> say<00:03:11.170> what

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
don't in this chapter we rarely say what

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.199 
don't in this chapter we rarely say what
type<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.860> but<00:03:12.190> we<00:03:12.310> don't<00:03:12.580> say<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.880> word<00:03:13.060> like

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
type of but we don't say the word like

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.790 
type of but we don't say the word like
titration<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.140> know<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.470> titration

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
titration you know it's a titration

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.400 
titration you know it's a titration
problem<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:16.120> none<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.959> problems<00:03:17.290> are

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
problem so none of the problems are

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.580 
problem so none of the problems are
labeled<00:03:17.890> as<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.600> time<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:20.440> have

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
labeled as this is the time so you have

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.320 
labeled as this is the time so you have
to<00:03:20.709> be<00:03:20.800> in<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.010> out<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.790> here<00:03:22.000> we're<00:03:22.180> giving

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
to be in that out so here we're giving

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.650 
to be in that out so here we're giving
you<00:03:22.510> more<00:03:22.570> than<00:03:22.840> one<00:03:23.140> guess<00:03:24.090> so

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
you more than one guess so

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.110 
you more than one guess so
here<00:03:26.140> you're<00:03:26.380> gonna<00:03:26.560> use<00:03:26.920> like<00:03:27.730> for<00:03:28.030> example

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
here you're gonna use like for example

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.199 
here you're gonna use like for example
the<00:03:28.830> pulling<00:03:29.830> pressure<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.700> sum<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:30.970> the

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
the pulling pressure is the sum of the

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.510 
the pulling pressure is the sum of the
partial<00:03:31.450> pressures<00:03:31.959> or<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.440> total<00:03:32.800> holes<00:03:33.250> is

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
partial pressures or the total holes is

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.850 
partial pressures or the total holes is
the<00:03:33.640> sum<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:33.910> all<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.270> holes<00:03:34.450> or<00:03:35.080> occasionally

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
the sum of all the holes or occasionally

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.979 
the sum of all the holes or occasionally
but<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.130> say<00:03:36.489> rarely<00:03:37.060> you're<00:03:37.600> gonna<00:03:37.720> use<00:03:37.959> that

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
but I say rarely you're gonna use that

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.840 
but I say rarely you're gonna use that
the<00:03:38.290> total<00:03:38.590> bottoms<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.040> some<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.370> volumes

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
the total bottoms of some of the volumes

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.970 
the total bottoms of some of the volumes
and<00:03:40.290> then<00:03:42.270> after<00:03:43.270> that<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:44.320> know<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.860> the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
and then after that you know that the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.570 
and then after that you know that the
mole<00:03:45.190> fraction<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:48.390> partial<00:03:49.390> pressure<00:03:49.570> of<00:03:49.720> one

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
mole fraction is partial pressure of one

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.729 
mole fraction is partial pressure of one
the<00:03:51.580> one<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:52.000> bring<00:03:52.180> out<00:03:52.390> some<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.660> total<00:03:53.140> or

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
the one to bring out some the total or

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.259 
the one to bring out some the total or
the<00:03:54.190> moles<00:03:55.180> or<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.140> total<00:03:56.440> moles<00:03:56.940> or<00:03:57.940> the

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
the moles or the total moles or the

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.729 
the moles or the total moles or the
volume<00:03:58.840> over<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.560> total<00:03:59.769> volume<00:04:01.500> so<00:04:02.500> some

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
volume over the total volume so some

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.550 
volume over the total volume so some
combination<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.459> that<00:04:03.640> usually<00:04:04.420> this<00:04:04.660> part<00:04:05.049> is

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
combination of that usually this part is

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.009 
combination of that usually this part is
the<00:04:05.830> most<00:04:05.980> common<00:04:06.549> for<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:07.030> all<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.870> you

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
the most common for you all that you

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.699 
the most common for you all that you
would<00:04:08.140> use<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:08.700> then<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:09.910> also<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:11.350> ideal

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
would use and then this also the ideal

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.800 
would use and then this also the ideal
gas<00:04:11.950> for<00:04:12.280> good<00:04:12.459> measure<00:04:12.760> is<00:04:12.970> thrown<00:04:13.299> into<00:04:13.540> a

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
gas for good measure is thrown into a

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.289 
gas for good measure is thrown into a
lot<00:04:14.049> of<00:04:14.080> these<00:04:14.380> kinds<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.010> questions<00:04:15.299> because

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
lot of these kinds of questions because

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.349 
lot of these kinds of questions because
sometimes<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:17.169> have<00:04:17.200> like<00:04:18.070> we<00:04:19.030> did<00:04:19.209> on<00:04:19.330> the

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
sometimes you have like we did on the

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.350 
sometimes you have like we did on the
previous<00:04:19.450> problem<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.440> R<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.280> T<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:22.240> we

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
previous problem and R and T but we

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.480 
previous problem and R and T but we
didn't<00:04:22.660> have<00:04:22.840> B<00:04:24.090> for<00:04:25.090> example<00:04:25.950> okay<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.220> that's

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
didn't have B for example okay so that's

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.799 
didn't have B for example okay so that's
another<00:04:27.760> type

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:33.809 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:37.259 

this<00:04:34.809> X<00:04:35.110> X<00:04:35.739> means<00:04:36.069> small<00:04:36.429> fraction<00:04:37.059> and

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:37.269 
this X X means small fraction and

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:39.959 
this X X means small fraction and
literally<00:04:38.259> it<00:04:38.379> goes<00:04:38.559> with<00:04:38.769> this<00:04:38.919> part<00:04:39.729> of<00:04:39.819> it

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
literally it goes with this part of it

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.499 
literally it goes with this part of it
the<00:04:40.779> moles<00:04:41.619> of<00:04:41.919> whatever<00:04:42.219> it<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:42.759> divided<00:04:43.479> by

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
the moles of whatever it is divided by

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.739 
the moles of whatever it is divided by
the<00:04:43.569> total<00:04:43.839> notes<00:04:44.639> but<00:04:45.639> all<00:04:45.849> those<00:04:46.179> are<00:04:46.449> equal

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:46.749 
the total notes but all those are equal

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:51.850 
the total notes but all those are equal
to<00:04:46.899> the<00:04:47.019> mole<00:04:47.229> fraction

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860

for Graham's law bans lock has property
let's<00:05:16.560> say<00:05:16.770> gas<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.360> divided<00:05:18.360> by<00:05:18.390> property<00:05:19.290> of

let's say gas a divided by property of
gas<00:05:20.280> B<00:05:20.870> equals<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:21.990> inverse<00:05:22.290> of<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.280> molar

gas B equals the inverse of the molar

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.510 
gas B equals the inverse of the molar
masses<00:05:27.380> so<00:05:28.380> that<00:05:28.560> could<00:05:28.740> be<00:05:28.860> like<00:05:29.070> distance

that would work too and it could be time
but<00:05:43.350> times<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.980> one<00:05:44.250> of<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.910> four<00:05:45.210> properties

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
but times the one of the four properties

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.170 
but times the one of the four properties
here<00:05:46.350> that<00:05:47.010> does<00:05:47.250> not<00:05:47.400> import<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.000> molar

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
here that does not import the molar

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.620 
here that does not import the molar
masses

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630

that's<00:05:49.590> you'll<00:05:50.040> need<00:05:50.250> to<00:05:50.340> remember<00:05:50.610> that

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
that's you'll need to remember that

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.170 
that's you'll need to remember that
yourself<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:52.550> distinguish<00:05:53.550> between<00:05:53.730> these

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
yourself so distinguish between these

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.760 
yourself so distinguish between these
two<00:05:54.570> this<00:05:55.380> will<00:05:55.710> have<00:05:57.020> it'll<00:05:58.020> usually<00:05:58.260> like

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
two this will have it'll usually like

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.280 
two this will have it'll usually like
give<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.220> both<00:05:59.490> molecules<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:00.690> then<00:06:01.080> give

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
give you both molecules and then give

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.470 
give you both molecules and then give
you<00:06:01.410> one<00:06:01.680> of<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:01.980> properties<00:06:02.550> where<00:06:03.450> a

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
dalton's law will be more like it'll

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.820 
dalton's law will be more like it'll
give<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:05.550> like<00:06:05.760> a<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:06.090> smattering<00:06:06.630> of<00:06:07.140> random

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
give you like a a smattering of random

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.300 
give you like a a smattering of random

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
stuff the of de Mestral okay so that's

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.810 
stuff the of de Mestral okay so that's
that<00:06:11.910> one<00:06:12.440> we've<00:06:13.440> also<00:06:13.620> got<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.460> root<00:06:14.640> mean

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
that one we've also got the root mean

need to keep the correct units so M

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.540

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
your team needs to be in Kelvin okay so

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.790 
your team needs to be in Kelvin okay so
that<00:06:53.630> one<00:06:53.810> if<00:06:53.990> you<00:06:54.080> see<00:06:54.230> root<00:06:54.410> mean<00:06:54.560> square

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
that one if you see root mean square

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.950 
that one if you see root mean square
velocity<00:06:54.920> that's<00:06:55.400> all<00:06:55.550> you<00:06:55.640> got<00:06:55.820> and<00:06:56.270> then<00:06:56.810> the

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
velocity that's all you got and then the

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.860 
velocity that's all you got and then the
last<00:06:57.170> kinetic<00:06:57.800> energy<00:06:58.220> or<00:06:58.670> maybe<00:06:58.940> there<00:06:59.780> might

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
last kinetic energy or maybe there might

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.490 
last kinetic energy or maybe there might
be<00:06:59.930> more<00:07:00.200> but<00:07:00.440> right<00:07:00.710> now<00:07:00.830> kinetic<00:07:01.280> energy<00:07:02.500> so

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
be more but right now kinetic energy so

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.700 
be more but right now kinetic energy so
P<00:07:04.070> sub<00:07:04.400> K<00:07:04.700> is<00:07:05.060> one<00:07:05.930> half<00:07:06.200> mu<00:07:07.300> squared<00:07:08.300> or<00:07:09.020> three

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
P sub K is one half mu squared or three

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.440 
P sub K is one half mu squared or three
halves<00:07:09.980> are<00:07:10.970> T<00:07:12.520> so<00:07:13.520> there's<00:07:13.640> two<00:07:13.880> equations

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
halves are T so there's two equations

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.250 
halves are T so there's two equations
for<00:07:14.690> the<00:07:14.810> kinetic<00:07:15.230> energy<00:07:16.870> just<00:07:17.870> depend<00:07:18.200> on

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
for the kinetic energy just depend on

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.880 
for the kinetic energy just depend on
what<00:07:18.470> you're<00:07:18.650> given<00:07:19.070> and<00:07:19.960> really<00:07:20.960> if<00:07:21.470> you<00:07:21.680> put

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
what you're given and really if you put

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.220 
what you're given and really if you put
these<00:07:22.010> two<00:07:22.360> equations<00:07:23.360> together<00:07:23.630> and<00:07:23.900> solve

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
these two equations together and solve

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.290 
these two equations together and solve
for<00:07:24.320> u<00:07:24.680> that's<00:07:25.640> where<00:07:25.910> this<00:07:26.120> one<00:07:26.390> comes<00:07:26.660> from

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.300 
for u that's where this one comes from

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.070 
for u that's where this one comes from
so<00:07:29.470> here<00:07:30.470> again<00:07:30.620> you<00:07:30.830> need<00:07:31.160> to<00:07:31.340> use<00:07:31.520> for<00:07:31.760> M

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
so here again you need to use for M

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.640 
so here again you need to use for M
kilograms<00:07:33.080> per<00:07:33.530> mole<00:07:34.750> something<00:07:35.750> M<00:07:35.900> is<00:07:36.380> really

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:36.650 
kilograms per mole something M is really

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.430 
kilograms per mole something M is really
is<00:07:37.070> we<00:07:37.760> label<00:07:38.120> it<00:07:38.210> mass<00:07:38.570> here<00:07:38.900> but<00:07:39.110> really<00:07:39.260> the

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 
is we label it mass here but really the

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.860 
is we label it mass here but really the
molar<00:07:39.710> mass<00:07:42.400> all<00:07:43.400> these<00:07:44.120> ours<00:07:44.860> here<00:07:45.860> are

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:46.870 
molar mass all these ours here are

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.950 
molar mass all these ours here are

00:07:59.440 --> 00:07:59.450 

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.000 

okay<00:08:00.450> let's<00:08:00.600> see<00:08:00.810> if<00:08:00.870> there's<00:08:01.080> anything<00:08:01.740> else

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.010 
okay let's see if there's anything else

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.220 
okay let's see if there's anything else
that<00:08:02.100> kind<00:08:02.400> of<00:08:02.460> sticks<00:08:02.640> out

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.230 
that kind of sticks out

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.140 
that kind of sticks out
otherwise<00:08:04.230> I'd<00:08:04.530> say<00:08:04.710> most<00:08:05.070> other<00:08:05.490> equations

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.150 
otherwise I'd say most other equations

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.560 
otherwise I'd say most other equations
are<00:08:06.390> conceptual<00:08:07.290> in<00:08:07.410> this<00:08:07.560> chapter<00:08:08.330> said<00:08:09.330> okay

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:09.570 
are conceptual in this chapter said okay

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.760 
are conceptual in this chapter said okay
is<00:08:10.410> that<00:08:10.470> the<00:08:10.710> summary<00:08:11.010> look<00:08:11.280> important
