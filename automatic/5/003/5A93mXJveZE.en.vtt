00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.470
 for a while 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.780
 but no 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.310
 what fart people how are you waiting for 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.440
 you are very well I am crisis 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.390
 well here I bring you one more glitch to 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.150
 that they can have infinite money in the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.220
 gta 5 multiplayer in gta 5 online 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.200
 rather said and very good this eclipse 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.119
 it is very easy to do it is very simple 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.680
 as long as you follow the steps that you 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.660
 show in the video why they put 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.280
 lots of attention and good to be able 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.500
 doing this lis is going to need two things 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.780
 the first would be a garage and the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.850
 second would be to buy an expensive car that 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.170
 buy the most expensive car they can or 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.700
 that they can even use the car 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.350
 free that they give grains a bill of 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.490
 rockstar ok well then the first thing 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.560
 we will have to be in the 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.390
 campaign than in the normal campaign what 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.130
 let's go to pause we're going to 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.230
 departure and we will save a new 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.580
 departure that we are going to keep it so that 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.320
 do not lose your game since we are going to 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.420
 create a new game that we give to 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.400
 new game this is not going to take away the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.200
 campaign that we would have as long as 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.549
 they have saved before what 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.350
 they did keep it going to replace it 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.180
 but what are we going to do and create a 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.590
 new than when in the kinematics 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.810
 this from the beginning what we have would be 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.840
 give pause we go again to gta 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.090
 online we give you to play gta online and we 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.890
 let's session by invitation ok this is 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.409
 very important that they do it session 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.420
 since this can not be done this does not work 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.920
 if we do it in multiplayer or if 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.900
 we do with some friends this not only 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.940
 It has to be in session by invitation or 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.530
 good solo once 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.360
 we have appeared on the map does not matter 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.130
 where in your garage or in your car we 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.410
 we're going to come to the many custom that's 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.479
 found near michael's house 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.280
 the pgje to the saints just though 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.930
 found here by house near the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.659
 michael's house exactly here where 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.729
 I'm showing on the map it's nothing 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.320
 easy to lose and good what we will have 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.020
 What would it be like to come with our vehicle? 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.210
 parked near the saints likes and 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.979
 we are going to break we go to gta online 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.840
 we go to options and here is very 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.180
 important that they give rise to 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.009
 last location ok this is very 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.479
 important because without this the cliche does not 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.830
 it works so I recommend that you 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.450
 Do this 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.340
 ok rather I do not recommend what they have 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.050
 to do that once doing this what 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.220
 that they would have to look for a car or 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.750
 that we were going to look for any car 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.310
 any car that is out there even 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.440
 can grab the one that is seasonal 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.970
 parked next ok why do I go to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.769
 to do with this car would be to crash what 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.080
 there is to break the glass is this 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.489
 I would be ready to crash the threads 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.030
 street roman shock it as not 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.190
 they hurt you 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.930
 and once we have it crashed we 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.750
 let's go to the righteous saints and what 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.340
 Let him go right now that is very 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.140
 important so put a lot 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.790
 Attention what you are going to say here 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.250
 repair vehicle sell or what are we going to 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.260
 give twice to sell we go to pause 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.239
 without selling what we are going we give it elevate 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.940
 twice there he will send us to what 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.800
 would be the live xbox store that here 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.110
 This is going to send us to the store and 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.910
 let's give that the option of I see you 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.130
 let's give cancel we do not want to buy 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.560
 nothing that certainly can not be 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.330
 now that once we come back giving him 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.860
 go to the option that the store is going to 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.750
 bring what would be our car to 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.370
 new that we're going to do again what 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.019
 same that we are going to give him to sell 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.280
 vehicles without selling it until it 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.530
 leave the option of insurance that you want 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.040
 sell your vehicle and we do the same to you 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.510
 we give pause we raise it twice there 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.830
 will send us to the store once 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.739
 bring us to the store we are going to give 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.120
 once they have not tried to squeeze more 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.310
 buttons just the ones that I am 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.709
 saying they squeeze him once he sees and he's going 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.600
 to return ok now he will not return 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.280
 to the vehicle that we had inside the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.019
 custom saints will now return us to 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.180
 vehicle that we had left outside ok 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.730
 that would be our vehicle because the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.200
 super 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.959
 but whoever you have chosen 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.610
 that here is the important here here what 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.000
 what you will have to do if you do not send them the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.379
 this one that they have left outside 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.060
 repeat everything that repeats the process and 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.950
 ready to see if it comes back to them very 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.720
 good once they got them their 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.760
 car that have appeared in your car 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.260
 we are going to put them to the righteous saints and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.299
 as we see it lets us sell our 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.040
 137,000 vehicle that's too much 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.870
 then what we are going to see would be what 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.090
 same but this time if we are going to sell it 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.260
 ok we sell it once it does not come out 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.810
 We will give the sold option 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.420
 start we will give you the eve and we will 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.879
 give twice to ok to send us to 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.260
 the ebooks store the ok here what 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.269
 We're going to be the same we give 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.340
 back so that he does not return to what 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.049
 it would be our car but now we are going to 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.209
 appear with the same option to sell 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.210
 ok so let's do the same thing what 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.039
 we sell we give start lb twice there 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.979
 we go to the store and so on 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.199
 we would be winning for an hour five 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.490
 million dollars ok this already depends 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.530
 how much time do they want to do 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.820
 you can continue like this 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.289
 Sometimes they want until you 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.789
 they want they can be here 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.130
 selling your cars without losing it 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.500
 obviously they will not lose it and good 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.870
 they will be making money 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.520
 and I know it's kind of hard to have a 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.860
 garage at the beginning I know it's something 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.540
 difficult to have a car at first but 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.010
 for that is the free car that they give 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.750
 for creating a rockstar account 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.910
 belief a rockstar account are they 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.940
 they're going to give a free car it's called I chose 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.440
 rh8 I think I think it's called nothing else 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.080
 of the account and they will be free 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.820
 tunnel or on issues what tunnel are they going to 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.140
 give equal money the bugatti if you have 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.850
 the bugatti if they have any other 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.220
 car tunnel or to the maximum to give them 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.630
 a lot of money is always always and 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.390
 When they have an expensive car they are going to 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.190
 give that money and well then this 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.660
 it would be practically everything she knows 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.850
 give me a like if you liked this video 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.230
 If you have any doubt leave it ends in 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.060

 in another video until the next goodbye
