00:00:02.173 --> 00:00:07.603
 Good evening! Today's SportKlub will start with Espanyol, and then they will not talk. 

00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:15.589
 Like I said, thanks to the draw of Espanyol Barça won the league! 

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:28.080
 Bernat, painting your face in Barça's colors is not appropriate. 

00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:31.525
 You're right, I should be more objective. 

00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:35.031
 For what, everyone knows that we are for Barca. 

00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:37.981
 Such paints badly affect the complexion. 

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:43.429
 For Barça, you can. It's the 22nd Barça league. 22! 

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:49.870
 How about Rambla? 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:58.029
 Okay, okay, good. There were many people on Canaletes, but not as many as in recent years. 

00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.037
 Ej Xavi, who is this? 

00:01:01.037 --> 00:01:06.830
 Xavi Pascual, Barça basketball coach. They were now in Final Four. 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.720
 And what is the Final Four? 

00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:12.867
 Euroleague final. 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.348
 And what is Euroliga? 

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:21.468
 Champions League in basketball. If you do not speak to him after football, it will not overcome. 

00:01:21.953 --> 00:01:23.712
 And what, what, you won? 

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:27.599
 We lost in the semi-final with Madrid. 

00:01:28.094 --> 00:01:32.109
 Oh, I'm sorry. Well, it's just a basket and nobody cares. 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.634
 It's impudence! Nobody says about basketball in this program or what ?! 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.670
 Hamuj, Michael Jordan TV3 talks about me. 

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.900
 For my good ripples ... balls too. 

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:51.950
 I have information, they told me that your line-up is already old. 

00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:54.990
 And more! Navarrodependencia! 

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:58.550
 And that they do not listen to you with such a voice! 

00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:00.030
 And how do we talk about celebrating Barça? 

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:02.190
 Damn right! We have not spoken about football for a long time 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.270
 We're connecting with Barça's coach, let's see what the champions are doing. 

00:02:09.146 --> 00:02:13.860
 We stop the transmission to show the message of a dangerous kidnapper who imprisoned three hostages. 

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:23.680
 Some call me a journalist. 

00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:28.040
 I prefer them to call me "master." 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.680
 Here are the three candidates for the title of the Catalan of the Year! 

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:37.670
 But this is not Catalans of the Year! 

00:02:37.673 --> 00:02:39.870
 The Catalan of the Year is me! 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.830
 I mean, I'm not Catalan of the Year, I'm better, but I should not be. 

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:49.520
 In any case, I would rather say that I am not one. 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:57.150
 That's why I demand that I still feel the Catalan of the Year! Okay, I demand that I do not feel that way. 

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:06.270
 And if you do not meet my demands, they will listen to all my transmissions. 

00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:30.650
 Do you understand what he wants? To be a Catalan of the Year or not? 

00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:31.980
 That he would not feel him. 

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:33.480
 But now it is or is not it? 

00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:35.360
 And what now? We call the clay? 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.960
 Yes, calmly. But it's better to watch the celebration first. 

00:03:53.488 --> 00:03:56.380
 We can celebrate the title, eh? 

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:03.000
 We're on top! Further! Boldly flexing body! 

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:05.520
 Let me die, I'm going to give it up soon. 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.130
 If you left a year ago, we would have Reina, he tells the Germans jokes. 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.020
 I fit. I'm going. 

00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:14.840
 You are the captain! 

00:04:14.842 --> 00:04:16.570
 Do not go, I will not wear a wristband! 

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:19.040
 Guys, they're shouting at us! 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.760
 And no, it's for footballers ... 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.000
 You were not supposed to go? 

00:04:32.997 --> 00:04:35.430
 Sure, to the bar after the brewers. 

00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:37.480
 Beer!!!!
