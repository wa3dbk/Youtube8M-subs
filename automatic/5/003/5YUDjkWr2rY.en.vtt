and<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.780> don't<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.800> two

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and what you don't like there are two

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.490 
and what you don't like there are two
three-week<00:00:56.760> programs<00:00:57.239> intensive<00:00:58.109> both<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
three-week programs intensive both of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
three-week programs intensive both of
them<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.399> you're<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> student<00:00:59.850> who's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
them so if you're a student who's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
them so if you're a student who's
interested<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.960> biology<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.609> take

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
interested in biology you can take

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.460 
interested in biology you can take
explorations<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.809> genetics<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.379> molecular

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
explorations in genetics and molecular

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.469 
explorations in genetics and molecular
biology<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> next

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
biology for one and then for the next

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
biology for one and then for the next
one<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.229> might<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> take<00:01:07.860> environmental

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
one you might want to take environmental

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.359 
one you might want to take environmental
biology<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:10.049> you're<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> person<00:01:10.920> who<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
biology if you're a person who is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.280 
biology if you're a person who is
interested<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.000> biology<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:12.900> you're

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
interested in biology but also you're

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.950 
interested in biology but also you're
interested<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.770> law<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> could<00:01:15.479> take<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
interested in law so you could take a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
interested in law so you could take a
class<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.560> biology<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> next

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
class in biology and then the next

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.060 
class in biology and then the next
session<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.600> could<00:01:18.780> take<00:01:18.990> trial<00:01:19.530> advocacy

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
session you could take trial advocacy

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.910 
session you could take trial advocacy
for<00:01:20.400> instance

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.800 

this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.219> trial<00:01:26.520> advocacy<00:01:27.000> section<00:01:27.600> of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
this is the trial advocacy section of

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.139 
this is the trial advocacy section of
the<00:01:28.350> leadership<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.039> law<00:01:29.159> program<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:30.060> high

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
the leadership and law program for high

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.389 
the leadership and law program for high
school<00:01:30.180> students<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.470> great<00:01:31.860> opportunity

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
school students it's great opportunity

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.850 
school students it's great opportunity
because<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.450> students<00:01:33.960> after<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.500> take<00:01:34.740> my

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
because the students after they take my

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
because the students after they take my
course<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.880> quite<00:01:36.179> well<00:01:36.420> whether<00:01:36.810> they

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
course they know quite well whether they

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
course they know quite well whether they
want<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.320> into<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.649> field<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.189> law<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
want to go into the field of law or in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.669 
want to go into the field of law or in
particular<00:01:39.509> trial<00:01:39.929> work<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.560> they've

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
particular trial work because they've

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.520 
particular trial work because they've
done<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.130> seen<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.610> they<00:01:42.409> experienced<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
done it and seen it they experienced it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
done it and seen it they experienced it
they<00:01:43.679> lived<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.069> its<00:01:44.490> eye<00:01:44.759> opening<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.899> really

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
they lived in its eye opening it really

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.520 
they lived in its eye opening it really
is<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:47.009> fact<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.530> lecture

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
is the fact that it's not just lecture

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.050 
is the fact that it's not just lecture
