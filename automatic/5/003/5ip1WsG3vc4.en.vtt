00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
 Yup 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.059
 welcome to our cooking service with us 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:17.539
 today we show you how to pinch the instamapper fish we start with fish 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.909
 d but a single portion a sole 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:24.199
 and let's see how to achieve it 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.509
 first we take a knife 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.919
 a clip 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.419
 or even a fork can work 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.419
 so let's proceed to take our heads off 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.300
 mymovie I love the seal that helps us work in the eyes and then smooth it 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 the side plugs 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.990
 for good 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 therefore also on the other side 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.010
 once removed 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.120
 whore the thorn of this part and on the other side 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.750
 we put the knife opinel knife between the blame 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.820
 and the plug at the top 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.470
 moving 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 in this way we try to detach 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.470
 the meat from 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.610
 plug 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.720
 with the help 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.420
 the knife in the market we hope the fillet 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 on the clean plate 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.690
 then we remove 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.690
 the plug 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.860
 we have another that read 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.260
 that we arrange it on the plate 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.550
 so as to reconstruct 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.510
 the fish 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.510
 let's arrange lemon 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 we can use one of these decorations 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.210
 so let's finish 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.770
 placing 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 the contour 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:19.349
 so let's settle 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.939
 now I put marjoram 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.939
 en I studied is ready to be served 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.689
 and a fairly simple operation to carry out 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.669
 is 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.089
 that's all for today 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:38.479
 from the space kitchen service with us see you at the next weather
