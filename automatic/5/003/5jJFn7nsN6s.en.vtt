00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
got when I got my bike so what I did was

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.280 
got when I got my bike so what I did was
I<00:00:34.470> put<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.920> two<00:00:35.250> mounts<00:00:35.970> one<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> front

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I put on two mounts one in the front

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.709 
I put on two mounts one in the front
here<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.880> top<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:41.719> i'm

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
here then one on the top here and i'm

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.330 
here then one on the top here and i'm
using<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> j-hook<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.940> camera<00:00:45.809> housing

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
using the j-hook on the camera housing

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.880 
using the j-hook on the camera housing
so<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.489> way<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:48.059> put<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:49.140> way<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
so this way I can put it this way to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
so this way I can put it this way to
film<00:00:50.129> forward<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.969> adjust<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:54.270> angle<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
film forward and adjust it the angle and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.910 
film forward and adjust it the angle and
I<00:00:56.010> could<00:00:56.190> also<00:00:57.199> do<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.649> for

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
I could also do it this way for

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.270 
I could also do it this way for
recording<00:00:59.550> our<00:00:59.820> rearview<00:01:00.750> shots<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:02.129> that's

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
showy until a few weeks later and I

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.889 
showy until a few weeks later and I
wasn't<00:01:59.099> going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.249> wait<00:01:59.459> and<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.539> was<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
wasn't going to wait and this was the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.399 
wasn't going to wait and this was the
only<00:02:00.959> one<00:02:01.319> pretty<00:02:01.859> much<00:02:02.359> that<00:02:03.359> they<00:02:03.509> had<00:02:03.719> for

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
only one pretty much that they had for

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.389 
only one pretty much that they had for
the<00:02:04.829> size<00:02:06.079> everything<00:02:07.079> else<00:02:07.259> was<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.619> large

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the size everything else was like large

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.969 
the size everything else was like large
or<00:02:08.640> extra<00:02:08.909> large<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> only<00:02:10.649> one

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
or extra large so this was the only one

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.460 
or extra large so this was the only one
that<00:02:11.009> was<00:02:11.370> decent<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.599> got<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that was decent so I got it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.660 
that was decent so I got it
I<00:02:15.080> don't<00:02:16.080> recommend<00:02:16.350> getting<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.860> G<00:02:17.010> max<00:02:17.220> there

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.620 
I don't recommend getting a G max there
I<00:02:19.070> mean<00:02:20.070> it's<00:02:20.250> decent<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.360> would<00:02:24.360> recommend
