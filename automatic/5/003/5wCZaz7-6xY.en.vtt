00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 and let's go with the third super 4 then 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.680
 white hair invested dark type 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.480
 I know like a dark type of something 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 such 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.490
 so who can we use anyone 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:33.180
 we moved super effective no 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:36.950
 absolutely no no hello lucia dark lady 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.629
 ok use pokémon of the right kind 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.340
 we even have to fight type moves that 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.710
 bad luck and on the other is equal to terry is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.969
 equal to terry ie part with aun doom 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.230
 that also the fire type therefore I would have 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.879
 could make a choice to follow 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.350
 best 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.660
 I want a little try to outrage them 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.670
 I would like to try to do some ko un 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.149
 I don't know if I will succeed, though 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.149
 I try 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.600
 we are well placed 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.160
 now it will certainly merge 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.610
 acritica bed I do it now before no 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.770
 to that 66 for perfect dragon knight 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.830
 now he uses waste as well as type 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.060
 fight if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 no it is not even and also of a fight type 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.200
 right 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.380
 I do n't remember if we go back a 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.790
 outrage we are already confused therefore a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.950
 outrage is worth the other we can 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:48.870
 stick level 70 scraps to rock club 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.390
 it would be rock scale that exceeds effective 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.780
 rightly they all attack please 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:01.670
 make it stick perfect and out too 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.670
 waste no like how he managed to resist 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 I don't believe it, I don't want to believe it 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.149
 here obviously uses full restore 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.149
 before attacking us more subdued store 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.750
 born of confusion we are outrage 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.049
 but that maybe it makes it be 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.360
 however, he immediately confuses that you are sorry 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.159
 for language, however, there is when there 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.930
 wants it takes 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.230
 here even night died for 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.230
 suicide 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.750
 then we use blind but it won't be 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.750
 much 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.810
 we use charis hard one of our two 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.860
 orange dragons we go with dragon clou 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.600
 among other things, it is also delayed 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.150
 traconf end tool that enhances the 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:59.650
 dragon-type moves and therefore bad not 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.300
 go ko perfect but is good at 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 face of the dragon we come to him 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.040
 doing nothing practically from there 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.110
 also sends here but we change pokémon 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.700
 absolutely we send to tears that 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:22.500
 finally makes his debut in the league 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.500
 pokémon we use thunderbolt 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.440
 savona too perfect 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.569
 shadows on against umbre is not that we can 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.060
 send back charis hart dyke but the 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:52.090
 bad presentiment that will go ko da 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:52.090
 with 53 ps level 70 we use a flight 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.819
 booms from fouls plus mum possible damage 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.230
 my 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:07.310
 that's all and all this 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.310
 I sincerely expected more 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:18.590
 let's make a bit of strength, well, the stub 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.759
 already much better 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.889
 by not going ko force by you can do it 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:29.520
 send ko but so the fury does not know 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:33.240
 store gets perfect last pokémon 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.889
 let's see who it is upson should 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.889
 also be above as stronger then 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.550
 level 71 ok let's do staff and then 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.039
 we go with dignity ko for which will go 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.340
 to end up certainly so oh my god a 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:56.400
 fire aid help on fire man not me 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.690
 I expected him to do so 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.970
 I expected merit to be quite a lot 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.800
 because we are at the red life helping fire 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.099
 and all not 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.099
 Oh my God 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.300
 fantastic looks fantastic 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.420
 ok and in the next part we will do 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.420
 the last super 4 then to later
