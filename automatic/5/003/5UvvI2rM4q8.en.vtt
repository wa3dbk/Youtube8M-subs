00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 the whole world is a stage and everyone 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.069
 men and women we are actors with 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.110
 our outputs and our income a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.190
 man in the course of life interprets 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.039
 many parts 7 ages divided into seven 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 acts first the child with his 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.580
 verses that drools in the arms of the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.939
 motor then the whimpering pupil with 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.000
 his books and the face numbed by 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.540
 morning dragging you listless like 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.750
 a snail to school then 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.510
 the lover who sighs like one 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.649
 furnace the sad ballad composed for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.870
 the eyebrow of the beloved woman 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.140
 then comes the soldier with his own 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 bizarre mustached curses like a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.460
 leopard jealous of his impulsive honor 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.329
 and ready to fight in search of a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 ephemeral reputation even in the mouth 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.210
 of a cannon then the judge from the beauty 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 round belly filled with fat capons 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.490
 with a stern eye and a good beard 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.979
 cured spitting wise utter banality 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.420
 which he considers modern and he also reads 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.590
 his sixth age part transforms you 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.860
 in a weak and sleepy pants 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.130
 with his glasses on a nose 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.650
 bag by his pants when he was 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.220
 young and well preserved but now too much 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.790
 wide for his withered legs and the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.840
 nice male stamp of the regressed voice 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.020
 to a childish little voice falsetti e 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:58.189
 the high-pitched sounds coming out of your mouth 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.189
 the last scene then at the bottom of this 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:08.420
 strange and long story is one 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.420
 second childhood complete oblivion 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:19.010
 without teeth without eyes without taste 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.209
 without nothing
