this is decree 100 watt replacement LED
bulb<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> bigger<00:00:11.969> brighter<00:00:12.389> bulb<00:00:12.780> than

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
bulb this is a bigger brighter bulb than

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.720 
bulb this is a bigger brighter bulb than
anything<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.380> Cree<00:00:13.559> has<00:00:13.679> done<00:00:13.860> before<00:00:14.009> with

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
anything that Cree has done before with

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.450 
anything that Cree has done before with
1600<00:00:15.540> lumens<00:00:15.690> worth<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.199> light<00:00:16.410> output<00:00:16.650> now<00:00:17.340> it

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
1600 lumens worth of light output now it

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.760 
1600 lumens worth of light output now it
gets<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.820> from<00:00:18.060> 18<00:00:18.600> Watts<00:00:18.900> giving<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> very

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
gets that from 18 Watts giving it a very

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.320 
gets that from 18 Watts giving it a very
impressive<00:00:20.130> efficiency<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.970> eighty<00:00:21.150> eight

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
impressive efficiency of eighty eight

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.840 
impressive efficiency of eighty eight
point<00:00:21.570> eight<00:00:21.779> eight<00:00:22.140> lumens<00:00:22.800> per<00:00:22.890> watt<00:00:23.070> that's

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
point eight eight lumens per watt that's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.120 
point eight eight lumens per watt that's
great<00:00:24.539> that's<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.930> very<00:00:25.170> efficient<00:00:25.680> bulb<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
great that's a very efficient bulb and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.529 
great that's a very efficient bulb and
that's<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:26.880> good<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.359> Cree<00:00:27.510> has

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that's just as good as what Cree has

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.120 
that's just as good as what Cree has
done<00:00:27.810> before<00:00:27.930> meaning<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.830> might<00:00:29.010> be

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
done before meaning that this might be

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
done before meaning that this might be
destined<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.849> get<00:00:30.000> Energy<00:00:30.390> Star<00:00:30.599> certified

destined to get Energy Star certified

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170 
destined to get Energy Star certified
it's<00:00:31.529> not<00:00:31.830> there<00:00:32.099> yet<00:00:32.309> though<00:00:32.550> now<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.120> you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
it's not there yet though now if you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.490 
it's not there yet though now if you
take<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> look<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> bulb<00:00:34.020> you'll<00:00:34.170> see<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
take a look at this bulb you'll see that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.440 
take a look at this bulb you'll see that
it<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.649> noticeably<00:00:35.610> bigger<00:00:35.910> than<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it is noticeably bigger than the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.540 
it is noticeably bigger than the
previous<00:00:36.870> generation<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.410> Cree<00:00:37.620> bulbs<00:00:37.950> here

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
previous generation of Cree bulbs here

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.310 
previous generation of Cree bulbs here
it<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.760> next<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> 60<00:00:39.600> watt<00:00:39.719> replacement

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it is next to the 60 watt replacement

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.959 
it is next to the 60 watt replacement
LED<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.770> Cree<00:00:40.980> put<00:00:41.160> out<00:00:41.280> about<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> year<00:00:41.700> ago

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
LED that Cree put out about a year ago

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
LED that Cree put out about a year ago
you'll<00:00:42.600> see<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> bulb<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> lot<00:00:43.710> bigger

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you'll see that the bulb is a lot bigger

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.920 
you'll see that the bulb is a lot bigger
but<00:00:44.340> also<00:00:44.640> those<00:00:44.969> heat<00:00:45.239> sinks<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> lot

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
but also those heat sinks are a lot

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.799 
but also those heat sinks are a lot
bigger<00:00:46.170> dissipating<00:00:46.829> quite<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> bit<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.430> heat

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
bigger dissipating quite a bit more heat

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.910 
bigger dissipating quite a bit more heat
all<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.110> let's<00:00:49.260> turn<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> lights<00:00:49.710> out

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
all right so let's turn the lights out

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160 
all right so let's turn the lights out
and<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.219> our<00:00:50.340> light<00:00:50.550> box<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:51.090> here's<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> 60

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
and get our light box out here's the 60

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.779 
and get our light box out here's the 60

in the middle is the 75 watt replacement

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.439 
in the middle is the 75 watt replacement
that<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.190> put<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.760> couple<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.149> months<00:00:57.360> ago

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that they put out a couple of months ago

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.360 
that they put out a couple of months ago
and<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.129> the

and here on the right we have the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.860 
and here on the right we have the
hundred<00:00:59.730> watt<00:00:59.850> replacement<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.719> see

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
hundred watt replacement and you can see

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.869 
hundred watt replacement and you can see
a<00:01:00.899> pretty<00:01:01.199> clear<00:01:01.739> growth<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> light

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
a pretty clear growth in the light

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.570 
a pretty clear growth in the light
output<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.449> got<00:01:03.629> 800<00:01:04.379> lumens<00:01:04.500> than<00:01:04.949> 1,100

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
output it's got 800 lumens than 1,100

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210 
output it's got 800 lumens than 1,100
lumens<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.439> 1600<00:01:07.439> lumens<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.979> see

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
lumens and then 1600 lumens you can see

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.340 
lumens and then 1600 lumens you can see
that<00:01:08.400> difference<00:01:08.880> you'll<00:01:09.270> also<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that difference you'll also see that

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.280 
that difference you'll also see that
there<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.770> slightly<00:01:11.340> less<00:01:12.150> yellowy<00:01:12.689> tone<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
there is a slightly less yellowy tone to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
there is a slightly less yellowy tone to
the<00:01:13.380> hundred<00:01:13.650> watt<00:01:13.799> replacement<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> has<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the hundred watt replacement it has the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.640 
the hundred watt replacement it has the
same<00:01:15.360> color<00:01:15.659> temperature<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.470> two

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
same color temperature as these two

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.160 
same color temperature as these two
bulbs<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.280> 2700<00:01:18.210> K<00:01:18.390> low<00:01:18.780> end<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
bulbs are all 2700 K low end of the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.770 
bulbs are all 2700 K low end of the
spectrum<00:01:19.409> kind<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.310> warm<00:01:20.610> tone<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.450> because

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
spectrum kind of warm tone but because

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
spectrum kind of warm tone but because
of<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.960> extra<00:01:22.259> brightness<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.070> yellow<00:01:23.369> enos

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
of that extra brightness the yellow enos

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.219 
of that extra brightness the yellow enos
doesn't<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.210> come<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.509> quite<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.780> much<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
doesn't really come out quite so much it

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.310 
doesn't really come out quite so much it
looks<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:25.830> neutral<00:01:26.430> tone<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.820> light

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
looks like a more neutral tone of light

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
looks like a more neutral tone of light
so<00:01:28.320> let's<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.740> 75<00:01:29.340> watt<00:01:29.549> replacement

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so let's get that 75 watt replacement

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.340 
so let's get that 75 watt replacement
out<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.240> there<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> replace<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
out of there and replace it with the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.980 
out of there and replace it with the
Philips<00:01:31.829> 100<00:01:32.520> watt<00:01:32.670> replacement<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
Philips 100 watt replacement this is a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
Philips 100 watt replacement this is a
very<00:01:34.320> comparable<00:01:34.770> bulb<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:35.460> Cree<00:01:35.670> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
very comparable bulb to what Cree is
