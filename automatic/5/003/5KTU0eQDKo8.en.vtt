in this video we're going to talk about

why<00:00:08.970> Federer<00:00:09.480> beat<00:00:10.170> murray<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.010> handily<00:00:11.580> why

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
why Federer beat murray so handily why

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.759 
why Federer beat murray so handily why
this<00:00:11.880> match<00:00:12.330> wasn't<00:00:12.719> nearly<00:00:13.019> as<00:00:13.170> close<00:00:13.530> as

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
this match wasn't nearly as close as

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.410 
this match wasn't nearly as close as
many<00:00:14.219> expected<00:00:19.609> in<00:00:20.609> my<00:00:20.670> preview<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.270> this

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
many expected in my preview to this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.599 
many expected in my preview to this
match<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.960> said<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.560> Murray<00:00:22.769> had<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.250> three

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
match I said that Murray had to do three

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.580 
match I said that Murray had to do three
things<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.180> have<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> chance<00:00:24.689> at<00:00:24.900> winning<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
things to have a chance at winning to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.009 
things to have a chance at winning to
have<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.740> chance<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.070> beating<00:00:26.279> Roger<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
have a chance at beating Roger and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.060 
have a chance at beating Roger and
unfortunately<00:00:28.019> for<00:00:28.170> him<00:00:28.289> he<00:00:28.439> didn't<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.800> any

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
unfortunately for him he didn't do any

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.830 
unfortunately for him he didn't do any
one<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.429> those<00:00:29.609> three<00:00:29.970> things<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.510> that's<00:00:30.630> one

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
one of those three things and that's one

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
one of those three things and that's one
of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.990> reasons<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.710> match<00:00:31.980> wasn't

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
of the reasons this match wasn't

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.310 
of the reasons this match wasn't
particularly<00:00:32.820> close<00:00:33.180> he<00:00:33.690> had<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> serve<00:00:34.079> well

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
particularly close he had to serve well

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
particularly close he had to serve well
he<00:00:34.770> had<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> return<00:00:35.219> well<00:00:35.520> he<00:00:36.090> had<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> apply

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
he had to return well he had to apply

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.119 
he had to return well he had to apply
constant<00:00:36.930> pressure<00:00:37.290> he<00:00:37.530> didn't<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.829> any<00:00:38.010> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
constant pressure he didn't do any of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
constant pressure he didn't do any of
those<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.210> let's<00:00:39.629> go<00:00:39.780> through<00:00:39.809> each

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
those so let's go through each

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.319 
those so let's go through each
particular<00:00:41.040> thing<00:00:41.790> we'll<00:00:41.969> start<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
particular thing we'll start with the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.779 
particular thing we'll start with the
serve<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> entire<00:00:44.070> match<00:00:44.340> he<00:00:44.520> served

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
serve and for the entire match he served

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.200 
serve and for the entire match he served
57%<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.960> his<00:00:46.170> first<00:00:46.410> serve<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.879> number

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
57% on his first serve and this number

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.760 
57% on his first serve and this number
is<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> little<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.289> skewed

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
is a little bit a little bit skewed

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.220 
is a little bit a little bit skewed
because<00:00:50.399> his<00:00:51.090> sword<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.420> much<00:00:51.719> better<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
because his sword was much better in the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
because his sword was much better in the
third<00:00:52.500> set<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> first<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
third set but in the first and the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
third set but in the first and the
second<00:00:54.360> set<00:00:54.570> his<00:00:54.989> percentage<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.680> way<00:00:55.920> down

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
second set his percentage was way down

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.790 
second set his percentage was way down
from<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.730> number<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.329> that's<00:00:57.930> why<00:00:58.230> Federer

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
from this number and that's why Federer

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.220 
from this number and that's why Federer
won<00:00:58.920> those<00:00:59.250> relatively<00:00:59.760> easily<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.600> by

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
won those relatively easily and then by

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.840 
won those relatively easily and then by
serving<00:01:01.530> better<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> third<00:01:02.340> set<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
serving better in the third set that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.570 
serving better in the third set that
pulled<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.480> number<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
pulled this number up but over the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820 
pulled this number up but over the
course<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.909> match<00:01:06.090> 57%<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> get

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
course of match 57% is not going to get

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.250 
course of match 57% is not going to get
it<00:01:07.950> done<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.119> first<00:01:09.299> serve<00:01:09.600> wasn't<00:01:10.049> there

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
it done so the first serve wasn't there

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.929 
it done so the first serve wasn't there
so<00:01:10.710> he<00:01:10.740> wasn't<00:01:10.979> winning<00:01:11.250> too<00:01:11.520> many<00:01:11.640> free

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
so he wasn't winning too many free

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.260 
so he wasn't winning too many free
points<00:01:12.360> off<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:13.140> shot<00:01:13.790> now<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> second

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
points off that shot now the second

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
points off that shot now the second
thing<00:01:15.299> McMurray<00:01:16.140> needed<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.770> well<00:01:16.979> was

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
thing McMurray needed to do well was

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.870 
thing McMurray needed to do well was
returned<00:01:18.030> well<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:19.159> here<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> return<00:01:20.640> he

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
returned well but here on the return he

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
returned well but here on the return he
only<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.299> thirty<00:01:21.990> two<00:01:22.290> percent<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:23.040> his

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
only one thirty two percent of his

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.240 
only one thirty two percent of his
return<00:01:24.090> points<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.840> let's<00:01:25.710> compare<00:01:26.040> this

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
return points and let's compare this

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.399 
return points and let's compare this
number<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.939> his<00:01:27.360> previous<00:01:27.869> rounds<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
number with his previous rounds in the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.039 
number with his previous rounds in the
semi<00:01:28.619> averse<00:01:28.860> chillage<00:01:29.579> he<00:01:29.970> won<00:01:30.119> 39<00:01:30.420> against<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
semi averse chillage he won 39 against a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
semi averse chillage he won 39 against a
doll<00:01:31.229> he<00:01:31.380> won<00:01:31.530> 44<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.340> against<00:01:32.850> isn't<00:01:33.180> her<00:01:33.240> he

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
doll he won 44 and against isn't her he

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.950 
doll he won 44 and against isn't her he
won<00:01:33.650> 42<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.430> these<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.759> obviously<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.299> solid

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
won 42 so these are obviously very solid

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.679 
won 42 so these are obviously very solid
numbers<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> her<00:01:38.909> first<00:01:39.150> serve<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
numbers here this is her first serve and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.719 
numbers here this is her first serve and
second<00:01:40.229> serve<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.189> there's<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> huge

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
second serve but then there's a huge

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.139 
second serve but then there's a huge
drop<00:01:42.060> off<00:01:42.470> against<00:01:43.470> Federer<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.939> that's

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
drop off against Federer so that's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850 
drop off against Federer so that's
obviously<00:01:45.329> one<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> reasons<00:01:46.290> he<00:01:46.470> didn't

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
obviously one of the reasons he didn't

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.770 
obviously one of the reasons he didn't
perform<00:01:47.040> particularly<00:01:47.700> well<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.600> these

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
perform particularly well now these

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.139 
perform particularly well now these
numbers<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.170> even<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.530> telling<00:01:49.829> when<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.970> go

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
numbers are even more telling when we go

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.850 
numbers are even more telling when we go
over<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.049> these<00:01:52.590> are<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
over here because these are the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.850 
over here because these are the
percentages<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:54.000> his<00:01:54.270> opponents<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.530> on

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
percentages that his opponents one on

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.620 
percentages that his opponents one on
their<00:01:56.759> second<00:01:57.390> serve<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.490> Federer<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.030> 61

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
their second serve and Federer was at 61

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.499 
their second serve and Federer was at 61
percent<00:02:00.990> he<00:02:01.079> won<00:02:01.200> 61<00:02:01.860> percent<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.399> his<00:02:03.030> second

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
percent he won 61 percent of his second

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
percent he won 61 percent of his second
serve<00:02:03.659> points<00:02:04.110> versus<00:02:05.100> 44<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.030> chillage<00:02:07.069> 42

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.479

for<00:02:08.520> Nadal<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.149> 29<00:02:09.690> which<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.080> pretty<00:02:10.200> amazing

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
for Nadal and 29 which is pretty amazing

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.940 
for Nadal and 29 which is pretty amazing
against<00:02:11.489> isn't<00:02:11.819> her<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.090> that's<00:02:12.720> why<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.020> 61

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
against isn't her and that's why the 61

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.550 
against isn't her and that's why the 61
gives<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.310> lull<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> Z<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.569> lols<00:02:15.780> because

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
gives the lull with a Z the lols because

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.320 
gives the lull with a Z the lols because
this<00:02:16.830> number<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.250> unbelievably<00:02:17.760> high<00:02:18.000> and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
this number is unbelievably high and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.770 
this number is unbelievably high and
this<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> huge<00:02:19.470> reason<00:02:19.709> why<00:02:20.330> Murray<00:02:21.330> had

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
this is a huge reason why Murray had

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.509 
this is a huge reason why Murray had
difficulty<00:02:22.470> getting<00:02:22.500> his<00:02:22.830> teeth<00:02:23.040> into<00:02:23.340> fed

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
difficulty getting his teeth into fed

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.949 
difficulty getting his teeth into fed
service<00:02:23.940> game<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.330> ultimately<00:02:24.660> one<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
service game and ultimately one of the

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.500 
service game and ultimately one of the
main<00:02:25.170> factors<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.800> why<00:02:26.340> he<00:02:26.550> lost<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.239> match

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
main factors and why he lost this match

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.620 
main factors and why he lost this match
now<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> final<00:02:28.830> element<00:02:29.099> pressure<00:02:29.819> well<00:02:30.599> I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
now the final element pressure well I

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.300 
now the final element pressure well I
said<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.170> previous<00:02:31.530> video<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.040> Murray

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
said in my previous video that Murray

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.309 
said in my previous video that Murray
had<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.580> apply<00:02:32.790> constant<00:02:33.420> pressure<00:02:33.810> over<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
had to apply constant pressure over the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.170 
had to apply constant pressure over the
course<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:35.010> match<00:02:35.220> he<00:02:35.640> could<00:02:35.819> do<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:35.940> by

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
course of a match he could do that by

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.270 
course of a match he could do that by
standing<00:02:36.569> up<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.930> taking<00:02:37.590> away<00:02:37.830> Federer's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
standing up and taking away Federer's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.630 
standing up and taking away Federer's
time<00:02:38.519> all<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> demidenko<00:02:39.380> he<00:02:40.380> could<00:02:40.709> take<00:02:41.370> big

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
time all I demidenko he could take big

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.910 
time all I demidenko he could take big
cuts<00:02:41.940> when<00:02:42.180> he<00:02:42.269> had<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> look<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.349> he<00:02:43.560> didn't<00:02:43.830> do

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
cuts when he had a look and he didn't do

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.059 
cuts when he had a look and he didn't do
that<00:02:44.099> either<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.319> what<00:02:46.319> did<00:02:46.560> start<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.890> happen

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
that either so what did start to happen

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.620 
that either so what did start to happen
in<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> third<00:02:47.610> set<00:02:47.849> was<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.209> had<00:02:48.360> Murray

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
in the third set was you had Murray

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.570 
in the third set was you had Murray
taking<00:02:49.049> bigger<00:02:49.260> shots<00:02:49.590> when<00:02:50.250> he<00:02:50.340> got<00:02:50.459> an

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
taking bigger shots when he got an

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.280 
taking bigger shots when he got an
opportunity<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.360> that's<00:02:51.480> what<00:02:51.720> narrowed<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
opportunity and that's what narrowed the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.350 
opportunity and that's what narrowed the
gap<00:02:52.319> there<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.040> gave<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.430> epic<00:02:53.760> third

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
gap there and gave you that epic third

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.870 
gap there and gave you that epic third
set<00:02:54.660> breaker<00:02:54.959> but<00:02:55.890> certainly<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.670> first

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
set breaker but certainly in the first

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.030 
set breaker but certainly in the first
two<00:02:57.060> sets<00:02:57.299> he<00:02:57.480> was<00:02:57.599> way<00:02:57.900> way<00:02:58.110> way<00:02:58.290> way<00:02:58.500> way<00:02:58.739> too

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
two sets he was way way way way way too

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.360 
two sets he was way way way way way too
passive<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.319> he<00:03:01.319> allowed<00:03:01.560> Federer<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.190> get

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
passive and he allowed Federer to get

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.449 
passive and he allowed Federer to get
into<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> groove<00:03:02.840> find<00:03:03.840> his<00:03:03.989> range<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.590> play

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
into a groove find his range and play

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.490 
into a groove find his range and play
obviously<00:03:06.150> at<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.329> high<00:03:06.480> level<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:07.290> he

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
obviously at the high level that he

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.100 
obviously at the high level that he
played<00:03:07.769> at<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.280> Murray<00:03:09.030> reverted<00:03:09.900> back<00:03:09.930> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
played at so Murray reverted back to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.800 
played at so Murray reverted back to
that<00:03:10.530> passive<00:03:11.069> style<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.579> sometimes<00:03:12.150> see<00:03:12.780> him

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that passive style we sometimes see him

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.900 
that passive style we sometimes see him
play<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.130> said<00:03:14.190> before<00:03:14.400> that's<00:03:14.730> not

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
play and like I said before that's not

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.490 
play and like I said before that's not
going<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.390> done<00:03:15.540> against<00:03:16.200> federer

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
going to get it done against federer

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.590 
going to get it done against federer
Federer<00:03:16.860> loses<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> guys<00:03:17.519> who<00:03:17.940> take<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.389> to

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
Federer loses the guys who take it to

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.599 
Federer loses the guys who take it to
him<00:03:18.750> some<00:03:19.049> way<00:03:19.200> who<00:03:19.350> apply<00:03:19.709> constant<00:03:20.250> pressure

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
him some way who apply constant pressure

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.780 
him some way who apply constant pressure
in<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.540> majors<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.160> beating<00:03:23.160> Federer<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.700> a

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
in the majors and beating Federer and a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.300 
in the majors and beating Federer and a
best-of-three<00:03:24.150> not<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.260> same<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.069> the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
best-of-three not the same the the the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.860 
best-of-three not the same the the the
passive<00:03:26.730> style<00:03:26.940> might<00:03:27.239> work<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.600> little<00:03:27.720> bit

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
passive style might work a little bit

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.590 
passive style might work a little bit
better<00:03:28.019> there<00:03:28.350> in<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.950> major<00:03:29.160> when<00:03:30.060> Federer<00:03:30.450> was

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
better there in a major when Federer was

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.300 
better there in a major when Federer was
really<00:03:30.989> locked<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.470> really<00:03:31.829> focused

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
really locked in really focused

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.039 
really locked in really focused
obviously<00:03:32.489> wants<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.180> win<00:03:33.359> more<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.870> than

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
obviously wants to win more so than

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.180 
obviously wants to win more so than
maybe<00:03:34.230> some<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.590> smaller<00:03:34.859> tournaments

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
maybe some of the smaller tournaments

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.759 
maybe some of the smaller tournaments
that's<00:03:36.030> not<00:03:36.299> going<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.600> get<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.840> done<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.590> wrap

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
that's not going to get it done to wrap
