put<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> good<00:01:52.380> front<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.159> know<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.520> had

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
put on a good front you know and I had

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.219 
put on a good front you know and I had
my<00:01:53.880> moments<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> had<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.780> times<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
my moments and I had my times when I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
my moments and I had my times when I
felt<00:01:55.469> a<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.710> better<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.219> most<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
felt a little better but most of the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240 
felt a little better but most of the
time<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.600> had<00:01:57.899> kind<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.469> downer<00:01:58.740> feeling

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
time I just had kind of a downer feeling

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580 
time I just had kind of a downer feeling
about<00:01:59.460> life<00:01:59.520> well<00:02:00.420> doing<00:02:00.960> energy<00:02:01.350> work

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
about life well doing energy work

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.819 
about life well doing energy work
changed<00:02:02.549> all<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.329> me<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.380> rescued

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
changed all of that for me and I rescued

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.660 
changed all of that for me and I rescued
both<00:02:05.039> six<00:02:05.610> years<00:02:05.880> ago<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:07.130> he's<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.460> been

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
both six years ago and he's just been

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.420 
both six years ago and he's just been
the<00:02:08.850> best<00:02:09.180> dog<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> world<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.770> he<00:02:11.009> ended

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the best dog in the world but he ended

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.520 
the best dog in the world but he ended
up<00:02:11.580> getting<00:02:11.880> diagnosed<00:02:12.480> with<00:02:12.660> cancer<00:02:12.870> about<00:02:13.350> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
up getting diagnosed with cancer about a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.020 
up getting diagnosed with cancer about a
year

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
year

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.070 
year
oh<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.750> began<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.290> real<00:02:15.620> intense<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:17.080> program

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
oh and I began a real intense a program

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.010 
oh and I began a real intense a program
of<00:02:18.380> doing<00:02:18.860> energy<00:02:19.069> work<00:02:19.550> on<00:02:19.790> him<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.209> the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
of doing energy work on him and the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.110 
of doing energy work on him and the
first<00:02:21.230> thing<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.530> happened<00:02:21.830> was<00:02:21.950> his<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.730> all

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
first thing that happened was his is all

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.180 
first thing that happened was his is all
of<00:02:23.360> his<00:02:23.510> indicators<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.260> cancer<00:02:24.650> disappeared

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
of his indicators of cancer disappeared

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.340 
of his indicators of cancer disappeared
from<00:02:25.280> his<00:02:25.459> blood<00:02:25.700> well<00:02:26.030> then<00:02:26.480> my<00:02:26.690> mom<00:02:26.900> got<00:02:27.140> sick

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
from his blood well then my mom got sick

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.559 
from his blood well then my mom got sick
on<00:02:27.530> top<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.400> really<00:02:29.300> put<00:02:29.450> my

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
on top of that so I really put my

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.330 
on top of that so I really put my
attention<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:30.170> her<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> little<00:02:30.680> bit<00:02:30.830> more<00:02:31.069> and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
attention on her a little bit more and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.910 
attention on her a little bit more and
he<00:02:31.790> got<00:02:31.970> sick<00:02:32.180> again<00:02:32.390> my<00:02:33.170> vet<00:02:33.410> usually<00:02:33.830> has

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
he got sick again my vet usually has

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.479 
he got sick again my vet usually has
given<00:02:34.220> him<00:02:34.340> days<00:02:34.610> two<00:02:35.470> weeks<00:02:36.470> maybe<00:02:36.890> she<00:02:37.280> says

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
given him days two weeks maybe she says

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.059 
given him days two weeks maybe she says
you<00:02:37.640> know<00:02:37.730> possibly<00:02:38.600> could<00:02:38.810> last<00:02:39.170> months<00:02:39.650> this

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
you know possibly could last months this

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
understand it he should not be here but

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.550 
understand it he should not be here but
you<00:02:49.910> know<00:02:50.060> she's<00:02:50.300> not<00:02:50.450> really<00:02:50.720> familiar<00:02:51.200> with

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
you know she's not really familiar with

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.740 
you know she's not really familiar with
energy<00:02:52.100> work<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.430> try<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.060> explain<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.720> little

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
energy work I try to explain it a little

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.930 
energy work I try to explain it a little
bit<00:02:54.019> but<00:02:54.200> it's<00:02:54.350> it's<00:02:54.769> such<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> wild<00:02:55.250> concept

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
bit but it's it's such a wild concept

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.790 
bit but it's it's such a wild concept
especially<00:02:56.180> for<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.720> lot<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:56.989> doctors<00:02:57.590> or

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
especially for a lot of doctors or

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.340 
especially for a lot of doctors or
veterinarians<00:02:58.580> but<00:02:59.269> you<00:02:59.810> know<00:02:59.930> our<00:03:00.050> bodies

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
veterinarians but you know our bodies

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.530 
veterinarians but you know our bodies
made<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.560> energy<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.340> I'm<00:03:01.760> able<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.360> energy

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
made of energy and I'm able to do energy

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.759 
made of energy and I'm able to do energy
work<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:04.870> basically<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.140> most<00:03:06.290> simple

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
work and and basically the most simple

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.220 
work and and basically the most simple
thing<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.360> found<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.200> just

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
thing that that I found is just

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.750 
thing that that I found is just
something<00:03:09.769> where<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:09.950> use<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> energy<00:03:10.580> from

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
something where you use the energy from

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.370 
something where you use the energy from
your<00:03:10.910> hands<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.450> direct<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.989> at<00:03:12.140> certain

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
your hands and direct it at certain

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.280 
your hands and direct it at certain
areas<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.580> works<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.180> heals<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.720> know<00:03:15.050> so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
because I saw such amazing results and I

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.500 
because I saw such amazing results and I
worked<00:03:42.799> with<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.310> lot<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.640> clients<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.180> their

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
worked with a lot of clients that their

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.210 
worked with a lot of clients that their
health<00:03:44.930> problems<00:03:45.140> just<00:03:45.560> disappear<00:03:46.190> because

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
health problems just disappear because

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.849 
health problems just disappear because
we're<00:03:47.030> changing<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.660> energy<00:03:48.109> system<00:03:48.560> we<00:03:48.680> run

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
we're changing the energy system we run

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.069 
we're changing the energy system we run
blocking<00:03:49.359> energy<00:03:50.359> we're<00:03:50.570> doing<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:50.900> lot<00:03:51.049> of

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
blocking energy we're doing a lot of

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.690 
blocking energy we're doing a lot of
things<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.590> just<00:03:51.829> allow<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.190> body<00:03:52.549> to

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
things that just allow the body to

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.970 
things that just allow the body to
function<00:03:53.239> as<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.570> as<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.750> should<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:54.709> once

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
function as it as it should but once

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.390 
function as it as it should but once
again<00:03:55.190> not<00:03:55.640> long<00:03:55.910> ago<00:03:56.120> bo<00:03:57.010> just<00:03:58.010> got<00:03:58.160> really

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
again not long ago bo just got really

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.539 
again not long ago bo just got really
sick<00:03:58.730> again<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.299> I<00:04:00.019> really<00:04:00.829> beefed<00:04:01.100> up<00:04:01.340> the

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
sick again and I really beefed up the

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.580 
sick again and I really beefed up the
amount<00:04:02.030> of<00:04:02.120> energy<00:04:02.510> work<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.840> was<00:04:02.989> doing<00:04:03.320> and

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
amount of energy work I was doing and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.430 
amount of energy work I was doing and
his<00:04:04.160> vet<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.850> know<00:04:04.940> my<00:04:05.090> vet<00:04:05.269> gave<00:04:05.480> him<00:04:05.690> you

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
his vet you know my vet gave him you

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.140 
his vet you know my vet gave him you
know<00:04:06.530> pretty<00:04:06.739> much<00:04:06.829> toward<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.549> weekend<00:04:07.970> she

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
know pretty much toward the weekend she

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.009 
know pretty much toward the weekend she
said<00:04:08.329> he's<00:04:08.450> either<00:04:08.570> going<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.780> do<00:04:08.989> a

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
said he's either going to do a

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.330 
said he's either going to do a
turnaround<00:04:09.320> know<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.859> know<00:04:09.920> of<00:04:10.010> course<00:04:10.130> I'd

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
turnaround know you know of course I'd

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.800 
turnaround know you know of course I'd
put<00:04:10.489> him<00:04:10.549> on<00:04:10.700> medication<00:04:10.850> I'll<00:04:11.390> do<00:04:11.540> anything

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
put him on medication I'll do anything

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.199 
put him on medication I'll do anything
that<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.560> can<00:04:12.890> but<00:04:13.130> it's<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.519> energy<00:04:13.970> more<00:04:14.150> than

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
that I can but it's the energy more than

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.390 
that I can but it's the energy more than
anything<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:14.900> like<00:04:14.959> she<00:04:15.230> says<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:16.100> medicine

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
anything and like she says that medicine

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.159 
anything and like she says that medicine
that<00:04:16.640> he's<00:04:16.789> been<00:04:16.970> on<00:04:17.090> should<00:04:17.479> never<00:04:17.840> have

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
that he's been on should never have

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.140 
that he's been on should never have
worked<00:04:18.410> as<00:04:18.680> long<00:04:18.919> she<00:04:19.220> doesn't<00:04:19.549> understand<00:04:20.000> it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
worked as long she doesn't understand it

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.810 
worked as long she doesn't understand it
I<00:04:20.329> know<00:04:20.600> what<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.169> is<00:04:21.350> it<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:22.010> energy<00:04:22.340> work

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
I know what it is it is this energy work

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.410 
I know what it is it is this energy work
that<00:04:23.030> I'm<00:04:23.180> doing

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
that I'm doing

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.540

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
I've been able to help him get over his

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.740 
I've been able to help him get over his

terror of storms abandonment issues you

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.660 
terror of storms abandonment issues you
know<00:04:30.870> used<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.260> just<00:04:31.470> be<00:04:31.590> totally<00:04:31.800> frantic<00:04:32.370> if

I walked out of the room there's just a
lot<00:04:34.950> of<00:04:35.010> things<00:04:35.310> that<00:04:35.400> have<00:04:35.520> disappeared<00:04:35.820> and

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
lot of things that have disappeared and

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.700 
lot of things that have disappeared and
and<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.750> same<00:04:36.900> thing<00:04:37.140> happens<00:04:37.470> for<00:04:37.680> people

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
and the same thing happens for people

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.610 
and the same thing happens for people
but<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.610> tears<00:04:38.970> me<00:04:39.270> up<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.840> know<00:04:40.080> how<00:04:40.380> many

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
but it tears me up to know how many

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.470 
but it tears me up to know how many
people<00:04:41.010> love<00:04:41.280> their<00:04:41.610> pets<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.150> way<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.450> I

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
people love their pets the way that I

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.570 
people love their pets the way that I
loved<00:04:42.840> Bo<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.380> they<00:04:43.740> feel<00:04:43.980> helpless<00:04:44.340> when

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
loved Bo and they feel helpless when

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.550 
loved Bo and they feel helpless when
they<00:04:44.730> get<00:04:44.910> sick<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.660> costs<00:04:46.230> a<00:04:46.290> lot<00:04:46.500> of

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
they get sick and it costs a lot of

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.170 
they get sick and it costs a lot of
money<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:47.130> have<00:04:47.220> them<00:04:47.400> on<00:04:47.520> drugs<00:04:47.820> means<00:04:47.970> some

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
money to have them on drugs means some
