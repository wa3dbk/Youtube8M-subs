edge by applying science to your

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.629 
edge by applying science to your
controller<00:00:10.080> by<00:00:10.800> extending<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> length<00:00:11.490> of

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
controller by extending the length of

controller by extending the length of
the<00:00:11.759> joystick<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.540> gain<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> larger<00:00:13.139> range<00:00:13.290> of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the joystick you gain a larger range of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.049 
the joystick you gain a larger range of
motion<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.309> should<00:00:14.400> allow<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.940> move

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
motion and this should allow you to move

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.790 
motion and this should allow you to move
quicker<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.599> more<00:00:15.780> precisely<00:00:16.170> all<00:00:16.470> while

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
quicker and more precisely all while

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.859 
quicker and more precisely all while
reducing<00:00:16.980> finger<00:00:17.580> strain<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.449> all<00:00:18.570> sounds

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
reducing finger strain it all sounds

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.480 
reducing finger strain it all sounds
pretty<00:00:18.900> impressive<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.680> does<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.830> work<00:00:20.070> let's

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
pretty impressive but does it work let's

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.150 
pretty impressive but does it work let's
take<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> look<00:00:21.410> come<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.619> variety<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
take a look come in a variety of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.310 
take a look come in a variety of
different<00:00:23.250> flavors<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.720> will<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
different flavors if you will the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.980 
different flavors if you will the
legendary<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> hoops<00:00:26.970> free<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.539> TD

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
freak and there's also the gamer pack

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.600 
freak and there's also the gamer pack
which<00:00:30.869> comes<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> regular<00:00:31.710> FPS<00:00:32.279> freek

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
which comes with the regular FPS freek

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.030 
which comes with the regular FPS freek
and<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.059> speed<00:00:33.329> freak<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.950> they

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
and the speed freak all in one what they

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.389 
and the speed freak all in one what they
do<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.309> they<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.520> snap<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.300> your<00:00:36.420> joystick

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
do is they just snap on to your joystick

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
do is they just snap on to your joystick
very<00:00:38.399> easily<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.899> pretty

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
very easily like that and it's on pretty

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.819 
very easily like that and it's on pretty
solid<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.750> these<00:00:45.750> are<00:00:45.930> supposed<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.320> work<00:00:46.559> by

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
solid so these are supposed to work by

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.220 
solid so these are supposed to work by
increasing<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> range<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.969> motion<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:49.170> you

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
increasing the range of motion so you

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.569 
increasing the range of motion so you
see<00:00:50.210> soft<00:00:51.210> real<00:00:51.449> quick<00:00:52.010> or<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.430> only

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
see soft real quick or as you can only

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.869 
see soft real quick or as you can only
move<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> circle<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.260> big<00:00:55.730> once<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
move in a circle like that big once you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
move in a circle like that big once you
pop<00:00:57.090> these<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.870> does<00:00:58.469> increase<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.100> range

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
pop these on it does increase the range

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.130 
pop these on it does increase the range
of<00:00:59.489> motion<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> same<00:01:00.719> time<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
of motion but at the same time it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
of motion but at the same time it
decreases<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> sensitivity<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.820> have

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
decreases the sensitivity so they have

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
decreases the sensitivity so they have
to<00:01:03.090> play<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.539> sensitivity<00:01:04.170> settings

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to play with your sensitivity settings

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.830 
to play with your sensitivity settings
in<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> game<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.909> grip<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> controller

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
in the game your grip on the controller

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.690 
in the game your grip on the controller
changes<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.470> you're<00:01:07.590> using<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> FPS<00:01:08.400> freek

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
changes when you're using the FPS freek

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000 
changes when you're using the FPS freek
whereas<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.510> usually<00:01:09.659> hold<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.229> pretty<00:01:10.500> tight

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
whereas you usually hold it pretty tight

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
whereas you usually hold it pretty tight
like<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.490> because<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.180> thumbs<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.689> pretty

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
like this because your thumbs are pretty

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
like this because your thumbs are pretty
low<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.710> these<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> hold<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> much

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
low with these you have to hold it much

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.960 
low with these you have to hold it much
looser<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:16.320> hit<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.680> thumbs<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.250> top<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
looser to hit your thumbs on top of the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.230 
looser to hit your thumbs on top of the
joysticks<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.310> full<00:01:21.000> motion

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
joysticks to get that full motion

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.060 
joysticks to get that full motion
holding<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.869> down<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.380> doesn't<00:01:22.799> quite<00:01:22.950> work

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
holding it down it doesn't quite work

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.690 
holding it down it doesn't quite work
the<00:01:23.700> same<00:01:24.530> since<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.799> higher<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> found<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the same since it is higher I found it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.300 
the same since it is higher I found it
harder<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> click<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> stick<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.189> you're

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
harder to click the stick so if you're

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 
harder to click the stick so if you're
using<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.909> run<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> knife<00:01:30.900> someone<00:01:30.930> at

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
using that to run or to knife someone at

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.090 
using that to run or to knife someone at
a<00:01:31.790> very<00:01:32.790> opportune<00:01:33.350> moment<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
a very opportune moment it can be a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.300 
a very opportune moment it can be a
little<00:01:35.420> less<00:01:36.420> responsive<00:01:37.170> unless<00:01:38.009> you're

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
little less responsive unless you're

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
little less responsive unless you're
pushing<00:01:39.090> downwards<00:01:40.049> more<00:01:40.380> which<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
pushing downwards more which can be a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
pushing downwards more which can be a
little<00:01:41.130> more<00:01:41.250> difficult<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:42.329> FPS<00:01:42.899> freeks

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
little more difficult the FPS freeks

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.340 
little more difficult the FPS freeks
standard<00:01:43.740> once<00:01:43.950> our<00:01:44.159> little<00:01:44.460> concave<00:01:45.350> much

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
standard once our little concave much

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
standard once our little concave much
like<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.770> xbox<00:01:47.280> 360<00:01:47.759> joysticks<00:01:48.710> but<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.220> FPS

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
like the xbox 360 joysticks but the FPS

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.960 
like the xbox 360 joysticks but the FPS
freek<00:01:51.180> legendary<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.530> convex<00:01:53.280> much<00:01:53.700> like

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
freek legendary is more convex much like

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.560 
freek legendary is more convex much like
the<00:01:54.439> ps3<00:01:55.439> joysticks<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.390> personally<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> like

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the ps3 joysticks and personally I like
