00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.140
 I am the cali of the valley 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.620
 well, my family is from Tumaca 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.930
 well I was born in Cali we are all the 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.780
 I was raised by life and well I think 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.530
 I started at juniors mouth school from 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.790
 Colombia 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:34.240
 I was there until 18 years later 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:38.610
 I went to Paraguay for two years and 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.860
 20 years I came to Bolivian football where 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.340
 I have practically practiced my career 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.300
 there where he tells me to know at a level 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.670
 and international 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.280
 and good is the opportunity to be here 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.629
 in Mexico is a beautiful country to be able 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.570
 play football one of the most 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.320
 competitive today where the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.019
 Colombians have been reflected by 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.239
 one has opened the door of thousands and 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.990
 well now it's trying to continue 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.310
 with this that started in one is not going to 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.040
 be 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.890
 a great challenge for both the club 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 as for me to be able to play a good 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.340
 championship and be able to treat you 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.370
 of going up to first that is the goal 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 of the club and good at what 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.670
 Staff try to make me know 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.580
 here in Mexico that I always take a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.340
 Trampoline for a clear objective 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.050
 I have to get to Europe many 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.740
 Colombians have been in this club and the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.290
 true that each one with a lot or a little 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.020
 what he has done has left his stamp and that 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.500
 it's more than important to try to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.730
 improve what they did and well a 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.340
 challenge for me to be able 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.910
 he was the scorer at the end of the championship 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.300
 that the team remains at first that 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.000
 we can win important things is a 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.290
 great challenge and it's a good new hope 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.720
 time will not give us the reason if 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.090
 we can achieve or not but this from a 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.300
 start and the start of now 7 team 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.460
 in the majority party that we're going to have 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.950
 so much more than the whole local yes yes 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.690
 we keep the rhythm of the game that 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.820
 imposed we will not have any 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.460
 inconvenience of being fighting between 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.580
 the 4 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.850
 to sign up for the title that I do not have 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.780
 No doubt because many things are 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.510
 showed against a team that also 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.580
 is has important players figures 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.950
 important I would like one day 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.790
 strong in my own seal my own 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.070
 nickname and good and there and I already 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.900
 have been sounding hopefully now 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.400
 from now on they start telling me how I 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.590
 they like me or the panther that they told me 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.320
 surprised when I arrived I did not know that 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.860

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.530
 with a very nice stunning sea me 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.180
 They say they now doing and cold and good 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.320
 let's hope that when the heat is not 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.430
 they are going to take me out of the sea on the beach 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.430
 I think they're going to interview me 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.280
