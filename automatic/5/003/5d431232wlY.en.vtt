bread you want to make sure that the
flour<00:01:22.100> when<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.730> read<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.970> ingredients<00:01:23.420> that

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
flour when you read the ingredients that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.990 
flour when you read the ingredients that
it<00:01:23.660> says<00:01:23.840> hole<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:25.040> front<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:25.490> if<00:01:25.700> it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
it says hole in front of it if it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.730 
it says hole in front of it if it
doesn't<00:01:26.270> say<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.540> word<00:01:26.660> hole<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.290> front<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.620> it

doesn't say the word hole in front of it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.070 
doesn't say the word hole in front of it
then<00:01:28.280> it's<00:01:28.610> not<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.880> healthy<00:01:29.390> whole<00:01:29.840> grain

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
then it's not a healthy whole grain

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.100 
then it's not a healthy whole grain
carbohydrates<00:01:30.760> other<00:01:31.760> healthy<00:01:32.420> carbs<00:01:32.720> that

legumes and potatoes and corn and sweet

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.270 
legumes and potatoes and corn and sweet
potatoes<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.230> wide<00:01:42.620> variety<00:01:42.950> of

potatoes so you have a wide variety of
healthy<00:01:43.940> nutrient-dense<00:01:44.540> carbohydrates<00:01:45.380> to

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
healthy nutrient-dense carbohydrates to

healthy nutrient-dense carbohydrates to
choose<00:01:45.890> from<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.550> not<00:01:47.000> at<00:01:47.270> all<00:01:47.450> an<00:01:47.720> advocate

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
choose from and I not at all an advocate

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.290 
choose from and I not at all an advocate
of<00:01:48.410> low<00:01:48.560> carb<00:01:48.830> diets<00:01:49.160> in<00:01:49.460> fact<00:01:49.940> I<00:01:50.060> would<00:01:50.180> say

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
of low carb diets in fact I would say

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.900 
of low carb diets in fact I would say
the<00:01:50.420> vast<00:01:50.660> majority<00:01:50.870> of<00:01:51.320> my<00:01:51.980> calories<00:01:52.550> in<00:01:52.580> my

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
the vast majority of my calories in my

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.970 
the vast majority of my calories in my
diet<00:01:53.180> actually<00:01:53.450> do<00:01:53.870> come<00:01:54.110> from<00:01:54.140> carbohydrates

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
diet actually do come from carbohydrates

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.920 
diet actually do come from carbohydrates
but<00:01:55.370> they<00:01:55.520> come<00:01:55.730> from<00:01:55.910> nutrient<00:01:56.390> dense<00:01:56.570> carbs

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
but they come from nutrient dense carbs

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.230 
but they come from nutrient dense carbs
so<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:58.040> bottom<00:01:58.220> line<00:01:58.370> is<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.700> want<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.940> get

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
so the bottom line is you want to get

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.120 
so the bottom line is you want to get
rid<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.450> those<00:01:59.600> three<00:02:00.110> empty<00:02:00.470> calorie<00:02:00.770> carbs

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
rid of those three empty calorie carbs

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.430 
rid of those three empty calorie carbs
or<00:02:01.420> dramatically<00:02:02.420> reduce<00:02:02.780> your<00:02:02.930> intake<00:02:03.200> and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
or dramatically reduce your intake and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.230 
or dramatically reduce your intake and
you<00:02:03.950> want<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.159> switch<00:02:04.370> over<00:02:04.550> and<00:02:04.940> make<00:02:05.210> a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
you want to switch over and make a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.440 
you want to switch over and make a
