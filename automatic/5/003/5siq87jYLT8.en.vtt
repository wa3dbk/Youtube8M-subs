00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.410
 Y 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.320
 and the ritz 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.350
 minecraft me seven week or 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.619
 If you review how you want to call it but the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.950
 thing is that a Saturday plus a nice 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.320
 Saturday a relaxing Saturday I bring you one 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.050
 new seed so you can play with her 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 or investigate it for you or 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.300
 just entertain them a few minutes 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.629
 more so we're going to more shares of the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.390
 world and we are going to put the seeds but 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:49.309
 always before making a nice roll 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.309
 of natural and homemade drums 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:59.449
 and the seed of this Saturday is minus 39 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:03.199
 67 65 28 93 16 19 70 61 ok it has good 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.850
 paints because it's a -3 96 ok it's 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.690
 of payment if I'm not wrong then 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.360
 I recommend not calling this number 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.920
 and the dangerous pro in 1.003 but hey 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.380
 let's give it up and let's create a 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.160
 new world to see what he thinks we 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.410
 this seed 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.409
 let's see loading not loading world and 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.119
 generating the ground 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.270
 Today is semi nothing happened to me 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.289
 Subscriber by twitter puts us here 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.150
 your tweet and as you see you appear here in 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.270
 a meadow 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.990
 and nothing else so let's put this on 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990
 in timing 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.909
 let's take a step to teach what it is that 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.680
 This seed is special if we go 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.280
 around here around here remember that 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.000
 the spa 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.200
 it's around here in these coordinates 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.200
 if we go here 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.140
 and we're still here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.729
 and we found this a tremendous 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.090
 cave with sant we have not met 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.220
 with a beautiful villa of boys 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.700
 and nothing this is what I got to comment 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.510
 it's a pretty cool seed because 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.340
 You come out here at one in the afternoon I do not know 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.140
 I'm fighting to see what he has 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.459
 special this seed is that in this 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 trunk here is to be made a portal 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.290
 to hell nothing else start we're not going to 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.489
 fighting the fun of this seed is 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.200
 basically this appears is next to 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.569
 a city of a village where you are 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.190
 in a racing and as you see here here 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.560
 happens on the gravel road 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.620
 and how do you see here good good good this 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.080
 there is a generation error totally 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.920
 well super played we will see all the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.500
 Axes iron and tuna boots offers no 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.190
 arrows and if we come here we will have 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.780
 stunning views to see what there is 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.350
 still cover with green a few racing with 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.010
 a well and people walking 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.520
 to the smithy that you see there and you that you 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.140
 you 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.360
 I think this person is not going to sleep 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.460
 a lot and nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.890
 this seed that good here has this 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.110
 It's special but it does not end here 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.680
 let's look at the coordinates worth 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.440
 are these next to 0 0 and 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.570
 now we are going to export to these 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:47.890
 coordinates you remember is to say everything 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:53.690
 before product like that but I remember badly 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:56.540
 they will plant if at 200 cubes there is a 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.700
 a desert temple or a pyramid 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.250
 it's cool because this stability is also here 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.680
 in the middle of the water look what's good 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.540
 everything in using the usb I think it's one of 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.530
 the best pyramids that I have seen until 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.660
 now it's worth 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.550
 removing this block of sants town that 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.700
 that has generated in another unit because 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.080
 was there is the best pyramid that I have 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.670
 seen generated that is as if it were and if 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:27.230
 let's go here is not that there is excessively 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:29.990
 special things here this is nothing 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:34.810
 bad and there are 9 3 as usual that I go 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.810
 to burst but really good 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.550
 really the fun also of this 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.810
 seed is that if we go through here we go to 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.980
 see that I was not wrong I do not want 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.130
 wrong 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.690
 we go through here we continue to see in the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.310
 temple we keep seeing we keep seeing 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:56.660
 we keep seeing we do not see it but but 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:00.560
 here they tachÃ¡n a song of the desert yes 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.710
 gentlemen and nothing this is all I hope that 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.380
 you liked it a lot and there is a double 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.080
 trunk with fence and I hope you have 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.010
 I really liked this seed, it happened to me 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.620
 subscriber thank you very much and nothing we 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.060
 we see in the next seed and who knows 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.060
 maybe I'm behind you 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.470
 until now I hope I have expected a 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.470
 good scare 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.470
 5
