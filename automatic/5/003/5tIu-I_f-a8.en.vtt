00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
lack of a better word but also how's the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
lack of a better word but also how's the
potato<00:01:04.949> head<00:01:05.280> features<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.119> he's<00:01:06.299> got<00:01:06.479> these

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
looks a lot like Optimus I'd say he's a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
looks a lot like Optimus I'd say he's a
perfect<00:01:12.570> mashup<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.470> he's<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> tiny<00:01:14.130> little

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
