blends it's pretty easy I guess it looks
very<00:01:09.750> gelatinous<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.189> mean<00:01:11.520> kind<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
very gelatinous and but I mean kind of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840 
very gelatinous and but I mean kind of
jelly<00:01:12.270> ish<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.130> blends<00:01:14.610> right

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
jelly ish and then it just blends right

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
jelly ish and then it just blends right
in<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.780> no<00:01:15.930> problem<00:01:15.960> with

in like that I have no problem with
blending<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.250> something<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
blending it in it's not something that

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.520 
blending it in it's not something that
takes<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.150> long<00:01:18.270> time<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.750> work<00:01:18.840> into<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.170> skin

foundation starts to have that's what it
feels<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.250> don't<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:45.000> hits<00:01:45.420> really

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840

gross on your skin and it makes me feel
more<00:01:47.939> oily<00:01:48.390> than<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.990> already<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.549> isn't

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
more oily than it already is or it isn't

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.639 
more oily than it already is or it isn't
it<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.329> makes<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.810> skin<00:01:51.869> feel<00:01:52.350> really

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it just makes your skin feel really

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.469 
it just makes your skin feel really
greasy<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.270> not

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
greasy so that is one thing I do not

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.109 
greasy so that is one thing I do not
like<00:01:54.720> about<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.049> product<00:01:55.399> number<00:01:56.399> two<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
like about the product number two I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.149 
like about the product number two I
don't<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.899> wear<00:01:58.140> primer<00:01:58.680> underneath<00:01:58.920> my

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
don't really wear primer underneath my

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.830 
don't really wear primer underneath my
foundation<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.640> start<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.630> that's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
foundation to start with so that's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.749 
foundation to start with so that's
mainly<00:02:01.140> why<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> wanted<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> try<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.610> if

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
mainly why I wanted to try and see if

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
mainly why I wanted to try and see if
you<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.030> maybe<00:02:03.119> would<00:02:03.390> make<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> difference

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you know maybe would make a difference

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.149 
you know maybe would make a difference
and<00:02:04.110> maybe<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.320> could<00:02:04.469> start<00:02:04.590> getting<00:02:04.860> into<00:02:05.040> one

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and maybe I could start getting into one

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.550 
and maybe I could start getting into one
primers<00:02:05.689> honestly<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.079> made<00:02:07.290> my

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
primers honestly this made my

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.969 
primers honestly this made my
station<00:02:08.220> bomb<00:02:08.789> last<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.739> shorter<00:02:10.739> amount<00:02:10.800> of

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
station bomb last a shorter amount of

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.990 
station bomb last a shorter amount of
time<00:02:11.099> than<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.520> usually<00:02:11.610> does

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
time than it usually does

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.540 
time than it usually does
I<00:02:12.180> wore<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.750> Monday<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.040> was<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.280> okay

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
I wore this Monday and I was there okay

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.640 
I wore this Monday and I was there okay
why<00:02:14.760> isn't<00:02:15.060> my<00:02:15.120> foundation<00:02:15.599> lasting<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.530> I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
why isn't my foundation lasting that I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.260 
why isn't my foundation lasting that I
didn't<00:02:17.069> work<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.310> next<00:02:17.550> day<00:02:17.670> my<00:02:17.819> foundation

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
didn't work the next day my foundation

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.000 
didn't work the next day my foundation
losses<00:02:18.630> then<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.840> tried<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.230> again<00:02:19.319> my

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
losses then I tried it again my

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.220 
losses then I tried it again my
foundation<00:02:20.459> did<00:02:20.640> not<00:02:20.790> last<00:02:21.030> maybe<00:02:21.569> it's<00:02:21.720> just

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
foundation did not last maybe it's just

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.570 
foundation did not last maybe it's just
that<00:02:22.349> they're<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.680> compatible<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.430> each

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
that they're not compatible with each

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.220 
that they're not compatible with each
other<00:02:23.849> sometimes<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.840> happens<00:02:25.110> with

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
other sometimes it happens with

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.930 
other sometimes it happens with
primaries<00:02:25.769> but<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.099> use<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.489> Tarte<00:02:26.790> Amazonian

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
primaries but I use the Tarte Amazonian

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.479 
primaries but I use the Tarte Amazonian
clay<00:02:27.420> 12-hour<00:02:28.260> foundation<00:02:28.860> maybe<00:02:29.130> they<00:02:29.370> don't

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
clay 12-hour foundation maybe they don't

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.250 
clay 12-hour foundation maybe they don't
go<00:02:29.730> together<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.390> don't<00:02:30.480> know

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
go together I don't know

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.110 
go together I don't know
so<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.650> cause<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.160> my<00:02:32.250> foundation<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.849> slide

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so it's cause to my foundation to slide

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.570 
so it's cause to my foundation to slide
a<00:02:33.150> bit<00:02:33.800> let<00:02:34.800> me<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.099> you've<00:02:35.190> tried<00:02:35.220> this
