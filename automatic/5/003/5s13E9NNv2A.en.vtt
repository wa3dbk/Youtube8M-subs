and<00:01:06.409> easier<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.400> maintain<00:01:07.549> then<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.540> regular

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
and easier to maintain then the regular

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.770 
and easier to maintain then the regular
routine<00:01:09.380> offer<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:09.920> sissing<00:01:10.460> yeah<00:01:11.210> she's<00:01:11.600> not

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
routine offer you sissing yeah she's not

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.750
