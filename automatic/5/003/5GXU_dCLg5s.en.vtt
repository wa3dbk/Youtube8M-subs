 do 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.050
 here after all the various screensavers by the way before 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.280
 the beginning 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.359
 games 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.689
 and how do you see ha in Russian is 

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:42.449
 duck 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.160
 but so far only 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.440
 yes while here transfer pubis 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.240
 by which 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 were imprisoned on the brakes of ships 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.990
 and here it is understood here I'm going with her 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.470
 stories 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.570
 give them try resettlement 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.960
 the consequences of samuel whoever those bets 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.990
 enough 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.990
 separate 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.150
 and you have to rewind them 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.550
 Well, here the dialogue is happening for the sake of 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.550
 show starts project ship from atom yes 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.350
 and how can we regulate 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.190
 speed that's when we push it was 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.850
 just press on speed 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 increases 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.910
 not a step to work 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.190
 is accelerating 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.870
 we need to create will definitely 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.310
 points in vietnam written how many 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.000
 meters to him 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.210
 and also to press on a heat 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.510
 vodka to this question and we slow down 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.970
 may also grodekovo 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.850
 let's wait and fit 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.160
 points 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.800
 and continue on our journey 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.030
 then bye how 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.420
 speed down 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.100
 propaganda is we can manage 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.120
 our ships 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.440
 for this we know that we have such a reversal 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.290
 attention is moving 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.590
 title holder will make 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.590
 correctly 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.990
 Bryansk about the state of emergency very cool made awards 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.130
 here 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.130
 but in his own time everyone who played 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.650
 better better game and no 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.720
 here are the protocols but because it is real 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.730
 very much everyone bought beautifully 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.109
 so what's already there is water alone 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.639
 graphically very very cool done 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.409
 canvases so we need to create 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.400
 trying to ship which 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.340
 is ahead of us who are 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.049
 so much so we will start the battle 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.389
 it will show what Budanov 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.849
 and you will be on how another 100 told 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.749
 teams 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.629
 from various people 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.290
 here you will follow 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.359
 and how soon there 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.079
 of course he is nothing interesting given 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.809
 drink virus here is ikarus which we are now 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.299
 we will fight 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.379
 And so there is 5 dialogue 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.239
 which has become missing 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.620
 so let us mash booze so ship and 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.859
 destroy it using normal 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.189
 Pushkin's edge ships that us 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.989
 we have one left for 160 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.169
 not that public of him 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.059
 we are besides this gleb 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.459
 under various legendary 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.779
 treasure 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.169
 and on which we can 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.569
 analysts find new ways went on 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:03.360
 experiment 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.840
 and some kind of horse thieves whom we 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.229
 see more but it happened 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:10.699
 as soon as three days 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.249
 but this battle is our ship 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.859
 from the fact that you kazhpota n.i 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.029
 but now we send where mm 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.379
 we will shoot but the owner 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.769
 offer it 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.509
 such slate 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.819
 let's try it 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.159
 and we let go and we are illegal children 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.729
 fluffy harmonious understanding 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.729
 recharged need some time to 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.930
 quick so we 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.889
 how else to figure out headquarters m direct 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.619
 once again 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.159
 but I think the second third salary is 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.109
 each ship will not stand 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.279
 so in response, how many have we got 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.079
 we can get rid of him so 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.259
 he missed and not just perfect 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.359
 maneuver 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.359
 truth again right we personally failed a 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.799
 but now it's hard to say so 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.419
 try to attack 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:03.409
 turn 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.059
 60 points are clearly needed 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.059
 how do the attacks relate to it 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.279
 and now our turn and year 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.369
 attack let's try 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:16.570
 since open dialogue is incomprehensible 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.379
 such is the price of the unit and we shoot 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.719
 nice to file so here he started 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.629
 Is that a maneuver to use that 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.830
 it was quite difficult to get into it 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.759
 5 and 5 5 and I have this but we are no 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.270
 just approved prices 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.500
 from him in this way gives therefore now 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.529
 we do not have long 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:36.840
 so st 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.900
 m 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.080
 it doesn’t come in as hard as it’s carp 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.409
 pass 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.249
 again he is trying to get us in the last 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.759
 we have the strength 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.600
 so nbu 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.600
 we still achieve this 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:54.949
 and west 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.819
 but almost gone 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.679
 it is necessary only on the last breath on 

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:00.189
 last breath resist 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.479
 document basis 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.709
 the hall and my 49 of our enemy is everything 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.049
 we are even for a decade and a half of everything 

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:11.110
 project profess 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.900
 so if we go further 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.310
 we collect loot as a Turan house mod 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.370
 we can understand how we tell them 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.189
 it's easy then them 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.180
 well ships 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.159
 so to speak 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.249
 collected prey which mortality from 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.159
 whatever it was 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:28.260
 a great 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.520
 destroyed so to speak paul first 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.330
 our two 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.330
 went well so we collect various 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:41.889
 the rotation boasts of the Japanese herself 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.949
 so the prime 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.639
 the cooks 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.860
 we all have gathered all 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.479
 so to speak 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.559
 the right things 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.069
 let's see what is there 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.219
 farther 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.689
 here is the menu here is our map 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.979
 cover boot and the feeling that 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.899
 the game requires internet access though i 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:04.520
 the exact length of the jubilant will affect 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.919
 so here is 0 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.919
 send to swim 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.830
 so how do i get network hints arises 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.380
 but particularly small 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.580
 boot up 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.270
 we will wait 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.750
 and get a very interesting state council in 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.560
 oil and gas you missed pa 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.900
 which is long enough 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.500
 a long time ago 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.500
 Well, here is our ship 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.309
 as we remember 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.819
 of the above 5 so we can in PM 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.559
 survive the scales will see 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:44.389
 that is, we can, on the one hand, the United States 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:45.509
 How we can 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:46.930
 and consider 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.219
 case 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:50.770
 first case 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.569
 as part of understand, you will need to give you 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.789
 portal kakut city 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.610
 which we saw contrary to 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.780
 so we can change or even some 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.780
 tickles made them can pave the course 

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:06.109
 I once believe that I will be asked questions 

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.249
 because I really really want to play 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:09.089
 highly 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:10.979
 cool done 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:13.479
 so we will allow 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:15.719
 yes and the active bark to park 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:18.029
 primates to issue 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.099
 will see 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:20.990
 but 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.889
 just lift 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:24.819
 so on the posts as no 

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.839
 buyers 

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:30.429
 ahead of us here is such a very steep on 

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:31.689
 will be more interesting 

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:33.739
 she advises not to play her game 

00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:36.139
 teams this year's body section and how 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.279
 the truth is that when it comes in contact with 

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.439
 that while that speed is
