 music lovers would like to see it

 and isolated from any sound to his fans 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.440
 instead they would love that their 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.750
 programming would be extended to all

 days his name is Carlos Fraga and he is the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.769
 responsible for the mother chicha a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.750
 radial space where they do not exist 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.740
 impossible and anything can 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 happen 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.710
 maria jose guzmán has the details 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.079
 as anticipating what will come with 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 the new communication law in change 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.640

 the morning in full program of gold mere 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.470
 and his friends there is perhaps the only 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.199
 segment capable of mixing artists 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.350
 international with their own 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.269
 our the popular ones in the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.670
 space that has won the applause 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:59.610
 of the public and laughter the chicha mother 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.830
 carlos fraga dj for almost 18 years is the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.530
 guilty of what different artists 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.030
 as antonio flags with antonio many 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.030
 are merged for example 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.560
 I am a very man 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.990
 that I like the best women do not 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.720
 lack of money 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.509
 or what white rat lover woman have 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.110
 a hand in hand with mime group appointment 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.110
 cellar 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.140
 yes 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.350
 the idea was how do I tell you to put a 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.950
 national artist in international with 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.910
 something the months that I can 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.770
 be the bunny of a reggaeton that is 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.230
 the bunny with the bunny of the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.590
 conquerors something like that and you should always 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.140
 have some some good resemblance 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.900
 in the name of the artist or in the name 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.740
 of the song so that something is something that 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.960
 be the cup 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.940
 the way to work with the ingenious 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.670
 mixtures starts with the help of people 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.740
 the public is finally the one that sends 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.430
 suggestions that the good carlitos has 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.080
 the difficult and complicated task of mixing 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.600
 when the mere parrot or the nick of hitman 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.420
 or the duck days read the proposals do not 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.220
 laughter is lacking 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.950
 the most creative hands of the radio are 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.220
 they put to the test and the result is something 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.220
 A) Yes 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.620
 in six years of segment and more than 131 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.750
 mother chips to the air success is not 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.270
 always made wait at the end of each 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:55.090
 presentation the listener qualifies 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:57.760
 he would not always give us 786 but most 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.480
 of times and if you like our work 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.280
 to the people 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.159
 the idea of ​​bringing the segment to the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.920
 television is one of its objectives no longer 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:10.400
 it's just about listening and laughing 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.799
 to see and laugh double or maybe imagine 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.799
 see gloria trevi versus gloria gómez 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.840
 and 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.260
 although the shark project 1 fusion 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.260
 it's your rhythm with the quishpe dolphin 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.100
 i 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.419
 yes 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:03.419
 if more 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.419
 find me 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.419
 and although often find it 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.389
 difficult to mix albajos with reggaeton or 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.120
 corridors with rock for dj tragala de es 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:18.180
 impossible as he showed when 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.440
 merged angel huaranga with angels of the 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.150
 hell 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.150
 no no 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.450
 Y 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.990
 i 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.139
 for example look no woman no cry 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.990
 for example with both therefore 2 in the 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:59.439
 things doing for example a song 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:03.400
 from the queen the band a rock band 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:05.830
 classic queen with tell me how are you doing 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.410
 as if that were not enough and how his segment 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.630
 made famous and ximo in his bar called 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.060
 people light at a certain time of the 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.360
 chicha mother's night is requested by the 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.099
 people who dance it as they can 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.169
 so if you already had some 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.439
 explosive mixture that puts you in trouble 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.759
 our friend dj already knows then 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:27.729
 listen cinnamon radio every Wednesday 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:30.879
 and suggests the impossible that we do not know 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:33.150
 how, but he always succeeds because 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:35.840
 achieve 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.840
 good
