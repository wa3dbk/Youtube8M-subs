00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 i 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.570
 by friends the moment embrapa livestock 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.420
 is back with more than one edition 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.550
 unprecedented for you and we have shown 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.330
 for our viewers from the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.340
 Brazil 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.529
 the work of Embrapa cattle cutting 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.320
 development and breeding 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.140
 of grasses and legumes used 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.640
 pastures all over Brazil that do not 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.370
 today's program we will show a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.590
 similar panic family variety 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.170
 with a sufficient in the variety received the name 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.969
 and is already making a success. 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.280
 zootechnician embrapa of beef cattle 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.970
 haroldo queiroz is going to talk some more 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.970
 about this little thing 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.980
 during the showtec 2014 and many 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.600
 were presented and the company 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.650
 Brazilian agricultural research 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.750
 embrapa released one of them a new 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.780
 cultivate to see with the goal of 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.820
 replace the captain danny looking like this 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.049
 remember very good bassa 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.869
 but this is the jury jury that is a phrase 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.749
 that Ana has a very clear meaning 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:19.780
 which refers to the result of the jury 

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:22.450
 means good and handsome is a cart 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.759
 high digestibility high capacity 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.240
 support the high weight gain by 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.060
 and have good quality. 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.179
 or slightly superior to the spleen and 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.639
 thani originally from africa the grass 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.369
 which has been studied for more than ten 

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:40.990
 embrapa approved its profitability in the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.630
 Brazilian herds 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.139
 the jury was tested in two biomes 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.149
 different in the Amazon and in the 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:52.179
 this cultivar has been tested in the 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.119
 last 12 to 10 years depending on the 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.520
 both in the Amazonian biome that was 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.799
 acre and in the cerrado biome in 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.719
 planaltina and in great field in field 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.539
 Big, we're running the tests. 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.329
 but he already showed 50 pounds of 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.270
 superiority 50 kg of meat per 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.730
 hectare per year in the Amazon in Acre and 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.250
 at least 20 kilograms per hectare 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.580
 relation to the world is enough in the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.610
 and for those who want to know zurich too 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.560
 can be used in dairy farming 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.090
 we can make a comparison and 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.090
 transpose result 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.490
 as it has potential and produces 800 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.130
 grams per head per day in cattle from 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.470
 cut in dairy cattle and is equivalent to 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.660
 10 to 12 liters of milk 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.840
 so he can meet the requirements 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.530
 of a dairy cow up to 12 liters of 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.110
 milk 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.030
 that cow that is producing more 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.340
 that 12 thousand liters of milk will need 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.320
 of a feed supplement but in terms of 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.840
 of pastures it is equivalent to one 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.420
 Tanzania and the Mombasa in the production of 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.690
 an option of high productivity 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.300
 which is very resistant against rust 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.520
 it is a good choice for 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.820
 diversification within the cloths 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.620
 property and the perfect option for 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.989
 replace the Tanzanian where traffic 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.350
 is being attacked by the rust of the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.350
 corn 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.160
 Zurich will be officially launched on 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.470
 market during the fair dinapec 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.330
 dynamics and will be carried out in the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.400
 National Center for Research on Cattle 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.790
 of the large field clutch between 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.920
 on the 12th and 14th of next March 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.580
 the moment embrapa livestock farming today 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.590
 around here 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.730
 Thank you for your attention and until the next 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.730
 lime program 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.800
