 fifth place from us gets to drive 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.840
 the idea itself seemed very and very 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.610
 interesting however implementation is a bit 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:01.819
 let us down 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.819
 [music]

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.920
 dead so still and infect in nothing 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.960
 guilty people 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.280
 [music] 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.110
 I did not eat 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.140

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.940

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.360
 city â€‹â€‹map opens the top three 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.979
 resident evil 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.710
 the game is full of atmosphere 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.360
 zombie apocalypse really is this 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.870
 the atmosphere is not in all parts 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:56.610
 therefore only third place 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:56.610
 [music] 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.470
 . 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.860

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.160
 [music] 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.960
 the second in our opinion becomes elevator vd2 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.480
 great shooter where zombies strive 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.880
 hang out a piece of your flesh and if your 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.030
 partners will not arrive in time then write 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.030

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.300
 first place takes wolking dead 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.070
 smartest quest from telltale games 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.720
 incredibly oppressive atmosphere heavy 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.640
 gaming decisions affecting 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.270
 the fate of the rest of the characters and 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.530
 great story that's what makes this game 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.849
 the undisputed leader of our top 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.849
 [music] 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.670
 [music] 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.550
 This is exactly our opinion. 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.280
 The best five season not game we see each other 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:41.199
