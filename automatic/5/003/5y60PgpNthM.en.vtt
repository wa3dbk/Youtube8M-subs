00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.129
 when I have seen in this hour we are 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.589
 making a video brother mom and I 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.929
 we are here in our room 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.509
 our house and it's a video with a lot 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.459
 honey prepared for my students of the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.080
 school of ministries the first 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.910
 apostolic church of the faith of Christ 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.880
 jesus proudly we lagoons are going to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.310
 explain 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.779
 the sun circles had already been 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.869
 giving classes this circle has 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.910
 four chords is going to be the circle of 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.340
 sun but we're going to rely a lot on the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.309
 strumming of the right hand however 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.699
 I will explain first the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.500
 chord of the sun that is the finger the finger 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:48.860
 half trust or sixth rope that is here 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.460
 and then the index finger fifth string 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.510
 second fret 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.120
 and finally the ring finger in the first 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.750
 third fret string and it sounds more or less 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.700
 A) Yes 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.700
 the second agreed is that of my minor 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.490
 is here on the fifth second string 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.560
 trasto and on the fourth second string 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.369
 Trasto is also like we said a 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.369
 Accordate species 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.710
 is the lowest after lowering to the lowest 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.710
 they lower both fingers to the third and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.200
 Fourth string like this and add the finger 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.659
 index on the second string the first 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.189
 Trasto and they are like that 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.859
 is the lowest at the end of the seventh you only go 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:42.280
 to lower these two here in the third and 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:45.969
 in the first the medium in the third 2nd 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.359
 fret and the ring in the first 2nd 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.619
 fret index in the second the first 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.619
 fret and it sounds like that 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.140
 perfect then it 's just neither the smallest and 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.310
 recent 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.510
 we were working in the church and that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.010
 explain to them through this video the 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.130
 strumming of the right hand 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.530
 then the strumming is going to be 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.080
 much use in ballads in the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.850
 quiet praises that are going to be 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.790
 touching with the help of god in his 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.110
 cellular will be very useful 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.290
 the strumming can be done with these three 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.239
 fingers even some make the strum 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.489
 up with this with the little finger 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.080
 but I do it with two fingers and two 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.080
 fingers I do the strumming down 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.440
 the recoil that I 'm going to teach you 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.840
 only down below we're going to risk 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.750
 if it's not going up we're also going to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.090
 make your thumb run like 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.080
 if we were asking right so 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.080
 down 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.690
 it's going to be one down two up 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.080
 or down or two up this 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.080
 way 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:21.140
 down down up 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:28.190
 you repeat and many times this is one you 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:35.750
 repeat and repeat then counting the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:38.330
 easy times more or less 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.090
 4 1 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.370
 at home they will practice this 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.519
 four times doing the strumming and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.800
 then four silences and in those four 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.540
 silences are going to change the corde to 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.480
 next I remembered the circle that would be 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.140
 in this case my minor this way are 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.140
 four times 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:07.099
 4 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:09.360
 2 they change 34 - 23 and they change 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:14.040
 two 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.590
 4 the least and 23 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:28.120
 41 changes 2 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:28.120
 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.130
 so so so 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.379
 and this can be done in any other 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.150
 another chord and then I'll be going 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.099
 more circles to start 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.200
 practice if you are not from the church 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.960
 but you are watching this video 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.870
 get yourself a guitar if you have the 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.800
 hand a guitar gets the one with the 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.750
 chords tightens fingers well 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.789
 the position tries to get the most 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.159
 sound and start practicing your 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.590
 radiated are very simple and then you 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:33.069
 I will be teaching praises that 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.409
 can sing with ease in the 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.720
 cells and can be a blessing to your 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:41.020
 good churches this was all we 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.349
 we say goodbye my younger brother 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.300
 and today and it is that which does not stop 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:50.120
 laugh when you make a mistake, start 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.889
 laugh like crazy and this 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.449
 this is with much love for you
