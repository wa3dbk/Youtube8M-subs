top 37 our acting is if this is a simple

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.650 
top 37 our acting is if this is a simple
thing<00:00:16.440> like<00:00:16.470> why<00:00:17.369> would<00:00:17.640> people<00:00:17.970> object<00:00:18.330> it

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
thing like why would people object it

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.529 
thing like why would people object it
how<00:00:18.990> hard<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.770> label<00:00:20.400> i<00:00:20.490> saw<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.180> person

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
how hard is it to label i saw one person

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.810 
how hard is it to label i saw one person
right<00:00:21.720> how<00:00:22.230> much<00:00:22.439> does<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.740> ink<00:00:23.160> cost<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
right how much does that ink cost and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.200 
right how much does that ink cost and
the<00:00:24.720> problem<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.170> 30<00:00:25.890> people<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.490> much<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> an

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the problem is 30 people have much of an

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.900 
the problem is 30 people have much of an
idea<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.660> how<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> grain<00:00:28.410> commodity<00:00:29.130> system

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
idea of how the grain commodity system

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
idea of how the grain commodity system
works<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> United<00:00:31.199> States<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
works in the United States are in the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.740 
works in the United States are in the
rest<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> world<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:33.360> really<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
rest of the world you really have to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.440 
rest of the world you really have to
think<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.050> more<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> analogy<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.210> river

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
think of more in the analogy of a river

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.049 
think of more in the analogy of a river
if<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.290> rain<00:00:37.469> falls<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.250> hillsides<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
if the rain falls on hillsides and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.630 
if the rain falls on hillsides and
various<00:00:39.390> places<00:00:39.660> runs<00:00:40.500> down<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.980> hills<00:00:41.190> into

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
various places runs down the hills into

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.970 
various places runs down the hills into
small<00:00:42.090> streams<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.899> those<00:00:43.079> collect<00:00:43.680> into

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
small streams and those collect into

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.770 
small streams and those collect into
larger<00:00:44.370> screens<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.090> eventually<00:00:45.600> go<00:00:45.750> into

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
larger screens that eventually go into

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.369 
larger screens that eventually go into
rivers<00:00:46.610> that's<00:00:47.610> sort<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> image<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.110> what

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
rivers that's sort of the image of what

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.910 
rivers that's sort of the image of what
happens<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:49.980> rain<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.440> once<00:00:52.440> you're<00:00:52.680> into

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
happens with rain and once you're into

happens with rain and once you're into
the<00:00:53.160> river<00:00:53.370> or<00:00:53.579> even<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.149> smallest

the river or even into the smallest
stream<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.559> question<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> where<00:00:56.610> did<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
stream the question of where did that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.020 
stream the question of where did that
drop<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> water<00:00:57.600> came<00:00:57.960> from<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.910> know

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
drop of water came from this is you know

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
drop of water came from this is you know
impossible<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> answer<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.289> that's

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
impossible to answer and that's

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.959 
impossible to answer and that's
essentially<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> same<00:01:02.250> thing<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.579> happens

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
essentially the same thing that happens

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
essentially the same thing that happens
in<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> commodity<00:01:03.690> system<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.640> way<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
in the commodity system the way that the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.240 
in the commodity system the way that the
the<00:01:06.659> grain<00:01:06.900> system<00:01:07.290> works<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.650> very<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:08.010> like

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the grain system works is very much like

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.330 
the grain system works is very much like
that<00:01:08.280> River<00:01:08.729> you've<00:01:09.540> got<00:01:10.189> thousands<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that River you've got thousands of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
that River you've got thousands of
individual<00:01:11.850> farmers<00:01:12.270> most<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.170> whom<00:01:13.320> have

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
individual farmers most of whom have

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.560 
individual farmers most of whom have
many<00:01:13.860> different<00:01:14.280> fields<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.000> planted

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
many different fields that are planted

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
many different fields that are planted
two<00:01:15.720> different<00:01:16.049> varieties<00:01:16.500> there's<00:01:17.340> shared

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
two different varieties there's shared

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
two different varieties there's shared
equipment<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.229> used<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.220> more

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
equipment that is used it's more

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.620 
equipment that is used it's more
efficient<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> bring<00:01:21.740> combines<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:24.060> the

efficient to bring combines up at the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.020 
efficient to bring combines up at the
United<00:01:25.259> States<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> season<00:01:26.369> ends<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.880> the

United States as the season ends so the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
United States as the season ends so the
same<00:01:27.320> combines<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.500> harvesting<00:01:28.979> many

different fields brain wagons these

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.550 
different fields brain wagons these
things<00:01:31.950> go<00:01:32.490> into<00:01:32.700> Chuck's<00:01:33.450> maybe<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
things go into Chuck's maybe that go to

the local grain elevator and then from
there<00:01:37.470> they<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.189> into<00:01:38.630> 100<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.990> train

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
there they can go into 100 and can train

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.330 
there they can go into 100 and can train

or wasn't this GMO corn it's just not

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
or wasn't this GMO corn it's just not
something<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:50.880> really<00:01:51.149> answer<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.780> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
something you can really answer and so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.490 
something you can really answer and so
to<00:01:53.009> keep<00:01:53.280> something<00:01:53.610> separate<00:01:54.500> actually

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
to keep something separate actually

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.350 
to keep something separate actually
requires<00:01:56.040> sort<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.700> completely

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
requires sort of a completely

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
requires sort of a completely
independent<00:01:57.600> grain<00:01:58.500> handling<00:01:58.890> system<00:01:59.460> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
independent grain handling system and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.149 
independent grain handling system and
that<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.630> done<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.619> comes<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that can be done but that comes with a

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.880 
that can be done but that comes with a
cost<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:03.270> every<00:02:03.540> truck<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.560> isn't

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
cost because every truck that isn't

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.340 
cost because every truck that isn't
completely<00:02:05.430> filled<00:02:05.820> every<00:02:06.270> silo<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.049> isn't

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
completely filled every silo that isn't

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.800 
completely filled every silo that isn't
completely<00:02:07.740> filled<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:09.149> dedicated

completely filled and just dedicated

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.530 
completely filled and just dedicated

crops we're talking about is a lot more

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.699 
crops we're talking about is a lot more
practical<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.849> just<00:02:21.299> label<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.140> very<00:02:22.349> small

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
practical to just label the very small

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.949 
practical to just label the very small

that<00:02:24.989> work<00:02:25.439> to<00:02:25.709> keep<00:02:26.280> separate<00:02:26.819> rather<00:02:27.390> than

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
that work to keep separate rather than

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.660 
that work to keep separate rather than
to<00:02:27.959> try<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.500> doing<00:02:28.829> some<00:02:29.069> sort<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.340> tracking

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
to try to be doing some sort of tracking

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.589 
to try to be doing some sort of tracking
over<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.120> entire<00:02:30.510> system<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.340> those<00:02:33.060> labels

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
over the entire system and those labels

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.750 
over the entire system and those labels
already<00:02:34.200> exist<00:02:34.620> people<00:02:35.069> are<00:02:35.159> allowed<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.430> make

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
already exist people are allowed to make

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.000 
already exist people are allowed to make
those<00:02:36.030> claims<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.900> non-gmo<00:02:37.319> even<00:02:37.920> though

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
those claims of non-gmo even though

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.460 
those claims of non-gmo even though
there's<00:02:38.250> no<00:02:38.430> safety<00:02:38.849> reason<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.989> they<00:02:40.109> can<00:02:40.319> do

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
there's no safety reason but they can do

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.399 
there's no safety reason but they can do
that<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.280> that's<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.209> lot<00:02:42.450> more<00:02:42.719> logical

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
that and so that's a lot more logical

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.770 
that and so that's a lot more logical
way<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> do<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.099> than<00:02:44.280> trying<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:45.299> get<00:02:45.480> one

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
way to do it than trying to get one

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.770 
way to do it than trying to get one
state<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.530> tell<00:02:47.129> an<00:02:47.489> entire<00:02:47.879> country<00:02:48.450> how<00:02:48.720> to
