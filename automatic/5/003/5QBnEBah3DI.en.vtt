and besides playing this way is actually
very<00:02:27.080> consuming<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.769> term<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.010> resource<00:02:28.430> so

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
very consuming in term of resource so

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.780 
very consuming in term of resource so
the<00:02:30.049> player<00:02:30.319> uses<00:02:31.069> those<00:02:31.220> resource<00:02:31.580> like

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
the player uses those resource like

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.180 
the player uses those resource like
powers<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.450> his<00:02:32.569> mana<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.680> its<00:02:33.890> health

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
powers and his mana and its health

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.440 
powers and his mana and its health
potions<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.910> he<00:02:35.180> has<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.480> use<00:02:35.629> them<00:02:35.780> carefully

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:52.229 

might<00:02:41.450> be<00:02:41.569> watching<00:02:41.720> Nia<00:02:47.620> take<00:02:48.620> out<00:02:48.829> his<00:02:48.950> way

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.729 

so<00:02:53.239> here<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.540> players<00:02:53.780> stop<00:02:54.140> time<00:02:54.440> just

so here the players stop time just

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:55.930 
so here the players stop time just

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
here we are using wind blast to bounce

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:19.060 
here we are using wind blast to bounce

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
phosphorescent arrows back at them is

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.660 
phosphorescent arrows back at them is
another<00:06:24.290> combination<00:06:24.860> of<00:06:25.280> game<00:06:25.550> mechanics

another combination of game mechanics
that<00:06:26.150> we<00:06:26.210> did<00:06:26.360> not<00:06:26.390> plan<00:06:26.750> for<00:06:26.780> but<00:06:27.290> players

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
that we did not plan for but players

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.920 
that we did not plan for but players
found<00:06:27.800> it<00:06:27.920> quite<00:06:28.040> fun<00:06:28.400> so<00:06:28.850> we<00:06:29.060> made<00:06:29.480> some<00:06:29.660> small

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
found it quite fun so we made some small

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:43.740 
found it quite fun so we made some small
changes<00:06:29.990> to<00:06:30.500> help<00:06:30.680> support<00:06:30.860> it

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.600 

these<00:06:44.750> stilt-walker<00:06:45.350> guards<00:06:45.919> the<00:06:46.190> tall

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
these stilt-walker guards the tall

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.270 
these stilt-walker guards the tall
voices<00:06:47.060> they're<00:06:47.240> called<00:06:47.510> have<00:06:48.280> vulnerable

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
voices they're called have vulnerable

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.300 
voices they're called have vulnerable
tanks<00:06:49.700> of<00:06:49.850> whale<00:06:50.090> oil<00:06:50.330> on<00:06:50.630> their<00:06:50.810> backs<00:06:51.310> that

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
tanks of whale oil on their backs that

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.840 
tanks of whale oil on their backs that
they<00:06:52.430> use<00:06:52.669> for<00:06:53.000> their<00:06:53.800> incendiary<00:06:54.800> arrows<00:06:55.490> and

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
they use for their incendiary arrows and

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.820 
they use for their incendiary arrows and
so<00:06:56.030> periodically<00:06:56.780> the<00:06:57.169> player<00:06:57.380> is<00:06:57.530> shooting

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
so periodically the player is shooting

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.860 
so periodically the player is shooting
at<00:06:57.919> those<00:06:58.040> tanks<00:06:58.520> stopping<00:06:59.330> time<00:06:59.480> trying<00:06:59.840> to

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
at those tanks stopping time trying to

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.320 
at those tanks stopping time trying to
get<00:06:59.990> behind<00:07:00.290> them<00:07:00.500> the<00:07:01.430> shield's<00:07:01.910> all<00:07:02.030> around

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
get behind them the shield's all around

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.780 
get behind them the shield's all around
them<00:07:02.540> are<00:07:02.720> actual<00:07:03.230> breakable<00:07:04.010> wooden<00:07:04.280> shields

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
them are actual breakable wooden shields

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.270 
them are actual breakable wooden shields
so<00:07:05.030> they<00:07:05.389> absorb<00:07:06.350> some<00:07:06.560> of<00:07:06.590> the<00:07:06.710> players<00:07:06.889> shot

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
so they absorb some of the players shot

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.980 
so they absorb some of the players shot
but<00:07:07.550> periodically<00:07:07.910> the<00:07:08.240> player<00:07:08.450> breaks<00:07:08.780> one

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
but periodically the player breaks one

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.960 
but periodically the player breaks one
of<00:07:09.110> them<00:07:09.230> off<00:07:12.490> here<00:07:13.490> the<00:07:13.610> player<00:07:13.820> just

light is a Tesla like security device

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.040 
light is a Tesla like security device
that's<00:07:25.400> a<00:07:25.520> powerful<00:07:25.790> electrical<00:07:26.450> field<00:07:26.780> and

that's a powerful electrical field and
