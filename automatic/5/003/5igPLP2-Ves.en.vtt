00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
until it starts to feel thick I that may

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.790 
until it starts to feel thick I that may
sound<00:00:27.420> strange<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.990> some<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.560> who<00:00:28.710> are

sound strange to some of you who are

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.970 
sound strange to some of you who are
used<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> measuring<00:00:29.460> everything<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.830> is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
used to measuring everything but this is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.790 
used to measuring everything but this is
one<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> those<00:00:32.369> things<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:33.290> it's<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.440> even

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
one of those things that it's not even

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.520 
one of those things that it's not even
bother<00:00:34.980> measuring<00:00:35.809> just<00:00:36.809> dump<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.320> until

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
bother measuring just dump it in until

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.470 
bother measuring just dump it in until
it<00:00:37.649> starts<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:39.649> thick<00:00:40.649> creamy

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
it starts to get a thick creamy

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.130 
it starts to get a thick creamy
consistency<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.930> let<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
consistency to it and you just let it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.889 
consistency to it and you just let it
cook<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> few<00:00:46.770> minutes<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.430> done<00:00:47.899> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
cook for a few minutes and it's done the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
cook for a few minutes and it's done the
the<00:00:49.350> course<00:00:49.680> through<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> grain<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the course through the grain on the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.729 
the course through the grain on the
cornmeal<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> grits<00:00:53.129> longer<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.910> takes<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
cornmeal or the grits longer it takes to

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.029 
cornmeal or the grits longer it takes to
cook<00:00:56.690> it's<00:00:57.690> almost<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.890> it's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
cook it's almost there you can see it's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.830 
cook it's almost there you can see it's
getting<00:00:59.370> a<00:01:01.640> little<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.940> thick<00:01:03.329> texture

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
getting a little bit of thick texture

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.380 
getting a little bit of thick texture
there<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.210> it's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
there you can see it in there it's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.899 
there you can see it in there it's
definitely<00:01:07.549> definitely<00:01:08.549> getting<00:01:09.060> thick

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.539 

almost<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> thick<00:01:16.170> hollandaise<00:01:16.770> texture

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
almost like a thick hollandaise texture

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.899 
almost like a thick hollandaise texture
now<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.250> thickens<00:01:20.759> up

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
now you can see it really thickens up

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.190 
now you can see it really thickens up
from<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.299> point<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:23.780> bubbles<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.930> turns

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
from this point and bubbles and turns

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.780 
from this point and bubbles and turns
I'll<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> lid<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> cook<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.640> few

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
I'll put a lid on it cook it for a few

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.410 
I'll put a lid on it cook it for a few
minutes<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.820> basically<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.150> come

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
minutes and then basically just come

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.660 
minutes and then basically just come
back<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.740> finish<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.009> lots<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> butter

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
back and finish it with lots of butter

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.740 
back and finish it with lots of butter
and<00:01:33.409> of<00:01:34.409> course<00:01:34.909> parmigiano-reggiano<00:01:35.909> or

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and of course parmigiano-reggiano or

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.899 
and of course parmigiano-reggiano or
grate<00:01:37.110> some<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> there<00:01:37.860> season<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> up

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
grate some of that in there season it up

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.179 
grate some of that in there season it up
with<00:01:39.150> some<00:01:39.299> salt<00:01:39.600> maybe<00:01:40.290> some<00:01:40.590> pepper<00:01:40.829> I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
with some salt maybe some pepper I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.200 
with some salt maybe some pepper I
usually<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.670> even<00:01:41.880> worry<00:01:42.000> about<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
usually don't even worry about the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.539 
usually don't even worry about the
pepper<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> cheese<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.220> salt

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
pepper I think the cheese and the salt

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.550 
pepper I think the cheese and the salt
is<00:01:44.939> enough<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> finishing<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.530> with

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
is enough and the finishing it with

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280 
is enough and the finishing it with
butter<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.270> takes<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.049> see

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
butter is all it takes but you can see

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
butter is all it takes but you can see
in<00:01:49.439> there<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.369> certain<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
in there it's really certain to get that

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.270 
in there it's really certain to get that
texture<00:01:52.399> feeling<00:01:53.399> off<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> sides<00:01:54.090> there

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
texture feeling off to the sides there

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.039 
texture feeling off to the sides there
and<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.150> finished<00:01:56.420> product<00:01:56.780> should<00:01:56.869> be<00:01:57.020> a

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
and the finished product should be a

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.719 
and the finished product should be a
little<00:01:57.409> bit<00:01:57.680> thicker<00:01:57.890> than<00:01:58.130> an<00:01:58.250> applesauce

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
little bit thicker than an applesauce

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.810 
little bit thicker than an applesauce
almost<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.450> mashed<00:01:59.720> potatoes<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:01.460> that's

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
almost like mashed potatoes so that's

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.930 
almost like mashed potatoes so that's
pull<00:02:02.210> into<00:02:02.330> 101<00:02:03.130> really<00:02:04.130> not<00:02:04.310> difficult<00:02:04.549> to

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
pull into 101 really not difficult to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.440 
pull into 101 really not difficult to
make<00:02:05.210> just<00:02:06.170> don't<00:02:06.380> want<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.790> add<00:02:07.790> too<00:02:08.270> much

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450
