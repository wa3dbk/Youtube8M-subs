00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.649
 Anydata boys should do the latex stroke 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:20.899
 it was the goalkeeper if we are going to give him we are going to put stones to our style 

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:24.049
 because the front stroke has to be in one piece 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.769
 they are servera equity stiglitz 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.560
 the doubles of art 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.160
 just as in the other layout we are going to take our street side 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.390
 that remembering here 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.720
 are three centimeters longer than the lara state index 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.129
 instead of 41 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.039
 they will be 44 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.050
 + 3 centimeters for these purposes 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.140
 matched we took twice 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.950
 44 plus three centimeters of postures 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.810
 chinchilla we join our lines 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
 to make our pattern 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.860
 that's why we already have in the region 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.910
 without ceasing as in the back 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.120
 to start with what is the neck 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.479
 instead of sending to the court the three and a half 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.479
 because in this one we are going to kill the eight centimeters 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.480
 at 8 ' 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.070
 so here it was extended on the shoulder as in the other 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 at six and a half centimeters 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.670
 i our friendship back 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 we march up to the boat further down 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.060
 to go through those two lines 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.250
 and the letter the three and a half centimeters to be our shoulder inclination 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.410
 here we are not going to go down the straight line at eleven thirty but we are going 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.510
 to mark 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.260
 there where she 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.179
 is if we get half 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.329
 to start parts put there centimeter and a half 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.470
 to be honest report 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.460
 and we pay the same as in the other 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.519
 at 20 centimeters 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.749
 to take the measurement of the bust 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.529
 they are assuming that the time here the report of the neck to go giving 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.529
 figure of our backwardness 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.779
 i take the measurement of the bust 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.779
 93 cheese 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.689
 we doubled our knees once 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.079
 remember that gustavo square 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.849
 the two increase 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.439
 the usual series 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.079
 and then here we're going to start a little bit out 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.079
 doing our ricordi 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.459
 to take it out 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.740
 Yesterday we took the measurement of the bust 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.410
 and I have more culled the cut in front 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.569
 then we go with nothing 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.599
 5 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.430
 likewise the forward at eight centimeters we are going to mark the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.239
 difference 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.059
 but instead of three centimeters it's going to be 5 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.149
 of five centimeters 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:26.159
 and we will continue 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.880
 At the height of the bust usually the height of the bust almost always 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.150
 we have it between 100 6 and 7 centimeters has arrived this week to 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.569
 the 15 cents 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.599
 and as it has been raised since last 12 of 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.369
 well then let's separate our province 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.619
 the next day since it's very interesting 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.079
 yesterday on Monday amd graphic artists are taking us figure tickets 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.749
 but now that we are approaching 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.409
 the east but this forward has interest in you more meters 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.929
 long than the standard 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:12.979
 Well, let's take our waist measurement, which is 78 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:19.389
 we doubled our sitting times to get the fourth mismatch 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.490
 accommodated our next year 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.300
 to show the electoral interest 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.300
 more than 1 5 of the piece 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.870
 posture masters 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.210
 we have the said church three centimeters longer than india after 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:42.270
 london is fourth plus five souls 3 + 3 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.990
 quarter 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.330
 +5 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.939
 master 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.099
 master 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.629
 and now 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.629
 given this unit is the bust line 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.970
 to the last line that already in eighths where we live 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.559
 the three that was the difference 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.089
 let's mark 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.279
 of the bust 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:18.569
 I liked the piece we put our tape in this club and we're going to make a 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.050
 separation of four centimeters 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.659
 of sentimental theater 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.860
 if you have it here I saw it fair will be three centimeters can sometimes be two 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.500
 sometimes it can be five good so here and we also go up here three 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.210
 centimeters 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.360
 and we do 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.360
 let's make our side track 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.039
 so that we can figure out the layout 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.069
 and now yes 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.599
 we mark here our three centimeters of the moral cost 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:56.749
 and we lower it until 15 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.770
 but as if we had not done 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.550
 we work from the top to the bottom and the piece 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.180
 down 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.479
 in the clamp down 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.849
 we mark here we finish our line in June 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.749
 and it will come out 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:19.949
 this layout in which we are going to take here 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.520
 We are going to make this artist it was time that we already know the case 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.610
 that is before we will give this line with this and this or other causes 

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:33.319
 We took him lieutenant days after the sovereign who have time to 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.919
 practice this transport 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.240
 time ago 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.960
 the practice is important
