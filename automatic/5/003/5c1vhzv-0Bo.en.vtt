00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.980
 to the pm audit 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.730
 the report indicates several 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.430
 irregularities that would have been 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 committed within the assembled regiment of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.689
 military police 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.430
 in 40 pages the complainant points out what 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.859
 happens in the dependencies of the barracks 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.529

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.690
 pm and even private 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.149

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.910
 displayed the photos shows a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.670
 treatment that the animals receive 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.040
 veterinary care 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.510
 special periodic examinations 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.399
 everything would be paid with public money 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.129
 see this information after a 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.559
 consult the veterinarian to note the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.980
 diagnosis in the evaluation of anemia 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.750
 infectious is a particular horse but the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.539
 field that must indicate a name of the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.500
 shows that he is an animal of the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.750
 military police 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.420
 to be honest I did not have access to a 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.160
 document that speaks of this theme but 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.050
 come being they are under the 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.240
 responsibility of the military police but 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.700
 are not dependent if not only pm was 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.460
 assume the responsibility 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.260
 the Colonel Sartorius admitted the permanence 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.690
 of horses in the regiment 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.660
 he claims that they are 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.420
 owners to be breeding 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.630
 but the colonel himself acknowledges that he 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.960
 there is a legal document stating 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.790
 formalize the presence of animals within 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.160
 of the regiment supporting this was not 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.160
 document is not final because they are 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.289
 sessions that are held annually in a 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.710
 period of four to six months, which is 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.560
 period of coverage and a contract 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.170
 until authorized verbal not 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.270
 would require an assignment of use 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.030
 more elaborate contract 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.030
 you short periods of one animal 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.890
 it would not be just a verbal contract 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.030
 damage to friends in a 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.150
 conversation to an authorized 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.370
 private horses service done by 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.070
 military police officers who would be 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.230
 on duty they would have looked for the animals 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.260

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.600

 on duty refused to do the service 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.640
 but the animals did not wait for police officers 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.470
 military were off agreed 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:44.470 --> 00:03:14.959

00:02:47.270 --> 00:03:18.080

 Olympic sport of such amplitude 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.100
 but the commander of the assembled regiment 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.470
 denied that they had been withdrawn 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.770

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.419
 where the narcotics were 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.210

 the investigation to determine the case 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.720
 it would only have happened 15 days later 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.070
 when the news was published in the newspaper
