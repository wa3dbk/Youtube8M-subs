00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.530 

I<00:05:22.660> think<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.720> last<00:05:23.930> ones<00:05:24.140> in<00:05:24.260> coral<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.580> don't

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
I think the last ones in coral I don't

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.560 
I think the last ones in coral I don't
remember<00:05:26.870> what<00:05:27.170> this<00:05:27.320> one<00:05:27.560> is<00:05:27.770> if<00:05:28.670> if<00:05:29.090> I<00:05:29.300> check

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
remember what this one is if if I check

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.260 
remember what this one is if if I check
it<00:05:29.690> out<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.200> does<00:05:30.440> seem<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.980> be<00:05:31.160> a<00:05:31.460> longer

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
it out and it does seem to be a longer

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.440 
it out and it does seem to be a longer
one<00:05:32.540> of<00:05:32.690> when<00:05:32.870> I<00:05:32.900> remember<00:05:33.410> it<00:05:33.970> will<00:05:34.970> probably

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
one of when I remember it will probably

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.450 
one of when I remember it will probably
will<00:05:35.930> probably<00:05:36.320> just<00:05:36.440> stop<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:36.860> video<00:05:37.130> and

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
will probably just stop the video and

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.790 
will probably just stop the video and
complete<00:05:38.090> it<00:05:38.420> in<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.660> next<00:05:38.930> one<00:05:39.110> we<00:05:39.770> have

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
complete it in the next one we have

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.700 
complete it in the next one we have
about<00:05:40.100> 11<00:05:40.490> minutes<00:05:40.640> to<00:05:40.880> do<00:05:41.060> it<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:41.710> hopefully

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
about 11 minutes to do it and hopefully

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.840 
about 11 minutes to do it and hopefully
it<00:05:42.920> won't<00:05:43.010> won't<00:05:43.460> even<00:05:43.760> take<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:43.970> long<00:05:45.460> so

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.480 

here<00:05:49.850> we<00:05:49.970> go

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
here we go

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.060 
here we go
that<00:05:52.490> one<00:05:52.670> was<00:05:52.850> that<00:05:53.180> one's<00:05:53.360> really<00:05:53.960> easy<00:05:57.070> but

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
that one was that one's really easy but

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.040 
that one was that one's really easy but
that<00:05:58.280> was<00:05:58.430> just<00:05:58.670> a<00:05:58.850> lot<00:05:59.360> of<00:05:59.480> times<00:05:59.660> it'll<00:05:59.840> just

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050
