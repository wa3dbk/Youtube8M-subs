00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
Lily it's 480p which is a little bit

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.910 
Lily it's 480p which is a little bit
nicer<00:00:49.649> than<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.430> 480i<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.930> whatever<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.829> is

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
nicer than the 480i or whatever it is

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.260 
nicer than the 480i or whatever it is
for<00:00:53.100> standard<00:00:53.460> TV<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.980> basically<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:57.180> know

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
for standard TV and basically you know

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.560 
for standard TV and basically you know
your<00:00:57.899> two<00:00:58.620> cables<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.280> ps3<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.359> Wii

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
your two cables your ps3 and your Wii

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.729 
your two cables your ps3 and your Wii
and<00:01:00.980> then<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.300> white<00:01:04.229> which<00:01:04.559> is

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and then you have the white which is

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.460 
and then you have the white which is
your<00:01:04.769> rebel<00:01:05.309> leave<00:01:05.519> left<00:01:05.820> audio<00:01:06.140> red<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
your rebel leave left audio red is the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
your rebel leave left audio red is the
right<00:01:07.619> audio<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.040> believe<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> green

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
right audio I believe and then the green

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.320 
right audio I believe and then the green
which<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.100> non<00:01:11.100> color<00:01:11.460> video<00:01:12.979> out<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
which is a non color video out so you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.130 
which is a non color video out so you
can<00:01:15.659> hook<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> TV<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.299> set<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.509> so

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can hook it up to a TV and set it up so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
can hook it up to a TV and set it up so
at<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.530> place<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.400> VGA

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
at this place for your VGA

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.890 
at this place for your VGA
now<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.590> VGA<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> Xbox<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.659> you've

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
now this VGA now like the Xbox if you've

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.410 
now this VGA now like the Xbox if you've
got<00:01:25.140> an<00:01:25.290> Xbox<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.630> tell

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
got an Xbox one this one is you can tell

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.380 
got an Xbox one this one is you can tell
it's<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> female<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.369> can't<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.060> connect

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it's a female so you can't just connect

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.499 
it's a female so you can't just connect
it<00:01:33.540> directly<00:01:33.720> into<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.490> monitor<00:01:36.090> itself

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
it directly into the monitor itself

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.859 
it directly into the monitor itself
because<00:01:37.170> monitor<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:41.869> so

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
because monitor is just like that and so

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.609 
because monitor is just like that and so
you<00:01:42.899> can't<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.520> straight<00:01:44.520> connect<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
bad thing is is this is an out so you

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.900 
bad thing is is this is an out so you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
plug these two in now red with red white

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.199 
plug these two in now red with red white

this will plug into your speakers but if

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.830 
this will plug into your speakers but if
you<00:02:58.989> have<00:02:59.140> speakers<00:02:59.620> like<00:02:59.859> mine<00:03:00.190> my<00:03:00.909> plug<00:03:01.420> for

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
you have speakers like mine my plug for

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.720 
you have speakers like mine my plug for
my<00:03:01.870> speakers<00:03:02.290> are<00:03:02.440> just<00:03:02.739> like<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.159> it<00:03:03.459> won't

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
my speakers are just like this it won't

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.349 
my speakers are just like this it won't
have<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.239> input<00:03:04.870> as<00:03:05.049> an<00:03:05.709> output<00:03:06.040> for<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.430> input

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
have a input as an output for that input

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.940 
have a input as an output for that input
so<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:08.769> could<00:03:09.190> plug<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.359> into<00:03:10.540> an<00:03:10.930> input<00:03:11.470> for<00:03:11.680> a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
so you could plug it into an input for a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.380 
so you could plug it into an input for a
computer<00:03:12.519> if<00:03:12.640> you're<00:03:12.790> playing<00:03:12.940> right<00:03:13.090> by<00:03:13.239> your

computer if you're playing right by your

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.650 
computer if you're playing right by your
computer<00:03:13.659> and<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:15.670> would<00:03:15.849> work<00:03:15.879> that<00:03:16.060> way<00:03:16.540> yeah

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
computer and it would work that way yeah

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.210 
computer and it would work that way yeah

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
instead of a male you can get a female

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.530 
instead of a male you can get a female
one<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:26.470> RCA<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.250> then<00:03:27.970> plug<00:03:28.269> in<00:03:28.419> your

one of RCA and then plug in your
speaker's<00:03:28.870> directly<00:03:29.319> into<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:31.349> basically

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
speaker's directly into that basically

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.330 
speaker's directly into that basically
the<00:03:32.440> same<00:03:32.590> concept<00:03:32.799> as<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.519> VGA<00:03:34.269> plug<00:03:35.340> which

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
the same concept as the VGA plug which

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.580 
the same concept as the VGA plug which
is<00:03:36.730> pretty<00:03:37.510> easy<00:03:37.720> um

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
is pretty easy um

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.339 
is pretty easy um
altogether<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:40.209> liked<00:03:40.599> this<00:03:40.750> cable<00:03:41.139> I<00:03:41.169> got

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
altogether I I liked this cable I got

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.039 
altogether I I liked this cable I got
mine<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.560> think<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:42.040> was<00:03:42.129> like<00:03:42.220> realm<00:03:43.180> 25<00:03:43.840> to

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
mine I think it was like realm 25 to

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.949 
mine I think it was like realm 25 to
three<00:03:44.290> dollars

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
three dollars

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.080 
three dollars
it<00:03:46.959> works<00:03:47.199> good<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:48.220> only<00:03:48.280> problem<00:03:48.699> is<00:03:48.819> with

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
it works good the only problem is with

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.819 
it works good the only problem is with
by<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:50.199> machine<00:03:51.129> monitor<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.510> tends<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.139> have<00:03:53.889> a

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
by a machine monitor it tends to have a

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.259 
by a machine monitor it tends to have a
shadow<00:03:56.829> lines<00:03:57.250> going<00:03:57.519> through<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:57.970> screen

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
shadow lines going through the screen

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.309 
shadow lines going through the screen
going<00:03:58.629> upward<00:03:58.989> and<00:04:00.629> again<00:04:01.629> you<00:04:01.930> go<00:04:02.049> really

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
going upward and again you go really

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.750 
going upward and again you go really
noticeable<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:02.949> gets<00:04:03.069> really<00:04:03.190> annoying<00:04:03.459> so

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
noticeable so it gets really annoying so

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.039 
noticeable so it gets really annoying so
