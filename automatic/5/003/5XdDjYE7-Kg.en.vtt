all right take an empty tire rim to rim
as<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.540> know<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.750> lot<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.049> people<00:00:07.170> have<00:00:07.529> been

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.169 
having a bit of trouble with it the
first<00:00:09.780> dish<00:00:10.550> to<00:00:11.550> make<00:00:11.670> sure<00:00:11.849> you've<00:00:12.000> got<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
first dish to make sure you've got the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.470 
first dish to make sure you've got the
tire<00:00:12.480> broken<00:00:12.929> off<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.469> beat<00:00:14.210> will<00:00:15.210> fall<00:00:15.450> down

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
tire broken off the beat will fall down

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.410 
tire broken off the beat will fall down
an<00:00:15.809> edge<00:00:18.170> so<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.410> ends<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.770> like<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.420> we

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
an edge so that it ends up like so we

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.080 
an edge so that it ends up like so we
fold<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.869> down<00:00:22.020> under<00:00:22.500> its<00:00:22.650> own<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.519> pressure

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
fold it down under its own the pressure

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.049 
fold it down under its own the pressure
avatar<00:00:24.539> there<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:28.670> part<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.170> gonna<00:00:31.260> get

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
avatar there right part so you gonna get

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.770 
avatar there right part so you gonna get
get<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> gap<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> tire<00:00:34.020> seat<00:00:35.780> alright

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
get a gap there in the tire seat alright

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110 
get a gap there in the tire seat alright
and<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.739> edge<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> tire<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.790> edge<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and the edge of the tire the edge of the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.700 
and the edge of the tire the edge of the
rim<00:00:39.300> goes<00:00:39.570> within<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> tire<00:00:40.610> alright<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
rim goes within the tire alright and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.700 
rim goes within the tire alright and
find<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> quite<00:00:44.010> easy<00:00:44.600> from<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.809> put<00:00:46.559> some

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
find that quite easy from there put some

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.459 
find that quite easy from there put some
pressure<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> outside<00:00:47.640> edge<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.469> it'll

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
pressure on the outside edge and it'll

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.560 
pressure on the outside edge and it'll
pop<00:00:49.500> through<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:52.260> outside<00:00:53.270> pull<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.420> as

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
pop through the outside pull it out as

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.740 
pop through the outside pull it out as
far<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.940> put<00:00:56.940> push<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.329> down<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
far as you can put push it down on the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.490 
far as you can put push it down on the
edge<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.120> bead<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.270> tire<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.079> on

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
edge of the bead of the tire here and on

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.479 
edge of the bead of the tire here and on
the<00:01:01.530> room<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.949> roll<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.619> easy<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:05.280> one

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the room and roll it out easy that's one

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.880 
the room and roll it out easy that's one
okay<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.810> Front's<00:01:07.170> pretty<00:01:07.350> much<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> same

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
okay the Front's pretty much the same

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.280 
okay the Front's pretty much the same
front<00:01:08.640> fish<00:01:09.290> getting<00:01:10.290> broken<00:01:10.820> mounting<00:01:11.820> them

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
front fish getting broken mounting them

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.800 
front fish getting broken mounting them
mounting<00:01:13.290> them<00:01:14.090> there's<00:01:15.090> pretty<00:01:15.420> much<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
mounting them there's pretty much the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.740 
mounting them there's pretty much the
exact<00:01:16.110> opposite<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.840> use<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> use<00:01:20.479> some<00:01:21.479> sort<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
exact opposite so use a use some sort of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.219 
exact opposite so use a use some sort of
tired<00:01:22.049> i<00:01:22.380> er<00:01:22.680> um<00:01:24.920> look<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.130> blue<00:01:26.340> but

tired i er um look not blue but
something<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.560> these<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.310> already

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
something like that these have already

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.929 
something like that these have already
been<00:01:29.579> done<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.710> them<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
been done so to get them in it's the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.510 
been done so to get them in it's the
wrong<00:01:33.770> all<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> side<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.430> rumen<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.220> it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
wrong all the side of the rumen and it's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.609 
wrong all the side of the rumen and it's
the<00:01:38.579> same<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> same<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.409> room

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the same is the same to get the room

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.020 
the same is the same to get the room
through<00:01:41.060> hold<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.240> down<00:01:42.420> hold<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.610> so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
through hold it down hold it down so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.620 
through hold it down hold it down so
that<00:01:45.060> it's

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.880 

stuck<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:48.870> like<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.230> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.650> can<00:01:49.770> might

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
stuck down like that so you can might

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.560 
stuck down like that so you can might
have<00:01:49.980> to<00:01:50.100> crush<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> side<00:01:50.670> wall<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.060> bit

created but your thumb into the hollow

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.940 
created but your thumb into the hollow
you've<00:01:57.690> just<00:01:57.930> created<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:59.180> then<00:02:00.180> pressure<00:02:00.950> on

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you've just created and then pressure on

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.180 
you've just created and then pressure on
the<00:02:02.280> outside<00:02:02.670> side<00:02:02.970> walls<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> come

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
the outside side walls and then you come

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:15.040 
the outside side walls and then you come
fronts<00:02:08.190> are<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> same<00:02:12.830> create<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.950> hollow

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
fronts are the same create that hollow

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.880 
by the hollow and push it through fronts
gonna<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> little<00:02:28.020> bit<00:02:28.170> tricky<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.530> get<00:02:28.740> off

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
gonna be a little bit tricky to get off

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.870 
gonna be a little bit tricky to get off
here<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:30.300> same<00:02:30.570> principle<00:02:30.959> applies<00:02:31.880> you
