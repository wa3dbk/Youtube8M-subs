 because the part is not for me is like 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.859
 I will be able to test it for a few days 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.330
 and then I have to pass on now 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.470
 that's why I have to hurry up now 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 Unpack things and then 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.960
 reasonable to test and point two 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.529
 Dusseldorf is after the museums I have to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.570
 Now go ahead and do not have to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.550
 But you can spend that much time 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.469
 promise sunday and above all 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210
 the next week will be review week and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.160
 Comparative week I'll be there with you 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.660
 videos will be slain there again 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 say you want to make technology 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.520
 please a simple one again 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.260
 unboxing video so but the logitech 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.719
 keyboard folio mini that went to the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 Christmas time was the carved out of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.829
 all corners and ends really cheap 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.719
 then there was the 20 euro cashback 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 action so you got the thing believe 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.800
 I converted for 30 euros or something 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 I have it much cheaper now 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.869
 shot on ebay the thing is new 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.479
 has been opened and the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.760
 Packaging is slightly damaged and something 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.850
 I'm not interested in that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.280
 I care more like strikes 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.530
 in comparison to the later 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 logitech alcasynn I am really there 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.880
 a fan especially at the ipad he ipad 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.159
 mini is so straight but that 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.909
 I am very interested in how much 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.400
 because that the folio can keep up 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.590
 So of infos to the foot there you need 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.950
 not much say protection cover and easy 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.409
 type keyboard for the ipad mini means 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.329
 for normal mini and 4 retina mini and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.009
 then let's see once open daily 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.430
 the packaging is very nice 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.290
 easy and then we have any 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.119
 info no as I said it was already 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.250
 once again, we have our 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.210
 white charger I like that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.890
 color it fits usb to micro usb with 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.719
 This logitech accessory is available 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.659
 no lightning that just for the 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.079
 ios devices then we have the cover here 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.179
 ok then packed and glued 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.530
 on the ground 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.299
 something out the handbook to all right can 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.799
 Of course that will explain that then 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.390
 needs and I think to myself on and off 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.370
 switch well it is a bluetooth 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.599
 product and yes someone who deals with it 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.969
 Unknowing of course, he wonders 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.650
 how do i get the keyboard with mine 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:29.010
 Connected ipad I need about there 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.420
 cable to okay the pros but otto 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.189
 normal user thinks now 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.989
 of course, are entitled to ask the 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.659
 forget you forget technology 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.099
 will be there again and again so we have 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.829
 the good thing I have here now 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.049
 blue version does not look that way 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.879
 So it does not look good 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.590
 No leather here I'm glad 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.389
 that I'm not on imitation leather or 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.519
 no cheese is any 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.950
 high gloss plastic but solid blue 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.590
 I like that from the outside 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.459
 open something and we recognize directly 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.139
 here is beautiful glossy processed since 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.489
 I wonder why, why do you need ? 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.489
 here's what funny scratch 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.250
 sensitive and natural 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.290
 fingerprint prone I like that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.239
 of course here with the white a lot 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.669
 better shines though but then will 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.099
 one prints and so does not matter 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.590
 we have a short layout so German 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.109
 layout no problem fn button the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.209
 passed known logitech failure 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.340
 keys and everything possible so the special 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.870
 they are all here , too 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.979
 Mark left mark right and 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.760
 anything again it 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.680
 written 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.739
 Well that fits and of course now as 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.370
 difference to the old one we have here 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.989
 rail where then the ipad mini comes in 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.069
 if you have threaded it once then 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.709
 it stays there then sometimes pushes 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.919
 resignation so now we have it in there and 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.739
 28 together 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.479
 So that's one weight I would 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.829
 Now definitely say that together 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:04:00.389
 we together as an ipad 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.709
 so is the question you need something like that 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.109
 I just get him there 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.970
 panic what if I'm the folio version 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.759
 for the ipad he would have how hard that 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.069
 combination more good let's look at it 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.530
 Everything is protected that is power 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.509
 a positive impression 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.549
 At the side I have my micro 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:19.919
 USB connection to the store and 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.779
 switch off and still I think so 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.079
 the bluetooth connection button yes there 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.629
 is 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.759
 bluetooth logo on it and otherwise have 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.400
 we do not care about anything, of course 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.599
 Little is noticeable that one less 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.069
 here the connections still looks from 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.030
 headphones a gear on and off 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.439
 and such things 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.060
 loud and quiet that you can also in 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.699
 closed state then comes when there 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.639
 somebody hears something with music or something 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.879
 and then while the speaker is using 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.469
 and or the ipad loads wonderfully 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.110
 but what is noticeable is the 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.580
 color differences and I like that 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.979
 not really no, not that 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.280
 silver to the ipad but black frame 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:59.190
 and then that bright opponent dark gray 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.060
 from the keyboard I like that 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.000
 visually not at all so i stayed 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.490
 But I like that in color 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.699
 unfortunately not good what was here with of 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.659
 Sleep asleep is now lying down 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.550
 not sleep 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.750
 that may surprise me, good 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.969
 probably the distance is here 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.740
 the magnets too far so that the 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.659
 must then gets always by hand account 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.960
 So no auto wake on trade off 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.490
 unfortunately not function but I will 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.539
 still test in detail if I 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.690
 me with the device a bit 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.430
 have employed 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.319
 of the size we let's see whether something like 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.479
 we can still set that up 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:37.400
 which is magnetic and we have one 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.990
 corner 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.639
 he is okay there is one more 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.379
 any other angle behind it may 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.259
 do not set up here so close to it 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:48.240
 not so apparently only this one 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.099
 I do not have to say an angle 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.620
 problem the lake seems similar to that of 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.779
 to be in contrast that is fine and 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.229
 then to tap your words you have 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:00.180
 a netbook feeling on it as of the 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.500
 alcasynn at the ipad he at the bigger one 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.339
 version but that should go well 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.819
 I would have thought here there is 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:10.860
 to create more angles 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.330
 optically colored here this bright 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.370
 said the gray now even tells me 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.039
 nothing sorry but there you are of course 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.979
 as an apple user also a bit stb 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:22.009
 what I am asking myself now is that 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.050
 Of course, something I like a lot 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.279
 that the huge disadvantage of my times 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.139
 made time you can maybe still here 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:31.490
 what change in the angle and so the 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.680
 hochstellen hoch wrote jobs 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.660
 probably also upright 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.340
 somehow, once I get out 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.930
 So I'll be the days too 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.569
 But test what am of course at 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.240
 old unfortunately is always disturbing because the 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.470
 you only open up to 180 degrees 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.199
 can anything over it 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.910
 then here solves the magnet here 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.740
 of course that one will be in the 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.180
 rail is in it I can also comfortable 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.630
 The keyboard to turn the thing 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.729
 pick up and then hold and look like that 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.020
 and as a normal tablet but it is 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.460
 of course hard 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.620
 I do not think that I'm all that 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.810
 Often, after that, of course, then 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.669
 again if I do not need that here 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.069
 extract the ipad 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:11.810
 Of course it takes then the left 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.550
 it just relatively fix that easy 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.900
 Redeem again to redeem 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.310
 Of course I will do that for the days now 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:21.380
 2000 times make first impression 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.090
 positive on the one hand negative what 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.729
 the optics are on the other side 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.280
 I am very curious what the 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:33.020
 next day everything to me keyboard 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.819
 folio from logitech just too much 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.240
 watching is good and the next one 

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:37.240
 Video
