 one of the cultivation techniques can increase cassava production in the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.759
 family agriculture 'is what a survey of the Embrapa 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.699

 with an eye on the increasingly demanding consumer 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.140
 the embratur wants to increase the quality of the product 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.050
 and developed techniques with varieties that are more resistant to pests 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.420
 in the last five years

 property in planaltina de goiás 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.679
 since it began to plant following the directions of the ungrateful 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.760
 he doubled the production mainly each variety 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.360
 that 27 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.170
 impressive nadir is very productive has more than one thousand four years that is very sweet 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.660
 nor neymar came who knew that I planted paulo ae so many the visitor 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.190
 if he was worth more cement he came in and talked to me and asked what he did not 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.490
 It is true that the team faces a pioneering 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.680
 and produced the cacao lock monroe goat 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.580
 e-mail change 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.600
 there and offered me 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.060
 a little love of a cell without two hundred bodies 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.060
 to me make a text cassava cristinha 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.810
 that's when I tried 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.860
 to-day with her the secrets to greater cassava 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.520
 distance between these 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.770
 here is where now there are two before they were planted 3 with this in the same area 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.030
 planting decreased the number of seedlings 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.080
 and increases productivity 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.200
 only the best varieties are chosen, this selection is not trickery 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.990
 only on the basis of the states

 this fear is that the whole follow-up process 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.510
 ie the crop report is resistant to pests and diseases 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.360
 and finally productivity in addition to increased production 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.039
 cassava also has better market acceptance 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.939
 the producers receive from Embrapa 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.639

 cattle
