and we had a few beers and we designed

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.400 
and we had a few beers and we designed
as<00:01:46.280> people<00:01:47.180> are<00:01:47.420> on<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.840> back<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.140> a

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
as people are on the back of a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.130 
as people are on the back of a
packet<00:01:48.619> really<00:01:49.550> yeah<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.450> then<00:01:50.750> we<00:01:50.840> went<00:01:50.990> to

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
packet really yeah and then we went to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.780 
packet really yeah and then we went to
MERIS<00:01:51.470> off<00:01:51.650> with<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.009> idea<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.400> they<00:01:52.460> really

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
MERIS off with the idea and they really

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.730 
MERIS off with the idea and they really
liked<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.450> just<00:01:53.509> went<00:01:54.020> from<00:01:54.110> there<00:01:54.259> on

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
liked it and it just went from there on

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.200 
liked it and it just went from there on
the<00:01:55.009> packet<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.490> way<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.759> state<00:01:56.000> table

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
the packet the way that state table

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.170 
the packet the way that state table
with<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.509> fab<00:01:56.690> pack<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.050> hand<00:01:57.860> yeah<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.610> think

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
with the fab pack in hand yeah I think

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.420 
with the fab pack in hand yeah I think
the<00:01:59.420> difference<00:01:59.750> today<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:00.860> the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the difference today is that it that the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.310 
the difference today is that it that the
budgets<00:02:01.910> are<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.210> big<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.690> teams<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.140> so

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
budgets are so big and the teams is so

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.950 
budgets are so big and the teams is so
big<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.770> comes<00:02:04.490> with<00:02:04.670> technology<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.539> know

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
big that comes with technology you know

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.410 
big that comes with technology you know
originally<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.649> advance<00:02:07.009> was<00:02:07.399> was<00:02:08.000> enough<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
originally the advance was was enough to

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.660 
originally the advance was was enough to
give<00:02:08.570> us<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.750> profit<00:02:09.009> without<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.190> royalties

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
