00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
once in a while but I don't really I'd

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.150 
once in a while but I don't really I'd
rather<00:05:06.449> give<00:05:06.690> another<00:05:06.870> round<00:05:07.289> of<00:05:07.680> course<00:05:07.949> of

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
rather give another round of course of

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.110

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.820 
course I don't know I feel like the
reverse<00:05:12.270> one<00:05:12.630> might<00:05:12.900> have<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.139> little<00:05:13.440> bit<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.680> a

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
reverse one might have a little bit of a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.529 
reverse one might have a little bit of a
stronger<00:05:14.070> head<00:05:14.400> but<00:05:14.610> maybe<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:14.940> just<00:05:15.240> like<00:05:15.389> the

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539

be hidden or yeah exactly it's much
harder<00:05:58.840> they<00:05:59.080> have<00:05:59.199> to<00:05:59.289> be<00:05:59.380> more<00:05:59.500> precise<00:05:59.889> but

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
harder they have to be more precise but

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.620 
harder they have to be more precise but
it<00:06:00.550> is<00:06:00.669> a<00:06:00.699> little<00:06:00.970> bit<00:06:01.120> more<00:06:01.330> in<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.539> other

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
it is a little bit more in the other

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.080 
it is a little bit more in the other
characters<00:06:01.810> favor<00:06:02.169> ideal<00:06:02.560> yeah<00:06:03.520> I<00:06:03.550> think<00:06:03.729> so<00:06:04.060> I

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
characters favor ideal yeah I think so I

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.990 
characters favor ideal yeah I think so I
this<00:06:04.240> is<00:06:04.569> definitely<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.990> stage<00:06:06.000> especially

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
this is definitely the stage especially

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.540 
this is definitely the stage especially
in<00:06:07.389> this<00:06:07.509> matchup<00:06:07.750> now

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
in this matchup now

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.400 
in this matchup now
now<00:06:09.060> Falcons<00:06:09.480> can<00:06:09.600> run<00:06:09.750> all<00:06:09.780> over<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.200> stage

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
now Falcons can run all over the stage

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.490 
now Falcons can run all over the stage
it<00:06:10.560> doesn't<00:06:10.800> like<00:06:11.100> he's<00:06:11.250> got<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.580> chance<00:06:11.730> to
