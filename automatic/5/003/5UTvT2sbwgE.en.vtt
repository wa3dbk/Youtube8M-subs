00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.710
 a very interesting set of which 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.680
 immediately comes and the battery and various 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.070
 types of chargers from such 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.670
 duty flashlight that is useful to all 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 which can be useful to all who 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 no need to buy more 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.899
 accessories as they all go with us 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.750
 Immediately in the kit comes bye. 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.360
 flashlight here in such a cardboard 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.610
 box 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 Immediately box plastic and apologize 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.200
 immediately I say that we have a little loop 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.340
 shalturili here there 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.289
 steel. here she is already lost but 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.399
 it's all the little things though box 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.340
 presents itself excellent and store and 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.040
 same place to transport everything in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.729
 kit let's see what we have 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 included carefully 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.479
 I suggest starting with a different 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.720
 accessories and then finish 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.659
 consideration of the lantern itself 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.540
 4 of us there is a power supply from the network 220 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.780
 volt is such a universal unit 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:31.400
 power 42 volts 1 amp with this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.990
 an adapter for the cradle 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.390
 which are mounted the flashlight itself 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.290
 such a tricky connector is needed so that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.640
 us not to confuse the polarity 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.180
 as we see in this case polarity 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.920
 confused physically impossible also 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.180
 the kit comes with two adapters under 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.180
 European plug 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.689
 and under the american and european flat 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.939
 the plug fits very well on 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.360
 the latch can not be removed are not easy to lose it 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.890
 you canâ€™t eat me enough 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:18.720
 a little button to make some effort she 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:24.349
 removed set we still have a block 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.220
 12 volt power supply for car 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.660
 respectively instead of the power supply 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.920
 hunt then we can use 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.410
 cigarette lighter here's a car not 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.329

 made of pretty thick strap and 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:57.359
 cardura unfortunately there is no possibility 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:01.290
 installing it on the actual gear 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:04.079
 type sea in dice trails included 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.950
 still dark and over put on a rubber band 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:11.250
 mccord now let's talk about the flashlight itself 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.720
 torch 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.120
 quite large over fist size 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.930
 tail 100 has nice buttons 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.310
 located just under the thumb 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.769
 flashlights soon when with does not turn on 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.450
 so if to be a kim movie then we 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.910
 There is a sticker that says that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.530
 must be removed 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.950
 protective films with batteries which 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.819
 there it is established that we are now 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.919
 and we will do but see what is inside 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.959
 the tail tail of the lantern is just 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.819
 aluminum plug which is not 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.370
 performs no role in the lyric chain 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.810
 Hansen 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.500
 here we see here these stubs they 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.470
 removed 1 2 after which the battery 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.579
 flashlight can be installed 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.500
 distinctive feature of the lantern series 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.200
 rc is what battery can 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.050
 set like so some from 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.480
 we have observed the polarity here 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.370
 sara on the battery itself 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.500
 think accordingly and in general 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.910
 change the battery in this when I'm not 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.180
 will need it as it charges 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.510
 inside the lantern 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:27.250
 rectangular profile rezinochka 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:27.820
 actually not blurred turns on 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.110
 lamp 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.530
 large mode button 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.870
 smaller button and going on the head 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.990
 there is a good radiator for cooling 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.740
 and here are the actual contacts themselves for 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.300
 charging lantern in the Kremlin as we see 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.490
 lantern in the corridor can only be installed 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.280
 in one position because he is with us 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.140
 accordingly shrinks and protection from 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.610
 fool and flashlight can only be set 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:03.300
 and the right way here is a flashlight 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.470
 stopped he does not play does not fall out 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.610
 accordingly stole this can be 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.120
 fixed on the table 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.520
 hung on the wall under the table already 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.980
 initially go through two holes 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.350
 which can make screws screws 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.300
 and fasten it on the surface where it is 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.950
 we will need him pour in working 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.270
 a place 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.000
 raspirator very simply stops 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.010
 also frost is the this so 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.919
 charging indicator on the very hide whether 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.870
 we don't have them either on the car 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.660
 cigarette lighter feet or on the power supply 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.210
 from the mains 220 volts 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.570
 Another interesting feature is that if 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.570
 when for post with battery off 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.460
 without the battery putting a flashlight and 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:52.030
 turn on it will just work from 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:54.270
 network 220 reflector flashlight not smooth 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.470
 textured 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.240
 stated brightness is more than 800 lumens or something 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.110
 such a small flashlight is quite 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.110
 enough 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.199
 light spot measure focused 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:19.909
 far enough 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:22.680
 There are 1 2 3 4 brightness modes 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:25.409
 while holding the mode change button 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.050
 we are changing to strabag mode 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.879
 on the strobe donate interest 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.870
 poor quality in the kit goes into what 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:34.199
