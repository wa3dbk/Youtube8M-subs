00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
so short here that there are last layer
so<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> don't<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:56.660> if<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.469> probably<00:00:59.010> should

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so I don't know if I I probably should

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.709 
so I don't know if I I probably should
layer<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.260> back<00:01:01.590> ah<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> only

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
layer them a bit at the back ah the only

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.170 
layer them a bit at the back ah the only
way<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> disguise<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> bit

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
way to disguise it is to have a bit

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.289 
way to disguise it is to have a bit
tighter<00:01:06.510> cows<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.530> come<00:01:08.310> my<00:01:08.549> own<00:01:08.729> hair<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
tighter cows and come my own hair and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.289 
tighter cows and come my own hair and
that<00:01:09.750> way<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.049> would<00:01:10.320> blend<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.100> better

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
that way you would blend in a bit better

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
that way you would blend in a bit better
anyway<00:01:12.299> let<00:01:13.229> me<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.369> love
