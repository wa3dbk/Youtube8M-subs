having it on the dummy's head that you

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.110 
having it on the dummy's head that you
would<00:03:35.940> use<00:03:36.269> we<00:03:37.079> make<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.829> sink<00:03:38.250> through<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.270 
would use we make it sink through to the
hair<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.780> i<00:03:39.930> was<00:03:40.109> getting<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.470> lot<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.709> leakage

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
hair and i was getting a lot of leakage

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.610 
hair and i was getting a lot of leakage
even<00:03:41.670> when<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:42.180> mixed<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.810> correctly<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.440> make

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
even when I I mixed it correctly to make

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.380 
even when I I mixed it correctly to make
it<00:03:43.769> extra<00:03:43.920> thick<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.459> feel<00:03:44.640> like<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.000> was<00:03:45.120> just

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
it extra thick I feel like it was just

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.599 
it extra thick I feel like it was just
not<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.109> right<00:03:46.260> way<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.980> felt<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.340> I

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
not the right way to do it I felt like I

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.729 
not the right way to do it I felt like I
would<00:03:48.269> get<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> better<00:03:49.070> um<00:03:50.959> idea<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.290> what<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.530> was

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
would get a better um idea of what I was

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.099 
would get a better um idea of what I was
doing<00:03:53.190> when<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.519> held<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.060> unit<00:03:54.390> upside<00:03:54.810> down

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
doing when I held the unit upside down

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.930 
doing when I held the unit upside down
like<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.160> table<00:03:56.930> put<00:03:57.930> like<00:03:58.799> papers<00:03:59.700> in

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
like this on a table put like papers in

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.060 
like this on a table put like papers in
there<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.299> hold<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.630> open<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.200> then<00:04:01.290> paint<00:04:01.920> it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
there to hold it open and then paint it

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.370 
there to hold it open and then paint it
from<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.459> inside<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:03.600> way<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:03.959> kind<00:04:04.320> of

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
from the inside that way I can kind of

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.069 
from the inside that way I can kind of
look<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.799> see<00:04:05.010> if<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.940> was<00:04:06.120> going<00:04:06.299> through<00:04:06.720> if

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
look and see if it was going through if

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.259 
look and see if it was going through if
it<00:04:07.230> was<00:04:07.380> reaching<00:04:07.709> again<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:08.910> how<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.120> do

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
it was reaching again this is how I do

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.180 
it was reaching again this is how I do
it<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.720> that's<00:04:09.870> because<00:04:10.290> i<00:04:10.440> have<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.769> kind<00:04:11.070> of

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
it and that's because i have a kind of

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.190 
it and that's because i have a kind of
an<00:04:11.280> artist<00:04:11.579> steady<00:04:11.880> hand<00:04:12.269> like<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:12.630> know<00:04:12.870> if

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
an artist steady hand like you know if

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.259 
an artist steady hand like you know if
you<00:04:13.380> are<00:04:13.410> patient<00:04:13.920> I've<00:04:14.489> learn<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.090> patient

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
it is an acquired skill okay but you

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.440

have<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.859> be<00:04:20.099> patient<00:04:20.310> because<00:04:20.849> you<00:04:21.120> have<00:04:21.299> to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
have to be patient because you have to

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.700 
have to be patient because you have to
make<00:04:21.570> sure<00:04:21.599> that<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.900> pin<00:04:22.109> up<00:04:22.229> all<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.500> hair

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
in just the front part because you

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.210 
in just the front part because you
really<00:04:37.139> only<00:04:37.290> want<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.650> bleach<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.040> front

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.430 
really only want to bleach the front
front<00:04:38.400> anyway<00:04:38.639> but<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.330> feel<00:04:39.570> like<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:40.260> weight

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
front anyway but I feel like the weight

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.460 
front anyway but I feel like the weight
having<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.250> hair<00:04:41.780> dangle<00:04:42.780> down<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.290> that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
having the hair dangle down like that

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.010 
having the hair dangle down like that
leaving<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:44.010> free<00:04:44.220> I<00:04:44.610> just<00:04:45.120> feel<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.810> me

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
leaving it free I just feel like for me

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.939 
leaving it free I just feel like for me
it<00:04:46.320> worked<00:04:46.680> better<00:04:46.949> because<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.970> was<00:04:48.270> not<00:04:48.510> like

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
it worked better because it was not like

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.230 
it worked better because it was not like
scrunched<00:04:49.949> up<00:04:50.070> like<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.430> will<00:04:50.550> be<00:04:50.580> on<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:50.940> doll

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
scrunched up like it will be on a doll

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.210 
scrunched up like it will be on a doll
head<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.990> know<00:04:52.110> therefore<00:04:52.380> leaking<00:04:52.979> through

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
causing more accidents so that's how I

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.280 
causing more accidents so that's how I
do<00:04:55.919> it<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.460> actually<00:04:56.669> leave<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.510> hair<00:04:57.750> open

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
that's how I do it I don't know if it's

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.620 
that's how I do it I don't know if it's
the<00:06:13.470> right<00:06:13.889> way<00:06:14.220> or<00:06:14.250> the<00:06:14.789> correct<00:06:15.120> way<00:06:15.330> but

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
that's the way I've learned that works

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.089

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.170 
how to bleach or not I do hope that
everybody<00:06:22.289> takes<00:06:22.740> time<00:06:23.490> to<00:06:23.789> look<00:06:23.970> at

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
everybody takes time to look at

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.550 
everybody takes time to look at
everybody's<00:06:24.660> way<00:06:24.810> of<00:06:24.930> doing<00:06:25.139> it<00:06:25.200> before<00:06:25.349> you

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
everybody's way of doing it before you

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.500 
everybody's way of doing it before you
decide<00:06:25.860> to<00:06:26.010> do<00:06:26.130> it<00:06:26.220> for<00:06:26.370> yourself<00:06:26.460> it<00:06:26.940> is<00:06:27.150> a

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
decide to do it for yourself it is a

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.710 
decide to do it for yourself it is a
kind<00:06:27.990> of<00:06:28.139> a<00:06:28.320> time-consuming<00:06:28.860> process<00:06:29.099> but<00:06:29.970> the

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
kind of a time-consuming process but the

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.839 
kind of a time-consuming process but the
rewards<00:06:31.349> are<00:06:31.500> very<00:06:31.800> good<00:06:32.099> as<00:06:32.340> you<00:06:32.520> can<00:06:32.669> see<00:06:32.820> I
