00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.250
 Well, well, let's start with 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.020
 our baby roscones and for that we go 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.030
 to use baker yeast yeast 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.740
 pressed we make some cheeks as you see 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.650
 and we add it to the milk with the water 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.570
 warm dissolves 10 while we put 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.669
 the flour because I say flour because 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.400
 let's use 2 this is strong flour is 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.499
 say the one that is rich in gluten but 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.060
 we are also going to use a normal of all 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.849
 the days that we find in any 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.040
 most usual supermarket we do as 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.900
 a volcano a kind of crater we put 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.940
 the sugar then a little salt 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.580
 you know that enhances the flavors I have chosen 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.180
 for this roscón good olive oil 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.790
 natural and healthy fat we add the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.230
 eggs and we start mixing with a 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.090
 spatula with the statements but of 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.280
 one way would be more advisable 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.710
 hard mass that we're going to work with is a 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.480
 hard dough is difficult to handle we add 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.090
 in the yeast that we had dissolving 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.380
 well and we're going to do it said in a bowl 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.570
 It can also be done perfectly 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.210
 message making it a kind of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.340
 volcano but good in this case we're going 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 to do so until we are actively going to 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.030
 keep thinking about this until 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.070
 that does not stick to your fingers 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.100
 they do not stick so well we're going to work 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.810
 on the table already stains less because already 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.310
 the dough is a little drier and for 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 I miss him that way 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.470
 you see that the mass tends to stick in the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.840
 table and good is the recipe puts so much 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.820
 flour does not matter if we see that the dough 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.119
 so it's sticky we add more flour 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.560
 that is, each type of flour 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.080
 they give different result besides by 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.920
 example the eggs 6 eggs of 60 65 of 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.110
 70 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.509
 Well, we achieved it because today is for 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.399
 ask then more flour well we follow 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.929
 kneading it is convenient to knead 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.579
 20 minutes at least here is something else 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.320
 rich that I have a dora dough was 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.420
 great then then minus ten 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.929
 minutes would be good enough already 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.360
 we have let's put it to rest for 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.330
 give him so that fermenten has to 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.350
 triplicate a little film paper 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.789
 so it does not dry but be careful with 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.310
 the edges that do not stick that if not 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.950
 leica lifts let's leave it 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.899
 tripling the volume that's the goal 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.640
 fixed good has tripled I do not know here 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.930
 he has gone crazy he has a volume this 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.510
 enormous better is better when we see that 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.069
 that our mass has grown more good 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.410
 signal will not be more spongy 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.280
 healthy let's remove the air that has 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.980
 got this mass 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.040
 and let's move on but this time much more 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.630
 briefly it is simply to take out the air 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.510
 as you can see why that hit 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.030
 that I just want to get the air and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.580
 I'm going to work with only half of 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.230
 base 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.650
 here I do now good so what am I 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.790
 making is a kind of custard for 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.790
 cut it into pieces 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.870
 of 50 grams and if you want it to be more 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.159
 big ourselves 50 grams for a 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.739
 mini roscón I think it's pretty 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.930
 well, I'm going to do another kind of 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.060
 foundation that I was doing before but 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.890
 this time as tiny as you can see 150 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.989
 grams I told you and what I do is 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.310
 help you for the ends and vice here 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.519
 we have the kind of donut 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.520
 I would say I do not repeat the play and took out a 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.700
 kind of lace 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.490
 and one of the extremes has very well 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.300
 flat a little 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.920
 on the table and I have it good then 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.110
 we leave it again to be involved in 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.030
 agreement 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.440
 this is going to be faster but good 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.540
 while I'm going to do the fruit thing 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.200
 frosted childbirth in pieces as you see 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.189
 and well you have already helped and what I do 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.379
 is to varnish with beaten egg and decorate it 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.000
 with the candied fruit that chopped 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:44.450
 previously you see 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.820
 and then a little sugar so that 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.800
 that snow effect that comes out in the 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.750
 roscones a droplet of water is what goes 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.760
 to get that effect a little bit of 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.680
 almonds because not great fruits 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.689
 dry to come very well 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.060
 well then baked at 190 degrees you know that 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.980
 be golden while yesterday look 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.959
 We are giving away books in this kitchen 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.269
 to the people who say is that I know of 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.400
 cook and do a test of days questions 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.489
 type test has three answers each 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.980
 then it is evaluated to see that we have succeeded 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.620
 It is very simple and good because there you 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.729
 we say the points you've got 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.259
 so good you tell us who says 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.239
 Paul I am of any name that is 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.340
 is to put you in the ranking ie 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.620
 who does not have more and you can also choose 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.320
 I said it on the site from before contest 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.880
 very good and then later with that you 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.440
 we say if you have the bonus then look 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.760
 join your score the votes which 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.169
 you do not get easier it's doing 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.389
 comments on youtube for each 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.630
 comment every five points and you say 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.310
 nick blank space and your name five 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.320
 points and you're ready to see if you win a book 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.419
 break this is great come on 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.810
 we have again here and the micros with 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.870

 it needs to be the party of kings 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.580

 minutes with is come a greeting see you
