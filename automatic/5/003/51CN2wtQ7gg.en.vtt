00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello people welcome to outdoor 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.680
 Equipment TV I am one 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.469
 passionate coffee drinker and 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.880
 enjoy my meal outside here 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.960
 hot cup of coffee and the stefan has 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 there made a little invention and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.830
 like the ones I sent myself 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.380
 very happy that I have today 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.390
 First try it if you want 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.039
 This invention only once 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.369
 take a closer look then you could 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.530
 I think that's a small one 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.719
 mini goggles whatever I have 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.329
 posted a picture on facebook and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.540
 asked what was the number there were several 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.230
 answer everything there 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.700
 and he has the following lines 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.899
 I wrote Hello Benjamin 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.309
 something tinkered 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.469
 Maybe I can thank you for that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.420
 give your great videos something back 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 saw how you tried with 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.980
 to make a coffee filter coffee of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.539
 the touched is yes and indeed I have 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.559
 in one of my videos where i go in the winter 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.420
 Stayed outside at the tent here 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.580
 me a coffee trying to brew 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.010
 with a coffee filter that's the case now 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 a small coffee filter would have been in at that time 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.549
 GroÃŸtaft filter had some level 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.409
 put over so we have that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.530
 pouring water-rich gravel is yes 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.540
 The filter keeps the pressure very clear 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.400
 therefore , it is not made of paper and there 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.350
 is torn then 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.689
 yes and he writes very nice may 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.659
 In life everything has to happen 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:36.840
 try it out just so you learn in 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.630
 Did the stefan if you like try it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 but just with a fresh one 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.640
 brewed coffee just the hook on 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.750
 grip out hook 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.040
 So here we have this device 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 simply the hg never attack off hook 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 So that's the handle and then the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.110
 The rings are ready to hang up again 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.970
 outdoor coffee machine so hang now 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.020
 So I hook those in here again 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.280
 Everything worked very filigree 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.780
 custom made by yourself 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.490
 develops himself invented 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.590
 yes, that's how she looks then and there 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.180
 Do you still have some coffee here for me? 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.050
 Milk is cleverly lacking 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.670
 thank you very much stefan so great everything 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.060
 I'll have coffee here right now 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.190
 I just put on water 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.220
 make hot water now and then 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.020
 The whole thing comes in here and then I am 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.900
 I'm just curious how that 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.920
 works now I'm doing here ' 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:52.280
 pure coffee powder for a cup namely 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:56.310
 about a teaspoon a little more like that 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.490
 be it strong, the water is boiling 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:05.030
 and I mean this here now 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.030
 water in my filter purely yes 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.300
 works that looks good 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:19.620
 first class yes very important he still has 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.860
 the cup was written during the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.580
 testing process to keep it hot 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.080
 last time here on the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.200
 cooker on it all so nice hot 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.600
 I'll watch it I still have it 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.390
 stuck under it because even at 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.580
 this construction if the filter too 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.580
 Deep trance is one can do the whole thing 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.970
 just increase something so there is still 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.970
 more pure 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.380
 excellent running goes right through 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.800
 really good so I think so 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:03.959
 is enough the whole looks from below 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.310
 drips nicely so you can get that 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.590
 Let's go out here 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.849
 and the taste is excellent 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.489
 delicious filter coffee 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.180
 thank you very much stefan for this great 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.840
 invention 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.610
 and the beautiful is people is natural 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.190
 everything completely suitable for outdoor coffee filters 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:30.030
 and coffee just take that out 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:35.760
 whole hook again then back here 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:41.160
 fix the hooks in the handle again and 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.960
 then you can do it all in again nicely 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.320
 stow the backpack or it fits 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:51.539
 even here loose in the side pocket 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.210
 the pants in pure so people thank you 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.770
 see me with you for a look 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.450
 this invention has from my side from 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.620
 the absolute thumb earned high and 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.360
 people do it well the time enjoying here 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.419
 outside I drink hit you and 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.770
 someone else knows kicks rows as sees 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:14.760
 See you in the next video for that until then 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:16.710
 Bye, people, that's how it looks 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.300
 the cooker out when the spirit burns 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.850
 and I just put my top here 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.500
 on it and it is synonymous quite good 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.690
 I do not say it's a danger now 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.479
 I would have something over here 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:33.539
 The stove sinks something in the earth 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:35.010
 I say now for the long term so I 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:38.280
 have the cooker something sunk in the 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:42.260
 earth for a better stand and lifts 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.260
 impeccably goes wonderfully
