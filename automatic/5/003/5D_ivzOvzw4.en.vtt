look<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.120> scene<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.780> showed<00:00:34.219> it's

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
look at the scene that we showed it's

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
look at the scene that we showed it's
been<00:00:35.460> slightly<00:00:35.910> updated<00:00:36.510> some<00:00:37.170> few<00:00:37.320> things

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
been slightly updated some few things

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
been slightly updated some few things
that<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.860> been<00:00:37.950> bugging<00:00:38.129> me<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.399> took<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that have been bugging me I took the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
that have been bugging me I took the
time<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.180> change<00:00:39.390> we've<00:00:40.079> added<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.440> few<00:00:40.469> new

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
time to change we've added a few new

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010 
time to change we've added a few new
features<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.700> more<00:00:41.910> than<00:00:42.030> anything<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.780> just

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
features but more than anything we just

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.290 
features but more than anything we just
wanted<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.590> higher<00:00:43.829> quality<00:00:44.370> version

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
wanted to get a higher quality version

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.340 
wanted to get a higher quality version
out<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.590> web<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.190> people<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:48.289> take<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
out on the web so people could take a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.189 
out on the web so people could take a
look<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.270> see<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.300> kind<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.870> level<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.140> detail

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
look and see the kind of level of detail

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.360 
look and see the kind of level of detail
that<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.629> talking<00:00:54.629> about<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.370> hopefully

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that we are talking about and hopefully

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.990 
that we are talking about and hopefully
he<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.750> you<00:00:57.750> know<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> better<00:00:58.980> idea<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.370> what

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
he I you know get a better idea of what

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.910 
he I you know get a better idea of what
we're<00:01:00.120> hoping<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.600> deliver<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
we're hoping to deliver with the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.310 
we're hoping to deliver with the
abduction<00:01:02.460> game<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.120> terms<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.539> level<00:01:04.229> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
abduction game in terms of level of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.260 
abduction game in terms of level of
detail<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.949> attention<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.729> detail<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.180> all

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
detail and attention to detail and all

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.200 
detail and attention to detail and all
that<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.250> real<00:01:08.250> quick<00:01:08.430> overview<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that so real quick overview this is a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.500 
that so real quick overview this is a
forest<00:01:09.780> scene<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.860> will<00:01:11.310> probably<00:01:11.820> serve<00:01:12.210> at

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
forest scene that will probably serve at

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
forest scene that will probably serve at
the<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> starting<00:01:13.710> area<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> game<00:01:14.490> or

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the as the starting area of the game or

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.890 
the as the starting area of the game or
at<00:01:15.540> least<00:01:15.720> some<00:01:16.049> version<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
at least some version of this this is

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
at least some version of this this is
the<00:01:22.020> area<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> player<00:01:22.830> gets<00:01:23.130> abducted

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the area that the player gets abducted

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
the area that the player gets abducted
from<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:26.119> final<00:01:27.119> game<00:01:27.450> play<00:01:27.780> or

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
from we do not have a final game play or

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.980 
from we do not have a final game play or
final<00:01:28.650> assets<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.240> it's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
final assets in here but this is it's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.640 
final assets in here but this is it's
really<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.560> testbed<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.250> us<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.549> start

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
really just a testbed for us to start

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.580 
really just a testbed for us to start
figuring<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.890> our<00:01:34.950> production<00:01:35.460> pipeline<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
figuring out our production pipeline and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.620 
figuring out our production pipeline and
and<00:01:37.590> even<00:01:38.310> some<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.579> our<00:01:38.700> interactive

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
and even some of our interactive

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.980 
and even some of our interactive
elements<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:42.180> assets<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:42.990> based<00:01:43.229> on

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
elements the assets here are based on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.539 
elements the assets here are based on
some<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> type<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.380> forests<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.220> find

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
some of the type of forests you find

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.340 
some of the type of forests you find
here<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.880> Pacific<00:01:48.270> Northwest

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
here in the Pacific Northwest

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:58.539 
here in the Pacific Northwest
specifically<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.740> Spokane<00:01:50.700> area

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.819 

this<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> all<00:01:59.850> inside<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.780> Unreal<00:02:01.439> 4<00:02:01.469> engine

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
this is all inside the Unreal 4 engine

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.200 
this is all inside the Unreal 4 engine
which<00:02:02.610> has<00:02:02.789> been<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.970> real<00:02:03.149> treat<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.539> work<00:02:03.630> with

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
which has been a real treat to work with

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.789 
which has been a real treat to work with
and<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.329> addition<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.020> sort<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.619> some

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and in addition to just sort of some

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.290 
and in addition to just sort of some
visual<00:02:09.649> target<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.920> are<00:02:11.220> showing<00:02:11.610> off<00:02:11.760> some

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
visual target we are showing off some

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.380 
visual target we are showing off some
object<00:02:12.780> interactions<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:13.670> we<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.849> sample

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
object interactions so we have a sample

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.960 
object interactions so we have a sample
object<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:19.970> unlike<00:02:21.830> mist<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.099> ribbon<00:02:23.430> style

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
object here unlike mist and ribbon style

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.790 
object here unlike mist and ribbon style
games<00:02:24.269> where<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.630> usually<00:02:24.750> cannot<00:02:25.290> interact

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
games where you usually cannot interact

games where you usually cannot interact
with<00:02:26.150> objects<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.360> abduction<00:02:28.049> we're<00:02:28.200> hoping

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
with objects and abduction we're hoping

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.650 
with objects and abduction we're hoping
for<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:29.040> much<00:02:29.580> greater<00:02:29.849> level<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.239> object

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
for a much greater level of object

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.420 
for a much greater level of object
manipulation<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.799> object<00:02:32.099> interaction<00:02:34.430> this

manipulation and object interaction this
lamp<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.060> turn<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> lamp<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:36.959> can<00:02:37.110> set

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
lamp we can turn on the lamp we can set

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.630 
lamp we can turn on the lamp we can set
the<00:02:37.380> lamp<00:02:37.530> down<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.220> will<00:02:38.310> light<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
the lamp down and it will light the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.850 
the lamp down and it will light the
surroundings<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:40.049> more<00:02:40.260> importantly<00:02:40.680> if

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
surroundings but more importantly if

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.640 
surroundings but more importantly if
you've<00:02:40.980> played<00:02:41.220> any<00:02:41.400> any<00:02:42.000> missed<00:02:42.440> any<00:02:43.440> missed

games<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:45.450> know<00:02:45.599> that<00:02:45.959> looking<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:46.709> clues<00:02:47.160> is

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
games you know that looking for clues is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.000 
games you know that looking for clues is
a<00:02:47.700> big<00:02:47.940> part<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.569> so<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:49.890> to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
a big part of it and so this is just to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.059 
a big part of it and so this is just to
illustrate<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.780> hide<00:02:52.019> clues<00:02:52.410> now<00:02:52.739> more

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
illustrate that and hide clues now more

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.259 
illustrate that and hide clues now more
than<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.579> environment<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.180> we're

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.540 

looks<00:03:15.970> like<00:03:16.120> we've<00:03:16.239> got<00:03:16.360> another<00:03:16.629> clue<00:03:16.989> I

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
looks like we've got another clue I

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.530 
looks like we've got another clue I
should<00:03:18.550> state<00:03:18.819> that<00:03:18.970> these<00:03:19.060> clues<00:03:19.360> were

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
should state that these clues were

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
really put together just for this demo

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.979 
really put together just for this demo
they<00:03:21.190> don't<00:03:21.370> they<00:03:21.640> don't<00:03:21.670> yet<00:03:22.000> tie<00:03:22.239> two

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
they don't they don't yet tie two

they don't they don't yet tie two
puzzles<00:03:23.349> in<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.590> scene<00:03:23.860> but<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.790> could<00:03:24.970> down

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
puzzles in the scene but but could down

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:43.680 
puzzles in the scene but but could down
the<00:03:25.360> line<00:03:41.940> still<00:03:42.940> working<00:03:43.239> out<00:03:43.360> some<00:03:43.390> bug's

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
the line still working out some bug's

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.119 
the line still working out some bug's
with<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.080> cursor<00:03:44.410> behavior<00:03:44.769> there<00:03:44.950> you

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
with the cursor behavior there you

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.559 
with the cursor behavior there you
probably<00:03:45.400> saw<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.640> cursor<00:03:46.120> going<00:03:46.360> out<00:03:46.480> of

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
probably saw the cursor going out of

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.920 
probably saw the cursor going out of
focus<00:03:46.690> as<00:03:47.019> well<00:03:47.140> but<00:03:48.099> we<00:03:48.250> just<00:03:48.400> just<00:03:49.030> added<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
focus as well but we just just added the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.960 
focus as well but we just just added the

camera depth of field features in the
last<00:03:52.120> couple<00:03:52.299> days<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.780> we're<00:03:52.900> still<00:03:53.079> working

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
last couple days so we're still working

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.110 
last couple days so we're still working
some<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.650> out

this<00:04:05.950> engine<00:04:06.310> has<00:04:06.430> been<00:04:06.579> just<00:04:06.819> fantastic<00:04:07.420> in

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
this engine has been just fantastic in

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.330 
this engine has been just fantastic in

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:20.789 
terms of the rendering features we're
able<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.640> put<00:04:09.849> into<00:04:09.970> it
