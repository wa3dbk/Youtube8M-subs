00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.780
 Yes What is also Opako this time will also be doing because I get an early warning of black Coop 3 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.179
 I think 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:18.640
 And this time it's information about explosives though 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:20.300
 Park after the grenade launcher rpg in what this Black Ops 3 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.090
 Danger cross enters 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:32.629
 It seems to be done Congratulations this personally I thought it was super good news 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:36.559
 Well Seriously explosives I wish I was from the direction of the person who was or Toka search people of that was the ship Dominator 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:40.290
 I think that I think we were always there for Tteyuu Na or Kun'ne quit 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.640
 change without Toka na It is something there was the danger cross in aw 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.740
 Japan is to it was pretty strong variety I Toka Attari softening explosives 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.850
 Ghost Modern 2 was also a game famous for its explosives being very strong 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:58.200
 boo 3 is but do not know what I had chosen also such a point 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.610
 Danger close no gray book no other rpg such kind of launchers 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.280
 It means that there is nothing 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.850
 However 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.560
 I think that there is probably an anti-air type brain man char like Stinger but it is anti - human 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:13.469
 There seems to be no launcher This is personally nice though 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.310
 Whether and you would not need to be and completely zero was looking at the echo of quite something net 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:22.590
 I was saying that I think we less likely to defeat the people who are or have or muffled 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.539
 There was a voice, too c 4 I became weak and threw, and I was tied up with a double tap 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.659
 Since it has been said in Tsu can not 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:33.400
 I think that this is a policy to weaken the explosives for a while. 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.840
 Say high sheet of explosives in Opako basis 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:43.880
 It is a sleeper blow but how is it for everyone 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:49.759
 Then I think I want to talk about the information of the zombie mode 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.260
 This is a rumor, but it seems that there are two modes in zombie mode 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:58.660
 Story mode and survival mode 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:01.120
 Survival mode is how many rounds can survive as before? Maybe 4 players or so 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.300
 I think that is the survival mode of 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.910
 What kind of story is it in story mode ? 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.680
 It is not leaked at all yet. Story mode such as about the beginning of zombies 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.250
 Because there was before 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.090
 Black Ops 3 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.470
 Zombie mode story I is the Once and I made together what kind of story 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.980
 Is not it 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.370
 I would like to talk about lean next 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.140
 It's about lean, isn't it about that peeping ? 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.720
 At the end of the wall , something is only my upper body 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.980
 It's like I'm hitting you while I 'm looking into it 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.460
 Though it was adopted by that ghost and was not aw 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.570
 Now at Beauty 3 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.010
 It seems to be adopted or undecided It seems that it is under test now 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.829
 so 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.840
 In boo 3 it is new operation such as thrust jump power slide all run 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:56.239
 Though has been announced 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:59.239
 How is it going to be Lee? Opa child is like a little Lynn is not very good at it 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.000
 It doesn't matter if I didn't have to 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:08.820
 Interesting even if there probably because the person who was also need quite that was good at cormorant 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.960
 Stop put the bell to think of it is cod that specification unlock condition because not a 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.940
 I want you to 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:18.990
 A person who is looking at cancer at a fixed point by ringing with that sniper and acceleration and another ar 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.170
 something even smg not a proper today the way'm no longer go and forced not to hand 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:28.010
 Is not there 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:32.870
 So personally I would like you to stop adding jars to camouflage unlock conditions 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:36.200
 Next I would like to talk about a similar park with a similar blast suppressor. 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:41.210
 The blaster suppressor was in aw, but Exo 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.330
 It's a park where you disable the display on the right map when you use the move . 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.950
 Beauty 3 also that it is also there 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:54.500
 If you fly or bounce or use something, the red point will be uselessly moved 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:57.200
 Then you must stop moving because there is a red point or you must put on the park 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.200
 I'm unhappy I'm such not become out Yappa I say to become 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.970
 Why such a Park in his own manner I say the kana not it 's not honest 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:10.110
 It says parabolic microphone but I think I Do was good aw is 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:14.640
 It was an interesting attachment, such as disabling the suppressor and displaying a red dot 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.070
 However, I think that it is good to have said that, but I think I have another brass suppressor 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.829
 Though it is story of 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:25.810
 I do not want to take over from aw , I think personally 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:30.759
 Then I want to finish Black Corp 3 feet in this area 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:35.630
 Also everyone because it when there is a story, such as I made you want to do something I this video Video 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:39.110
