spend<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:46.850> hundred<00:01:47.150> percent<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.600> our<00:01:47.720> efforts

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
spend a hundred percent of our efforts

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.890 
spend a hundred percent of our efforts
on<00:01:48.290> game<00:01:49.190> design<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.970> graphic<00:01:50.360> fidelity

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
on game design and graphic fidelity

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.150 
on game design and graphic fidelity
throughout<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.290> game<00:01:51.320> whether<00:01:52.010> you're

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
throughout the game whether you're

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.130 
throughout the game whether you're
underground<00:01:52.550> or<00:01:52.820> aboveground<00:01:52.960> you'll<00:01:53.960> come

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
underground or aboveground you'll come

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.510 
underground or aboveground you'll come
around<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.470> corner<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:54.920> get<00:01:55.070> these<00:01:55.190> just

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
around the corner and get these just

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.390 
around the corner and get these just
amazing<00:01:56.240> views

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.160 

we<00:01:59.850> want<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.120> have<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> heavy<00:02:00.570> element<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
verticality in our levels you know as a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.290 
verticality in our levels you know as a
ranged<00:02:04.290> character<00:02:04.500> sometimes<00:02:05.460> being<00:02:05.940> up<00:02:06.120> in<00:02:06.240> a

post<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.080> better<00:02:07.230> area<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.800> can<00:02:07.980> get

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
post is the better area can you can get

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.310 
post is the better area can you can get
a<00:02:08.130> view<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> melee<00:02:09.690> character<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
a view as more of a melee character you

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.120 
a view as more of a melee character you
can<00:02:10.470> sit<00:02:10.710> there<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:10.950> protect<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.640> area<00:02:13.130> well

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
can sit there and protect that area well

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.040 
can sit there and protect that area well
this<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> final<00:02:15.270> areas<00:02:15.570> when<00:02:15.930> we

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
this is one of the final areas when we

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.840 
this is one of the final areas when we
first<00:02:16.320> started<00:02:16.710> we<00:02:16.740> talked<00:02:17.100> about<00:02:17.340> doing<00:02:17.550> a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
first started we talked about doing a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.490 
first started we talked about doing a
tower<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.360> doing<00:02:18.780> something<00:02:19.020> big<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.350> it's

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
tower and doing something big but it's

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.840 
tower and doing something big but it's
been<00:02:19.650> done<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.040> many<00:02:20.130> times<00:02:20.340> when<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:20.640> thought

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
been done so many times when we thought

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.030 
been done so many times when we thought
you<00:02:21.060> know<00:02:21.210> let's<00:02:21.630> do<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:22.140> giant<00:02:22.620> pit<00:02:22.890> instead

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
you know let's do a giant pit instead

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.520 
you know let's do a giant pit instead
there<00:02:23.910> might<00:02:24.210> be<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.570> little<00:02:24.750> bit<00:02:24.990> of<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.140> spider

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
there might be a little bit of a spider

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.580 
there might be a little bit of a spider
problem<00:02:25.710> down<00:02:26.250> here<00:02:26.570> these<00:02:27.570> big<00:02:27.930> pieces<00:02:28.350> of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
problem down here these big pieces of

problem down here these big pieces of
basalt<00:02:29.250> rock<00:02:29.520> they<00:02:29.970> actually<00:02:30.300> were<00:02:30.420> modeled

basalt rock they actually were modeled

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.560 
basalt rock they actually were modeled
out<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:31.140> 3d<00:02:31.590> first<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.550> really<00:02:32.760> has<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> very

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
out in 3d first so it really has a very

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.199 
out in 3d first so it really has a very
sculpted<00:02:34.560> feel<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.520> them<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.820> feel<00:02:35.970> like

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
sculpted feel I want them to feel like

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.210 
sculpted feel I want them to feel like

it's<00:02:50.520> not<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.060> typical<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:52.230> console<00:02:52.890> game<00:02:53.130> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
it's not so typical in a console game to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.840 
it's not so typical in a console game to
be<00:02:53.550> able<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.060> create<00:02:54.270> your<00:02:54.510> own<00:02:54.870> world<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.850> can't

thank you enough you know what happens

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.290 
thank you enough you know what happens
if<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.010> could<00:02:59.190> build<00:02:59.400> my<00:02:59.550> own<00:02:59.580> dungeons<00:03:00.120> and

crucible what we allow the players to do

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.060 
crucible what we allow the players to do

we<00:03:22.870> just<00:03:23.050> give<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:24.160> user<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:24.970> ability<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.990> be

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
we just give the user the ability to be

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.870 
we just give the user the ability to be
the<00:03:26.380> game<00:03:26.560> maker<00:03:26.830> at<00:03:27.130> first<00:03:27.370> when<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.790> idea

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the game maker at first when the idea

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.980 
the game maker at first when the idea
was<00:03:28.090> pitched<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.450> me<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.569> actually<00:03:28.720> thought

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
was pitched to me I actually thought

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.260 
was pitched to me I actually thought
we're<00:03:29.620> crazy<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.370> was<00:03:30.459> based<00:03:30.670> or<00:03:30.850> everywhere

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
we're crazy it was based or everywhere

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.600 
we're crazy it was based or everywhere
so<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:31.930> team<00:03:32.230> goes<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.530> there<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.069> they're

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
so this team goes in there and they're

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.160
