00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:16.239
 they often wonder about cycling from the net with the star completely out 

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.019
 position 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.350
 most of the time it is too low 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.429
 and also the inclination 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.480
 while for the height of the saddle we refer to the notes 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.730
 introduction to the movie 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.210
 Now let's go through the practical adjustment phase usually on bicycles 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.490
 there are two systems for locking 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.500
 the seatpost 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.129
 a seat clamp 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.839
 milk requires the use of a 10 11 12 13 key depending on the 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.650
 bicycle model 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.470
 a more practical one 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.460
 quick release which consists of a freedom 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.200
 that loose allows rapid movement but also the inconvenience 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.340
 to facilitate the bad guys 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.400
 in this case we recorded a release 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.890
 dancers ice cream accounts 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.150
 it's enough 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.590
 loosen 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.970
 tombstone 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.680
 arpas through continuous 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.240
 so females 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.680
 the evening regulation the stexa 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.230
 positioned 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.350
 at the most congenial height for our first installment will suffice 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.430
 to block 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.000
 first partially to be able to check then standing on the back of the bicycle 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.810
 that the star aligned with the trim 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.740
 the journal of the same 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.880
 once the greenhouse is positioned correctly in a longitudinal direction 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.260
 we could go to firmly block 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 the view of the seatpost pug 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.900
 to secure a stop 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.470
 after this close-up adjustment action it is possible to pass instead 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.700
 to control the inclination of the evening 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.409
 a saddle with the tip at the top inclined upwards 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.149
 overall anatomy youtube 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.259
 and therefore it can last a long time in the glories 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.599
 vice versa if the glue. tilted too far down 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.989
 he takes us whenever we go to bed and slides forward 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.629
 no service in mind 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.370
 generally and salmon particular problems related to each individual 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.169
 individual the correct position of the saddle 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.279
 and as they say perfectly in bubble 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.529
 then with a plane of saddle that parallel currently 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:42.149
 to adjust 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:47.109
 the inclination of the saddle normally present 1st. guide of 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.220
 at the base of the same at the point where the star 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.240
 bar be fixed to the register boat 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.109
 in this case our model has a soldier 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.869
 from 13 lower 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.869
 that is enough to loosen 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.619
 just enough 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.939
 because it is born 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.939
 the free movement of the evening 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.679
 the goalkeeper's saddle may be 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.249
 in this case 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:24.659
 always checking what is the position along the longitudinal axis 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.109
 we have a star 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.029
 which is perfectly imola ie parallel to the ground at this point 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.919
 maintaining the positions 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.909
 it is enough to stand again 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.689
 ghost ronaldo 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.489
 firmly 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.769
 given the effort you make to touch 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.689
 on the stem itself 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.790
 therefore
