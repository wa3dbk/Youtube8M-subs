of it I showed that my hot pot had been

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.670 
of it I showed that my hot pot had been
locked<00:00:12.670> and<00:00:13.090> like<00:00:13.900> that's<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.230> only<00:00:14.260> thing<00:00:14.590> I

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
locked and like that's the only thing I

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.380 
locked and like that's the only thing I
can<00:00:14.860> think<00:00:15.070> of<00:00:15.340> to<00:00:15.490> refer<00:00:15.699> to<00:00:15.730> it<00:00:16.000> if<00:00:16.270> you<00:00:16.360> have

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
can think of to refer to it if you have

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.150 
can think of to refer to it if you have
a<00:00:16.510> passcode<00:00:16.930> lock<00:00:17.020> on<00:00:17.320> your<00:00:17.440> iPhone<00:00:17.740> or<00:00:17.859> iPod

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
a passcode lock on your iPhone or iPod

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.900 
a passcode lock on your iPhone or iPod
or<00:00:19.090> iPad<00:00:19.920> somebody<00:00:20.920> tries<00:00:21.190> to<00:00:21.370> get<00:00:21.490> into<00:00:21.640> it

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
or iPad somebody tries to get into it

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.970 
or iPad somebody tries to get into it
and<00:00:22.090> I<00:00:22.480> think<00:00:22.540> it's<00:00:22.840> five<00:00:23.080> attempts<00:00:23.620> if<00:00:23.800> they

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
and I think it's five attempts if they

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.770 
and I think it's five attempts if they
try<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:24.520> get<00:00:24.700> into<00:00:24.970> it<00:00:25.120> it<00:00:25.270> will<00:00:25.420> lock<00:00:25.600> your

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
try to get into it it will lock your

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.690 
try to get into it it will lock your
ipod<00:00:26.170> up<00:00:26.320> for<00:00:26.500> like<00:00:26.590> a<00:00:26.620> minute<00:00:27.039> then<00:00:27.460> if<00:00:27.610> they

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
ipod up for like a minute then if they

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.670 
ipod up for like a minute then if they
try<00:00:27.880> again<00:00:27.910> five<00:00:28.420> minutes<00:00:28.810> then<00:00:29.080> or<00:00:29.500> two

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
try again five minutes then or two

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.810 
try again five minutes then or two
minutes<00:00:30.010> or<00:00:30.130> something<00:00:30.310> like<00:00:30.369> that<00:00:30.430> but<00:00:30.640> every

minutes or something like that but every

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.490 
minutes or something like that but every
time<00:00:30.970> they<00:00:31.119> try<00:00:31.360> that<00:00:31.690> it's<00:00:31.900> more<00:00:32.050> time<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.379> it

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500
