installed you'll notice the top part
rubber<00:01:37.240> parts<00:01:37.630> just<00:01:37.870> like<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.910> vision

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
rubber parts just like the vision

Stardust<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:42.100> difference<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:42.880> also

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
Stardust the difference is and you also

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.660 
Stardust the difference is and you also
know<00:01:43.240> such<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.930> has<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.860> short<00:01:45.130> hair<00:01:45.310> versus

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
know such it has the short hair versus

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.540 
know such it has the short hair versus
the<00:01:45.759> long<00:01:46.000> hair<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.460> wick<00:01:48.700> works<00:01:49.090> better<00:01:50.020> I

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
the long hair the wick works better I

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.430 
the long hair the wick works better I
believe<00:01:51.550> here<00:01:52.180> on<00:01:52.330> short<00:01:52.840> wig<00:01:53.050> than<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.320> does

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
believe here on short wig than it does

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.920 
believe here on short wig than it does
on<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.650> other<00:01:53.800> one<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.210> regular<00:01:55.750> 510

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
on the other one that is a regular 510

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.460 
on the other one that is a regular 510
connection<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.880> screw<00:02:01.270> on<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.780> new

connection and you screw on the new

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.300 
connection and you screw on the new
atomizer

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.889 

now

dry burn so you let it sit and here's
one<00:04:01.580> already<00:04:01.879> put<00:04:02.150> together<00:04:02.799> this<00:04:03.799> has

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
one already put together this has

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:16.569 
one already put together this has
vanilla<00:04:05.989> menthol<00:04:06.500> in<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.799> too<00:04:07.340> dark<00:04:07.519> juice
