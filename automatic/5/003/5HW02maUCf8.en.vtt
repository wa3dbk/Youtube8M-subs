00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
on for the past few days so I've been

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.270 
on for the past few days so I've been
working<00:00:06.839> with<00:00:07.080> libgdx<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.919> I've<00:00:07.980> been<00:00:08.069> trying

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
working with libgdx and I've been trying

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.589 
working with libgdx and I've been trying
to<00:00:08.370> create<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.610> game<00:00:08.849> engine<00:00:09.059> which<00:00:09.330> can<00:00:09.360> be

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
to create a game engine which can be

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.580 
to create a game engine which can be
reused<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.790> be<00:00:11.790> used<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.120> 2d<00:00:12.389> games<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.809> general

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
reused to be used on 2d games in general

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.700 
reused to be used on 2d games in general
mostly<00:00:14.099> top-down<00:00:14.549> game<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.030> RPGs<00:00:15.660> as<00:00:16.500> things

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
mostly top-down game so RPGs as things

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.400 
mostly top-down game so RPGs as things
like<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> past<00:00:17.850> few<00:00:18.330> days

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
like that so for the past few days

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.480 
like that so for the past few days
perfect<00:00:19.410> four<00:00:19.770> or<00:00:19.830> five<00:00:19.949> days<00:00:20.220> I've<00:00:20.460> been

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
perfect four or five days I've been

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.450 
perfect four or five days I've been
pretty<00:00:20.760> busy<00:00:20.939> lately<00:00:22.039> I've<00:00:23.039> been<00:00:23.130> working<00:00:23.400> on

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
pretty busy lately I've been working on

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.040 
pretty busy lately I've been working on
this<00:00:23.550> probably<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:23.939> 20<00:00:24.510> minutes<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.810> an<00:00:24.930> hour

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
this probably like 20 minutes to an hour

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.800 
this probably like 20 minutes to an hour
each<00:00:25.289> day<00:00:25.580> but<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.640> pretty<00:00:27.119> much<00:00:27.210> created<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
each day but I pretty much created the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.419 
each day but I pretty much created the
engine<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.099> my<00:00:29.189> little

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
engine so right now it's my little

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.620 
engine so right now it's my little
private<00:00:29.760> engine<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> want<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> show<00:00:30.570> you

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
private engine but I want to show you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720 
private engine but I want to show you
what<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> did<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.410> far<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.369> long<00:00:32.610> with

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
what I did with it so far so long with

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.090 
what I did with it so far so long with
the<00:00:32.759> engine<00:00:33.090> comes<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.480> mapmaker<00:00:33.800> which<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.950> also

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the engine comes a mapmaker which I also

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.209 
the engine comes a mapmaker which I also
created<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.350> work<00:00:37.530> together<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.129> if

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
created so it the to work together so if

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.440 
created so it the to work together so if
I<00:00:38.280> was<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.489> granny<00:00:38.700> game<00:00:38.940> using<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> game

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
I was a granny game using the game

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.389 
I was a granny game using the game
engine<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.350> use<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> map<00:00:40.739> maker<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.219> make

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
engine I can use the map maker to make

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
engine I can use the map maker to make
maps<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> game<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:42.930> using<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> game

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
maps for the game that's using the game

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.119 
maps for the game that's using the game
engine<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.160> then<00:00:44.340> pretty<00:00:44.969> much<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:45.539> work

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
engine and then pretty much it will work

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
engine and then pretty much it will work
interchangeably<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> mean<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.760> use<00:00:48.450> any

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
interchangeably so I mean I can use any

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.869 
interchangeably so I mean I can use any
map<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.440> making<00:00:49.680> here

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
map I'm making here

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.450 
map I'm making here
in<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:52.199> games<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:52.649> makes<00:00:52.860> things<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.129> easy

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
in my games which makes things very easy

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.639 
in my games which makes things very easy
to<00:00:53.579> develop<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:54.899> gonna<00:00:55.020> create<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> new<00:00:55.410> map

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
to develop so I'm gonna create a new map

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.220 
to develop so I'm gonna create a new map
really<00:00:55.890> quick<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:58.399> will<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.719> 30

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
really quick I will make the with the 30

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.229 
really quick I will make the with the 30
I'll<00:01:01.469> make<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> height<00:01:01.949> 30<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.120> we

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I'll make the height 30 so this is we

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.210 
I'll make the height 30 so this is we
start<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:04.710> fill<00:01:04.890> let's<00:01:05.040> leave<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
start out with gonna fill let's leave a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.200 
start out with gonna fill let's leave a
bunch<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.430> buttons<00:01:05.610> over<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.150> all

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
bunch of buttons over here you have all

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.120 
bunch of buttons over here you have all
your<00:01:06.299> tiles<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.750> here<00:01:06.930> I'm<00:01:07.380> using<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.650> tile<00:01:07.860> map

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
your tiles up here I'm using a tile map

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.039 
your tiles up here I'm using a tile map
which<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.180> even<00:01:09.299> tile<00:01:09.540> map<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
which are not even tile map is just a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.859 
which are not even tile map is just a
bunch<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> tiles<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.799> together<00:01:11.720> fill<00:01:12.720> this

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
bunch of tiles I put together fill this

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.620 
bunch of tiles I put together fill this
page<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> tiles<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.450> from

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
page with the tiles and then now from

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.550 
page with the tiles and then now from
here<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> different<00:01:16.500> buttons

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
here you can see the different buttons

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.140 
here you can see the different buttons
so<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> tiles<00:01:17.790> okay<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so we have all the tiles okay like I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.640 
so we have all the tiles okay like I
said<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> different<00:01:19.439> layers<00:01:19.560> we

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
said we have the different layers we

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.950 
said we have the different layers we
have<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> ground<00:01:20.250> layer<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> top<00:01:20.700> layer

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
have the ground layer and the top layer

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.690 
have the ground layer and the top layer
so<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> set<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.770> ground<00:01:23.369> layers<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so if I was to set a ground layers of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.640 
so if I was to set a ground layers of
rock<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.210> show<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.479> black<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.500> I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
rock it would show this black but if I

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
rock it would show this black but if I
were<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.920> remove<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.400> by<00:01:26.909> right-clicking

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
were to remove that by right-clicking

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.960 
were to remove that by right-clicking
and<00:01:27.710> set<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> grass<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> top

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and set the grass but then go to the top

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
and set the grass but then go to the top
layer<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.540> set<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> rock<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> would

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
layer and set the rock then it would

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
layer and set the rock then it would
show<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.250> normally<00:01:32.570> soon<00:01:33.570> same<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.200> with

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
show up normally soon same thing with

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.580 
show up normally soon same thing with
the<00:01:34.380> trees<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.299> that's<00:01:36.299> how<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.479> works<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the trees so that's how that works I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.710 
the trees so that's how that works I
also<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.100> entities<00:01:38.369> added<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.450> this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
also have entities added in so this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.609 
also have entities added in so this
works<00:01:39.990> as<00:01:40.290> well<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.650> also<00:01:40.860> saving<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.490> course

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
works as well as also saving of course

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.719 
works as well as also saving of course
just<00:01:43.619> load<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.100> fact<00:01:44.250> I'll<00:01:44.460> show<00:01:44.610> you

just load that in fact I'll show you
sort<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.420> saving<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:45.869> well<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:47.399> entities

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
sort of saving as well the entities

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
sort of saving as well the entities
worked<00:01:48.000> pretty<00:01:48.180> well<00:01:48.390> also<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.590> pretty<00:01:49.770> proud

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
worked pretty well also I'm pretty proud

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
worked pretty well also I'm pretty proud
of<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> did<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:50.880> them<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.240> these

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
of them what I did with them so these

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.749 
of them what I did with them so these
entities<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.439> used<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.130> loaded<00:01:53.579> into

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
entities can be used and loaded into

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.730 
entities can be used and loaded into
your<00:01:53.939> actual<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:54.689> into<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> game<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.500> would

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
your actual or into the game that would

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
your actual or into the game that would
be<00:01:55.799> used<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> game<00:01:56.520> engine<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.509> can

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
be used with a game engine and they can

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.149 
be used with a game engine and they can
get<00:01:58.259> different<00:01:58.439> information<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
get different information now the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.499 
get different information now the
different<00:01:59.490> information<00:01:59.640> let<00:02:00.119> me<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.360> play

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
different information let me just play

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.600 
different information let me just play
sandy<00:02:00.990> down<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.380> quick<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:02.130> will<00:02:02.250> make<00:02:02.430> an

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
sandy down really quick we will make an

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.420 
sandy down really quick we will make an
entity<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.020> want<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.430> player

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
entity right here if I want the player

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.010 
entity right here if I want the player
if<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> entity<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.810> player

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
if I want the entity to be a player

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.839 
if I want the entity to be a player
inside<00:02:07.320> negative<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.829> otherwise<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.640> type

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
inside negative one otherwise to type

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.510 
inside negative one otherwise to type
whatever<00:02:09.030> end

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
whatever end

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.280 
whatever end
the<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.610> would<00:02:09.970> put<00:02:10.270> in<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:11.020> ID

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
the I would put in and then this ID

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.160 
the I would put in and then this ID
pretty<00:02:12.250> much<00:02:12.460> will<00:02:12.940> link<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.630> idea<00:02:14.140> of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
pretty much will link up to the idea of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.230 
pretty much will link up to the idea of
an<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.710> an<00:02:14.860> entity<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.430> your<00:02:15.490> actual<00:02:16.060> game

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
an of an entity in your actual game

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.700 
an of an entity in your actual game
itself<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:16.960> get<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> entity<00:02:17.560> and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
itself so you can get the entity and

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.930 
itself so you can get the entity and
load<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> where<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:18.490> supposed<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.730> be<00:02:18.820> lower

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
load it where it's supposed to be lower

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.550 
load it where it's supposed to be lower
than<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.420> put<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.630> there<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.350> it's<00:02:20.470> very

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
than that and put it there so it's very

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.350 
than that and put it there so it's very
very<00:02:20.770> simple<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.250> use<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.550> say<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.790> had<00:02:22.000> entity

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
very simple to use so say I had entity

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.620 
very simple to use so say I had entity
one<00:02:22.600> here<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.350> gonna<00:02:23.470> put<00:02:23.650> an<00:02:23.740> e<00:02:23.860> right<00:02:23.890> there

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
one here it's gonna put an e right there

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.330 
one here it's gonna put an e right there
kind<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.690> put<00:02:25.810> some<00:02:25.960> trees<00:02:26.200> around<00:02:26.440> here<00:02:26.560> just

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
kind of put some trees around here just

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.670 
kind of put some trees around here just
cancel<00:02:27.870> playstyle<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.020> gonna<00:02:29.170> put<00:02:29.320> some<00:02:29.470> trees

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
cancel playstyle so gonna put some trees

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.020 
cancel playstyle so gonna put some trees
around<00:02:29.890> here<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.720> second

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.700 

put<00:02:37.030> some<00:02:37.180> trees<00:02:37.390> around<00:02:37.660> him

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
put some trees around him

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.710 
put some trees around him
what<00:02:39.130> kind<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.370> make<00:02:39.490> like<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.730> box<00:02:40.270> looking

either play of the entity and I can
actually<00:03:23.770> set<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.040> path<00:03:24.280> for<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:24.820> I

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
actually set a path for it so I

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.930 
actually set a path for it so I
implemented<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.630> a-star<00:03:26.520> algorithm<00:03:27.520> for

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
implemented the a-star algorithm for

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.910 
implemented the a-star algorithm for
path<00:03:28.120> finding<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.660> did<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.410> within<00:03:29.530> about<00:03:29.680> an

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
path finding I did it within about an

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.790 
path finding I did it within about an
hour<00:03:30.030> using<00:03:31.030> just<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.600> read<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.260> bunch<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.620> things

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
hour using just I read a bunch of things

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.740 
hour using just I read a bunch of things
online<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.520> was<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.120> little<00:03:34.270> confusing<00:03:34.600> at<00:03:34.720> first

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
online I was a little confusing at first

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.930 
online I was a little confusing at first
but<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.170> wrote<00:03:35.350> my<00:03:35.470> own<00:03:35.530> algorithm<00:03:36.100> for<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.910> a

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
but I wrote my own algorithm for the a

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.300 
but I wrote my own algorithm for the a
star<00:03:37.270> method<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:38.440> worked<00:03:38.830> pretty<00:03:39.070> easily

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
star method and it worked pretty easily

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.510 
star method and it worked pretty easily
so<00:03:39.750> say<00:03:40.750> one<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.110> entity<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.739> move<00:03:41.950> here

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
so say one of the entity to move here

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.610 
so say one of the entity to move here
all<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.000> do<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.209> click<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:44.050> gets<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.380> path

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
all I do is click and it gets the path

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.310 
all I do is click and it gets the path
to<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.360> say<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.390> wanted<00:03:46.600> him<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.810> move<00:03:47.020> all<00:03:47.230> the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
to it say I wanted him to move all the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.050 
to it say I wanted him to move all the
way<00:03:47.350> up<00:03:47.500> here<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:47.860> player<00:03:48.100> he<00:03:48.850> wouldn't

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
way up here to the player he wouldn't

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.860 
way up here to the player he wouldn't
move<00:03:49.120> all<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.360> way<00:03:49.450> up<00:03:49.510> there<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.840> can

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
move all the way up there and you can

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.470 
move all the way up there and you can
set<00:03:50.140> different<00:03:50.170> paths<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.340> even<00:03:51.580> go<00:03:51.700> by<00:03:51.850> so

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
set different paths and it even go by so

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.430 
set different paths and it even go by so
say<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.870> wanted<00:03:53.080> a<00:03:53.290> game<00:03:53.590> where<00:03:55.440> we're

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
say that you wanted a game where we're

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.550 
say that you wanted a game where we're
pretty<00:03:56.650> much<00:03:56.890> me<00:03:57.640> remove<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:59.200> wanted<00:03:59.470> an

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
pretty much me remove this you wanted an

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.060 
pretty much me remove this you wanted an
entity<00:04:00.040> entity<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.570> go<00:04:01.900> back<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.650> forth<00:04:02.860> down

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
entity entity to go back and forth down

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.470 
entity entity to go back and forth down
the<00:04:03.130> hall<00:04:03.690> say<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:04.840> at<00:04:04.959> all<00:04:05.110> for<00:04:05.410> now

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
the hall say this at all for now

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.230 
the hall say this at all for now
looking<00:04:08.290> for<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.800> player<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.430> if<00:04:09.790> he<00:04:09.910> walks

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
looking for the player and if he walks

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.910 
looking for the player and if he walks
into<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.599> players<00:04:10.840> site<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.620> means<00:04:11.739> we<00:04:11.830> need

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
into the players site that means we need

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.220 
into the players site that means we need
to<00:04:12.010> attack<00:04:12.310> them<00:04:12.580> whatever<00:04:13.390> so<00:04:13.690> pretty<00:04:13.900> much<00:04:14.080> I

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
to attack them whatever so pretty much I

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.349 
to attack them whatever so pretty much I
can<00:04:14.380> have<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.860> in<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.190> game<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.910> can<00:04:16.030> have<00:04:16.209> it

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
can have the in the game I can have it

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.960 
can have the in the game I can have it
so<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:17.500> entity<00:04:18.040> this<00:04:18.280> entity<00:04:18.549> itself

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
so that the entity this entity itself

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.090 
so that the entity this entity itself
you<00:04:19.840> will<00:04:19.959> set<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.380> path<00:04:20.530> again<00:04:20.769> by<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:20.980> way

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
you will set the path again by the way

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.470 
you will set the path again by the way
if<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.310> were<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.489> set<00:04:21.669> this<00:04:21.790> path<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:22.210> here<00:04:22.389> it

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
if I were to set this path up here it

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.990 
if I were to set this path up here it
would<00:04:22.600> see<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.110> new<00:04:23.580> tiles<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.730> then<00:04:24.850> move

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
would see the new tiles and then move

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.110 
would see the new tiles and then move
them<00:04:25.120> over<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.160> path<00:04:27.340> through<00:04:27.760> here

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
them over so so the path through here

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.580 
them over so so the path through here
and<00:04:28.360> then<00:04:28.660> pretty<00:04:28.780> much<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.080> entity<00:04:29.350> can

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
and then pretty much this entity can

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.170 
and then pretty much this entity can
walk<00:04:29.740> back<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.130> forth<00:04:30.190> looking<00:04:30.910> for<00:04:31.120> the

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
walk back and forth looking for the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.900 
walk back and forth looking for the
player<00:04:31.389> and<00:04:32.100> from<00:04:33.100> there<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.340> mean<00:04:33.639> you<00:04:33.730> can<00:04:33.850> do

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
player and from there I mean you can do

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.250 
player and from there I mean you can do
whatever<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.210> want<00:04:34.389> your<00:04:34.540> actual<00:04:34.780> game<00:04:34.960> so

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
whatever you want your actual game so

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.430 
whatever you want your actual game so
you<00:04:35.800> can<00:04:36.070> for<00:04:36.550> example<00:04:36.960> have<00:04:37.960> them<00:04:38.139> attack<00:04:38.350> the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
you can for example have them attack the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.700 
you can for example have them attack the
player<00:04:38.590> like<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:38.860> said<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.700> can<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.660> don't<00:04:41.530> know

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
player like I said you can I don't know

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.930 
player like I said you can I don't know
really<00:04:42.010> honestly<00:04:42.310> whatever<00:04:42.580> you<00:04:42.639> want<00:04:42.790> to<00:04:42.850> do

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
really honestly whatever you want to do

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.260 
really honestly whatever you want to do
with<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:43.450> that's<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:45.160> it<00:04:46.060> works<00:04:46.210> very

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
with it so that's that and it works very

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.480 
with it so that's that and it works very
well<00:04:46.479> so<00:04:46.870> I<00:04:46.900> mean<00:04:46.990> it's<00:04:47.320> let<00:04:47.889> me<00:04:47.950> show<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.190> one

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
well so I mean it's let me show you one

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.640 
well so I mean it's let me show you one
of<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.639> things<00:04:48.820> that<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.000> made<00:04:49.180> also<00:04:50.080> also

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
of the things that I made also also

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.560 
of the things that I made also also
saves<00:04:50.919> as<00:04:51.100> well<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.550> if<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.150> were<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.300> come<00:04:52.419> back

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
saves as well so if I were to come back

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.540 
saves as well so if I were to come back
into<00:04:52.750> here<00:04:53.050> just<00:04:53.950> reload<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.400> go<00:04:57.490> to
