mean he's he's working out all the time

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.600 
mean he's he's working out all the time
now<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:14.600> he's<00:01:14.780> fit<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:15.229> know<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:15.650> I<00:01:15.860> he

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
now so he's fit you know so I he

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.859 
now so he's fit you know so I he
probably<00:01:16.850> wearing<00:01:17.119> me<00:01:17.270> down<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.450> little<00:01:17.659> bit

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
probably wearing me down a little bit

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.480 
probably wearing me down a little bit
but<00:01:18.050> I<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:18.560> know<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.680> take<00:01:18.950> him<00:01:19.130> down<00:01:19.250> and

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
but I you know I take him down and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.400 
but I you know I take him down and
ground<00:01:19.670> them<00:01:19.759> out<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:20.540> put<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.110> on<00:01:21.170> him<00:01:21.350> I

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
ground them out and I put it on him I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.090 
ground them out and I put it on him I
think<00:01:21.440> I<00:01:22.720> think<00:01:23.720> they<00:01:23.810> do<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.990> great<00:01:24.200> job<00:01:24.290> being

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
think I think they do a great job being

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.490 
think I think they do a great job being
creative<00:01:25.640> as<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.880> is<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.330> really<00:01:26.930> don't<00:01:27.080> know

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
creative as it is I really don't know

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.660 
creative as it is I really don't know
what<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.740> could<00:01:27.979> think<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.369> would<00:01:28.520> be

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
what I could think of that would be

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.540 
what I could think of that would be
better<00:01:28.940> other<00:01:29.240> than<00:01:30.009> camel<00:01:31.009> racing<00:01:31.430> or

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
better other than camel racing or

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.060 
better other than camel racing or
something<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.500> always<00:01:33.500> liked<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.650> endurance

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
something I always liked the endurance

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.380 
something I always liked the endurance
races<00:01:34.400> I've<00:01:34.610> always<00:01:34.759> been<00:01:34.970> a<00:01:35.030> fan<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.240> the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
races I've always been a fan of the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.380 
races I've always been a fan of the
endurance<00:01:35.780> races<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.740> longer<00:01:37.280> distance<00:01:37.430> I'm

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
endurance races the longer distance I'm

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.760 
endurance races the longer distance I'm
not<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.600> fan<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:38.869> sprints<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:41.680> think<00:01:42.680> it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
not a fan of sprints and I think it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.529 
not a fan of sprints and I think it
would<00:01:43.130> be<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.460> long<00:01:43.640> distance<00:01:44.030> event<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.360> some

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
would be a long distance event of some

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.889 
would be a long distance event of some
sort<00:01:44.920> something<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:47.000> like<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.630> sprint

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
sort something that I like the sprint

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.210 
sort something that I like the sprint
race<00:01:48.080> I<00:01:48.259> think<00:01:48.440> they<00:01:48.560> should<00:01:48.710> have<00:01:48.830> a<00:01:48.860> quarter

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
race I think they should have a quarter

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.040 
race I think they should have a quarter
of<00:01:49.250> mile<00:01:49.580> dash<00:01:49.850> though<00:01:50.180> I<00:01:50.210> think<00:01:50.360> that's<00:01:50.690> what

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
of mile dash though I think that's what

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.480 
of mile dash though I think that's what
everyone<00:01:51.350> kind<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.649> wants<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:52.160> no<00:01:52.460> one

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
everyone kind of wants that no one

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
everyone kind of wants that no one
really<00:01:52.610> understands<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.450> eight<00:01:53.630> like<00:01:53.990> it's

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
really understands the eight like it's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.680 
really understands the eight like it's
you<00:01:55.009> know<00:01:55.039> 12<00:01:55.340> seconds<00:01:55.850> or<00:01:56.000> 11<00:01:56.300> seconds

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
you know 12 seconds or 11 seconds

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.880 
you know 12 seconds or 11 seconds
whatever<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.140> everyone<00:01:57.560> wants<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.830> see

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
whatever it is everyone wants to see

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.460 
whatever it is everyone wants to see
that<00:01:58.160> big<00:01:58.399> quarter<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.030> know<00:01:59.090> obviously<00:01:59.960> it's

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
that big quarter you know obviously it's

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.160 
that big quarter you know obviously it's
hard<00:02:00.979> on<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.130> horses<00:02:01.429> but<00:02:01.850> it's<00:02:02.780> pretty<00:02:03.020> cool

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
hard on the horses but it's pretty cool

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
hard on the horses but it's pretty cool
I<00:02:03.410> like<00:02:03.979> probably<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> quarter-mile<00:02:05.660> crash

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.940 

did<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.400> favorite<00:02:14.580> event<00:02:15.000> uh

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
did you have a favorite event uh

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.310 
did you have a favorite event uh
probably<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.520> longer<00:02:17.850> distances<00:02:18.540> it's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
probably like the longer distances it's

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.860 
probably like the longer distances it's
it's<00:02:19.830> interesting<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.520> me<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.780> know

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
it's interesting to me to see you know

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.140 
it's interesting to me to see you know
what<00:02:22.050> strategy<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:23.460> will<00:02:23.640> take<00:02:23.820> with<00:02:24.030> each

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
what strategy one will take with each

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.410 
what strategy one will take with each
horses<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.740> think<00:02:26.730> some<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.030> distance

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
horses I I think some of the distance

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.250 
horses I I think some of the distance
races<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.170> kind<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.580> more<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:31.050> kind

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
races it's kind of it it's more it kind

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.540 
races it's kind of it it's more it kind
of<00:02:31.320> throws<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.590> lot<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.920> people<00:02:32.220> off<00:02:32.340> here

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
of throws a lot of people off here

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.760 
of throws a lot of people off here
because<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.240> know<00:02:33.330> they're<00:02:33.540> not<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> lot

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
because you know they're not like a lot

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.890 
because you know they're not like a lot
of<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.920> year<00:02:35.130> like<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.730> Europeans<00:02:36.240> they

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
of the year like the Europeans they

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.870 
of the year like the Europeans they
seemed<00:02:37.170> they<00:02:37.530> they<00:02:37.770> salute<00:02:38.160> well<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.850> end

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
seemed they they salute well in the end

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.080 
seemed they they salute well in the end
them<00:02:39.150> races<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.660> then<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:40.380> lot<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.130> drivers

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
them races and then a lot of drivers

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.700 
them races and then a lot of drivers
around<00:02:42.360> here<00:02:42.570> tire<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:42.930> them<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.200> adjust<00:02:43.530> to

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
around here tire for them to adjust to

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.250 
around here tire for them to adjust to
the<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.190> rate<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.550> speed<00:02:44.820> for<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.630> know<00:02:45.750> 22

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
the to rate the speed for you know 22

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260 
the to rate the speed for you know 22
miles<00:02:46.500> two<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> half<00:02:47.100> miles<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.640> stuffer

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
miles two and a half miles it's stuffer

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.480 
miles two and a half miles it's stuffer
I<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.140> distant<00:02:49.440> sources<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:53.340> some

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
I like the distant sources I think some

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
I like the distant sources I think some
of<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.640> distance<00:02:54.030> races<00:02:54.450> are<00:02:54.630> nice<00:02:55.170> because

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
of the distance races are nice because

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.070 
of the distance races are nice because
it<00:02:57.510> shows<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:59.330> little<00:03:00.330> different<00:03:00.690> side<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
it shows a little different side of a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.330 
it shows a little different side of a
lot<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.380> horses<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.860> ones<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.190> are<00:03:02.310> really

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
lot of horses the ones that are really

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.210 
lot of horses the ones that are really
good<00:03:02.940> horses<00:03:03.240> will<00:03:03.540> shine<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.560> those<00:03:04.860> those

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
good horses will shine in those those

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.690 
good horses will shine in those those
races<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.990> think<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.500> trot<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:07.830> good<00:03:08.370> when

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
races and I think the trot is good when

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.479 
races and I think the trot is good when
they're<00:03:08.880> with<00:03:09.600> like<00:03:09.960> my<00:03:10.200> lord

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
they're with like my lord

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.759 
they're with like my lord
there<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.760> for<00:03:13.390> trotters<00:03:13.749> I<00:03:13.870> like<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.260> it's

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
there and for trotters I like it it's

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.110 
there and for trotters I like it it's
good<00:03:14.950> because<00:03:15.129> they<00:03:15.400> can<00:03:15.639> seem<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:15.939> take<00:03:16.060> a

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
good because they can seem to take a

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.390 
good because they can seem to take a
little<00:03:16.269> bit<00:03:16.389> more<00:03:16.569> stamina<00:03:16.900> than<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.230> pacer<00:03:17.769> my

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
little bit more stamina than a pacer my

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.890 
little bit more stamina than a pacer my
favorite<00:03:18.790> extreme<00:03:19.150> race<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.480> want<00:03:19.659> to<00:03:19.749> say<00:03:19.870> is

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
favorite extreme race I want to say is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.039 
favorite extreme race I want to say is
probably<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.319> mini<00:03:20.469> colony<00:03:20.799> race<00:03:21.010> yeah<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
probably the mini colony race yeah the

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.629 
probably the mini colony race yeah the
five-eighths<00:03:23.379> mile<00:03:23.590> dash<00:03:23.769> i<00:03:24.040> think<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.400> good<00:03:24.609> i

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
five-eighths mile dash i think is good i

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.860 
five-eighths mile dash i think is good i
know<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:24.969> not<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.120> new<00:03:25.329> one<00:03:25.359> they<00:03:25.599> do<00:03:25.719> that

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
know it's not a new one they do that

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.390 
know it's not a new one they do that
every<00:03:25.900> year<00:03:26.109> but<00:03:26.439> that's<00:03:26.739> it's<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.129> lot<00:03:27.310> of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
every year but that's it's a lot of

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.399 
every year but that's it's a lot of
excitement<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:28.180> lot<00:03:28.420> of<00:03:28.599> horses<00:03:28.870> going<00:03:29.109> all

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
excitement a lot of horses going all

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.080 
excitement a lot of horses going all
they<00:03:29.500> can<00:03:29.560> go<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.069> i<00:03:30.310> must<00:03:30.909> say<00:03:30.969> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
they can go and i must say the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
five-eighths mile dash and obviously the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.860 
five-eighths mile dash and obviously the
Tony<00:03:32.769> raises<00:03:33.189> a<00:03:33.250> big<00:03:33.400> hit<00:03:33.579> for<00:03:33.730> me<00:03:33.879> I<00:03:34.239> really

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
Tony raises a big hit for me I really

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.000 
Tony raises a big hit for me I really
like<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.579> 58<00:03:36.579> stashes<00:03:37.060> where<00:03:37.689> they<00:03:37.810> go<00:03:37.959> up<00:03:38.169> to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
like the 58 stashes where they go up to

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.739 
like the 58 stashes where they go up to
eats<00:03:39.250> with<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.489> disco<00:03:39.760> 58<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.329> it's<00:03:40.450> not<00:03:40.540> too

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:40.749 
eats with a disco 58 so it's not too

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.020 
eats with a disco 58 so it's not too
hard<00:03:40.930> persistent<00:03:41.680> kind<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.069> it<00:03:42.159> creates<00:03:42.879> a<00:03:42.939> lot

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030
