word awesome guy send it back to me all
packed<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.560> nicely<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.830> mounted<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
packed up nicely so I have mounted the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
packed up nicely so I have mounted the
landing<00:01:14.970> gear<00:01:15.119> real<00:01:15.270> quick<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> bench<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
landing gear real quick on the bench and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.160 
landing gear real quick on the bench and
I<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.250> mounted<00:01:17.700> them<00:01:17.880> inverted<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.750> purpose

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
I have mounted them inverted on purpose

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.999 
I have mounted them inverted on purpose
this<00:01:19.350> way<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:21.049> gear<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.290> command<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
this way the gear up command when the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.410 
this way the gear up command when the
gear<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.280> opening<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.270> harder

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
gear is opening up will be a lot harder

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.899 
gear is opening up will be a lot harder
because<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.320> against<00:01:26.070> gravity<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.759> not

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
because they are against gravity and not

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.890 
because they are against gravity and not
with<00:01:27.210> gravity<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> let's<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.270> how<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.659> work

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
with gravity so let's see how they work

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.710 
with gravity so let's see how they work
so<00:01:31.380> gonna<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.400> turn<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.790> servo<00:01:33.150> tester<00:01:33.540> here

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
so gonna just turn my servo tester here

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:44.040 
so gonna just turn my servo tester here
to<00:01:34.250> gear<00:01:35.250> up

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.580 

okay<00:01:45.050> all<00:01:45.290> nice<00:01:45.620> and<00:01:45.860> smooth<00:01:47.110> my<00:01:48.110> nose<00:01:48.320> gear<00:01:48.500> is

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
okay all nice and smooth my nose gear is

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.940 
okay all nice and smooth my nose gear is
not<00:01:48.740> mounted<00:01:48.860> real<00:01:49.220> good<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:50.230> now<00:01:51.230> against

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
not mounted real good and now against

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.700 
not mounted real good and now against
gravity<00:01:52.280> gear<00:01:53.090> down<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:57.020> is<00:01:57.230> a<00:01:57.260> massive

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
gravity gear down and this is a massive

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
gravity gear down and this is a massive
set<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.880> landing<00:01:59.570> gear<00:01:59.780> it<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.590> big<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:00.980> heavy

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
set of landing gear it is big and heavy

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.620 
set of landing gear it is big and heavy
and<00:02:02.590> works<00:02:03.590> perfect<00:02:05.770> now<00:02:07.090> for<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.180> next<00:02:08.450> test

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
and works perfect now for the next test

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.100 
and works perfect now for the next test
I<00:02:08.869> want<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.229> show<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.830> current<00:02:10.729> consumption

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
I want to show the current consumption

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.220 
I want to show the current consumption
but<00:02:12.110> I'm<00:02:12.650> going<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.920> have<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.840> remove<00:02:14.840> my<00:02:15.050> nose

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
but I'm going to have to remove my nose

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.920 
but I'm going to have to remove my nose
gear<00:02:15.470> set<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.950> no<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.340> know<00:02:16.520> okay<00:02:16.970> i'll<00:02:17.600> set<00:02:17.900> it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
gear set it no you know okay i'll set it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.300 
gear set it no you know okay i'll set it
aside<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.130> still<00:02:22.310> attached<00:02:22.700> and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
aside like so so it's still attached and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.210 
aside like so so it's still attached and
let's<00:02:25.310> see<00:02:26.320> what<00:02:27.320> currents<00:02:27.770> are<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:27.980> getting

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
let's see what currents are we getting

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.640 
let's see what currents are we getting
here<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.290> gear<00:02:30.290> up<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:33.020> can<00:02:33.170> see<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.320> very

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
here so gear up and you can see a very

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.790 
here so gear up and you can see a very
