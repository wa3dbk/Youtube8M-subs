him sure he was ripped but what really

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
him sure he was ripped but what really
inspired<00:01:46.619> me<00:01:46.829> was<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.159> he<00:01:47.310> maintained<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
inspired me was that he maintained it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969
