through all these here so first let's

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.869 
through all these here so first let's
take<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> look<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> low<00:00:38.520> end

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
take a look at the low end

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.520 
take a look at the low end
levan<00:00:39.149> inch<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.840> high<00:00:40.050> end<00:00:40.290> we'll<00:00:40.410> give

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
levan inch and the high end we'll give

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.889 
levan inch and the high end we'll give
these<00:00:40.620> side-by-side<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> higher<00:00:42.660> end

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
these side-by-side now the higher end

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.990 
these side-by-side now the higher end
here<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.140> only<00:00:43.350> $100<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.820> you

here is only $100 more and with that you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.200 
here is only $100 more and with that you
basically<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.800> 128<00:00:46.800> gigs<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.520> storage<00:00:47.610> versus

that the only configuration you have on

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.249 
that the only configuration you have on
the<00:01:13.979> lower<00:01:14.220> end<00:01:14.520> 11<00:01:15.180> inch<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> memory<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it comes with 4 gigs which is nice

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.609 
it comes with 4 gigs which is nice
because<00:01:18.180> before<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.810> low<00:01:18.960> end<00:01:19.170> only<00:01:19.439> came

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
because before the low end only came

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
because before the low end only came
with<00:01:19.740> 2<00:01:19.920> gigs<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.369> also<00:01:20.939> now<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> goes<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> 8

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
with 2 gigs and also now it goes up to 8

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
with 2 gigs and also now it goes up to 8
where<00:01:22.140> before<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.470> could<00:01:22.680> only<00:01:22.799> go<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> 4<00:01:23.640> so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
where before we could only go up to 4 so

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.580 
where before we could only go up to 4 so
that's<00:01:24.090> great<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.110> thing<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> keep<00:01:25.380> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that's great now one thing to keep in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
that's great now one thing to keep in
mind<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.700> soldered<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
mind is this is soldered right on to the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.450 
mind is this is soldered right on to the
logic<00:01:28.650> board<00:01:28.829> right<00:01:28.979> into<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> motherboard

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
logic board right into the motherboard

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.520 
logic board right into the motherboard
so<00:01:29.640> there's<00:01:30.270> no<00:01:30.450> memory<00:01:30.750> upgrades<00:01:31.079> down<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
so there's no memory upgrades down the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
so there's no memory upgrades down the
road<00:01:31.710> whatever<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.000> screen

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
road whatever you get in this screen

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.969 
road whatever you get in this screen
you're<00:01:33.689> gonna<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.930> stuck<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.920> know

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you're gonna be stuck with for you know

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
you're gonna be stuck with for you know
the<00:01:35.100> life<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.579> computer<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.329> want

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the life of this computer so if you want

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.819 
the life of this computer so if you want
more<00:01:36.659> memory<00:01:36.869> down<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> road<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.799> don't

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
more memory down the road and you don't

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.740 
more memory down the road and you don't
do<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.119> buy<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> new<00:01:39.570> computer

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
do this you have to buy a new computer

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
do this you have to buy a new computer
basically<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:41.759> idea<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
basically so I think it's a good idea to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.130 
basically so I think it's a good idea to
upgrade<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.450> hundred<00:01:42.720> bucks

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
upgrade this hundred bucks

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
upgrade this hundred bucks
is<00:01:43.200> reasonable<00:01:43.829> enough<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.700> up

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
is reasonable enough so you can get up

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.179 
is reasonable enough so you can get up
to<00:01:44.850> eight<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.540> actually<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> pretty<00:01:46.049> good

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
to eight and it's actually a pretty good

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.230 
to eight and it's actually a pretty good
you<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:47.640> fair<00:01:47.850> amount<00:01:48.060> here

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
you know a pretty good fair amount here

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.719 
you know a pretty good fair amount here
for<00:01:48.390> OS<00:01:48.689> 10<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> would<00:01:50.070> call<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> minimum

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
for OS 10 for I would call the minimum

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.889 
for OS 10 for I would call the minimum
and<00:01:50.880> eight<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> nice<00:01:51.479> comfortable

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and eight is a nice comfortable

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.359 
and eight is a nice comfortable
especially<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.920> not<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.189> primary

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
especially if it's not your primary

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.370 
especially if it's not your primary
computer<00:01:54.060> other<00:01:54.630> than<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.899> that's<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.350> we

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
computer other than that that's all we

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.289 
computer other than that that's all we
got<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> low<00:01:56.670> end<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
got here on the on the low end on the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.300 
got here on the on the low end on the
high<00:01:57.420> end<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.780> another<00:01:58.079> option<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.799> for

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
high end we have another option here for

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.670 
high end we have another option here for
some<00:01:59.490> storage<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.299> go<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.540> 256<00:02:01.079> gig<00:02:01.500> or

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
some storage you can go up to 256 gig or

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.420 
some storage you can go up to 256 gig or
512<00:02:02.450> depending<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:03.540> much<00:02:03.719> how<00:02:04.469> much<00:02:04.649> room<00:02:05.250> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
512 depending how much how much room you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.969 
512 depending how much how much room you
really<00:02:05.700> need<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:07.920> that's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
really need on here I you know that's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.919 
really need on here I you know that's
getting<00:02:08.280> kind<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.550> expensive<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.270> would<00:02:09.509> say

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
getting kind of expensive I would say

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.839 
getting kind of expensive I would say
maybe<00:02:10.410> consider<00:02:10.860> looking<00:02:11.009> against<00:02:11.340> some<00:02:11.489> USB

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
maybe consider looking against some USB

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.210 
maybe consider looking against some USB
thumb<00:02:12.660> drives<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.230> need<00:02:13.379> some<00:02:13.560> more

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
thumb drives if you need some more

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.130 
thumb drives if you need some more
you<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.430> get<00:02:14.520> some<00:02:14.670> USB<00:02:14.880> 3.0<00:02:15.570> drives<00:02:15.870> which

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you can get some USB 3.0 drives which

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.920 
you can get some USB 3.0 drives which
the<00:02:16.710> new<00:02:16.860> MacBook<00:02:17.280> MacBook<00:02:17.640> Airs<00:02:18.210> support<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the new MacBook MacBook Airs support and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.540 
the new MacBook MacBook Airs support and
they<00:02:19.350> can<00:02:19.470> be<00:02:19.560> pretty<00:02:19.710> fast<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
they can be pretty fast and get up to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.520 
they can be pretty fast and get up to
you<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.820> 100<00:02:21.120> Meg's<00:02:21.270> read/write<00:02:21.990> on<00:02:22.260> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
you know 100 Meg's read/write on it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.340 
you know 100 Meg's read/write on it
that's<00:02:23.250> pretty<00:02:23.490> affordable<00:02:24.270> storage<00:02:24.990> it's

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
that's pretty affordable storage it's

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.200 
that's pretty affordable storage it's
not<00:02:25.440> gonna<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:25.620> as<00:02:25.800> fast<00:02:26.250> as<00:02:26.400> SSD<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.060> it's

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
not gonna be as fast as SSD but it's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.030 
not gonna be as fast as SSD but it's
still<00:02:27.390> gonna<00:02:27.540> be<00:02:27.630> pretty<00:02:28.260> darn<00:02:28.470> fast<00:02:28.710> if<00:02:28.950> you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
still gonna be pretty darn fast if you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
still gonna be pretty darn fast if you
need<00:02:29.220> some<00:02:29.400> extra<00:02:29.730> storage<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.600> course

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
need some extra storage and of course

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.240 
need some extra storage and of course
you<00:02:30.840> got<00:02:30.960> Thunderbolt<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.650> need<00:02:31.800> any<00:02:32.010> like

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
you got Thunderbolt if you need any like

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
you got Thunderbolt if you need any like
desktop<00:02:32.490> storage<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.870> know<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:33.990> think<00:02:34.110> for

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
desktop storage so you know I think for

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.080 
desktop storage so you know I think for
300<00:02:34.770> bucks<00:02:34.860> I'd<00:02:35.130> shy<00:02:35.370> away<00:02:35.430> from<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.910> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
300 bucks I'd shy away from that and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.150 
300 bucks I'd shy away from that and
maybe<00:02:36.240> just<00:02:36.480> stick<00:02:36.600> with<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> 128<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
maybe just stick with the 128 and the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.320 
maybe just stick with the 128 and the
other<00:02:38.280> big<00:02:38.460> upgrade<00:02:38.820> we<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.300> can

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
other big upgrade we have as you can

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.810 
other big upgrade we have as you can
increase<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.900> processor<00:02:40.380> speed<00:02:40.680> from<00:02:40.950> 1.7

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
increase the processor speed from 1.7

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.310 
increase the processor speed from 1.7
which<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.240> on<00:02:42.360> both<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.630> these<00:02:42.720> up<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.020> 2

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
which is on both of these up to 2

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.010 
which is on both of these up to 2
gigahertz<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.400> core<00:02:44.730> i7<00:02:44.970> both<00:02:45.690> these<00:02:45.870> are

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
gigahertz on on a core i7 both these are

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.660 
gigahertz on on a core i7 both these are
dual<00:02:46.200> core<00:02:46.470> machines<00:02:46.830> there's<00:02:47.010> no<00:02:47.100> quad<00:02:47.370> core

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
dual core machines there's no quad core

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.690 
dual core machines there's no quad core
here<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.510> MacBook<00:02:48.870> Air<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:50.040> say<00:02:50.580> this

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
here in the MacBook Air so I say this

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.220 
here in the MacBook Air so I say this
high-end<00:02:51.030> 11<00:02:51.330> inch<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.540> probably<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.959> sweet

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
high-end 11 inch is probably the sweet

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.990 
high-end 11 inch is probably the sweet
spot<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.100> do<00:02:53.310> some<00:02:53.520> additional

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
spot because you can do some additional

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.550 
spot because you can do some additional
stuff<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> mainly<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.380> upgrade

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
stuff with it mainly you can upgrade

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.100 
stuff with it mainly you can upgrade
this<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.400> storage<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.000> need<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.630> you

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
this the storage if you need to and you

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.280 
this the storage if you need to and you
get<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> pretty<00:02:58.500> good<00:02:58.680> deal<00:02:58.890> here<00:02:59.300> 128<00:03:00.300> upgrade

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
get a pretty good deal here 128 upgrade

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.350 
get a pretty good deal here 128 upgrade
for<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.950> storage<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.550> then<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.300> addition

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
for the storage and then in addition

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.699 
for the storage and then in addition
that<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:03.930> upgrade<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.260> processor

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
that that you can upgrade the processor

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.710 
that that you can upgrade the processor
if<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.890> want<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.580> big<00:03:05.820> fan<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.209> i7

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
if you want to I'm a big fan of the i7

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.300 
if you want to I'm a big fan of the i7
just<00:03:06.870> because<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.110> do<00:03:07.170> video<00:03:07.590> work<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.100> stuff

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
just because I do video work and stuff

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.670 
just because I do video work and stuff
so<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.640> bet<00:03:08.820> if<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.060> ever<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:10.380> know<00:03:10.500> do

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
so I bet if I ever have to you know do

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.030 
so I bet if I ever have to you know do
any<00:03:11.010> any<00:03:11.880> heavy<00:03:12.840> lifting<00:03:12.930> kind<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.680> stuff<00:03:13.860> on

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
any any heavy lifting kind of stuff on

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.979 
any any heavy lifting kind of stuff on
it'll<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.310> nice<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.580> have<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.880> i7<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:15.600> I'm

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
it'll be nice to have that i7 so I'm

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.750 
it'll be nice to have that i7 so I'm
gonna<00:03:16.290> pick<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.650> one<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.400> what<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.550> would

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
gonna pick this one this is what I would

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.130 
gonna pick this one this is what I would
pick<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.209> also<00:03:18.630> if<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.750> take<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> look<00:03:19.049> at

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
pick and also if you take a look at

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.539 
pick and also if you take a look at
these<00:03:19.200> turbo<00:03:19.590> boost<00:03:19.830> speeds<00:03:20.130> which<00:03:20.400> is

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
these turbo boost speeds which is

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.190 
these turbo boost speeds which is
interesting<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.090> get<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.269> lot<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.660> extra<00:03:21.870> turbo

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
interesting you get a lot of extra turbo

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.410 
interesting you get a lot of extra turbo
boost<00:03:22.440> here<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.430> know<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.760> your<00:03:23.880> meit's<00:03:24.090> 3

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
boost here you know for your meit's 3

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.090 
boost here you know for your meit's 3
Giga<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:24.780> faster<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.620> know<00:03:25.980> you're

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
Giga it's faster but you know you're

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.250 
Giga it's faster but you know you're
getting<00:03:26.340> basically<00:03:26.760> 6<00:03:27.120> gigahertz<00:03:27.420> faster<00:03:28.080> in

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
getting basically 6 gigahertz faster in

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.350 
getting basically 6 gigahertz faster in
this<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.769> turbo<00:03:29.100> boost<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.610> turbo<00:03:30.180> boost

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
this in the turbo boost and turbo boost

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.820 
this in the turbo boost and turbo boost
allows<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.900> get<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.049> little<00:03:31.140> extra<00:03:31.440> speed

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
allows you to get a little extra speed

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.370 
allows you to get a little extra speed
out<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.549> lower<00:03:33.209> number<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.630> cores<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.230> kind

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
out of lower number of cores it can kind

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.630 
out of lower number of cores it can kind
of<00:03:34.440> shut<00:03:34.650> down<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.980> other<00:03:35.100> cores<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.519> make

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
of shut down the other cores and make

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.940 
of shut down the other cores and make
them<00:03:35.760> go<00:03:35.880> faster<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:37.019> some<00:03:37.230> tasks<00:03:37.739> it'll

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
them go faster so in some tasks it'll

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.430 
them go faster so in some tasks it'll
actually<00:03:38.070> run<00:03:38.459> up<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.910> 3.2<00:03:39.390> gigahertz<00:03:39.780> which

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
actually run up to 3.2 gigahertz which

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.870 
actually run up to 3.2 gigahertz which
is<00:03:40.560> nice<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.400> seems<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.670> be<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.760> pretty

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
is nice so this seems to be a pretty

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.479 
is nice so this seems to be a pretty
good<00:03:42.060> configuration<00:03:42.360> here<00:03:42.930> for<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.950> 11<00:03:44.340> inch

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
good configuration here for this 11 inch

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.650 
good configuration here for this 11 inch
and<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.820> what<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.299> actually<00:03:45.540> what

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
and this is what this is actually what

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.270 
and this is what this is actually what
I'm<00:03:45.780> getting<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.830> probably<00:03:47.070> what<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.190> would

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
I'm getting and probably what I would

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.940 
I'm getting and probably what I would
recommend<00:03:47.850> just<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:48.150> terms<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.510> value<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.170> you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
recommend just in terms of value and you

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.289 
recommend just in terms of value and you
know<00:03:50.010> get<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> machine<00:03:50.519> there<00:03:50.640> last<00:03:50.910> year<00:03:51.120> while

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
know get a machine there last year while

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.210 
know get a machine there last year while
one<00:03:51.900> other<00:03:52.049> thing<00:03:52.230> you're<00:03:52.380> worth<00:03:52.560> noting<00:03:53.040> and

one other thing you're worth noting and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.500 
one other thing you're worth noting and
is<00:03:53.340> down<00:03:53.489> here<00:03:53.670> on<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> bottom<00:03:54.000> there's<00:03:54.420> an

and<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:28.050> one<00:04:28.200> has<00:04:28.380> 128<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.070> this<00:04:29.160> was<00:04:29.310> 256

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
and this one has 128 and this was 256

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.760 
and this one has 128 and this was 256
all<00:04:30.450> right<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.380> can<00:04:31.500> see<00:04:31.620> there's<00:04:31.740> a

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
all right so you can see there's a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.990 
all right so you can see there's a
little<00:04:31.920> bit<00:04:32.070> more<00:04:32.100> of<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.310> substantial<00:04:32.460> upgrade

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
little bit more of a substantial upgrade

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.140 
little bit more of a substantial upgrade
going<00:04:33.480> up<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.490> 256<00:04:35.490> but<00:04:35.700> let's<00:04:35.940> see<00:04:36.030> what

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
going up to that 256 but let's see what

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.270 
going up to that 256 but let's see what
we<00:04:36.240> have<00:04:36.390> here<00:04:36.570> inside<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.170> options<00:04:37.590> similar

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
we have here inside the options similar

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.190 
we have here inside the options similar
to<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.700> low-end<00:04:39.120> apples<00:04:39.570> restricting<00:04:40.110> our

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
to the low-end apples restricting our

to the low-end apples restricting our
options<00:04:40.680> here<00:04:40.940> where<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.060> can't<00:04:42.300> basically

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
options here where you can't basically

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.210 
options here where you can't basically
get<00:04:43.010> 128<00:04:44.060> gig<00:04:45.590> configuration<00:04:46.590> in<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.770> 13-inch

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
get 128 gig configuration in a 13-inch

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.100 
get 128 gig configuration in a 13-inch
unfortunately<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.390> would<00:04:48.480> be<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.570> nice<00:04:48.720> nice

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
unfortunately that would be a nice nice

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.050 
unfortunately that would be a nice nice
value<00:04:49.470> spot<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.740> think<00:04:49.860> but<00:04:50.550> otherwise<00:04:50.730> yeah<00:04:51.000> I

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
value spot I think but otherwise yeah I

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.970 
value spot I think but otherwise yeah I
definitely<00:04:51.450> say<00:04:51.630> I'm<00:04:51.930> consider<00:04:52.320> this<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.740> 8

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
definitely say I'm consider this is 8

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.770 
definitely say I'm consider this is 8

we saw on the high end the 11 inch we

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.880 
we saw on the high end the 11 inch we
have<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.780> same<00:04:57.990> options<00:04:58.440> here<00:04:58.620> with<00:04:58.800> the

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
have the same options here with the

and I'm not I'm not a huge fan of this

and I'm not I'm not a huge fan of this
13-inch<00:05:04.680> configuration<00:05:05.340> cuz<00:05:05.520> I'd<00:05:05.700> rather

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
13-inch configuration cuz I'd rather

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.490 
13-inch configuration cuz I'd rather
save<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.210> little<00:05:06.450> more<00:05:06.630> money<00:05:06.690> you<00:05:07.170> know<00:05:07.260> get<00:05:07.410> it

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
save a little more money you know get it

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.250 
save a little more money you know get it

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
down from from 1,500 and then you know

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.630 
down from from 1,500 and then you know
of<00:05:10.320> course<00:05:10.440> when<00:05:10.590> we<00:05:10.620> add<00:05:10.800> on<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.190> it<00:05:11.460> brings

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
of course when we add on this it brings

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.510 
of course when we add on this it brings
it<00:05:11.730> up<00:05:11.790> to<00:05:11.850> 1600<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:12.780> stick<00:05:13.110> with<00:05:13.200> 128<00:05:14.010> not

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
it up to 1600 and stick with 128 not

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.120 
it up to 1600 and stick with 128 not

you<00:05:18.000> know<00:05:18.090> in<00:05:18.210> this<00:05:18.300> particular

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
you know in this particular

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.290 
you know in this particular
configuration<00:05:19.010> with<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.040> i7<00:05:20.460> processor

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
configuration with the i7 processor

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.250 
configuration with the i7 processor
that's<00:05:21.510> I<00:05:21.600> guess<00:05:21.660> where<00:05:21.900> I'm<00:05:21.960> going<00:05:22.140> with<00:05:22.230> that

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
that's I guess where I'm going with that

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.960 
that's I guess where I'm going with that
thought<00:05:22.620> but<00:05:23.310> yeah<00:05:23.460> this<00:05:23.550> is<00:05:23.610> where<00:05:23.820> I<00:05:23.850> would

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
thought but yeah this is where I would

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.460 
thought but yeah this is where I would
look<00:05:24.180> at<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.330> really<00:05:24.450> loved<00:05:24.690> getting<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:24.930> i7

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
look at I really loved getting this i7

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.020 
look at I really loved getting this i7
processor<00:05:25.950> but<00:05:26.160> again<00:05:26.490> if<00:05:26.580> it's<00:05:26.640> not<00:05:26.820> a<00:05:26.850> big

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
processor but again if it's not a big

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.190 
processor but again if it's not a big
deal<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.420> you<00:05:27.480> you<00:05:27.690> know<00:05:27.780> maybe<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.080> could

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
deal to you you know maybe you could

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.230 
deal to you you know maybe you could
stick<00:05:28.440> with<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:29.100> lower<00:05:29.310> end<00:05:29.520> configuration

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
stick with the lower end configuration

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.510 
stick with the lower end configuration
over<00:05:30.570> here<00:05:30.840> so<00:05:31.440> there<00:05:31.710> guys<00:05:31.950> a<00:05:31.980> look<00:05:32.250> at<00:05:32.400> the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
over here so there guys a look at the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.280 
over here so there guys a look at the
MacBook<00:05:32.880> Air<00:05:32.910> give<00:05:33.450> you<00:05:33.510> some<00:05:33.660> ideas<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.020> think

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
MacBook Air give you some ideas to think

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.720 
MacBook Air give you some ideas to think
about<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.710> key<00:05:34.890> feature<00:05:35.160> here<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.520> you

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
about the key feature here that you

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.030 
about the key feature here that you
kinda<00:05:35.940> understand<00:05:36.420> is<00:05:36.660> that<00:05:36.740> memory<00:05:37.740> is<00:05:37.890> not

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
kinda understand is that memory is not

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.440 
kinda understand is that memory is not
upgradeable<00:05:38.580> so<00:05:38.760> whatever<00:05:39.180> you're<00:05:39.330> gonna

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
upgradeable so whatever you're gonna

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.000 
upgradeable so whatever you're gonna
pick<00:05:39.720> out<00:05:39.900> I<00:05:40.110> think<00:05:40.410> it's<00:05:40.530> worth<00:05:40.680> doing<00:05:40.950> a

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
pick out I think it's worth doing a

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.500 
pick out I think it's worth doing a
build<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.310> order<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.730> Max<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.150> sucker

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
build to order and Max and that sucker

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.780 
build to order and Max and that sucker
