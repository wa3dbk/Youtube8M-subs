there<00:00:19.300> are<00:00:19.449> several<00:00:19.689> ways<00:00:20.020> of<00:00:20.289> getting<00:00:20.350> roster

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
there are several ways of getting roster

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.460 
there are several ways of getting roster
information<00:00:21.279> that<00:00:22.090> is<00:00:22.240> pixels<00:00:22.750> out<00:00:23.140> of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
information that is pixels out of

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.859 
information that is pixels out of
Sketchup<00:00:23.770> and<00:00:24.160> into<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.520> file<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.630> most

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
Sketchup and into a file the most

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.319 
Sketchup and into a file the most
obvious<00:00:26.320> method<00:00:26.349> is<00:00:26.919> to<00:00:27.279> copy<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.820> contents

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
obvious method is to copy the contents

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.659 
obvious method is to copy the contents
of<00:00:28.449> the<00:00:28.630> screen<00:00:28.750> to<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.259> clipboard<00:00:29.619> you<00:00:30.489> can

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
of the screen to the clipboard you can

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.069 
of the screen to the clipboard you can
then<00:00:30.789> paste<00:00:31.060> it<00:00:31.270> into<00:00:31.449> a<00:00:31.570> graphics

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
then paste it into a graphics

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.950 
then paste it into a graphics
application<00:00:32.739> like<00:00:32.890> Photoshop<00:00:32.920> on<00:00:33.699> the<00:00:34.360> PC<00:00:34.750> you

application like Photoshop on the PC you

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.630 
application like Photoshop on the PC you
can<00:00:34.989> do<00:00:35.260> that<00:00:35.440> by<00:00:35.620> pressing<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.160> Print<00:00:36.460> Screen

paste from the clipboard into the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.319 
paste from the clipboard into the
document<00:00:44.470> you'll<00:00:45.100> have<00:00:45.280> an<00:00:45.400> exact<00:00:45.820> copy<00:00:46.150> of

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329

document you'll have an exact copy of
the<00:00:46.540> screen<00:00:46.839> so<00:00:47.440> you<00:00:47.530> will<00:00:47.710> need<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:47.920> crop<00:00:48.280> out

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489

any of the user interface elements like

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.610 
any of the user interface elements like
the<00:00:50.770> menus<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.699> scene<00:00:51.940> tabs<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.930> tool<00:00:53.140> boxes

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
and so on and on the Mac you can do this

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.139 
and so on and on the Mac you can do this

won't include any of the user interface

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.430 
won't include any of the user interface
elements<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.060> menu<00:01:51.390> bar<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.229> tool

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.310 
elements like the menu bar the tool
boxes<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.840> recommend<00:01:54.840> leaving<00:01:54.990> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
boxes and so on I recommend leaving this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.320 
boxes and so on I recommend leaving this
checked<00:01:55.710> because<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:56.550> smooth<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
checked because it will smooth out the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.840 
checked because it will smooth out the
jagged<00:01:57.810> lines<00:01:58.070> creating<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.130> quality<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.790> is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
jagged lines creating a quality that is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120 
jagged lines creating a quality that is
superior<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.050> you<00:02:01.229> even<00:02:01.619> see<00:02:01.830> on<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
superior to what you even see on the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.570 
superior to what you even see on the
screen

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
screen

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.810 
screen
so<00:02:04.270> I'll<00:02:04.480> go<00:02:04.630> ahead<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.990> export<00:02:05.440> and<00:02:05.820> then

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
so I'll go ahead and export and then

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.640 
so I'll go ahead and export and then
we'll<00:02:07.000> be<00:02:07.090> able<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.390> open<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:08.110> up<00:02:08.260> in<00:02:08.590> a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
we'll be able to open that up in a

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.859 
we'll be able to open that up in a
program<00:02:09.040> like<00:02:09.070> Photoshop<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.060> print<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.750> out

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
program like Photoshop and print it out

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.690 
program like Photoshop and print it out

degree panorama x' from sketchup but to
do<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.739> need<00:02:29.040> two<00:02:29.400> things<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:30.030> ruby

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
do this you need two things a ruby

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.349 
do this you need two things a ruby
script<00:02:31.140> called<00:02:31.469> cubic<00:02:32.010> panel<00:02:32.459> out<00:02:32.670> that

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
script called cubic panel out that

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.220 
script called cubic panel out that
allows<00:02:33.629> you<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.900> export<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.769> set<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.250> six<00:02:35.579> images

representing the faces of a cube and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.880 
representing the faces of a cube and
then<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.420> need<00:02:39.629> some<00:02:39.959> third-party<00:02:40.620> software

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
then you need some third-party software

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.670 
then you need some third-party software
to<00:02:41.700> stitch<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.269> together<00:02:42.510> into<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:43.109> panorama

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
to stitch this together into a panorama

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.890 
to stitch this together into a panorama
and<00:02:43.950> I'll<00:02:44.430> show<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.730> an<00:02:45.030> example<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.599> just

course you don't necessarily need the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.929 
course you don't necessarily need the
skin<00:04:24.289> because<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.800> can<00:04:24.949> just<00:04:25.159> drag<00:04:25.430> in<00:04:25.729> the

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:25.939 
skin because you can just drag in the

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.029 
skin because you can just drag in the
panorama<00:04:26.419> itself<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.379> move<00:04:27.529> around

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.189 

the<00:04:30.339> shift-key<00:04:30.699> allows<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.389> to<00:04:31.509> zoom<00:04:31.749> in<00:04:31.960> and

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
the shift-key allows you to zoom in and

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.709 
the shift-key allows you to zoom in and
the<00:04:33.069> command<00:04:33.400> key<00:04:33.669> allows<00:04:34.029> you<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.330> zoom<00:04:34.360> out

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:34.719 
the command key allows you to zoom out

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.200 
the command key allows you to zoom out
all<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.589> all<00:04:35.710> it's<00:04:36.039> a<00:04:36.129> very<00:04:36.159> easy<00:04:36.610> way<00:04:36.969> of

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
all in all it's a very easy way of

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.759 
all in all it's a very easy way of
exporting<00:04:38.169> panoramas<00:04:38.770> from<00:04:38.979> Sketchup
