00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.100
 well, all good things come to an end 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.279
 we did not ask varlamovu seed but simple 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.279
 Moscow Dynamo winning row 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.919
 Artem Frolov was struck by this from the series 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.930
 Puddles drove what had already been seen first 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.929
 long time defeat wholesale 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.390
 squirrel 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.289
 how to yourself and Muscovites are not dear friends 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.720
 not the announcement of new programs and so 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 no longer thinking popular 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.890
 the telecast which goes on one of 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.089
 central channels 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.439
 just the composition of the delegation 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.039
 Novosibirsk, the capital of the away game 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.699
 against the dynamo came in several 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.649
 a man whose Moscow hometown 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.170
 for example, general manager 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.309
 club kirill fastovsky root 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.000
 Muscovite for several seasons 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.120
 was one of the leaders of CSKA 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.239
 by the will of fate the last three years 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.280
 working in Novosibirsk itself 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 the beginning was the program 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.680
 worldwide fame for this 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.160
 the program 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.820
 moving progressively 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 first season like this maybe an hour 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.210
 the result is a little better see what 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.990
 he will be at the end of the season naturally 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.370
 now this gap 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.370
 but surely we understand where we are going 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.570
 but we also know what disadvantages we have 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.200
 another representative of the capital region 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.740
 the composition of Siberia head coach 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.900
 Dmitry quarterly some passages that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.299
 mentor is not born capital will be right 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.749
 but wait for friends native to Dmitry 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.259
 Vyacheslavovich Resurrection 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.420
 there are only four glass meters 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.759
 from Moscow and in the light of the permanent 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850
 talk about combining capital and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.189
 areas this dispute is considered irrelevant 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.509
 this season the first two quarterly in 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.670
 as a steering Siberia his appointment 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.569
 in the off season in the club came up with all 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:35.880
 by responsibility 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210
 and now on his choice does not regret 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.650
 I always 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.340
 I would like to work 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.010
 novice precisely Russian 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.900
 100 leading modern hockey 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.110
 while being 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.910
 quite famous 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.690
 hockey players in the past having achieved years 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.000
 many summit results high 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.470
 results but not so long ago 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.280
 Such because such very strongly 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.220
 the style that preaches has changed 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.940
 reports about their training team 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.760
 it is logical that the most promising 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.270
 because he he said from such 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.169
 concepts like traps 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:15.829
 which is very much progressing 47 3 not 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.899
 be given to countries at a faster pace 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:18.509
 liter 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:20.609
 all recent successes at the club are related as 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.549
 Russia 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.400
 both coaches of Siberia started the championship 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.760
 home defeat from locomotive however 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 then Novosibirsk managed to gather and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.739
 the match 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.419
 ward quarterly approached 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.310
 with the rank of one of the leaders of the eastern 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.209
 conference 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.299
 nothing else happened yet 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.700
 no one won anything above having 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.969
 no intermediate 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.059
 results 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.899
 not really 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.449
 we just prepared for the start of the championship 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.439
 I understand how tight the calendar is 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.999
 waiting for us in the first three months they understood 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.229
 that they have these glasses if the plot is empty 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.360
 then you can't make it out 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.060
 I understand Siberia in order to 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.880
 to develop to improve the game is necessary 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.489
 gain 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.459
 in the last weeks in the team occurred 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.049
 changes go left back 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.739
 will sign an order four forwards 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.590
 Andrei Stepanov Mikhail Fisenko Kirill 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.449
 Lebedev and Nikita Gusev 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.959
 they were replaced by experienced masters from 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.549
 Khabarovsk came here forward 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.569
 Alexander Nikulin is well known 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.839
 Plastovskoy on work in CSKA and we to 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.959
 experienced constantine eyes which 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.139
 started this season 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.059
 we needed a central 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.049
 second-tier attackers we are very 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.049
 count soshnikova 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.759
 here it just takes a worthy place 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.849
 obvious problems with the attacker first 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.349
 the link 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.609
 we want fictitiously 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.669
 but prospects uses the second 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:44.989
 link for this we need a striker 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.689
 to the first-named Luzhkov one thing not 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.209
 less so 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.039
 finally returning to our 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.680
 talk hunting club Siberia 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.499

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:58.539
 became another representative
