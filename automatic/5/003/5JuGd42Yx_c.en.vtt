can actually see how the seeds on the
side<00:00:32.810> of<00:00:32.930> this<00:00:33.050> actually<00:00:33.950> grow<00:00:34.220> in<00:00:34.400> arches<00:00:34.970> if

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
side of this actually grow in arches if

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.700 
side of this actually grow in arches if
you<00:00:35.540> look<00:00:35.690> from<00:00:35.810> the<00:00:35.900> top<00:00:36.080> that<00:00:36.290> kind<00:00:36.410> of<00:00:36.500> like

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
you look from the top that kind of like

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.830 
you look from the top that kind of like
straight<00:00:37.010> lines<00:00:37.060> but<00:00:38.060> you<00:00:38.180> want<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:38.750> want

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
straight lines but you want to you want

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.930 
straight lines but you want to you want
to<00:00:38.960> get<00:00:39.110> in<00:00:39.230> these<00:00:39.380> arches<00:00:39.830> and<00:00:40.460> just<00:00:40.730> follow

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
to get in these arches and just follow

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.210 
to get in these arches and just follow
that<00:00:41.090> natural<00:00:41.480> curve<00:00:41.720> around<00:00:42.200> if<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.010> cut

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
that natural curve around if you cut

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.760 
that natural curve around if you cut
down<00:00:43.400> straight<00:00:43.880> into<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:44.450> at<00:00:45.460> like<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:47.770> going

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
down straight into it at like this going

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.310 
down straight into it at like this going
about<00:00:48.980> half<00:00:49.250> way<00:00:49.490> up<00:00:49.900> you're<00:00:50.900> going<00:00:50.990> to<00:00:51.050> just

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
about half way up you're going to just

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.040 
about half way up you're going to just
cut<00:00:51.560> straight<00:00:51.950> down<00:00:52.010> into<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.610> berry<00:00:56.050> about

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
cut straight down into the berry about

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.550 
cut straight down into the berry about
that<00:00:57.260> far<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.740> then<00:00:58.370> just<00:00:58.580> fold<00:00:58.790> it<00:00:58.970> out<00:00:59.560> and

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
that far and then just fold it out and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.540 
that far and then just fold it out and
you're<00:01:00.650> going<00:01:00.740> to<00:01:00.800> go<00:01:00.950> in<00:01:01.070> here<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.310> do<00:01:01.400> this

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
you're going to go in here and do this

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.270 
you're going to go in here and do this
again<00:01:03.549> fold<00:01:04.549> it<00:01:04.670> out<00:01:05.950> usually<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.039> get<00:01:07.130> about

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
again fold it out usually you get about

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.760 
again fold it out usually you get about
four<00:01:07.700> of<00:01:07.820> these<00:01:07.939> sometimes<00:01:08.689> though<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.380> can

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
four of these sometimes though you can

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.349 
four of these sometimes though you can
get<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.390> fifth<00:01:11.390> one<00:01:11.539> if<00:01:11.689> it's<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.990> big<00:01:12.259> berry<00:01:13.359> when

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.080 
get a fifth one if it's a big berry when
you<00:01:14.450> do<00:01:14.570> your<00:01:14.750> little<00:01:14.960> cuts<00:01:15.170> like<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:16.090> so

actually I fold that little guy back out
so<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.770> can<00:01:39.950> see

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
so you can see

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.300 
so you can see
makes<00:01:42.950> kind<00:01:43.220> of<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:44.170> shape<00:01:45.170> there<00:01:45.470> we're<00:01:46.220> going

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
makes kind of a shape there we're going

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.570 
makes kind of a shape there we're going
to<00:01:46.400> take<00:01:46.580> these<00:01:47.650> we're<00:01:48.650> going<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.830> cut<00:01:49.100> down<00:01:49.810> in

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
to take these we're going to cut down in

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.230 
to take these we're going to cut down in
and<00:01:52.580> then<00:01:52.910> kind<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.480> pull<00:01:53.750> them<00:01:53.870> out<00:01:54.050> like<00:01:54.590> that

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
and then kind of pull them out like that

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.430 
and then kind of pull them out like that
that's<00:01:56.240> going<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.480> give<00:01:56.630> us<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.840> nice<00:01:57.020> round

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
that's going to give us a nice round

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:14.630 
that's going to give us a nice round
shape<00:01:59.200> add<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.620> shape<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.830> our<00:02:01.070> rose

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.460 

so<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> bunch<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.870> different<00:02:15.990> pedals

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
so you get a bunch of different pedals

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.590 
so you get a bunch of different pedals
out<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:18.590> hands<00:02:19.590> are<00:02:19.680> shaking<00:02:20.010> there<00:02:20.600> now

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
out of it hands are shaking there now

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.850 
out of it hands are shaking there now
here's<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.650> trick<00:02:23.000> from<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.260> inside<00:02:25.260> we're

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
here's the trick from that inside we're

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.890 
here's the trick from that inside we're
going<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.070> take<00:02:26.390> we're<00:02:27.390> actually<00:02:27.540> going<00:02:27.780> to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
going to take we're actually going to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.680 
going to take we're actually going to
cut<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:30.650> spiral<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.310> until<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.240> get<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.390> plug

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
cut a spiral in this until we get a plug

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.080 
cut a spiral in this until we get a plug
on<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.110> top<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.710> okay<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.820> can<00:02:35.910> take

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
on the top of it okay so you can take

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.310 
on the top of it okay so you can take
your<00:02:36.210> knife<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:36.780> put<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.050> out<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> little

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
your knife you can put it out a little

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.530 
your knife you can put it out a little
bit<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.500> an<00:02:37.590> angle<00:02:37.820> putting<00:02:38.820> from<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> outside

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
bit of an angle putting from the outside

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.510 
bit of an angle putting from the outside
here<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.920> start<00:02:41.370> cutting<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.730> spiral<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
here and start cutting a spiral and the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.930 
here and start cutting a spiral and the
thinner<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.060> cut<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.020> better<00:02:46.320> really

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
thinner you cut it the better really

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.380 
thinner you cut it the better really
because<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.060> looks<00:02:48.300> more<00:02:48.540> rows<00:02:49.020> like<00:02:49.380> big

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
because it looks more rows like big

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.210 
because it looks more rows like big
thick<00:02:51.390> portions<00:02:52.110> they<00:02:52.530> don't<00:02:52.709> play<00:02:52.950> well<00:02:53.190> with

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
thick portions they don't play well with

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.390 
thick portions they don't play well with
the<00:02:53.520> eye<00:02:57.350> they're<00:02:58.350> sturdier<00:02:58.830> but<00:02:58.950> they<00:02:59.220> don't

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the eye they're sturdier but they don't

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.520 
the eye they're sturdier but they don't
play<00:02:59.520> well<00:02:59.610> with<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.030> eye<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:01.260> we're<00:03:01.410> actually

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
play well with the eye so we're actually

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.949 
play well with the eye so we're actually
going<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.860> cut<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.450> until<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.690> nice

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
going to cut this until we get a nice

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.830 
going to cut this until we get a nice
little<00:03:04.230> plug<00:03:05.180> right<00:03:06.180> out<00:03:06.300> of<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> middle<00:03:06.720> of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
little plug right out of the middle of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.820 
little plug right out of the middle of
it<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:09.000> comes<00:03:09.270> out<00:03:09.570> now<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.530> see

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
it and that comes out now you can see

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.720 
it and that comes out now you can see
our<00:03:10.970> rows<00:03:11.970> starting<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> take<00:03:12.720> shape<00:03:13.730> we're

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
our rows starting to take shape we're

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.430 
our rows starting to take shape we're
actually<00:03:14.880> going<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.300> fold<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.840> all<00:03:15.959> back<00:03:16.200> out

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
actually going to fold it all back out

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.020 
actually going to fold it all back out
here<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.280> going<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.520> one<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.790> pre

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
here this is going to be one of the pre

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.890 
here this is going to be one of the pre
rows<00:03:19.489> now<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.549> can<00:03:20.790> take<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.269> push<00:03:21.570> down

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
rows now you can take and just push down

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.130 
rows now you can take and just push down
on<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.580> you'll<00:03:23.760> see<00:03:23.850> how<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.840> wanting

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
on this and you'll see how this wanting

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.080 
on this and you'll see how this wanting
to<00:03:25.200> bind<00:03:25.410> up<00:03:25.560> right<00:03:25.739> here<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.790> take

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
on the same cut and cut down making a

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.910 
on the same cut and cut down making a
relief<00:03:39.480> cut<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:43.140> that'll<00:03:43.380> allow<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.709> to

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
relief cut and that'll allow it to

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.920 
relief cut and that'll allow it to
spread<00:03:44.190> out<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.459> little<00:03:44.700> more<00:03:44.940> don't<00:03:45.660> be<00:03:45.780> afraid
