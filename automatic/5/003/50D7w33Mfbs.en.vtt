00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:32.510 

you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.859 

so<00:01:33.520> it's<00:01:33.640> worth<00:01:33.760> noting<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.360> whole<00:01:34.510> song<00:01:34.750> is

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
so it's worth noting the whole song is

in C minor this is the right hand

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.380 
in C minor this is the right hand
basically<00:01:37.630> it's<00:01:37.840> just<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:38.140> C<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.680> G<00:01:39.400> g-sharp

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
basically it's just a C and G g-sharp

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
basically it's just a C and G g-sharp
and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:42.549> back<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:42.940> our<00:01:43.000> G<00:01:43.390> then<00:01:44.200> F<00:01:44.759> G<00:01:45.759> E<00:01:46.060> minor

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and then back to our G then F G E minor

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.710 
and then back to our G then F G E minor
D<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.810> G<00:01:50.170> scale<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:51.070> C<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.570> you're

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
D and the G scale to C then you're

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.770 
D and the G scale to C then you're
afraid<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.190> salon<00:01:54.460> C<00:01:54.729> minor<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.630> just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
afraid it's a salon C minor and you just

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.660

basically add little bit there's not

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.760 
basically add little bit there's not
much<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.180> can<00:01:58.240> really<00:01:58.540> go<00:01:58.780> wrong<00:01:59.020> does<00:01:59.470> lungs

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
much that can really go wrong does lungs

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.280 
much that can really go wrong does lungs
as<00:01:59.979> hand<00:02:00.220> right<00:02:00.490> try<00:02:01.479> an<00:02:01.540> experiment<00:02:02.049> that's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290

this song but starting the news during
in<00:02:14.860> every<00:02:15.070> matter<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.209> just<00:02:16.360> sort<00:02:16.540> of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
in every matter but you just sort of

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.240 
in every matter but you just sort of
shifting<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.319> comfortable<00:02:17.920> for<00:02:18.040> your

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
shifting it so it's comfortable for your

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.240 
shifting it so it's comfortable for your
hands<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:20.170> you've<00:02:20.350> got<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> G<00:02:20.830> major

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
hands and then you've got a G major

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.130 
hands and then you've got a G major
once<00:02:21.430> again<00:02:21.519> shift<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:22.000> your<00:02:22.150> hands<00:02:22.330> then<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
once again shift of your hands then you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.550 
once again shift of your hands then you
basically<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.680> remain<00:02:24.130> foursome

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.960 

the<00:02:27.980> left<00:02:28.160> net<00:02:28.310> doesn't<00:02:28.490> actually<00:02:28.700> have<00:02:28.910> a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the left net doesn't actually have a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.440 
the left net doesn't actually have a
change<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.300> map<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.140> mean<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:32.120> could<00:02:32.300> do

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
change to map so I mean you could do

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:42.880 
change to map so I mean you could do
something<00:02:32.930> experimental<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:34.100> really<00:02:34.310> wanted

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
