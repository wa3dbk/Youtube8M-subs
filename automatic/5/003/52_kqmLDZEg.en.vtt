00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.380
 that we will show you step by step how 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.959
 enter and remove sim cards and 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.079
 sd of samsung galaxy devices 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.659
 series to these steps are valid for 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:19.140
 three devices of the series in this 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:21.330
 video we will use a galaxy to 5 in the part 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.150
 right of the device we will find 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.669
 two trays one primary the lower 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.220
 for nano sim cards and 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.250
 secondary the upper one for the cards 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.800
 sd the devices of the series are 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.980
 only compatible with nano cards 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.410
 sim to remove the sim card from your 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 tray first we must make sure of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 that the device is turned off 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.250
 we keep pressing the power button 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.740
 until the options appear and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.790
 then press turn off and confirm 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.800
 with accept then introduce the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.200
 extraction ring in the hole 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.330
 the sim card tray to be able 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.150
 open it we introduce the ring of 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.790
 extraction in its hole to avoid 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.050
 damage the device we should make sure 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.050
 to place the ring 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.420
 perpendicularly below 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.540
 we pull gently to extract the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.580
 tray we put the sim card in the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 tray with golden contacts towards 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.620
 below we re-insert the tray 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.660
 in the device to prevent the 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.180
 dust particles come into contact 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.980
 with the inside of the device we must 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.200
 make sure the tray is 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.020
 closed now we can turn on the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.450
 device to insert the sd card 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.790
 we must remove the tray intended 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.000
 For this, keep in mind that the series 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.370
 It supports cards up to 64 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.410
 gigabytes we introduce the ring of 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.600
 extraction in the hole of the tray 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.970
 of the memory card to be able to 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.820
 open it we must make sure that the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.980
 ring is perpendicular to the hole 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.190
 otherwise the device could 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.800
 be damaged then we extract 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.600
 Gently place the tray 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 memory card with contacts 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.800
 golden down 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.530
 we re-insert the tray in the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.540
 phone to prevent particles 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.670
 of dust come into contact with the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.590
 inside of the device we must 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.800
 make sure the tray is 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.680
 closed we should keep in mind that if 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.819
 the sd card tray is marked 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.650
 with the symbol of zinc two micro sd 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.989
 we can use a second sim card 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.030
 before using this tray for a 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.180
 sim card we must turn off the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.180
 device 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.519
 we put the sim card in the tray 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.659
 with the gold contacts facing down 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.730
 we must bear in mind that the 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.730
 orientation of the sim placed in this 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.940
 tray will be ice cream we go back to 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.650
 insert the tray into the device 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.019
 we must make sure it is well 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.970
 closed to prevent dust from entering 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.200
 in contact with the inside of the phone 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.480
 then 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.640
 we keep pressing the button 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.379
 turned on to turn on the device 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.569
 that is all 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.030
 we just learned how to introduce and 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.340
 remove the sim and sd cards from a 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.069
 samsung galaxy device series 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.230
 for more information and tips
