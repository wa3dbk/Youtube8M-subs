00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.290
 grow dear listeners with you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.759
 Jeff gave many of you noticed that with 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.500
 time in windows starts somehow 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.150
 slows down to think about 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.719
 banal operations just long 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.929
 loaded 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.719
 for many the solution becomes pretty 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.590
 yet radical and you just 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.800
 reinstall windows or from 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.529
 wear it to reinstall 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 I 'll offer you a method which 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.010
 allow you to save all your files 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.470
 thereby not reinstalling windows and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.890
 somehow speed up the operating room 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 systems for starters we need to open and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.070
 command to execute 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.200
 and lead the team m with camping here this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 the command you enter in the field to execute and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.410
 press ok 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.899
 then you will have a configuration window 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.930
 systems here the most important thing for you will be 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.960
 Startup point at Startup point 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.399
 in without fail can see 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 all those programs that you will have 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.680
 start automatically on startup 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.420
 systems exactly these all the files and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.960
 slow down just your computer when 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.390
 because they require 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.280
 additional resources have prepared another 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.170
 downloads because for example you 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.729
 start the computer and you 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.780
 automatically as my case 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.790
 opens an acrobat yes trader java 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.560
 and other programs 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.330
 for example, I don't want what I have 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.909
 this or that automatically opened 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.420
 program so i find it a list 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.430
 autoloading and disabling one or another on 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.159
 my opinion can be made much easier 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.590
 disable absolutely everything with you 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.960
 the computer will boot without loss 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.610
 all kinds of resources to launch those or 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.470
 other programs and in the future you can 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.960
 open all those programs that you 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.450
 are needed already by directly running them 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.630
 you won't lose anything by hand 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.430
 apart from acquiring speed 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.700
 also worth remembering and and as parameters 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.170
 services because here services also 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.990
 makes your computer think 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.600
 at start as well as with further 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.850
 start using your resources already 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.150
 directly in the course of your work and 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.780
 as well as the autoload item in item 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.310
 services and all these services from automatically 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.440
 running the program starts at you 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.200
 absorb the memory of many 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.510
 RAM does not exceed the example 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.340
 two gigabytes and for windows it will be 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.990
 so few in this case 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.570
 RAM becomes pretty 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.680
 still a valuable resource and it needs to be somehow 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.170
 rational use 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.300
 so here I am also offering you 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.200
 see absolutely all services and 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.330
 disable exactly those that you do not need 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.860
 For example, you can tick off 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.290
 display microsoft services 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.680
 hence after that you will see those 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.940
 programs that you run 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.489
 directly with your installation then 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.790
 there are services of those programs which 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.860
 it was you who installed it for those who are afraid 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.720
 disconnect microsoft services 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.430
 would be the best way 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.350
 but if you want to improve speed 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.060
 work your computer and less 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.880
 use memory under 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.590
 father of the service or application that you 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.690
 absolutely do not want to use something 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.320
 I suggest you still dig into 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.510
 point of service and if you are confused by that 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.250
 or a different fate and you are afraid that she 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.910
 can either hurt your 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.269
 computer 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.640
 there are two ways here or you can not 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.799
 disable or search the internet and 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.840
 and the description and maybe you just do not 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.440
 know how she works or what she does 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.780
 answers 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.940
 so try experimenting 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.459
 as a last resort you can always 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.410
 boot back shout out at 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.580
 thus turn on you will recover 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.980
 absolutely all work 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.160
 and it is also worth saying that you all 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.950
 yet not evil sire become all this further 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.500
 you need to click apply and ok 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.599
 and here he brought you tapu on 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.090
 reboot or exit without reboot 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.319
 if you know that soon you will turn off 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.069
 computer or will it 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.780
 reboot 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.849
 can click the way out without 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.709
 reboot if you want 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.160
 restart now click 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.450
 reboot item and also want 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.340
 say about the services that all the same 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.200
 it will be more correct to disconnect several 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.819
 through another utility for this choose 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.959
 context menu on item ok my 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:20.830
 computer item management further on you 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.080
 an auxiliary window comes out here 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.660
 choose service point and applications 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.200
 services here are all the same services that 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.250
 were in the genie mask utility only 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.380
 here they are already 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.110
 sorted into several items and 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.830
 Here you will see and the type of load and 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.550
 you can choose their type here 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.180
 downloads 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.130
 and thereby determine what happens to them 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.020
 exactly make you can run 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.479
 or disable this or that fate 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.680
 which currently have no working example 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.590
 this service works 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.500
 and me and and click how to stop after 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.440
 This we see that the computer basically 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.360
 nothing is lost then further and seeing 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.050
 manual startup type we can change 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.120
 him on 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.280
 either disabled or leave on item 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.319
 manually for that function when 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.840
 and directly you will include this 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:13.509
 the pooja program is completely disabled 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.379
 disable automatic start next 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:19.210
 click again change and ok 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.220
 not long rummaging you can turn off 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.610
 absolutely all that part that you 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.610
 absolutely
