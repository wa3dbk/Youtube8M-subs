00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.340
 I do not have words or it costs me a lot 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.960
 find them to tell them and 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.760

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.190
 If you look in the eyes of tears me 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.220

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.310
 world those who were close and those who 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.050
 they were always important pillars in 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.060
 is in this race today will lead to 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.220
 change the chip after being nerve 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.260
 know the call of the nerve from which 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.300
 the world cup begins the concentration how 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.220
 you feel where before you look and month and 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.670
 means not want to be focused not 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.610
 happy happy and now yes already with the cause 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.840
 Imposed to work harder than ever 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.640
 now the next goal to be part 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.070
 of the eleven that are inside the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.800
 court every game become a player 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.520
 important with this selection is going to be 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.039
 very difficult there is a big purchase 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.289
 but but well I know that if I put the 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.299
 batteries I can get so that's 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.039
 the next step that I have does not stop for 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.899
 to be there and keep looking for my 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.329
 my dreams besides playing in Europe 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.460
 but there is still the possibility of 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.649
 back is a good showcase to go back 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.860
 to lose that possibility to return to 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.330
 europe yes I know that it can be opened 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.760
 many doors after this world 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.590
 so it's time to take advantage and live 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.310
 maximum each of the moments what 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.379
 we're going through and it's also good I think 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.079
 that at age 26 he turned 26 in 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.230
 brazil so I'm at a very old age 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.090
 good for to look back to europe and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.680
 do things importance so that's the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.630
 next goal today is the help in 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.329
 the best moment of his career until 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.950
 now like that but but I think that also 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.049
 there are many things to learn and 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.190
 mature so is the aaiÃºn will continue 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.069
 rising level and well I know that my top 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.870
 It has not arrived yet, so I'm still in 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.970
 ascending plan and in my head is 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.400
 setting is to continue improving after 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.690
 these 23 games with Miguel as you see this 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.450
 face selection 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.430
 is to compete the 15th whoever 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.440
 especially because of the mentality that they have 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.080
 each of my colleagues or by the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.180
 mentality that we all have together 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.040
 that's what it does to us and it's going to 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.500
 return a very complicated opponent in 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.110
 worldwide and with the odds of 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.720
 beat that is what we believe in 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.160
 Miguel poses we believe in each one of 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.070
 us and we believe that together we can 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.190
 be a big surprise in this world 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.870
 so that's going to have to have a lot 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.580
 Mexico careful though after you 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.580
 I thank you much better thanks to you 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.770
 ah
