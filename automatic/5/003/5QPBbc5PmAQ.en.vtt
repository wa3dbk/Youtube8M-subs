00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
these guys but it doesn't really use a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.860 
these guys but it doesn't really use a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
most bold statement and dance music it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.940 
most bold statement and dance music it's
not<00:02:38.790> anything<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.270> labels<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:40.050> Ed<00:02:40.260> Banger

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
not anything that labels like Ed Banger

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.760 
not anything that labels like Ed Banger
or<00:02:41.190> DFA<00:02:42.150> records<00:02:42.570> haven't<00:02:42.930> brought<00:02:43.140> us<00:02:43.320> before

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
or DFA records haven't brought us before

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.260 
or DFA records haven't brought us before
and<00:02:44.070> they<00:02:44.280> could<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.550> done<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> lot<00:02:44.940> more<00:02:45.180> to

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
and they could have done a lot more to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.730 
and they could have done a lot more to
change<00:02:45.480> things<00:02:45.840> up<00:02:46.050> but<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.260> think<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.620> would

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
change things up but I think that would

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.710 
change things up but I think that would
have<00:02:46.830> taken<00:02:47.040> away<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.940> how<00:02:48.060> much<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.510> dance

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
have taken away to how much of a dance

record this really is here and there the
sounds<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.750> LP<00:02:51.959> do<00:02:52.440> get<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> little

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
sounds on this LP do get a little

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.070 
sounds on this LP do get a little
generic<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.030> very<00:02:54.209> nice<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.660> hear<00:02:54.780> dance

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
when it comes to this style I'm kind of

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.960 
when it comes to this style I'm kind of
feeling<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.470> strong<00:03:16.709> six<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> life<00:03:17.459> seven<00:03:17.760> on

this thing it's okay it's good as a
whole<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.450> I'm<00:03:21.720> most<00:03:21.959> likely<00:03:22.140> going<00:03:22.380> to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
whole but I'm most likely going to
