00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.690 
will adversely affect the sound now the
way<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.110> works<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.710> you<00:02:20.770> just<00:02:20.890> put<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.520> wire

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
way this works is you just put the wire

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.210 
way this works is you just put the wire
down<00:02:21.730> through<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.630> hole<00:02:23.050> on<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.010> then

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
down through the hole on the and then

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.030 
down through the hole on the and then
you<00:02:24.250> screw<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.000> connector<00:02:25.780> down<00:02:25.990> now<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.800> did

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
you screw the connector down now I did

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.950 
you screw the connector down now I did
find<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.880> really<00:02:28.150> do<00:02:28.300> have<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.660> Snug

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
find that you really do have to Snug

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.830 
find that you really do have to Snug
that<00:02:28.990> down<00:02:29.440> pretty<00:02:30.220> firmly<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:31.570> don't<00:02:31.720> want

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
that down pretty firmly you don't want

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.450 
that down pretty firmly you don't want
to<00:02:31.930> over<00:02:32.200> tighten<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.740> or<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.040> could<00:02:33.250> break

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
to over tighten it or you could break

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.640 
to over tighten it or you could break
the<00:02:33.640> wire<00:02:33.790> but<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:34.870> you're<00:02:35.050> not<00:02:35.230> firm<00:02:35.620> enough

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the wire but if you're not firm enough

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.920 
the wire but if you're not firm enough
you<00:02:36.160> won't<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> good<00:02:37.030> connection<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.780> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
you won't get a good connection and you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.170 
you won't get a good connection and you
may<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:38.380> even<00:02:38.590> get<00:02:38.860> audio<00:02:39.220> out<00:02:39.520> of<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.820> left

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
may not even get audio out of the left

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.420 
may not even get audio out of the left
speaker<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.680> course<00:02:41.920> there's<00:02:42.190> another

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
speaker and of course there's another

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.520 
speaker and of course there's another
port<00:02:42.880> on<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.420> speaker<00:02:43.870> as<00:02:44.050> well<00:02:46.170> power<00:02:47.170> is

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
port on the speaker as well power is

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.620 
port on the speaker as well power is
provided<00:02:47.800> this<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.550> not<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.820> battery-powered

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
provided this is not a battery-powered

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.260 
provided this is not a battery-powered
speaker<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.890> there's<00:02:51.100> no<00:02:51.370> battery<00:02:51.880> inside

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
speaker so there's no battery inside

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.720 
speaker so there's no battery inside
this<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.870> do<00:02:53.050> need<00:02:53.710> to<00:02:53.830> use<00:02:53.860> an<00:02:54.190> AC<00:02:54.370> adapter

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
this so you do need to use an AC adapter

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.560 
this so you do need to use an AC adapter
to<00:02:55.300> provide<00:02:55.660> power<00:02:55.960> now<00:02:56.770> this<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.190> 100<00:02:57.820> 240

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
to provide power now this is 100 240

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.290 
to provide power now this is 100 240
volts<00:02:59.190> 47<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.490> 63<00:03:01.210> Hertz<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:02.020> this<00:03:02.350> will<00:03:02.560> work

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
volts 47 to 63 Hertz so this will work

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.390 
volts 47 to 63 Hertz so this will work
internationally<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:05.140> also<00:03:05.410> has<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.830> 6

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
internationally and this also has a 6

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.220 
internationally and this also has a 6
foot<00:03:06.790> cord<00:03:07.000> length<00:03:07.960> on<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.080> is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
foot cord length on it so this is

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.070 
foot cord length on it so this is
perhaps<00:03:11.470> one<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.490> loudest<00:03:13.240> Bluetooth

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
perhaps one of the loudest Bluetooth

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.650 
perhaps one of the loudest Bluetooth
speakers<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.800> I've<00:03:14.920> heard<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.660> I'm

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
almost hate to say it but I do I do

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.290 
almost hate to say it but I do I do
notice<00:03:28.300> some<00:03:28.780> harshness<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.740> sound<00:03:30.300> bass

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
notice some harshness to the sound bass

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.040 
notice some harshness to the sound bass
is<00:03:31.540> decent<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.560> feel<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.430> bass<00:03:33.640> is

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
is decent I do feel that the bass is

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.080 
is decent I do feel that the bass is
appropriate<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:35.560> not<00:03:35.770> over<00:03:36.310> overly

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
appropriate and it's not over overly

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.260 
appropriate and it's not over overly
bassy<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.590> more<00:03:38.830> balanced<00:03:39.400> sound<00:03:39.640> but<00:03:40.240> I

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
bassy it's a more balanced sound but I

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.210 
bassy it's a more balanced sound but I
did<00:03:40.510> notice<00:03:40.780> sort<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.290> an<00:03:41.380> overall<00:03:41.680> harshness

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
did notice sort of an overall harshness

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.160 
did notice sort of an overall harshness
to<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.700> sound<00:03:42.970> it's<00:03:43.180> hard<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.480> put<00:03:43.630> my<00:03:43.780> finger

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
to the sound it's hard to put my finger

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.530 
to the sound it's hard to put my finger
on<00:03:44.200> but<00:03:45.100> all<00:03:45.490> I<00:03:45.520> can<00:03:45.670> say<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.210> that<00:03:46.390> after

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
on but all I can say is that after

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.650 
on but all I can say is that after
listening<00:03:47.080> for<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.320> few<00:03:47.590> hours<00:03:47.700> my<00:03:48.700> ears<00:03:49.000> just

seem to be slightly fatigued I'm going

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.910

basically turned both speakers up to

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.950 
basically turned both speakers up to
maximum<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.890> also<00:04:12.670> maxed<00:04:13.150> out<00:04:13.270> the<00:04:13.450> volume<00:04:13.690> on

cause<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.410> little<00:04:17.739> bit<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.070> distortion<00:04:18.790> here

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
cause a little bit of distortion here

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.599 
cause a little bit of distortion here
but<00:04:19.600> I<00:04:19.630> just<00:04:19.930> needed<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.410> do<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.859> to<00:04:21.190> provide

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
but I just needed to do that to provide

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.590 
but I just needed to do that to provide
the<00:04:21.790> maximum

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
the maximum

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.480 
the maximum
on<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.690> volume<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.260> each<00:04:23.410> speaker<00:04:23.860> is<00:04:23.920> capable

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
on a volume that each speaker is capable

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.820 
on a volume that each speaker is capable
of<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:24.970> obviously<00:04:25.870> if<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.110> backed<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
of and obviously if you backed the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.920 
of and obviously if you backed the
volume<00:04:27.430> down<00:04:27.610> slightly<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.480> would<00:04:28.600> get<00:04:28.780> rid

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
volume down slightly that would get rid

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.250 
volume down slightly that would get rid
of<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.170> Distortion<00:04:29.890> but<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.520> think<00:04:30.820> you'll<00:04:30.970> be

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
of that Distortion but I think you'll be

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.050 
of that Distortion but I think you'll be
interested<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.500> see<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.980> results<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:33.790> so

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
interested to see the results of this so

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:52.369 
interested to see the results of this so
first<00:04:34.300> let's<00:04:35.020> try<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.440> Bose<00:04:36.070> Soundlink

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:58.770 

you<00:04:53.379> got<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:54.300> accent<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:56.020> way<00:04:56.470> above<00:04:57.479> me<00:04:58.479> and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
you got to accent you way above me and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:17.839 
you got to accent you way above me and
now<00:04:59.680> here<00:05:00.069> is<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.370> grace<00:05:00.580> digital<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:16.900> got<00:05:17.289> to

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
now here is the grace digital you got to

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.559 
now here is the grace digital you got to
accent<00:05:18.849> you<00:05:19.539> way<00:05:20.020> above<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:21.610> finally<00:05:22.389> I<00:05:22.419> would

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
accent you way above and finally I would

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.420 
accent you way above and finally I would
like<00:05:22.659> to<00:05:22.810> play<00:05:23.080> that<00:05:23.259> song<00:05:23.530> one<00:05:23.860> more<00:05:23.889> time

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
like to play that song one more time

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.089 
like to play that song one more time
this<00:05:25.090> time<00:05:25.150> reducing<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.080> volume<00:05:26.319> on<00:05:26.590> both<00:05:26.860> my

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
this time reducing the volume on both my

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.129 
this time reducing the volume on both my
iPhone<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.879> the<00:05:28.060> speakers<00:05:28.539> so<00:05:28.810> that<00:05:28.840> there's

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
iPhone and the speakers so that there's

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.320 
iPhone and the speakers so that there's
no<00:05:29.319> distortion<00:05:30.009> just<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.729> give<00:05:30.879> you<00:05:31.000> a<00:05:31.030> better

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
no distortion just to give you a better

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.300 
no distortion just to give you a better
idea<00:05:31.449> of<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.110> quality<00:05:32.500> of<00:05:32.770> sound<00:05:33.069> that<00:05:33.250> you

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
idea of the quality of sound that you

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:50.119 
idea of the quality of sound that you
can<00:05:33.550> expect<00:05:33.969> from<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.330> grace<00:05:34.509> digital

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:56.309 

you<00:05:51.129> got<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:52.050> accent<00:05:53.050> you<00:05:53.740> with<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.639> baggage<00:05:55.319> I

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 
you got to accent you with the baggage I

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.670 
you got to accent you with the baggage I
do<00:05:57.280> find<00:05:57.729> that<00:05:58.030> if<00:05:58.389> you<00:05:58.599> do<00:05:58.780> try<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.080> overdrive

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
do find that if you do try to overdrive

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.980 
do find that if you do try to overdrive
these<00:05:59.979> speakers<00:06:00.460> they<00:06:00.729> they<00:06:01.330> do<00:06:01.389> show

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
these speakers they they do show

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.230 
these speakers they they do show
distortion<00:06:02.740> quite<00:06:03.039> easily<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.729> they<00:06:04.180> do

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
distortion quite easily and they do

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.300 
distortion quite easily and they do
develop<00:06:04.840> that<00:06:04.990> harshness<00:06:05.409> that<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.860> referred

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
develop that harshness that I referred

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.730 
develop that harshness that I referred
to<00:06:06.340> earlier<00:06:06.520> at<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.960> slightly<00:06:08.259> reduced

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
to earlier at the slightly reduced

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.350 
to earlier at the slightly reduced
volumes<00:06:09.190> though<00:06:09.400> they<00:06:09.610> have<00:06:09.789> a<00:06:09.819> very<00:06:10.090> nice

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
volumes though they have a very nice

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.670 
volumes though they have a very nice
warm<00:06:10.750> well-balanced<00:06:11.530> sound<00:06:13.470> the<00:06:14.470> grace

warm well-balanced sound the grace

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.550 
warm well-balanced sound the grace
digital<00:06:15.220> is<00:06:15.430> a<00:06:15.460> very<00:06:16.030> nice<00:06:16.360> bookshelf<00:06:17.020> speaker

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560

going to produce a really good sound

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.939 
going to produce a really good sound

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
level something that looks a little more

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.249 
level something that looks a little more
permanent<00:06:24.280> and<00:06:24.789> something<00:06:25.780> that<00:06:25.990> you're<00:06:26.110> not

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
permanent and something that you're not

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
going to be moving around a lot this

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.120 
going to be moving around a lot this
would<00:06:28.000> be<00:06:28.150> a<00:06:28.180> really<00:06:28.509> great<00:06:28.810> choice<00:06:29.110> I<00:06:29.470> do<00:06:29.830> like

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
would be a really great choice I do like

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.120 
would be a really great choice I do like
the<00:06:30.280> controls<00:06:30.729> on<00:06:31.000> the<00:06:31.030> top<00:06:31.289> you<00:06:32.289> do<00:06:32.470> have<00:06:32.740> more

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
the controls on the top you do have more

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.100 
the controls on the top you do have more
wires<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.789> deal<00:06:33.970> with<00:06:34.210> here<00:06:34.479> because<00:06:34.630> the<00:06:34.930> two

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
wires to deal with here because the two

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.320 
wires to deal with here because the two
speakers<00:06:35.440> do<00:06:35.860> need<00:06:36.069> to<00:06:36.220> be<00:06:36.370> connected<00:06:36.909> by<00:06:37.060> this

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
speakers do need to be connected by this

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.809 
speakers do need to be connected by this
wire<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:38.740> then<00:06:38.979> if<00:06:39.130> you're<00:06:39.280> using<00:06:39.310> an

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:39.819 
wire and then if you're using an

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.969 
wire and then if you're using an
auxilary<00:06:40.240> input<00:06:40.389> you<00:06:41.020> do<00:06:41.199> need<00:06:41.440> to<00:06:41.560> use<00:06:41.590> this

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
auxilary input you do need to use this

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.480 
auxilary input you do need to use this
cable<00:06:42.520> but<00:06:43.120> otherwise<00:06:43.479> I<00:06:44.020> like<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:45.099> fact<00:06:45.370> that

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
cable but otherwise I like the fact that

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.850 
cable but otherwise I like the fact that
you<00:06:45.669> can<00:06:45.879> charge<00:06:46.180> a<00:06:46.659> device<00:06:47.229> while<00:06:47.620> it's

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
you can charge a device while it's

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.430 
you can charge a device while it's
playing<00:06:48.280> through<00:06:48.639> the<00:06:48.759> speaker<00:06:49.180> and<00:06:49.380> it's<00:06:50.380> a

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
playing through the speaker and it's a

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.550 
playing through the speaker and it's a
very<00:06:50.710> attractive<00:06:50.830> and<00:06:51.699> a<00:06:51.780> very<00:06:52.780> nice<00:06:52.990> sounding
