00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.310 
from the UK who wanted to know if the
site<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.729> trustworthy<00:01:59.659> it<00:02:00.659> did<00:02:00.869> take<00:02:01.079> quite<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
site was trustworthy it did take quite a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020 
site was trustworthy it did take quite a
while<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> did<00:02:02.070> get<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.399> little<00:02:02.579> bit<00:02:02.790> worried

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
while so I did get a little bit worried

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
while so I did get a little bit worried
here<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.329> there<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.509> i<00:02:03.960> think<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> site

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
here and there but i think that the site

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
here and there but i think that the site
itself<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.460> overall<00:02:06.240> trustworthy

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
itself is like overall trustworthy

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.520 
itself is like overall trustworthy
already<00:02:07.320> views<00:02:07.619> himself<00:02:07.829> before<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.789> am

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
already views himself before I am

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.690 
already views himself before I am
purchased<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.580> know

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
purchased it and that and you know

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.430 
purchased it and that and you know
people<00:02:12.000> give<00:02:12.270> good<00:02:12.450> feedback

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
people give good feedback

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.580 
people give good feedback
but<00:02:13.860> uh<00:02:14.060> yeah<00:02:15.060> anyway<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.900> unboxing<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
but uh yeah anyway to the unboxing and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.770 
but uh yeah anyway to the unboxing and
this<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.160> battery<00:02:18.200> USB<00:02:19.200> cable<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.780> charge

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
this is the battery USB cable to charge

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.290 
this is the battery USB cable to charge
and<00:02:22.470> I'm<00:02:22.530> guessing<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.040> transfer<00:02:23.520> like<00:02:24.000> songs

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and I'm guessing to transfer like songs

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.590 
and I'm guessing to transfer like songs
music<00:02:24.870> videos<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.680> all<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.860> stuff<00:02:26.240> yeah<00:02:27.240> if

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600

you're from the UK you're going to need
to<00:02:29.820> buy<00:02:29.970> yourself<00:02:30.390> an<00:02:30.810> AC<00:02:31.050> adapter<00:02:31.230> because

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
to buy yourself an AC adapter because

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.070 
to buy yourself an AC adapter because
this<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.150> euro<00:02:33.950> AC<00:02:34.950> adapter<00:02:35.580> or<00:02:36.080> American

this is the euro AC adapter or American

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.620 
this is the euro AC adapter or American
I'm<00:02:37.200> not<00:02:37.380> too<00:02:37.530> sure<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.010> basically<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.540> know

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
I'm not too sure but basically you know

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.880 
I'm not too sure but basically you know
you're<00:02:39.780> not<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.080> be<00:02:40.170> able<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.470> charge<00:02:40.710> it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
you're not going to be able to charge it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.040 
you're not going to be able to charge it
with<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.190> wire<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.670> you're<00:02:42.660> from<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> UK

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
with the wire if you're from the UK

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.570 
with the wire if you're from the UK
because<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:44.130> isn't<00:02:44.490> what<00:02:45.120> fits<00:02:45.330> our<00:02:45.510> slots

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
because this isn't what fits our slots

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.980 
because this isn't what fits our slots
so<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.060> get<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.210> converter<00:02:48.540> or<00:02:48.840> an

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
so you can have to get a converter or an

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.240 
so you can have to get a converter or an
adapter<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:50.220> yeah<00:02:50.460> I'm<00:02:50.840> okay<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.130> my

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
adapter that yeah I'm okay so this is my

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.860 
adapter that yeah I'm okay so this is my
first<00:02:53.490> time<00:02:53.640> actually<00:02:53.850> seeing<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:55.680> person

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
first time actually seeing it in person

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.270 
first time actually seeing it in person
because<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.020> haven't<00:02:58.500> actually<00:02:58.680> touched<00:02:59.070> it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
because I haven't actually touched it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.800 
because I haven't actually touched it
before<00:02:59.760> this<00:03:00.060> video<00:03:01.130> but<00:03:02.130> here<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.430> go<00:03:02.810> last

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810

thing<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.050> can<00:03:04.200> say<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.680> feels<00:03:04.830> really

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
thing I can say is that it feels really

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.550 
thing I can say is that it feels really
light<00:03:08.390> yeah<00:03:09.390> it's<00:03:09.660> quite<00:03:09.810> difficult<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.410> do

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
light yeah it's quite difficult to do

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:20.930 
light yeah it's quite difficult to do
with<00:03:10.710> one<00:03:10.890> hand<00:03:11.100> oh<00:03:15.530> okay<00:03:16.530> one<00:03:16.740> second<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:18.000> this
