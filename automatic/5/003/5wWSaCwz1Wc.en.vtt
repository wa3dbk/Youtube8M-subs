00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.230
 Today, January 4, I am Kostroma 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.800
 area and decided today by catching on 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.720
 spinning in winter specific to this place 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.320
 that Kostroma is located near 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.950
 gres and some rivers in which goes 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.940
 warm water dumps do not freeze all winter 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.820
 and here you can catch on spinning 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.390
 almost all winter because water is not 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.860
 freezes 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.260
 well, when the air temperature is about 0 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.680
 degrees now just 0 that is 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.120
 rings not much the world is calling to catch 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.320
 more or less comfortable catching perch catching 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:49.960
 on a lead leash 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:57.050
