00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
 ah 

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello that such a good day today I'm going to 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.019
 share with you a tip to sew 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.879
 with these beautiful threads 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.879
 This itself are rayon 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.410
 look if you realize sometimes it costs you 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.220
 sewing work with them because when 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.490
 of growing up they become entangled a lot but 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.719
 share a very simple let's cut 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.239
 ours and those not too big already maybe that 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.370
 is two strands depending on you with 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.430
 How many strands does this one want to know what 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.180
 so thin or thick they want it to be their 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.750
 embroidery depends for the occasion not for 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.140
 the embroidery that you are going to 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.920
 use good me to occupy two strands 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.680
 here also how do I do now what am I going 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.390
 to do 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.390
 I have my pencil 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:09.370
 this any brand you do not this no 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:13.270
 The brand imports for very low quality 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.060
 that is very common I do not know does not matter 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.390
 the joke is that it's of these two 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.390
 bars 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 and we see what we are going to do is slide 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.670
 gently by the resist 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.759
 what are you going to do good for you to the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.710
 be new liza is not going to smear of 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.100
 this glue that is something like 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.540
 it remains like syrup then what it does 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.050
 is this one 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.860
 is start a little thread so that 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.730
 we are not entangled 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.010
 they do not need to mess it up a lot 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:58.620
 account as good as this kind of 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.560
 This is very useful at the time of the goal and 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.970
 to vote and that we have felt 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.300
 and do not worry about him leaving 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.880
 to stain their crafts because they 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.380
 dries very fast and when it's time to go 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.560
 sewing, the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.630
 heavy glue closed the goal it 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.580
