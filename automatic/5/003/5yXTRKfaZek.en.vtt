talk<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> topic<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.930> not

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
talk about a topic that is not

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.890 
talk about a topic that is not
controversial<00:00:08.280> but<00:00:08.700> just<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.090> weird<00:00:09.480> topic

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
controversial but just a weird topic

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.169 
controversial but just a weird topic
that<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.440> pretty<00:00:10.849> specific<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.880> particular

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
that is pretty specific to particular

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.169 
that is pretty specific to particular
kinds<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.259> bases<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.009> attacks<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.030> could

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
kinds of bases and attacks so this could

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.670 
kinds of bases and attacks so this could
apply<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> whether<00:00:15.900> you're<00:00:16.109> building<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> base

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
apply to whether you're building a base

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.950 
apply to whether you're building a base
or<00:00:16.920> attacking<00:00:17.730> base<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.630> these

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
or attacking base and that is these

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.290 
or attacking base and that is these
walls<00:00:19.380> over<00:00:19.619> here<00:00:19.949> Suze<00:00:20.340> there's<00:00:20.550> about<00:00:20.730> 10

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
walls over here Suze there's about 10

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.599 
walls over here Suze there's about 10
gazillion<00:00:21.510> walls<00:00:22.199> grouped<00:00:22.680> up<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.130> one<00:00:23.400> little

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
gazillion walls grouped up in one little

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.640 
gazillion walls grouped up in one little
little<00:00:24.269> group<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.019> looks<00:00:25.170> cool<00:00:25.380> looks

be the next Leonardo da Vinci or

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.429 
be the next Leonardo da Vinci or
whatever<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.080> some<00:00:31.199> kind<00:00:31.380> of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
whatever you know just some kind of

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.319 
whatever you know just some kind of
amazing<00:00:31.859> artist<00:00:32.160> that's<00:00:32.550> pretty<00:00:32.820> cool<00:00:32.940> looks

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
amazing artist that's pretty cool looks

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:33.799 
amazing artist that's pretty cool looks
nice<00:00:33.510> right

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
nice right

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.290 
nice right
but<00:00:34.320> how<00:00:34.590> useful<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.370> those<00:00:35.640> walls<00:00:35.940> over<00:00:36.180> here

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
but how useful are those walls over here

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
but how useful are those walls over here
so<00:00:36.450> he's<00:00:36.570> using<00:00:36.840> all<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.110> walls<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.950> most

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
so he's using all these walls but most

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.590 
so he's using all these walls but most
of<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.579> aren't<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.120> get<00:00:39.210> any<00:00:39.270> use

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
of them aren't going to get any use

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.180 
of them aren't going to get any use
because<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.559> were<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> play<00:00:40.980> some

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
because you see if we were to play some

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.970 
because you see if we were to play some
troops<00:00:41.430> down<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.200> destroy<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.620> attack

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
troops down here and destroy or attack

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.709 
troops down here and destroy or attack
these<00:00:44.190> walls<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:44.789> eventually<00:00:45.030> destroy<00:00:45.510> them

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
these walls then eventually destroy them

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.319 
these walls then eventually destroy them
obviously<00:00:46.489> all<00:00:47.489> these<00:00:47.789> walls<00:00:48.030> these

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
obviously all these walls these

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.840 
obviously all these walls these
outermost<00:00:48.809> walls<00:00:49.379> would<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.920> absolutely<00:00:50.520> no

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
outermost walls would get absolutely no

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.049 
outermost walls would get absolutely no
use<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.800> while<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:52.949> tagging<00:00:53.370> these<00:00:53.489> we

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
use because while we're tagging these we

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.910 
use because while we're tagging these we
could<00:00:54.210> take<00:00:54.390> them<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.690> before<00:00:54.870> anything<00:00:55.710> any

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
could take them out before anything any

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.860 
could take them out before anything any
of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> defensive<00:00:56.820> structures<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.600> any

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
of the defensive structures do any

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.930 
of the defensive structures do any
damage<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.469> us<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.430> something<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> think

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
damage to us so it's something to think

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.220 
damage to us so it's something to think
about<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.480> both<00:01:00.690> ends<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> spectrum

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
about on both ends of the spectrum

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
about on both ends of the spectrum
whether<00:01:01.680> you're<00:01:01.859> defending<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.309> tagging<00:01:02.640> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
whether you're defending or tagging so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.100 
whether you're defending or tagging so
we're<00:01:02.850> gonna<00:01:02.940> attack<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.629> side<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we're gonna attack from this side of the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.660 
we're gonna attack from this side of the
base<00:01:04.260> normally<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> would<00:01:05.129> actually<00:01:05.430> attack

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
base normally I would actually attack

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.920 
base normally I would actually attack
from<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> side<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> base<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
from this side the base just because it

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.539 
from this side the base just because it
just<00:01:07.560> looks<00:01:07.920> annoying

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
just looks annoying

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.859 
just looks annoying
to<00:01:08.850> attack<00:01:09.060> from<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.330> side<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.689> course

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to attack from this side and of course

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.320 
to attack from this side and of course
he<00:01:09.960> does<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.320> two<00:01:10.500> walls<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.189> which<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
he does have two walls here in which you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
he does have two walls here in which you
know<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.900> some<00:01:13.260> watchtowers

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
know they will have some watchtowers

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
know they will have some watchtowers
hitting<00:01:14.100> us<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.430> some<00:01:14.790> catapult<00:01:15.240> no<00:01:15.330> not<00:01:15.540> even

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
hitting us and some catapult no not even

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
hitting us and some catapult no not even
catapult<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.770> hitting<00:01:16.950> us<00:01:17.100> out<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.490> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
catapult will be hitting us out there so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.280 
catapult will be hitting us out there so
yeah<00:01:17.820> only<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> watchtowers<00:01:19.049> will<00:01:19.200> be

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
yeah only the watchtowers will be

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.289 
yeah only the watchtowers will be
hitting<00:01:19.530> us<00:01:19.710> once<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.130> take<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.909> first

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
hitting us once we take out this first

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.390 
hitting us once we take out this first
wall<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.140> come<00:01:22.380> over<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.979> we're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
wall and then come over here so we're

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.560 
wall and then come over here so we're
gonna<00:01:23.520> attack<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.150> show<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.330> exactly

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
gonna attack here and show you exactly

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.429 
gonna attack here and show you exactly
what<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:24.990> mean

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
what I mean

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
what I mean
so<00:01:26.040> something<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.520> about<00:01:26.700> while<00:01:27.030> you're

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
so something to think about while you're

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.700 
so something to think about while you're
building<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.540> base<00:01:27.720> or<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.229> you're<00:01:28.380> attacking

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
building a base or if you're attacking

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
building a base or if you're attacking
base<00:01:29.070> something<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.509> we're

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and one Watchtower for pretty much the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.280 
and one Watchtower for pretty much the
majority<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.790> time<00:01:50.850> while<00:01:51.750> my<00:01:51.960> troops

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
majority of that time while my troops

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.289 
majority of that time while my troops
were<00:01:52.500> destroying<00:01:53.009> all<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.579> those<00:01:53.729> walls<00:01:54.030> so

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.749 
were destroying all of those walls so
it's<00:01:54.600> pretty<00:01:54.780> much<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.470> downfall<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.549> base

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.300
