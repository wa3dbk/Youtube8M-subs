00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.240 

and<00:02:11.959> we're<00:02:12.140> cruising<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.739> little<00:02:12.950> bit<00:02:13.040> through

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and we're cruising a little bit through

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.570 
and we're cruising a little bit through
these<00:02:13.400> these<00:02:14.120> levels<00:02:14.599> now<00:02:17.890> actually<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> reason

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580

why<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:19.970> not<00:02:20.180> stopped<00:02:20.599> just<00:02:21.049> because<00:02:21.379> I

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
why I have not stopped just because I

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.080 
why I have not stopped just because I
don't<00:02:21.620> want<00:02:22.129> to<00:02:22.190> pick<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.489> game<00:02:22.700> back<00:02:22.910> up
