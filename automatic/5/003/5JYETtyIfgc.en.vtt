00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:06.049
 grill now we feel out andrés contreras still champion 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:06.850
 reigning 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.629
 memory that he also presented 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.629
 17 cars 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.050
 but from the team by 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.050
 and that is already a reality 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 obregon in the first first set I assume 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.560
 the third place that has made very good racing a very combative driver what 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.050
 same as roberto fernández 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.270
 hector rached that comes from the vicky formula that debuts just in this 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.850
 hugo díaz boot type grand prize this is 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.950
 standing there on the grill and immediately javier lamadrid not what 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.130
 is doing very good starts nc 1997 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.230
 I have surpassed Bernardo obregón who takes the photo 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.570
 and javier is 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.270
 recover their position however there they were at an Olympus 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.830
 also for 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.060
 to pass the incentive 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.350
 The mother's head is trying to get inside and this is what 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.960
 I also took advantage 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.100
 to get closer 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.570
 bobby fernández on the expectation if he stayed and in the back the same 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.049
 that hector rached that you 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.420
 a good start however to the first curve after the start 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.630
 he returned the favor right there 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.140
 octavio giorgi had some problem that prevented him from staying within the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.360
 first five because he had already advanced a position however 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.320
 well here the things dominated by the team colon in the tip the number 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.270
 26 of bernardo obregón in front but very close as has been practically 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.980
 the whole campaign there javier the matrix without detaching 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.860
 octavio piles of crazy sale know the clue since it is the owner 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.980
 what to stay there among the first places javier the network was looking for some 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:06.560
 way 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.930
 get close enough to your teammate 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.399
 to try to snatch the first position 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.959
 nevertheless it seemed that bernardo peña everything controlled 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.129
 while there was something 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.390
 all the competition raúl olimpo 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.660
 Javier lamadrid approached but he did it so much that they had an altercation 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.660
 on the track and had to pay a visit to the 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:29.829
 problem and with 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.599
 javier lamadrid and he played it and then what 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.699
 wolf made it a little out recessed to plant itself 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.919
 practically slicing one of the tires 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.899
 with an evening of the series of apartheid passes 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:44.259
 francella and well then there was again 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.149
 the pilot javier lamadrid in contention with bernardo obregón by being the 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:51.149
 first place of the competition we already saw 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.510
 and me that was on the side of the road and see 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.070
 the problems that madrid was beginning to fear to keep her 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.070
 automobile the distance little by little it was going to be 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.869
 because to know what is in a full fight for the championship 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.379
 Hector Marmolejo left the sharia track momentarily but he 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.119
 reintegrated when another who had been doing a very good career was 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:20.509
 ramón de zulueta with car number 139 that gradually was getting into 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.599
 in the positions and get to be behind the fight for the first and 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.099
 second 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.739
 not an Olympus had returned to battle was stunned to recover 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.639
 places 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.139
 with the desire to leave 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.139
 fast to the straight 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.979
 and that's why we've seen them in most of the qom 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.839
 get to the outside of the track to the ground 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.679
 We were already rolling in the final part of the competition, definitely Bernardo 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.989
 Obregon had controlled the ties 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.169
 his teammate 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.169
 only pilots who are fighting the championship 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.650
 that will have to radically change its regulation to be able to grow in 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:05.540
 competitors but whatever the important thing at the moment 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.050
 is precisely the battle between these two who are looking for 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.419
 97 in this category in category there was she 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:20.379
 ahead p javier lama tightening with all the madrid in the final part 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:24.430
 we will see the arrival towards the goal area of ​​the xerez that was close and the 

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:26.370
 matrix tried to get into 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.770
 on the road of bernardo obregón, however, there are those who make the difference 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.259
 they were 360 ​​and 11 100 thousandths of a second 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.620
 between the first and the second 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.130
 his place the race takes to bernardo obregón with which prolongs 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.059
 until the last date in guadalajara so we charge lamadrid ramón de 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:47.779
 his note was placed the third roberto fernandez reached the fourth and hector 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.039
 ochoa was in fifth we go to a break and return for the payment
