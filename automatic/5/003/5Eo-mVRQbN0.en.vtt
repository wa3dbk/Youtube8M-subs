00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hi, I'm here today to show you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.790
 You bought some things I did not 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.200
 daisson would not be and in the river it is a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.040
 department store here in my 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.089
 City 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.740
 so let's get a good first go 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.449
 start changing it and I'll show you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.119
 I do not know what I bought a bottle. 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.960
 because it's summer here and I think it's super 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.840
 interesting because you put the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 net here freezes after you put 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 here and type your juice with your water 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.280
 it will take longer to get hot 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.500
 so hurry up the bottle and the colors 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.980
 they are workshops 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.379
 I loved it but I bought this one that 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 tiarinha I do not know what you call them 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.920
 But I call it a tiara or marquinhos. 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 and it is normal normal but does not make up 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.359
 the little flowers because now this summer is going 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.250
 have summer matsuri and I 'll decorate 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.890
 with flowers to use along with 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.549
 my hobby is what summer is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.890
 So these two here I'm going to make a 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 I work alone when I try to make decorating 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.340
 huh 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.990
 to see if it looks cute that I 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.530
 I bought it from here, it 's home it's a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.340
 curtain to put outside 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.100
 like that at the door of my kitchen 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.659
 because the sun hits my kitchen late 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 and it 's very hot this curtain 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.220
 that helps refresh and then I wanted to 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.810
 do a very cute job and a 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.450
 because I like to draw and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.659
 Paint and then I bought a picture frame 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:47.640
 this one there is four size a4 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:52.649
 I bought two of these are the same and I 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.270
 I bought this one, it 's different and with that. 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.250
 that I bought in the story or pass 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.860
 that the other store that the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.869
 kosovo is like a dollar store 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.640
 I know the flag to put in the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.979
 my bedside table that I put 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.450
 football and remedy some little things 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.149
 on here 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.080
 and the tic-tac hair clip when I 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.470
 I'm going to sleep 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.790
 So I found her super cute, my bank. 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.200
 very nice so I'll put it on my 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.000
 bedside table 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.629
 Actually, she's a plant plate. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.489
 but I found it so cute that I decided 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.410
 put in my head table do 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.780
 I would it would be that I love I always stay 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.209
 dating are the pull handles 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.730
 very cute so I took three 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.239
 the first is this here a format of 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.239
 Diamond 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.140
 then I got this one that I did not 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.590
 I know what format it has but it's super 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.860
 I thought it was cute and I got it. 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.690
 a normal white that was also a 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.470
 I'm going to use a little project that 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.390
 I'll do 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.489
 and then it works out I'll show you 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.540
 I wanted another picture frame type to 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.760
 make the comic 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.489
 in another measure and then I bought it 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.450
 that would be because there in a lonely place 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.459
 is downloading 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.360
 I bought two of these this is from 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.600
 Plastic lava would also I found 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.790
 this little pot that is super cute and 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.160
 have a cute lid that's to do 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.989
 That little jar of juice and water I 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 I'm going to stick here and I'll make mine. 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.310
 cute little cupcake with this cute cup 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.049
 So, in the river, that's what I'm going to do now. 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.609
 show you two bags that I 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.280
 I bought at the mall. 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:35.450
 the first one was this one is a bag 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.260
 simple who is this place here to 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.810
 to charge 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.480
 you can take along or three 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.900
 passed and she still turns a backpack 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.870
 so she has three ways to use her 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.849
 opens well and in has a good climb up well 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.010
 great 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.680
 I really like this brown beige color 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.810
 roma without caramel are the preferred colors 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.599
 I do not like much of a black bag like this. 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.099
 I really like these 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.169
 wake up 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.609
 I think it's super legal. 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:13.060
 either with a sneaker or with a sneaker 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.060
 to the newspaper and 190 they less than 20 reais 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.700
 The other one I bought at this store is called 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.760
 collect collet that I call collet in 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.580
 instead vest and she is very cute 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:32.720

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:36.710
 discount will be one I had a purse 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.950
 white but she was very gray and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.570
 I threw it out so I wanted one. 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.970
 White bag, it's been a long time but never 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.220
 I found one the way I wanted to have it. 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.010
 This angel's face here is a zipper here. 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.350
 opens so and still comes with a handle 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.000
 extra that's really cool, right for you. 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:59.300
 stay when you tire if you can 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.700
 hang the purse in this detail here I 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.960
 I loved this bag, it 's true too. 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.250
 by her color and that decade of 14 thousand 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.610
 yen for 2,000 yen ie it was 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:18.710
