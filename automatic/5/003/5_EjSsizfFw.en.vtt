 blood pressure, there is then a low cold 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.510
 go now when we see on it 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
 heart movie that you are currently a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.099
 myocardial infarction to undergo're the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.280
 The facts turn it around at every second 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.280
 token 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.859
 within the regional chain of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.199
 emergency services is the ambulance service of 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.830
 South Holland South region of absolute 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.830
 vital 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.670
 she said, and often the first to do so 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.370
 site are an event to quickly and 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.260
 professional that crucial first aid 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 to be able to offer 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.670
 that this is the upper leg 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.880
 we are a bit in the cradle 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.710
 laid to do this really all that 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.580
 I also think being passionate is because 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.540
 real one 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.540
 to want and to be allowed 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.150
 in the two arm central what is exactly 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.729
 the address of the emergency building all 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.159
 emergency calls 4112 are added here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.520
 the emergency room for ambulance care 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.710
 happened once the location of it 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.399
 incident is known , the ambulance 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.399
 drive immediately 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.820
 all further information regarding 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.770
 until the patient and the accident is live too 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.659
 follow in the car 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.070
 we now work with direct deployment of an ambulance 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.810
 that means if the address and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.759
 telephone number of the report are known 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.039
 the ambulance sent immediately on the road 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.110
 and the ambulance then gets like them 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.939
 colliding with our extra information 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.039
 then they are about two minutes euros 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.719
 on then for in 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.719
 lady hit by a car 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.049
 met a market town 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.899
 this new way of working provides a 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.609
 time savings of a few minutes 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.049
 there appears to be little but can in the 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.049
 practice are of vital importance 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.629
 but it can be yes that can really be one 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.039
 make a difference putin and consequence and the 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.250
 CPR are those two minutes sometimes 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.530
 just very crucial factor outside the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.269
 that it counts after every second 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.269

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.459
 calamities 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.980
 so birth and death and everything 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.450
 is in between and that can just be one 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.959
 kind word there is a pat on it 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.910
 the globe 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.129
