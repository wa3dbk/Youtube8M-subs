00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.500
 on the day 36 mass commander at the start 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.650
 And today it is simply about it 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.450
 once again polished training sessions 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 to enter that is we have here briefly 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.869
 Of course, amplitudes wanted again 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.310
 I just want to demonstrate 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.669
 that is not always a progressive one 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.220
 Boosting means we necessarily have more 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.129
 weight must stabilize 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.120
 would like to choose relatively moderate well 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.100
 but I show which ones 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.540
 decades to simply higher wages 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.309
 be guided and against relative 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.170
 high weight and I will despite 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.890
 demonstrate the so-called pressure 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.320
 sat as pressure setting means I 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.720
 Start with a relatively high weight 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.979
 I work moderately for pyramids 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 so-called repetitive area that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.640
 I then about power peak about 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.380
 creates two to three repetitions and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.229
 work together again under that means 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.900
 I start with heavy weights on 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.450
 the performance tip is still a bit high 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.149
 middleweight and then build the again 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.350
 intensity by getting more moderate again 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.439
 move and demonstrate weight 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.439
 his 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:46.570
 with me that is now higher 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.570
 taken 30 bit higher 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.840
 important here keep the sentence short 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.430
 watson Named pressure set course 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.420
 at the same time the operating breaks 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.390
 we do not want to reach if we 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.390
 Wanted to go poor 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.020
 directly continue to roast weight with something 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.800
 if these important at the same time 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.800
 Repeat range slightly higher 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.610
 that was demonstrative 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.830
 Chassis with three different 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.080
 There were some possibilities around 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.710
 initiate various standing charming 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.710
 mistake before
