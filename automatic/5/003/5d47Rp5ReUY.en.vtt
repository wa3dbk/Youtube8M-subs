00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
piece right here is different it's

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.309

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
basically the same as the old one only

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.020 
basically the same as the old one only
it's<00:02:34.590> got<00:02:34.769> some<00:02:34.980> most<00:02:35.160> scratches<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.970> Nick's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I think that'll look a lot better with

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.150

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
five thousand yen however I think after

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.420 
five thousand yen however I think after
this<00:04:54.990> first<00:04:55.229> run<00:04:55.529> band<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:55.979> was<00:04:56.069> gonna<00:04:56.159> up<00:04:56.400> the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
this first run band I was gonna up the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.990 
this first run band I was gonna up the
price<00:04:56.759> to<00:04:56.789> around<00:04:57.300> six<00:04:57.689> thousand<00:04:58.199> yen<00:04:58.349> so<00:04:59.000> at

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
price to around six thousand yen so at

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.909 
price to around six thousand yen so at
that<00:05:00.210> point<00:05:00.509> it's<00:05:00.779> gonna<00:05:00.990> be<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.710> ignition

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
that point it's gonna be the ignition

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.709 
that point it's gonna be the ignition
boat<00:05:02.310> it's<00:05:02.430> gonna<00:05:02.610> be<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:02.759> good<00:05:02.969> 20<00:05:03.389> dollars

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
boat it's gonna be a good 20 dollars

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.230 
boat it's gonna be a good 20 dollars
more<00:05:04.080> than<00:05:04.439> the<00:05:04.650> standard<00:05:05.129> master<00:05:05.669> grade<00:05:05.849> Exia

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
more than the standard master grade Exia

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.450 
more than the standard master grade Exia
so<00:05:06.740> really<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.979> would<00:05:08.039> just<00:05:08.219> be<00:05:08.340> your

the old kit I think there's one thing oh
yeah<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:44.909> only<00:05:45.060> thing<00:05:45.479> that<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.930> no<00:05:46.319> grade

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
yeah the only thing that the no grade

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.200 
yeah the only thing that the no grade
does<00:05:46.800> better<00:05:47.039> is<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.580> back<00:05:47.789> and<00:05:47.819> forth

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
does better is the back and forth

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.529 
does better is the back and forth
movement<00:05:48.509> on<00:05:48.949> the<00:05:49.949> chest<00:05:50.819> right<00:05:51.060> here<00:05:51.089> other

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
movement on the chest right here other

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:52.309
