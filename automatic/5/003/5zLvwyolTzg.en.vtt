00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello to everyone here 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.510
 car but we will not work it 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.490
 many friend would like to talk it 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.280
 car exactly one year ago do 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.760
 I even do a little more cover 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.949
 trunk with potter then my channel 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.570
 I do not follow the link to the video 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.140
 gave under the description of this video well or 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.179
 who reluctant to lose the extra half an hour 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.179
 life a little in pictures now show 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.160
 there is such an opinion among the master 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.320
 that as if the floor drank a spotter machine 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.930
 waiting for the metal 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.450
 pulling tits in general, nothing good 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.390
 then it's all cut down at all 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.110
 does not stay and how would they prefer 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.299
 these masters use a semi-automatic 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.759
 by the way on the side of heaven there is no request itself 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.560
 don't offend the whole country frame call them 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.080
 people who are categorically there for 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.470
 own beliefs and other 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.659
 reasons do not want to enjoy the benefits 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.880
 so say scientific progress and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.020
 continues to use semi automatic 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.640
 when straightening front panels 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.280
 arguing that between spotter fell from 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.690
 there is no difference at all though 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.899
 the last spotter never 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.630
 enjoyed but I like the amount with my 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.429
 bell tower because for a long time myself 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.259
 semiautomatic rule he to mind and walked away from 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.720
 him so i kind of 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.670
 compare so but this I digress 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.189
 little can now be on the bus 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.950
 just before the man is bigger 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.549
 than a year after repair after that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.140
 ride the gas you can open the lid 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.590
 trunk see something inside 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.570
 this video as it did not show on the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.799
 after a year something changed there 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.600
 by the way over thought that the molars were not there 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.060
 it will be nothing to close up so they do not 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.070
 not patched paint filled not we drove them 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.390
 now i will open the cover to the same under 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:33.090
 made out we look so here these 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.579
 thick points it is from warming up from 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.090
 heating electrode 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:41.310
 these little dots bubbles it either from 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.880
 nails I donâ€™t remember either from the reverse 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.709
 malt cask reset back to tray on faith 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.709
 so butt cover 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:05.270
 barely visible wheel is 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:12.560
 untreated for a year travel home 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:17.120
 you can see what the car went not warm 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.180
 regions the region where most of the winter and 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.730
 dumb weather mean by car 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.330
 drove from the car wash literally that kilometer 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.760
 without a car became 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.700
 the roads sprinkle well have history 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.960
 reagents all so well even this one 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.270
 the client seemed to complain that the humidity 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.550
 big trunk for him she's on 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.790
 Civic forum deducting what they have 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:51.850
 the problem of good exists through the lattice 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:58.270
 air exchangers moisture gets so 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.270
 here is a pocket of some water 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:13.190
 living country the same story yes where there 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.959
 These bubbles come too sheepskin 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:22.040
 accumulates once more now I'll show you 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.250
 here they are these bubbles from the reverse 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.250
 hammer 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.420
 but I think everyone will decide what to do or 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.970
 take a reverse hammer from the shelf and 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.410
 despise semiautomatic well or buy with 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.910
 potters make their lives easier 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.750
 make work better 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.750
 good luck everyone all bye
