another braid out attempt the last time
I<00:00:09.000> did<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> braid<00:00:09.570> out<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.990> did<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.349> on<00:00:10.620> here<00:00:11.460> that

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I did a braid out I did it on here that

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.440 
I did a braid out I did it on here that
was<00:00:11.790> flat<00:00:12.179> ironed<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.030> like<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> old

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
was flat ironed for it was like a old

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.220 
was flat ironed for it was like a old
flat<00:00:15.809> iron<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:17.190> was<00:00:17.310> okay<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:18.080> you<00:00:19.080> could

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
flat iron and it was okay but you could

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.050 
flat iron and it was okay but you could
still<00:00:19.410> see<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.650> difference<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> textures

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
still see the difference in the textures

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.290 
still see the difference in the textures
so<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.900> time<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> tried<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.830> do<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.310> here

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
so this time I tried to do it on here

so this time I tried to do it on here
that<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.689> not<00:00:24.750> pail<00:00:25.680> turd<00:00:26.119> by<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.180> blow-dryer

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
that was not pail turd by the blow-dryer

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.140 
that was not pail turd by the blow-dryer

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
pulled the hair a little bit applied

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.840 
pulled the hair a little bit applied
some<00:00:33.210> pressure<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.110> elongate<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> curls<00:00:35.550> and

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
to figure out that would be ideally the

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.410 
to figure out that would be ideally the
best<00:01:51.229> way<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.409> do<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.829> no<00:01:52.130> heat<00:01:52.340> at<00:01:52.490> all<00:01:52.610> but

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
best way to do it no heat at all but

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.999
