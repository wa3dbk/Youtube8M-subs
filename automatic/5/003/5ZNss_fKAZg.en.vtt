00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:12.799 

I<00:00:08.809> came<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:10.469> auburn<00:00:10.769> university<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.480> 1995<00:00:12.480> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
I came to auburn university in 1995 and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.409 
I came to auburn university in 1995 and
we<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.259> been<00:00:13.440> doing<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.860> genetic<00:00:14.309> research<00:00:14.700> so

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419 
we have been doing a genetic research so

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.270 
we have been doing a genetic research so
in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> practical<00:00:16.200> sense<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.800> are<00:00:16.830> trying<00:00:17.100> to

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
in the practical sense we are trying to

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.120 
in the practical sense we are trying to
come<00:00:17.490> up<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.910> better<00:00:18.180> catfish<00:00:18.840> such<00:00:19.830> that

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
come up with a better catfish such that

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.260 
come up with a better catfish such that
our<00:00:20.400> farmers<00:00:21.030> can<00:00:21.300> use<00:00:21.620> but<00:00:22.620> you<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.000> we

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
our farmers can use but you to do so we

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.790 
our farmers can use but you to do so we
need<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.630> understand<00:00:25.110> the<00:00:25.200> genetics<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
need to understand the genetics of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.010 
need to understand the genetics of
catfish<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.910> we're<00:00:27.090> trying<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.480> understand

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
catfish so we're trying to understand

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.020 
catfish so we're trying to understand
the<00:00:28.080> entire<00:00:28.590> genetic<00:00:28.940> composition<00:00:29.940> of

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
the entire genetic composition of

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.540 
the entire genetic composition of
catfish<00:00:30.540> we<00:00:30.750> call<00:00:31.020> genome<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
catfish we call genome so we have a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.029 
catfish we call genome so we have a
product<00:00:33.030> or<00:00:33.329> large<00:00:33.749> program<00:00:34.440> called<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.039 
product or large program called the

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.000 
product or large program called the
catfish<00:00:35.519> genome<00:00:36.149> program<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.960> performance<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
catfish genome program a performance of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.360 
catfish genome program a performance of
a<00:00:38.129> fish<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.969> determined<00:00:39.960> by<00:00:40.140> its<00:00:40.170> genes<00:00:41.070> of

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
a fish is determined by its genes of

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.840 
a fish is determined by its genes of
genetics<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.230> order<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.589> get<00:00:43.949> a<00:00:43.980> faster

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

growing fish or fish visit diseases
resistance<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.839> to<00:00:48.960> understand<00:00:49.499> how

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.289 

I<00:01:45.549> grew<00:01:46.390> up<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.810> very<00:01:47.110> under<00:01:47.920> developed<00:01:48.640> area

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
I grew up in a very under developed area

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.859 
I grew up in a very under developed area
in<00:01:49.900> China<00:01:50.290> back<00:01:51.220> then<00:01:51.549> I<00:01:51.909> was<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.390> young<00:01:52.840> child

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
in China back then I was a young child

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
in China back then I was a young child
area<00:01:53.830> was<00:01:54.010> very<00:01:54.310> very<00:01:54.580> poor<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.720> lot<00:01:56.080> of

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
area was very very poor so a lot of

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.460 
area was very very poor so a lot of
people<00:01:57.369> were<00:01:57.729> really<00:01:57.940> food<00:01:58.930> was<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.170> big

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
people were really food was a big

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.950 
people were really food was a big
problem<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.159> ever<00:02:00.970> since<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.450> was<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.690> young

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
problem so ever since I was a young

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.399 
problem so ever since I was a young
child<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.830> hope<00:02:03.310> somebody<00:02:03.840> through<00:02:04.840> genetics

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
child I hope somebody through genetics

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.010 
child I hope somebody through genetics
or<00:02:05.590> other<00:02:06.090> agricultural<00:02:07.090> sciences<00:02:07.600> we<00:02:07.810> can

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
or other agricultural sciences we can

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.880 
or other agricultural sciences we can
improve<00:02:08.610> cops<00:02:10.140> agricultural<00:02:11.140> animals<00:02:11.560> such

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
improve cops agricultural animals such

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.010 
improve cops agricultural animals such
that<00:02:12.100> everybody<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.390> world<00:02:13.600> would<00:02:13.840> have

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
that everybody in the world would have

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.680 
that everybody in the world would have
enough<00:02:14.319> food<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:15.459> course<00:02:15.730> when<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:15.970> come<00:02:16.239> here<00:02:16.630> I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
enough food of course when I come here I

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.080 
enough food of course when I come here I
think<00:02:17.470> science<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.130> know<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.370> working<00:02:18.670> here

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
think science you know and working here

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.390 
think science you know and working here
but<00:02:19.630> science<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.410> agricultural<00:02:21.070> research
