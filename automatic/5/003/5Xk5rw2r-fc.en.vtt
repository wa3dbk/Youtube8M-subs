distant open regard circle just you know
the<00:02:31.270> kind<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.600> something<00:02:32.610> becomes<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.760> tank<00:02:34.270> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the kind of something becomes a tank and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.470 
the kind of something becomes a tank and
ten<00:02:36.190> booster<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.790> I'll<00:02:37.120> be<00:02:37.330> easy<00:02:37.740> then<00:02:38.740> to

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
ten booster and I'll be easy then to

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.540 
ten booster and I'll be easy then to
work<00:02:40.480> all<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:41.770> deck<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.220> saw<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> trench<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.940> lion

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
work all this deck I saw a trench a lion

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.420 
work all this deck I saw a trench a lion
so<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.810> becomes<00:02:47.170> 9<00:02:47.380> 9<00:02:48.300> 9<00:02:49.300> thousand<00:02:49.840> goes<00:02:49.990> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
so this becomes 9 9 9 thousand goes to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.350 
so this becomes 9 9 9 thousand goes to
when<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.460> don't<00:02:51.700> get<00:02:51.820> into<00:02:52.030> sculpey<00:02:54.150> other<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
when I don't get into sculpey other and
