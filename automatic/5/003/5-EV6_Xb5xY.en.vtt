00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
can tell the difference because it's

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.180 
can tell the difference because it's
definitely<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.420> lot<00:03:18.780> better<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.950> think

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
definitely a lot better and I think

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.860 
definitely a lot better and I think
that's<00:03:20.370> actually<00:03:20.700> pretty<00:03:20.850> obvious<00:03:21.269> but

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
that's actually pretty obvious but

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.569 
that's actually pretty obvious but
that's<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> front<00:03:22.440> facing<00:03:22.739> camera<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.220> back

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
that's the front facing camera the back

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.490 
that's the front facing camera the back
facing<00:03:23.910> camera<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.299> still<00:03:24.570> 8<00:03:24.810> megapixels

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
facing camera is still 8 megapixels

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.039 
facing camera is still 8 megapixels
however<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.400> shoots<00:03:26.640> more<00:03:26.910> vibrant<00:03:27.450> photos<00:03:27.870> on

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
however it shoots more vibrant photos on

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.229 
however it shoots more vibrant photos on
the<00:03:28.140> iPhone<00:03:28.470> 4s<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.400> also<00:03:29.549> take<00:03:29.850> much

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
the iPhone 4s and it can also take much

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.509
