00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
yeah that's a little bit of a tricky

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.050 
yeah that's a little bit of a tricky
part<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.930> ID<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.640> thought<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.970> it

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
part of this ID but I just thought of it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.190 
part of this ID but I just thought of it
I<00:02:48.239> don't<00:02:48.510> think<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:48.840> going<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.110> be

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
I don't think it's going to be

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.270 
I don't think it's going to be
implemented<00:02:49.950> or<00:02:50.040> anything<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.880> evidence

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
implemented or anything and evidence

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.009 
implemented or anything and evidence

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
jump jump off for instance that's a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.220 
jump jump off for instance that's a
problem<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.160> see<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.660> doesn't<00:03:06.660> really<00:03:06.930> have

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
problem I see here doesn't really have

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.890 
problem I see here doesn't really have
pants<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:08.269> again<00:03:09.410> couldn't<00:03:10.410> have<00:03:10.590> any<00:03:11.900> well

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
pants so again couldn't have any well

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.880 
pants so again couldn't have any well
whoops<00:03:13.380> let's<00:03:14.070> just<00:03:14.190> say<00:03:14.370> all<00:03:14.670> for<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.890> it

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
whoops let's just say all for now and it

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.620 
whoops let's just say all for now and it
doesn't<00:03:17.070> really<00:03:17.280> have<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.489> body<00:03:17.850> either<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.480> it

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
doesn't really have a body either so it

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.520 
doesn't really have a body either so it
would<00:03:18.780> be<00:03:18.900> really<00:03:19.230> bad<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:19.709> holding<00:03:20.489> items

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
would be really bad for holding items

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.750 
would be really bad for holding items
where<00:03:22.910> holy<00:03:23.910> well<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.690> i<00:03:25.140> want<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.560> say<00:03:25.739> pull<00:03:26.730> a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
where holy well I i want to say pull a

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.699 
where holy well I i want to say pull a
whirl<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.269> pull<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> wrap<00:03:27.750> but<00:03:28.260> they<00:03:28.380> didn't

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
whirl and pull a wrap but they didn't

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.430

really have a body today because their

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.509 
really have a body today because their
body<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.280> head<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.590> balances<00:03:34.829> itself

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
body is the head so it balances itself

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.610 
body is the head so it balances itself

out on a couple pokemon but a cup of

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.740 
out on a couple pokemon but a cup of
booking<00:03:37.920> will<00:03:38.040> be<00:03:38.160> real<00:03:38.850> really<00:03:39.209> overpowered

have hands oh so yeah um career I think

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.170 
have hands oh so yeah um career I think
it's<00:05:08.819> cold<00:05:09.060> Sniffy's<00:05:09.900> final<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.710> illusion

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
it's cold Sniffy's final of illusion

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.240 
it's cold Sniffy's final of illusion
only<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.210> hat<00:05:12.389> so<00:05:12.659> does<00:05:13.409> but<00:05:13.650> would<00:05:13.860> get<00:05:14.099> really

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
only a hat so does but would get really

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.990 
only a hat so does but would get really
i'm<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.580> powered<00:05:15.110> but<00:05:16.110> maybe<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:17.400> items<00:05:17.879> would

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
i'm a powered but maybe the items would

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.390 
i'm a powered but maybe the items would
be<00:05:18.120> stronger<00:05:18.719> because<00:05:18.900> i<00:05:19.169> have<00:05:19.379> less<00:05:19.710> lots<00:05:20.159> or

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
be stronger because i have less lots or

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.430 
be stronger because i have less lots or
something<00:05:20.729> I<00:05:20.849> don't<00:05:20.909> know<00:05:21.120> something<00:05:21.509> like

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
something I don't know something like

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.209 
something I don't know something like
that<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:23.279> yeah<00:05:23.909> I<00:05:24.590> don't<00:05:25.590> think<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.889> comes<00:05:26.099> to

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
that so yeah I don't think it comes to

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.519 
that so yeah I don't think it comes to
be<00:05:26.310> implemented<00:05:26.759> ever<00:05:27.120> but<00:05:27.779> it's<00:05:27.930> just<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.289> di

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
be implemented ever but it's just I di

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.700 
be implemented ever but it's just I di
wants<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.009> get<00:05:29.190> out<00:05:29.370> there<00:05:29.870> so<00:05:30.870> yeah<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.139> have

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
wants to get out there so yeah I have

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.740 
wants to get out there so yeah I have
been<00:05:31.979> saved<00:05:32.279> or<00:05:32.490> couple<00:05:32.819> videos<00:05:33.120> then<00:05:33.300> maybe

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
been saved or couple videos then maybe

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.360 
been saved or couple videos then maybe
most<00:05:34.259> of<00:05:34.349> you<00:05:34.440> guys<00:05:34.500> didn't<00:05:34.919> need<00:05:35.009> to<00:05:35.099> see<00:05:35.250> the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
most of you guys didn't need to see the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.510 
most of you guys didn't need to see the
other<00:05:35.490> two<00:05:35.729> videos<00:05:35.909> I<00:05:36.380> had<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.409> good<00:05:37.620> idea<00:05:37.949> for<00:05:38.130> X

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
other two videos I had a good idea for X

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.120 
other two videos I had a good idea for X
on<00:05:38.699> Y<00:05:38.729> for<00:05:39.210> how<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.389> items<00:05:39.750> not<00:05:40.590> necessarily

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
on Y for how the items not necessarily

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.129 
on Y for how the items not necessarily
from<00:05:41.279> X<00:05:41.969> on<00:05:42.210> Y<00:05:42.240> because<00:05:42.690> I<00:05:42.779> don't<00:05:42.930> think

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
from X on Y because I don't think

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.890 
from X on Y because I don't think
they're<00:05:43.259> going<00:05:43.440> to<00:05:43.590> be<00:05:43.680> implemented<00:05:44.810> just<00:05:45.810> a

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
they're going to be implemented just a

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.469 
they're going to be implemented just a
good<00:05:46.080> idea<00:05:46.379> for<00:05:46.469> how<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.830> in<00:05:47.190> general<00:05:47.479> but

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
good idea for how that in general but

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.170 
good idea for how that in general but
that's<00:05:48.719> probably<00:05:48.960> never<00:05:49.289> gonna<00:05:49.500> happen<00:05:49.849> so<00:05:50.849> to

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
that's probably never gonna happen so to

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.209 
that's probably never gonna happen so to
make<00:05:51.330> up<00:05:51.479> for<00:05:51.539> that<00:05:51.810> I'm<00:05:52.139> going<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.099> have

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
make up for that I'm going to have

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.430 
make up for that I'm going to have
another<00:05:53.550> video<00:05:53.990> saturday<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.259> hope<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:56.599> if<00:05:57.599> I
