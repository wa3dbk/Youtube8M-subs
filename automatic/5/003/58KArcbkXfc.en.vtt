00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.099 
referring to it and there's images
further<00:00:46.859> on<00:00:47.100> where<00:00:47.399> they<00:00:48.269> show<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.989> this

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
further on where they show like this

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.020 
further on where they show like this
weird<00:00:49.410> gigantic<00:00:49.859> pump<00:00:50.250> looking<00:00:50.579> things<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:50.999> i

think<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> pump<00:00:52.589> might<00:00:52.769> be<00:00:52.920> an<00:00:53.039> actual

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
think that the pump might be an actual

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.619 
think that the pump might be an actual
part<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> easter<00:00:54.059> egg<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.510> to

Richtofen now if you guys on us in the
middle<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.500> got<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> area<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.490> were

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
middle we got the area that they were

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.510 
middle we got the area that they were
zooming<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.299> says<00:02:03.479> November<00:02:04.009> 1870<00:02:05.009> which

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
zooming in it says November 1870 which

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.560 
zooming in it says November 1870 which
is<00:02:05.640> kind<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.880> weird<00:02:06.000> i<00:02:06.179> don't<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.539> that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
is kind of weird i don't know what that

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.359 
is kind of weird i don't know what that
means<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.380> probably<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> list<00:02:08.190> of

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
means it's probably just like a list of

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.889 
means it's probably just like a list of
different<00:02:08.520> major<00:02:08.940> battles<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.570> don't<00:02:09.690> even

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
different major battles or I don't even

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.230 
different major battles or I don't even
know<00:02:10.140> why<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.800> says<00:02:11.070> November<00:02:11.430> 1870<00:02:12.210> I

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
know why it's in it says November 1870 I

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.700 
know why it's in it says November 1870 I
don't<00:02:12.480> whatever<00:02:12.870> let's<00:02:13.080> move<00:02:13.230> forward<00:02:13.590> now

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
don't whatever let's move forward now

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.460 
don't whatever let's move forward now
the<00:02:14.550> next<00:02:14.640> images<00:02:15.090> actually<00:02:15.320> looks<00:02:16.320> like<00:02:16.410> a

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the next images actually looks like a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.290 
the next images actually looks like a
meteor<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.010> fell<00:02:17.070> down<00:02:17.490> looks<00:02:17.790> similar<00:02:18.120> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
meteor that fell down looks similar to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.130 
meteor that fell down looks similar to
the<00:02:18.390> one<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.870> was

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the one that was

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.650 
the one that was
shi<00:02:19.350> no<00:02:19.470> numa<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.330> little<00:02:21.450> different

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
shi no numa but it's a little different

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.020 
shi no numa but it's a little different
obviously<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.350> glowing<00:02:22.590> blue<00:02:22.920> we've<00:02:23.790> got

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
obviously it's glowing blue we've got

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.120 
obviously it's glowing blue we've got
like<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.330> weird<00:02:24.600> symbols<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.040> know

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
like the weird symbols on there you know

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.650 
like the weird symbols on there you know
a<00:02:26.160> ton<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.430> people<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.760> saying<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.569> the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
a ton of people are saying that the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.000 
a ton of people are saying that the
whole<00:02:27.780> zombie<00:02:27.959> thing<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.620> some<00:02:28.800> kind<00:02:28.920> of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
whole zombie thing is just some kind of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640 
whole zombie thing is just some kind of
weird<00:02:29.250> alien<00:02:29.819> thing<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.209> happened<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.260> it's

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
weird alien thing that happened and it's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.630 
weird alien thing that happened and it's
looking<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.280> be<00:02:32.400> more<00:02:32.580> and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
looking like it's going to be more and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.860 
looking like it's going to be more and
more<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.240> it's<00:02:33.390> got<00:02:33.510> some<00:02:33.690> weird

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
more like that it's got some weird

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.390 
more like that it's got some weird
symbols<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.620> would<00:02:34.770> normally<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.160> like

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
symbols that you would normally see like

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.520 
symbols that you would normally see like
in<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> weird<00:02:35.760> crop<00:02:36.090> circle<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.260> glowing

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
in a weird crop circle and it's glowing

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.490 
in a weird crop circle and it's glowing
same<00:02:38.160> meteorite<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.540> huge<00:02:39.810> just<00:02:40.380> like

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
same meteorite and it's huge just like

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.320 
same meteorite and it's huge just like
the<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.709> machine<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.130> Umeh<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.060> we'll<00:02:42.209> see

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
the one machine on Umeh so we'll see

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.590 
the one machine on Umeh so we'll see
what<00:02:42.450> happens<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.190> next<00:02:44.340> image<00:02:44.580> we<00:02:44.790> got<00:02:44.970> is

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
what happens so the next image we got is

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.540 
what happens so the next image we got is
the<00:02:45.780> actual<00:02:46.110> excavation<00:02:46.920> point<00:02:47.190> where

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
the actual excavation point where

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.280 
the actual excavation point where
they're<00:02:47.880> actually<00:02:48.270> taking<00:02:48.480> out<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.110> know<00:02:49.200> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
they're actually taking out you know the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.199 
they're actually taking out you know the
meteorite<00:02:49.709> exploring<00:02:50.190> down<00:02:50.340> below<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:50.819> you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
meteorite exploring down below as you

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.850 
meteorite exploring down below as you
can<00:02:51.360> tell<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.750> got<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.020> these<00:02:52.170> weird<00:02:52.410> relics

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
can tell we got like these weird relics

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.050 
can tell we got like these weird relics
that<00:02:52.980> they<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:53.400> also<00:02:53.610> have<00:02:53.940> like

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
that they have and they also have like

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.449 
that they have and they also have like
these<00:02:54.209> weird<00:02:54.630> blue<00:02:55.350> glowing<00:02:55.709> things<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.340> them

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
these weird blue glowing things on them

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.300 
these weird blue glowing things on them
so<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.390> looks<00:02:57.570> like<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:58.440> was<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:58.860> some<00:02:58.890> kind

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
so it looks like this was like some kind

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.520 
so it looks like this was like some kind
of<00:02:59.340> landing<00:03:00.030> point<00:03:00.300> possibly<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.110> something

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
of landing point possibly for something

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.320 
of landing point possibly for something
I'm<00:03:01.650> not<00:03:01.800> really<00:03:01.920> sure<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.580> it's<00:03:03.000> really

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
I'm not really sure but the it's really

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.110 
I'm not really sure but the it's really
old<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.860> looks<00:03:05.040> like<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.459> could<00:03:05.940> have

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
old so it looks like this could have

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.540 
old so it looks like this could have
stemmed<00:03:06.630> from<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.959> long<00:03:07.260> time<00:03:07.590> ago<00:03:07.650> when<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
stemmed from a long time ago when the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.100 
stemmed from a long time ago when the
meteorite<00:03:09.030> actually<00:03:09.060> hit<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.810> then<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.989> was

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
meteorite actually hit and then it was

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.540 
meteorite actually hit and then it was
eventually<00:03:10.350> discovered<00:03:10.769> because<00:03:11.250> we<00:03:11.430> can

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
eventually discovered because we can

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.970 
eventually discovered because we can
just<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:11.790> how<00:03:11.910> old<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:13.080> actual<00:03:13.500> structures

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
just see how old the actual structures

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.590 
just see how old the actual structures
are<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.790> we're<00:03:14.910> going<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.090> move<00:03:15.209> forward<00:03:15.390> to

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
are so we're going to move forward to

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.750 
are so we're going to move forward to
the<00:03:15.690> next<00:03:15.810> image<00:03:16.220> after<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.400> know<00:03:17.519> they're<00:03:17.670> at

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
the next image after you know they're at

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.759 
the next image after you know they're at
the<00:03:17.880> excavation<00:03:18.630> point<00:03:18.900> everyone<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.530> kind<00:03:19.709> of

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
the excavation point everyone is kind of

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.290 
the excavation point everyone is kind of
digging<00:03:20.070> they<00:03:20.220> break<00:03:20.489> into<00:03:20.700> an<00:03:20.910> area<00:03:21.150> that

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
digging they break into an area that

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.360 
digging they break into an area that
eventually<00:03:21.989> has<00:03:22.200> zombies<00:03:22.500> running<00:03:22.950> out<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
eventually has zombies running out and

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.270 
eventually has zombies running out and
we<00:03:23.430> see<00:03:24.150> just<00:03:24.390> at<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> actual<00:03:25.280> excavation

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
we see just at the actual excavation

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.039 
we see just at the actual excavation
area<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.760> being<00:03:27.000> run<00:03:27.180> over<00:03:27.209> by<00:03:27.450> zombies

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
area is being run over by zombies

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.380 
area is being run over by zombies
nothing<00:03:28.739> too<00:03:28.860> special<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.280> see<00:03:29.519> here<00:03:29.760> move<00:03:29.940> on

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
nothing too special to see here move on

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.970 
nothing too special to see here move on
to<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.600> next<00:03:30.780> one<00:03:30.900> we<00:03:31.410> get<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.590> picture<00:03:31.829> of

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
to the next one we get a picture of

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.860 
to the next one we get a picture of
no-man's<00:03:32.610> land<00:03:32.820> what<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.239> looks<00:03:33.420> like<00:03:33.630> as<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
no-man's land what it looks like as a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.500 
no-man's land what it looks like as a
bunch<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.230> zombies<00:03:34.380> running<00:03:34.769> through<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
bunch of zombies running through it and

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.640 
bunch of zombies running through it and
there's<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.630> couple<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:37.019> bodies<00:03:37.320> here<00:03:37.530> and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
there's a couple of bodies here and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.050 
there's a couple of bodies here and
there<00:03:37.799> but<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:38.519> no<00:03:38.670> man's<00:03:38.910> land

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
there but this is what no man's land

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.539 
there but this is what no man's land
looks<00:03:39.450> like<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.500> move<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.040> next<00:03:41.220> image

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
looks like so move on to the next image

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.610 
looks like so move on to the next image
we<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.480> actual<00:03:42.630> zombie<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.260> actually

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
we have the actual zombie is actually

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.740 
we have the actual zombie is actually
running<00:03:43.829> into<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.220> people<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.700> were<00:03:44.850> during

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
running into the people that were during

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.180 
running into the people that were during
the<00:03:45.959> battle<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:46.470> they<00:03:46.590> were<00:03:46.650> actually<00:03:47.040> having

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
the battle so they were actually having

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.759 
the battle so they were actually having
an<00:03:47.459> excavation<00:03:48.060> point<00:03:48.480> they<00:03:49.470> were<00:03:49.530> there

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
an excavation point they were there

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.590 
an excavation point they were there
excavating<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.579> at<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.760> same<00:03:50.940> time<00:03:51.000> they<00:03:51.480> had

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
excavating and at the same time they had

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.720 
excavating and at the same time they had
soldiers<00:03:51.900> who<00:03:52.290> were<00:03:52.440> kind<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.579> middle

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
soldiers who were kind of in the middle

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.250 
soldiers who were kind of in the middle
of<00:03:53.940> war<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.570> guess<00:03:54.810> they<00:03:54.930> were<00:03:55.049> kind<00:03:55.200> of

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
of war so I guess they were kind of

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.600 
of war so I guess they were kind of
defending<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.860> area<00:03:56.250> while<00:03:56.430> they<00:03:56.549> were

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
defending the area while they were

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.890 
defending the area while they were
trying<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.940> excavate<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.540> see<00:03:57.660> what<00:03:57.810> they

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
trying to excavate and see what they

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.039 
trying to excavate and see what they
could<00:03:57.959> find<00:03:58.079> but<00:03:59.070> as<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.370> see<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.780> bunch

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
could find but as you can see this bunch

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.539 
could find but as you can see this bunch
of<00:04:01.200> zombies<00:04:01.320> running<00:04:01.680> at<00:04:01.860> him<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.100> they

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
of zombies running at him and they

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.949 
of zombies running at him and they
actually<00:04:02.790> get<00:04:02.880> overwhelmed<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.600> get<00:04:03.750> killed

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
actually get overwhelmed and get killed

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.920

a<00:04:44.970> dead<00:04:45.270> rising<00:04:45.690> type<00:04:45.900> thing<00:04:46.169> but<00:04:46.199> I<00:04:46.410> think

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
a dead rising type thing but I think

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.900 
a dead rising type thing but I think
it'd<00:04:46.770> be<00:04:46.889> kind<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.160> cool<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:47.340> attack<00:04:47.729> yell

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
it'd be kind of cool if attack yell

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.460 
it'd be kind of cool if attack yell

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
little katana looking thing but he's

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.270
