00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
with this we are also changing from

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.160 
with this we are also changing from
suunto<00:00:37.559> int<00:00:38.520> protocol<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:40.730> bluetooth

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
suunto int protocol to bluetooth

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.029 
suunto int protocol to bluetooth
bluetooth<00:00:43.250> meaning<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.960> we<00:00:45.960> are<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.379> going

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
bluetooth meaning that we are not going

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.760 
bluetooth meaning that we are not going
to<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.370> able<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.820> use<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.300> old<00:00:48.570> pots<00:00:49.020> anymore
