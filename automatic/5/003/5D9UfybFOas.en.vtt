00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.210
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.140
 be fine then today we get 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.430
 found for a small video 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.029
 exceptional once again I 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.809
 wanted to show you 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.200
 you present a gaming headset so 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.560
 it's the famous turtle beach stilts 400 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.580
 so this is a helmet for ps4 ps3 and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960
 mobile with the little asterix so 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.359
 it's a helmet is compatible on all 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.490
 the mobiles on all the tablets on 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.429
 all mp3 players etc. etc 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.940
 so here's the box it's a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.590
 helmet that costs 99 euros it's a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.790
 stereo headphones with a very very good 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.950
 sounded frankly I was 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.670
 surprised because by this helmet duc it's 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.370
 for stereo it was quite surprising 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 it's totally wireless is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.840
 compatible so I remind you with 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.949
 ps3 ps4 and mobile so here is the beast 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 so as you can see he is black 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.070
 and blue must not believe in relation to the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 box on the side of the ear cups 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 the time on the turn it does not turn on 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.520
 at all it comes against this little 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.080
 logo turtle beach agreement pamiers 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.189
 there that light up here so inside 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.390
 you see it's turtle beach the matter 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.100
 it's plastic 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.840
 the helmet in light the frame is in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.880
 plastic and if he has a good rust 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.700
 for the top of the skull that is really 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 very comfortable the covers of 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.450
 ears are made of fabric cotton fabric me 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.299
 I prefer I prefer cotton 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.060
 end of the month the fabric as synthetic 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.399
 synthetic leather or the style we 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.079
 call it commonly so it's more 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.740
 frankly I was very surprised by the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:51.149
 quality of what are here so you 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.890
 find the plug to plug your 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.450
 famous pro because of course you 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.579
 can remove the microphone if you 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.899
 serve on a mobile in the street in the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.520
 train or in public transport 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.610
 and in general the door where you are very 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.770
 remove the microphone that is here 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.259
 so it's a flexible microphone when it's 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.239
 connect here it's like that here so 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.430
 it gives you that we can adjust it to a 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.549
 other saying like you want here and if 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.860
 there is therefore the model of this helmet 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.970
 type 400 the sound setting of the video game 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.170
 there are several settings that you 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.599
 can have inside 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.160
 so be aware that we have a 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.780
 little voice that also speaks to you against 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.360
 the helmet is half loads and the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.579
 headphones turned on the headphones and one or if you 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.650
 switch to in order fashion 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.620
 and if so you have the sound setting 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.389
 of the game here the several several 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.130
 small settings to burn them 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.430
 bases it's natural natural lessons 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.160
 several choices here the sound of the cat 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.530
 which could be regulated separately from the scion 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.880
 of the game something that is very very 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.069
 appreciable especially on ps4 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.739
 knowing that the majority of cases this does not 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.310
 are not really 100% compatible 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:05.310
 here so you find the jack 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.220
 3.5 with which you can plug in 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.590
 your body which he is enough have 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.650
 besides a double jack that is provided 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.109
 with the headset that's like these 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.700
 you disconnect here and reconnect on 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.260
 a ps vita for example or on a 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.450
 phone or tablet 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.209
 what you want the cable needs 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.310
 about one meter fifty we will say 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.230
 here we are 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.030
 sorry here so you find the mode 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.290
 mute 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.690
 so when you put the headset on you 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.150
 find like this so the helmet gets 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.409
 carry microphone on the left 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.099
 So here quickly which go 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.750
 like these micro left and the 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.000
 setting the settings is found at 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.370
 the back of your your head 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.349
 so in the beginning it's a little embarrassing because 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.670
 we do not really know which button 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.069
 quickly get used to it we do it 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.329
 super fast here is so then good 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.310
 well here at the micro usb socket 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.409
 on the other hand, the cable supplied with the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.519
 reload really ridiculous when 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.709
 I was ridiculous it's mostly at the level 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.319
 the length of the cable 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.129
 the coffee should be barely 30 cm 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.720
 so it's usb micro usb 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.310
 so that's it they do not really 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.510
 of effort above can not say that with 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.850
 what kind of case are you going to be able to play 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.900
 and use your headset in time 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.180
 because there you will find yourself 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.770
 the head in the tv cabinet and that risk 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.560
 to be a disadvantage 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.500
 then you also have the little key 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.190
 usb to relive it to connect your 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.070
 castan at all so that's dirty 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.479
 might stand as health so you 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.680
 have everything so I call back for a 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.000
 price of 99 euros 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.979
 I will show you a little bit 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.360
 quickly I do not know if we're going 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.039
 hear I'm going to lit 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.880
 his finger leaning here on the little 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.880
 right triangle 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.469
 you see you have the little logo that 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:10.309
 flashes on either side of the helmet as 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:13.610
 this is so when he is on the road 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:17.089
 give it so that's not great 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.409
 thing frankly even times it's 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:19.580
 rather annoying than anything else that reflects 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.169
 in the window if you have a window 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.479
 an ice cream next to it reflects and it's a 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.580
 a little awkward we have the impression 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.719
 to have a storm in the house 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.649
 so that's it for today I 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.419
 wanted to show you a little bit 

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:35.389
 headphones that is really not bad at all 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.800
 for the price frankly if you have 99 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.339
 euros to put in a good little helmet 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.139
 gaming 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:43.279
 do not hesitate take this case what it is 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.749
 really very comfortable and so here 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.610
 no complaints this is really a good 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:49.419
 little 4 go I leave you good 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.419
 day to you ciao ciao
