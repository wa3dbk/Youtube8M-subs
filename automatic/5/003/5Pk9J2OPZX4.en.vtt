00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.450

 performance and a very small pack size 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.480

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.670

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.270
 and even when wet was isolated 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.750
 The ion is very robust and special 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.320

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.079
 Of course for the little scumbag the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.420
 children's sleeping bags the most important question 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.579
 which one should pose as user 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.460
 if you are him or horse 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.460
 expect temperatures a spot the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.170
 temperature ranges our sleeping bags 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.689
 be on the heat scale right on the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.439
 Product explains the comfort area 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.000
 signs with t com is ours 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.299
 orientation value ben for each woman 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.789
 gurion has a comfort value of plus 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.229
 minus zero degrees of orientation value 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.909
 for the men lies between the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.909
 comfort area and in the area 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.050
 all jack wolfskin sleeping bags are after 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.539
 the therme song and technology 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.000
 that means they have one 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.610
 cold-sensitive places on the head am 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.070
 so good on the feet and on the feet 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.330
 are fed 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.250
 In conclusion, one can say that 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 the user should be aware of it 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.780
 so should use for the sleeping bag 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.400
 would like in what temperature ranges 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.440
 is at night and then 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.420
 finally make the decision 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.740
 I choose a down sleeping bag or 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.740
