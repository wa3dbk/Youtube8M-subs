00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.720 

welcome<00:00:03.389> back<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.990> want<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.009> start<00:00:05.310> with<00:00:05.490> when

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
welcome back I want to start with when

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.360 
welcome back I want to start with when
we<00:00:05.819> talk<00:00:06.060> about<00:00:06.089> sketching<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.890> concept

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
we talk about sketching is the concept

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.850 
we talk about sketching is the concept
of<00:00:08.490> scale<00:00:08.610> factor<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.200> important<00:00:10.769> when

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
of scale factor this is important when

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.580 
of scale factor this is important when
you're<00:00:11.010> doing<00:00:11.309> structural<00:00:11.610> details<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:13.139> with

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
you're doing structural details so with

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.990 
you're doing structural details so with
scale<00:00:13.860> factor<00:00:14.719> we're<00:00:15.719> dealing<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.970> what<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
scale factor we're dealing with what is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.269 
scale factor we're dealing with what is
the<00:00:18.300> relationship<00:00:18.840> between<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.859> scale<00:00:20.130> I'm

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the relationship between the scale I'm

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.519 
the relationship between the scale I'm
drawing<00:00:20.640> at<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> physical<00:00:21.960> object<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
drawing at and the physical object and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.380 
drawing at and the physical object and
so<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:24.380> examples<00:00:25.380> I'm<00:00:25.680> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.699> scale

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
so for examples I'm going to do scale

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.240 
so for examples I'm going to do scale
factors<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.340> 3/4<00:00:29.340> inch<00:00:30.140> equals<00:00:31.140> 1<00:00:31.679> foot<00:00:31.980> an

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
factors of 3/4 inch equals 1 foot an

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.200 
factors of 3/4 inch equals 1 foot an
inch<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> half<00:00:35.550> equals<00:00:36.800> one<00:00:37.800> foot<00:00:38.210> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
inch and a half equals one foot and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
inch and a half equals one foot and
these<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.809> two<00:00:39.960> common<00:00:40.379> scales<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:41.640> I'm

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
these are two common scales what I'm

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.850 
these are two common scales what I'm
going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> point<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.360> there<00:00:42.629> when<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.590> these

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
going to point out there when I do these

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
going to point out there when I do these
is<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.250> important<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> scale

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
is it's important to know the scale

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.350 
is it's important to know the scale
factors<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.000> translate

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
factors so I'm going to just translate

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.340 
factors so I'm going to just translate
this<00:00:48.600> really<00:00:48.899> quick

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
this really quick

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.100 
this really quick
this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:50.059> recorders<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> an<00:00:51.270> inch<00:00:51.420> equals<00:00:51.629> 12

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
this is recorders of an inch equals 12

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.080 
this is recorders of an inch equals 12
inches<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.399> showing<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> drawn

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
inches and this is showing the drawn

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.240 
inches and this is showing the drawn
scale<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> actual<00:00:55.289> physical<00:00:55.770> real<00:00:56.010> world

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
scale to the actual physical real world

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.029 
scale to the actual physical real world
scale<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:57.420> wine<00:00:57.660> also<00:00:57.840> come<00:00:58.170> over<00:00:58.260> here<00:01:01.039> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
scale then wine also come over here and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.490 
scale then wine also come over here and
sketch<00:01:02.370> these<00:01:02.640> out

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.190 

and<00:01:05.890> if<00:01:06.190> I<00:01:06.310> divide<00:01:06.640> both<00:01:06.670> sides<00:01:07.240> just<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.050> get<00:01:08.170> a

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
and if I divide both sides just to get a

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.740 
and if I divide both sides just to get a
ratio<00:01:09.090> then<00:01:10.090> that<00:01:10.630> will<00:01:10.840> equal<00:01:11.310> 1<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.460> 16<00:01:13.000> is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
ratio then that will equal 1 to 16 is

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.980 
ratio then that will equal 1 to 16 is
the<00:01:13.810> scale<00:01:14.110> factor<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.680> then<00:01:15.990> sometimes

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
the scale factor and then sometimes

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.890 
the scale factor and then sometimes
we'll<00:01:17.140> look<00:01:17.260> for<00:01:17.440> a<00:01:17.470> v8<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:18.790> F<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.240> then

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
we'll look for a v8 that's F and then

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.530 
we'll look for a v8 that's F and then
the<00:01:20.020> ratio<00:01:20.170> on<00:01:20.440> this<00:01:20.560> side<00:01:20.770> is<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.030> 1/8<00:01:22.030> and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
the ratio on this side is just 1/8 and

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.840 
the ratio on this side is just 1/8 and
what<00:01:22.690> that<00:01:22.870> means<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.440> every<00:01:23.590> inch<00:01:23.980> drawn<00:01:24.460> on

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
what that means is every inch drawn on

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.270 
what that means is every inch drawn on
paper<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.900> equal<00:01:26.230> 8<00:01:26.410> inches<00:01:26.890> in<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.130> real

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
paper will equal 8 inches in the real

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.910 
paper will equal 8 inches in the real
world<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.790> every<00:01:28.600> inch<00:01:28.810> drawn<00:01:29.230> on<00:01:29.380> paper<00:01:29.410> will

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
world and every inch drawn on paper will

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.100 
world and every inch drawn on paper will
equal<00:01:30.370> 16<00:01:30.820> inches<00:01:31.120> in<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.690> real<00:01:31.870> physical

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
equal 16 inches in the real physical

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.750 
equal 16 inches in the real physical
object<00:01:32.770> at<00:01:32.890> 3/4<00:01:33.640> scale<00:01:35.370> so<00:01:36.370> where<00:01:36.580> does<00:01:36.700> that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
object at 3/4 scale so where does that

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.580 
object at 3/4 scale so where does that
leave<00:01:37.090> us<00:01:37.120> if<00:01:37.510> I'm<00:01:37.690> going<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:37.990> come<00:01:38.140> over<00:01:38.320> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
leave us if I'm going to come over and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.730 
leave us if I'm going to come over and
draw<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.460> line<00:01:40.300> in<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:41.080> example<00:01:41.800> every<00:01:42.760> 4

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
draw a line in this example every 4

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.350 
draw a line in this example every 4
squares<00:01:44.740> on<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.070> graph<00:01:45.250> paper<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.760> 1<00:01:45.970> inch<00:01:46.180> so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
squares on the graph paper is 1 inch so

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.859 
squares on the graph paper is 1 inch so
I'm<00:01:46.450> going<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.630> draw<00:01:46.930> out<00:01:48.540> inch<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> half

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
I'm going to draw out inch and a half

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.960 
I'm going to draw out inch and a half
line<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:51.280> as<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.479> do<00:01:52.540> that<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:54.520> quickly<00:01:54.790> see

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
line and as I do that I can quickly see

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.760 
line and as I do that I can quickly see
I've<00:01:55.360> got<00:01:55.570> 1<00:01:55.780> 2<00:01:56.200> 3<00:01:56.550> 4<00:01:57.550> 5<00:01:58.090> 6<00:01:58.840> marks<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.560> means

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 marks that means

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.190 
I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 marks that means
each<00:02:00.009> of<00:02:00.040> these<00:02:00.310> squares<00:02:00.550> is<00:02:01.000> 2<00:02:01.270> inches<00:02:01.600> and

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
each of these squares is 2 inches and

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.790 
each of these squares is 2 inches and
let's<00:02:03.160> say<00:02:03.400> at<00:02:03.780> inch-and-a-half<00:02:04.780> scale<00:02:05.410> I

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
let's say at inch-and-a-half scale I

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.820 
let's say at inch-and-a-half scale I
would<00:02:06.280> want<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.910> draw<00:02:07.150> in<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.660> number<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> tree

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
would want to draw in a number a tree

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.660 
would want to draw in a number a tree
bar<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.280> number<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> tree<00:02:10.090> bar

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.380 

has<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.300> diameter<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:17.140> 1<00:02:17.680> inch<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:20.220> what

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
has a diameter of 1 inch and so what

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.949 
has a diameter of 1 inch and so what
size<00:02:23.640> circle<00:02:24.640> amounted<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.000> draw<00:02:25.390> an

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
size circle amounted to draw an

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.280 
size circle amounted to draw an
inch-and-a-half<00:02:26.500> scale<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:28.780> simply

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
inch-and-a-half scale that's simply

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.430 
inch-and-a-half scale that's simply
going<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.739> be<00:02:30.069> 1/8<00:02:31.030> inch<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.230> I'm<00:02:32.290> going<00:02:32.380> to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
going to be 1/8 inch and so I'm going to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.150 
going to be 1/8 inch and so I'm going to
come<00:02:32.590> over<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.280> select<00:02:33.580> 1/8<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:35.170> draw

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
come over here and select 1/8 and draw

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.680 
come over here and select 1/8 and draw
in<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.400> rebar

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.750 

so<00:02:41.320> what<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.500> have<00:02:41.710> shown<00:02:41.980> here<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.430> could<00:02:42.700> be

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
so what I have shown here this could be

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:51.080 
so what I have shown here this could be
a<00:02:43.270> great<00:02:43.510> beam<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:47.640> 1<00:02:48.640> foot<00:02:48.910> wide<00:02:49.890> and

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
a great beam that is 1 foot wide and

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.360 
a great beam that is 1 foot wide and
rebar<00:02:52.090> at<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.840> lower<00:02:53.050> corner<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:54.270> each<00:02:55.270> member

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
rebar at the lower corner of each member

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.260 
rebar at the lower corner of each member
if<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.550> were<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.820> come<00:02:58.000> over<00:02:58.180> at<00:02:58.710> 3/4<00:02:59.710> inch<00:02:59.890> scale

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
if I were to come over at 3/4 inch scale

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:08.550 
if I were to come over at 3/4 inch scale
and<00:03:01.710> draw<00:03:02.710> that<00:03:02.920> same<00:03:03.220> object<00:03:03.880> then<00:03:07.260> I'm<00:03:08.260> going

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
and draw that same object then I'm going

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.960 
and draw that same object then I'm going
to<00:03:08.650> draw<00:03:08.890> it

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.750 

here<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.900> then<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.800> know<00:03:14.860> I'm<00:03:15.250> going<00:03:15.490> to<00:03:15.580> use<00:03:15.730> a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
here and then I know I'm going to use a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.930 
here and then I know I'm going to use a
sixteenth<00:03:16.390> inch<00:03:17.310> diameter<00:03:18.310> opening<00:03:18.790> and

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
sixteenth inch diameter opening and

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.480 
sixteenth inch diameter opening and
that's<00:03:19.080> going<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.170> be<00:03:20.260> much<00:03:20.440> smaller<00:03:20.680> I'm<00:03:21.280> just

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
that's going to be much smaller I'm just

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.360 
that's going to be much smaller I'm just
going<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.700> eyeball<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.710> and<00:03:23.710> proportion<00:03:24.250> it

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
going to eyeball that and proportion it

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.880 
going to eyeball that and proportion it
down<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:25.180> here<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.570> have<00:03:25.750> two<00:03:25.960> scales<00:03:26.350> you

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
down so here you have two scales you

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.420 
down so here you have two scales you
have<00:03:26.920> 3/4<00:03:27.580> inch<00:03:27.700> scale<00:03:28.000> where<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.690> see<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.440> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
have 3/4 inch scale where you see a the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.080 
have 3/4 inch scale where you see a the
bottom<00:03:30.760> half<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.240> a<00:03:31.450> concrete<00:03:31.780> beam<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.940> is

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
bottom half of a concrete beam that is

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.470 
bottom half of a concrete beam that is
one<00:03:34.330> foot<00:03:34.570> wide

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.570 

and<00:03:38.569> here<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.709> have<00:03:39.920> an<00:03:40.159> inch<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.550> half

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
and here you have an inch and a half

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.479 
and here you have an inch and a half
scale<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.780> concrete<00:03:42.290> beam<00:03:42.500> one<00:03:43.040> foot<00:03:43.250> wide

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
scale the concrete beam one foot wide

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.960 
scale the concrete beam one foot wide
with<00:03:44.269> two<00:03:44.510> number<00:03:44.780> eights<00:03:44.989> in<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.319> bottom

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.550 

again<00:03:49.970> we're<00:03:50.239> not<00:03:50.390> suggesting<00:03:50.629> that<00:03:51.200> these

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
again we're not suggesting that these

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.100 
again we're not suggesting that these
are<00:03:51.830> real<00:03:52.780> structural<00:03:53.780> engineering

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
are real structural engineering

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.050 
are real structural engineering
solutions<00:03:54.769> these<00:03:55.040> are<00:03:55.250> just<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.849> the

reinforcing configuration these are just

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.850 
reinforcing configuration these are just
graphical<00:03:58.970> examples<00:03:59.599> and<00:03:59.870> we<00:04:00.319> selected<00:04:00.769> a

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
graphical examples and we selected a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.440 
graphical examples and we selected a
number<00:04:01.010> eight<00:04:01.340> simply<00:04:01.940> because<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.330> was

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
number eight simply because it was

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.990 
number eight simply because it was
1-inch<00:04:02.840> diameter<00:04:03.319> for<00:04:04.190> these<00:04:04.310> examples<00:04:04.819> but

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
1-inch diameter for these examples but

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.869 
1-inch diameter for these examples but
you<00:04:05.060> see<00:04:05.360> one<00:04:06.260> foot<00:04:06.500> wide<00:04:06.680> with<00:04:07.430> two<00:04:07.610> number

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
you see one foot wide with two number

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.729 
you see one foot wide with two number
eights<00:04:08.030> in<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.239> bottom<00:04:08.569> one<00:04:09.110> foot<00:04:09.319> wide<00:04:09.530> with
