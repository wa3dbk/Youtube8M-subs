00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.229
 You are the perfectionist you can shorten 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 and then would go 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.419
 sometimes along 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.799
 yes, I also prepared for this race again 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.220
 the one because it was a nice race in the last couple of five kilometers 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.800
 piste and drive 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.880
 then you don't have much to choose from that is just full body from the beginning you know 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.220
 You also know again and again that has all been discussed in advance with my 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.970
 staff with all people more 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.300
 you know in advance that this will be a distance coach, he needs information 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.550
 because the reached cannes can very often be very intensive due to the right one 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.810
 have schematics by first working through the gates of stig 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.210
 but to lay down a number of tribute with which time formation can increase 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.320
 and that is in the long run ample in this case 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770
 and my mistake has been dekker 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.090
 I am 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.910
 I am I was busy writing information lies is he 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.580
 and 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.000
 who made sure that I missed that turn when it came out here didn't know it 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.340
 the case you didn't know where it came from 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.220
 9 the italy in all fell inside or out in serbia 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.340
 every time that the device does not have to be things that the standard takes with it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.500
 emmen 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.280
 but when I write my paper winner the farmer after the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.280
 I didn't see him competing with clients at all on the side of the coaches 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.310
 and that is what it seemed to me was that the outside track had just arrived 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.350
 with that I experience impact on it again after I employ my information employers 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 information to skate right on me as if he was behind me again 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.110
 wanted to go outside 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.260
 so i would be fine 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.630
 he sat well but the plate the center area are shot but ahead 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 my experience was not like that 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.620
 that was still not enough information for them 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.800
 to coach him somewhat 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.920
 I got scolari then bought it again 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.300
 and then panicked with bees at skobrev I thought he saw 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.500
 once the head on the inner lane rect 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.989
 then think very fast then we all have to be very fast too 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.229
 thinking very quickly 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.269
 cinemas inside and she goes ie see it as a book from outside 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.419
 go inside 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:18.189
 And he didn't do that with the settlement times inside that it was this stress 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.229
 who did the parking 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.259
 9 in that bend a drafty but a little solve 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.569
 then I saw them coming there also go inside corner well something is wrong 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.079
 he photos the stars skobrev hand 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.179
 and at the next crossing I knew it 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.549
 the fastest lap time with the declarant 27 say nothing yet 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.409
 Then you know that the round was not icy skater and then you know 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.599
 your percent 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.599
 then the ground fell under your first name 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.019
 not literally
