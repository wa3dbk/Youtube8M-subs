00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 purchases found all purchases that 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.300
 did at intercharm 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.900
 I'll say right away that at the shopping show was 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.310
 some rice was very good 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.410
 first and best purchase to me 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.670
 It seems all autumn is a mask for 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.850
 hair from the movie 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 Estelle from the series for long and very kind 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.750
 hair this mask just won me over 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 I really like she does my hair 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.840
 incredibly smooth obedient she 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.940
 it gives them the volume it seems to me 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.420
 the best mask I've ever had 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.660
 and the damask is just awesome 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 that it is very easily and well absorbed 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.250
 in the hair it does not lie on the hair white 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.219
 by weight 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.969
 she immediately feeds them pretty 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.230
 economical very very pleasant smell 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.570
 I really like the packaging of this mask 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.790
 This mask is pretty pretty but 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.890
 Immediately I want to say that you neither 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.860
 addressed about the scope of this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.060
 product in this mask is 300 milliliters 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 I want to show you a jar with a volume of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.780
 actions dmitrov test you can 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.720
 compare what products of this jar 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.299
 much less than she herself is on 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.930
 there really is a big cap 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.780
 still such a protective cap like this 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.950
 the mask itself looks and as you see that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.439
 the packaging itself is pretty voluminous 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.920
 we immediately went this wonderful scent 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.259
 the flavor is just awesome and i want 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.140

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.229
 knock down the century bought socks from estelle 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.490
 she took two masks from various other 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.829
 clinics and lines also really liked 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.960
 so look at the console masks 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.049
 style seems to me everyone can find 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.179
 there came something interesting that something 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.099
 really like your hair 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.250
 last purchase that was on 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.909
 intercharm is such a varnish 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 firms 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:21.090
 he goes to three hundred and twenty first 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.760
 shades i really like this color where 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.329
 partial to such colors not in lipstick 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.719
 not 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:32.939
 nail polish doesn't like it very much 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:36.260
 good quality product for nails then 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:39.209
 I'll show you four varnishes from flormar 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.569
 I really liked these likes 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.120

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.629
 separate video where I will tell you more 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.280
 your impressions 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.010
 I want to say that the ratio of price and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.219
 qualities are very decent and decent 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.590
 quality for my money is very me 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:01.889
 I liked these varnishes and I stayed with them 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.700
 very satisfied also for the nails i took 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:08.489
 These are the design films and already 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.650
 came up with several manicure options 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.510
 with such and designer shelves for 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.099
 nails 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.829
 have seen to experiment with 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.709
 your marigold tips to draw 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.250
 attention to such designer wands 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.439
 this fall I discovered a new one 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.040
 natural cosmetics firm 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.889
 This cosmetics from India and this is called 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.340
 anna's firm cheers secrets of nature 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:38.970
 and the first remedy that I have 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:44.609
 this is aloe gel which contains 24 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:47.879
 percent but I have not been heard of 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:51.329
 these gels did not want to try it 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:55.139
 now I actively use it well 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:57.659
 reduces inflammation and redness of his 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:01.709
 can be used both on face and meme 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.930
 agel body and later I will tell of 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.780
 more details about your impression of the elf 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.319
 following remedy from starting a secret and so 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.229
 whether here is such a cream under the eyes pretty 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.989
 still a large amount of it which is not 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:19.279
 peculiar to ordinary eye cream 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.109
 Well, here you do not regret the smell of him 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:24.659
 quite so unusual with something 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.960
 reminds quiet moans almost all 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:31.500
 firm smells are pretty strong but 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.010
 it is natural and quite normal 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.169
 like this Indian products we know what 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.500
 all sorts of such Indian products they 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.659
 rich and rich in their aromas 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.240
 pretty so me this is not 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:51.529
 surprised for the hair the first is coconut 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.539
 oils that are rich in vitamin e 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.669
 i like something butter unlike 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.610
 many other oils 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:04.430
 Comes with a convenient dispenser it is convenient 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.020
 apply to hair because it comes with 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.440
 so dozer that is not necessary there 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.219
 poking your fingers somehow get 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:20.630
 Immediately apply to hair 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:23.669
 distribute the packaging to me very hair 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.460
 coconut-based oil loan

 sesame oil with various herbs 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.300
 this oil can be applied to the roots 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.839
 so on the ends of the hair this oil fights 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.210
 dandruff with hair loss 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:42.360
 stimulates hair growth to baltic and 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.789
 I was interested in this oil and very 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.719
 Interestingly he dace such roots 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:51.080
 inside then let her still be like that 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:54.479
 say insist and eats various 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.409
 useful substances and components 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:00.930
 also a convenient dispenser for this oil 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.330
 while I am active with these products 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.610

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.219
 full review and tell you my 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.930
 opinion about this company and about these funds 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:16.560
 my next purchases were three 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:20.099
 such face masks and night mask 100 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.949
 I liked me less likely it 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.880
 Here is a mask from garnier of blue 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.639
 clay and 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.920
 after steaming we are looking for the effect also in this 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:32.280
 masks present zinc 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:36.030
 and should contribute to the fact that acne 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.580
 inflammation will soon pass out 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.420
 my skin is nothing good this mask is not 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.170

 inflammations fight she did not help me 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:52.710
 ordinary mask is nothing special 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:56.490
 Wolf mask comes with acids 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:59.610
 she very carefully and cleanses the skin 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.650

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.320
