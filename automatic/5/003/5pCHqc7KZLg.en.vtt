00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
show you guys my little artsy trainer

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.460 
show you guys my little artsy trainer
plane<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.150> lot<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.600> guys<00:00:21.750> saw<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> plane<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
plane a lot of you guys saw the plane in

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.320 
plane a lot of you guys saw the plane in
some<00:00:22.650> previous<00:00:22.859> videos<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.939> thought<00:00:24.180> I'd

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
some previous videos so I thought I'd

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
some previous videos so I thought I'd
showed<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:26.099> an<00:00:26.279> older

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
showed you so here it is it's an older

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.339 
showed you so here it is it's an older
plane<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.210> trainer<00:00:27.510> that's<00:00:27.810> why<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> wing

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
plane it's a trainer that's why the wing

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.710 
plane it's a trainer that's why the wing
is<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.680> big<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.130> by<00:00:29.910> being<00:00:30.210> wide<00:00:30.449> like

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
is so big like that by being wide like

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.120 
is so big like that by being wide like
that<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.080> gives<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:31.470> forgiveness<00:00:31.980> in

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that it gives you more forgiveness in

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.680 
that it gives you more forgiveness in
the<00:00:32.279> air<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> make<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> mistake<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.540> gonna

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the air if you make a mistake it's gonna

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.500 
the air if you make a mistake it's gonna
float<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.260> lot<00:00:34.500> easier<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> air<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.420> I've

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
float a lot easier up in the air so I've

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.930 
float a lot easier up in the air so I've
always<00:00:36.690> wanted<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.770> my<00:00:37.980> life<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
always wanted one all my life and I

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.459 
always wanted one all my life and I
finally<00:00:39.180> got<00:00:39.360> into<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:39.960> while<00:00:40.200> ago<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
finally got into it a little while ago a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
finally got into it a little while ago a
friend<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.770> mine<00:00:40.860> had<00:00:41.700> these<00:00:41.879> planes<00:00:42.239> kicking

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
friend of mine had these planes kicking

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
friend of mine had these planes kicking
around<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.140> he's<00:00:43.530> been<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.070> quite<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
around and he's been into it for quite a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
around and he's been into it for quite a
while<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> traded<00:00:45.390> him<00:00:45.690> some<00:00:45.960> stuff<00:00:46.260> for

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
while so I traded him some stuff for

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.860 
while so I traded him some stuff for
that<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:48.000> point<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.629> pretty

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that and this point here is in pretty

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
that and this point here is in pretty
good<00:00:49.020> shape<00:00:49.079> actually<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:49.950> older<00:00:50.190> plane

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
good shape actually for an older plane

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430 
good shape actually for an older plane
he<00:00:51.000> actually<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.539> put<00:00:51.719> another<00:00:51.930> motor<00:00:52.260> in

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
he actually just put another motor in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.850 
he actually just put another motor in
its<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.739> super<00:00:52.890> tiger<00:00:53.430> 45<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> 45

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
its a super tiger 45 you can see the 45

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240 
its a super tiger 45 you can see the 45
model<00:00:56.789> number<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:58.680> engine<00:00:59.070> here

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
model number here and this engine here

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.709 
model number here and this engine here
is<00:00:59.309> barely<00:00:59.730> used<00:00:59.910> he<00:01:00.090> said<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.480> probably

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
is barely used he said it's probably

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.290 
is barely used he said it's probably
only<00:01:01.199> got<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.469> two<00:01:01.859> hours<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.579> as<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
only got about two hours on it as you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.670 
only got about two hours on it as you
can<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> muffler<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.199> nice<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
can see here the muffler is nice and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.240 
can see here the muffler is nice and
shiny

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
shiny

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
shiny
I<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> Super<00:01:06.390> Tigers<00:01:06.840> how<00:01:07.260> their

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
I like the Super Tigers how their

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
I like the Super Tigers how their
mufflers<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.070> big<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.810> basically<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
mufflers are big like that basically the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.300 
mufflers are big like that basically the
wing<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.470> attach<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:11.040> some

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
wing you just attach it with some

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
wing you just attach it with some
elastics<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.240> across<00:01:12.570> both<00:01:12.900> ways<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
elastics that go across both ways and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.219 
elastics that go across both ways and
now<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.820> take<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> wing<00:01:15.360> off<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.900> easier

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
now I can take the wing off it's easier

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
now I can take the wing off it's easier
for<00:01:16.259> storing<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.549> all<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
for storing it like that and all the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
for storing it like that and all the
electrical<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.540> inside<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.830> servos

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
electrical is inside here all the servos

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.590 
electrical is inside here all the servos
and<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.850> engine<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> little

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and this engine here is a little

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.170 
and this engine here is a little
two-stroke<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> glow<00:01:26.729> plug<00:01:27.000> here

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
two-stroke and this is a glow plug here

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630 
two-stroke and this is a glow plug here
there<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.540> no<00:01:27.750> spark<00:01:28.080> plug<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.650> just

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
there is no spark plug in there just

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
there is no spark plug in there just
basically<00:01:30.090> heat<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> glow<00:01:30.810> plug<00:01:31.079> when<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
basically heat up the glow plug when you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.469 
basically heat up the glow plug when you
go<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> start<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.880> runs<00:01:33.030> off<00:01:33.270> its

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
go to start it and then it runs off its

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.789 
go to start it and then it runs off its
own<00:01:33.630> heat<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> little

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
own heat it's kind of like a little

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.030 
own heat it's kind of like a little
diesel<00:01:35.130> engine<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> fuel<00:01:37.890> that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
diesel engine and this is the fuel that

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.210 
diesel engine and this is the fuel that
it<00:01:38.189> runs<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> nitro<00:01:39.570> fuel<00:01:40.100> here<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it runs on it's a nitro fuel here it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.840 
it runs on it's a nitro fuel here it
says<00:01:41.430> 15<00:01:41.880> percent<00:01:42.450> nitro<00:01:43.020> 16<00:01:44.009> percent<00:01:44.460> total

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
says 15 percent nitro 16 percent total

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.719

blend in there says premium for cycle

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.700 
blend in there says premium for cycle
but<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.700> works<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> two<00:01:51.600> cycle<00:01:52.049> engines<00:01:52.439> as

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
but it works in the two cycle engines as

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
but it works in the two cycle engines as
well<00:01:52.939> anyways<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.270> fun<00:01:54.450> hobby<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.869> does

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
well anyways it's a fun hobby it does

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.840 
well anyways it's a fun hobby it does
take<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.530> lot<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.740> time<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.340> work<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.700> these

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
take a lot of time to work on these

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.819 
take a lot of time to work on these
planes<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.299> all<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.680> as

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
planes and all that but it's not as

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.889 
planes and all that but it's not as
expensive<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.579> used<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.180> before<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
expensive as it used to be before you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.300 
expensive as it used to be before you
can<00:02:01.049> start<00:02:01.290> off<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.590> an<00:02:01.740> old<00:02:01.890> plane<00:02:02.100> like

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
can start off with an old plane like

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.249 
can start off with an old plane like
this<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.329> if<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.570> crash<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.079> you

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
this one and if you crash it then you

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.380 
this one and if you crash it then you
don't<00:02:04.530> lose<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.890> much<00:02:05.040> money<00:02:05.070> also<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.119> can

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
don't lose that much money also you can

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.169 
don't lose that much money also you can
buy<00:02:06.540> an<00:02:06.780> RC<00:02:07.350> flight<00:02:07.890> simulator<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.940> called

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
buy an RC flight simulator it's called

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.270 
buy an RC flight simulator it's called

my<00:02:13.980> first<00:02:14.219> question<00:02:14.549> today<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.969> youtubers

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
my first question today is a youtubers

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.509 
my first question today is a youtubers
asking<00:02:15.780> me<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.109> you<00:02:16.409> have<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> small<00:02:16.890> engine<00:02:17.310> and

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
asking me if you have a small engine and

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.610 
asking me if you have a small engine and
the<00:02:18.120> coil<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> outside<00:02:19.379> of<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the coil is on the outside of the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.559 
the coil is on the outside of the
flywheel<00:02:19.859> does<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.879> mean<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.329> you<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.540> no

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
flywheel does that mean that you have no

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.530 
flywheel does that mean that you have no
points<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.650> answer<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:23.099> is<00:02:23.400> no<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.879> may

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
points the answer to that is no you may

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.880 
points the answer to that is no you may
have<00:02:24.689> a<00:02:24.719> coil<00:02:25.079> on<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.260> outside<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.829> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
have a coil on the outside of the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.559 
have a coil on the outside of the
flywheel<00:02:26.099> but<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.939> doesn't<00:02:27.269> mean<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.420> you

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
flywheel but that doesn't mean that you

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.990 
flywheel but that doesn't mean that you
have<00:02:27.719> no<00:02:27.750> points<00:02:28.260> under<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> flywheel<00:02:29.189> if<00:02:29.790> you

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
have no points under the flywheel if you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.610 
have no points under the flywheel if you
have<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.150> wire<00:02:30.389> that<00:02:30.659> goes<00:02:30.719> from<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.260> ignition

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
have a wire that goes from the ignition

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.589 
have a wire that goes from the ignition
module<00:02:32.040> or<00:02:32.219> the<00:02:32.370> coil<00:02:32.670> underneath<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
module or the coil underneath the

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.050 
module or the coil underneath the
flywheel<00:02:34.049> then<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.709> means<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:35.519> points

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
flywheel then that means there is points

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.059 
flywheel then that means there is points
under<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.599> flywheel<00:02:36.870> let's<00:02:37.709> give<00:02:37.889> you<00:02:38.010> an

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
under that flywheel let's give you an

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.250 
under that flywheel let's give you an
example<00:02:38.400> here's<00:02:38.939> a<00:02:39.120> lawnmower<00:02:39.569> motor<00:02:39.810> that's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
example here's a lawnmower motor that's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.830 
example here's a lawnmower motor that's
apart<00:02:40.620> here's<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.670> coil<00:02:41.969> or<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.389> ignition

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
apart here's the coil or the ignition

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.110 
apart here's the coil or the ignition
module<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.439> if<00:02:44.189> you<00:02:44.280> look<00:02:44.430> around<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.849> coil

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
module and if you look around the coil

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.360 
module and if you look around the coil
there<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.659> no<00:02:45.840> wire<00:02:46.109> that<00:02:46.500> goes<00:02:46.560> directly

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
there is no wire that goes directly

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.569 
there is no wire that goes directly
under<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.419> flywheel<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.799> means<00:02:50.069> there

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
under the flywheel so that means there

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.059 
under the flywheel so that means there
is<00:02:50.730> no<00:02:50.939> point<00:02:51.269> under<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.079> flywheel<00:02:52.409> or<00:02:52.859> on

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
is no point under that flywheel or on

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.309 
is no point under that flywheel or on
that<00:02:53.280> engine<00:02:53.459> anywhere<00:02:54.120> only<00:02:54.540> wire<00:02:54.840> coming

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
that engine anywhere only wire coming

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.860 
that engine anywhere only wire coming
from<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.650> ignition<00:02:56.129> module<00:02:56.549> or<00:02:56.700> coil<00:02:57.090> goes

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
from this ignition module or coil goes

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.259 
from this ignition module or coil goes
to<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.349> safety<00:02:58.680> switch<00:02:59.010> over<00:02:59.609> here<00:02:59.639> on<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
to the safety switch over here on the

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.929 
to the safety switch over here on the
engine<00:03:00.659> which<00:03:01.409> attaches<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.280> cable<00:03:02.730> on

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
engine which attaches to the cable on

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.030 
engine which attaches to the cable on
the<00:03:03.209> handlebars<00:03:03.689> that<00:03:04.139> you<00:03:04.290> let<00:03:04.439> go<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.769> stop

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the handlebars that you let go to stop

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.099 
the handlebars that you let go to stop
the<00:03:05.219> machine<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.819> as<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.569> see<00:03:06.629> there<00:03:06.959> are

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
the machine and as you can see there are

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.289 
the machine and as you can see there are
no<00:03:07.260> wires<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.859> all<00:03:08.159> going<00:03:08.700> underneath<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
no wires at all going underneath that

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.020 
no wires at all going underneath that
flywheel<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.829> it's<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.040> lot<00:03:11.189> less<00:03:11.370> headaches<00:03:11.669> if

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
flywheel so it's a lot less headaches if

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030 
flywheel so it's a lot less headaches if
you<00:03:12.299> do<00:03:12.450> not<00:03:12.569> have<00:03:12.810> points<00:03:13.169> in<00:03:13.290> my<00:03:13.409> opinion<00:03:13.859> in

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
you do not have points in my opinion in

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.220 
you do not have points in my opinion in
this<00:03:14.639> case<00:03:14.849> if<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.150> had<00:03:15.239> no<00:03:15.450> spark<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.079> would

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
this case if you had no spark you would

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.280 
this case if you had no spark you would
check<00:03:16.469> the<00:03:16.530> safety<00:03:17.159> switch<00:03:17.400> over<00:03:17.790> here<00:03:17.819> or

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
check the safety switch over here or

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.659 
check the safety switch over here or
disconnect<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.379> wire<00:03:19.530> from<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.949> coil<00:03:20.220> try<00:03:20.609> it

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
disconnect the wire from the coil try it

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.000 
disconnect the wire from the coil try it
if<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.359> still<00:03:21.750> didn't<00:03:22.019> have<00:03:22.109> any<00:03:22.290> spark<00:03:22.650> then

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
if you still didn't have any spark then

i'm talking about is the small tube here
that<00:04:59.280> comes<00:04:59.550> out<00:04:59.759> of<00:04:59.969> here<00:05:00.180> from<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.569> center

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
that comes out of here from the center

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.019 
that comes out of here from the center
of<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.020> carb<00:05:01.319> and<00:05:01.830> this<00:05:02.460> is<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:02.759> small

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:03.029 
of the carb and this is the small

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.670 
of the carb and this is the small
emulsion<00:05:03.569> tube<00:05:03.810> which<00:05:04.020> goes<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:04.469> center

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
emulsion tube which goes in the center

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.129 
emulsion tube which goes in the center
there<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:05.159> there<00:05:05.939> is<00:05:06.060> an<00:05:06.210> o-ring<00:05:06.449> on<00:05:06.900> this

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
there and there is an o-ring on this

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.200 
there and there is an o-ring on this
side<00:05:07.349> here<00:05:07.710> of<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.889> tube<00:05:08.219> that<00:05:08.460> Clips<00:05:08.759> right

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
side here of the tube that Clips right

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.939 
side here of the tube that Clips right
down<00:05:09.479> in<00:05:09.689> here<00:05:09.719> and<00:05:10.229> on<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.770> other<00:05:10.830> side

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
down in here and on the other side

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.850 
down in here and on the other side
another<00:05:11.460> ol<00:05:11.699> ring<00:05:11.939> clips<00:05:12.449> in<00:05:12.659> here<00:05:12.990> so<00:05:13.710> the

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
another ol ring clips in here so the

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.499 
another ol ring clips in here so the
part<00:05:14.069> number<00:05:14.279> for<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.490> is<00:05:14.610> six<00:05:15.029> three<00:05:15.210> two

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
part number for that is six three two

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.290 
part number for that is six three two
five<00:05:15.960> four<00:05:16.259> seven<00:05:16.529> it<00:05:17.460> cost<00:05:17.669> about<00:05:17.879> a<00:05:17.939> buck<00:05:18.090> or

five four seven it cost about a buck or

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.550 
five four seven it cost about a buck or
two<00:05:18.330> each<00:05:18.659> but<00:05:19.020> they're<00:05:19.169> handy<00:05:19.409> to<00:05:19.500> have

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
two each but they're handy to have

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.589 
two each but they're handy to have
around<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:20.400> can<00:05:20.639> get<00:05:20.849> these<00:05:21.029> when<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.419> buy<00:05:21.569> a

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
around you can get these when you buy a

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.719 
around you can get these when you buy a
whole<00:05:22.020> carburetor<00:05:22.560> repair<00:05:22.979> kit<00:05:23.219> for<00:05:23.580> these

whole carburetor repair kit for these

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.240 
whole carburetor repair kit for these
carburetors<00:05:24.110> but<00:05:25.110> I<00:05:25.139> usually<00:05:25.349> buy<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.740> orange

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
carburetors but I usually buy the orange

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.189 
carburetors but I usually buy the orange
separately<00:05:26.819> because<00:05:27.090> sometimes<00:05:27.659> that's<00:05:27.960> all

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
separately because sometimes that's all

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.809 
separately because sometimes that's all
I<00:05:28.259> need<00:05:28.529> to<00:05:28.680> replace<00:05:28.979> are<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.460> two<00:05:29.639> o-rings

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
I need to replace are the two o-rings

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.579 
I need to replace are the two o-rings
that<00:05:30.330> way<00:05:30.779> there<00:05:30.990> I<00:05:31.020> don't<00:05:31.259> need<00:05:31.379> to<00:05:31.440> buy<00:05:31.560> a

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:31.589 
that way there I don't need to buy a

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.469 
that way there I don't need to buy a
whole<00:05:31.830> carburetor<00:05:32.310> kit<00:05:32.580> just<00:05:32.819> to<00:05:32.940> get<00:05:33.150> one<00:05:33.330> or

showed you are a different size than the

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.869 
showed you are a different size than the

carburetors<00:05:40.919> in<00:05:41.430> my<00:05:41.580> next<00:05:41.729> question<00:05:42.060> a

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
carburetors in my next question a

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.640 
carburetors in my next question a
youtuber<00:05:42.479> is<00:05:42.569> asking<00:05:42.900> me<00:05:42.990> why<00:05:43.199> doesn't<00:05:43.560> my

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
youtuber is asking me why doesn't my

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.800 
youtuber is asking me why doesn't my
radiator<00:05:44.009> idle<00:05:44.370> properly<00:05:44.909> he<00:05:45.300> says<00:05:45.509> it<00:05:45.690> will

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
radiator idle properly he says it will

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.290 
radiator idle properly he says it will
idle<00:05:46.139> really<00:05:46.440> slow<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:46.889> then<00:05:47.250> die<00:05:47.460> out<00:05:47.490> sure

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
idle really slow and then die out sure

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.820 
idle really slow and then die out sure
your<00:05:48.479> weed<00:05:48.629> eater<00:05:48.810> here<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.259> if<00:05:49.560> your<00:05:49.680> weed

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
your weed eater here and if your weed

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.260 
your weed eater here and if your weed
eater<00:05:50.009> is<00:05:50.190> slightly<00:05:50.460> different<00:05:50.819> it<00:05:51.089> doesn't

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
eater is slightly different it doesn't

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.939 
eater is slightly different it doesn't
matter<00:05:51.569> because<00:05:51.839> the<00:05:52.199> carburetor<00:05:52.620> will<00:05:52.830> be

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
matter because the carburetor will be

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.260 
matter because the carburetor will be
the<00:05:53.069> same<00:05:53.279> principle<00:05:53.699> when<00:05:53.849> it<00:05:53.969> comes<00:05:54.150> to

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
the same principle when it comes to

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.570 
the same principle when it comes to
adjusting<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.930> idle<00:05:54.960> speed<00:05:55.440> so<00:05:56.069> basically

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
adjusting the idle speed so basically

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.189 
adjusting the idle speed so basically
all<00:05:56.729> you<00:05:56.939> do<00:05:57.150> if<00:05:57.330> you<00:05:57.569> want<00:05:57.750> your<00:05:57.839> machine<00:05:57.990> to

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
all you do if you want your machine to

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.290 
all you do if you want your machine to
idle<00:05:58.560> faster<00:05:59.039> is<00:05:59.219> you<00:05:59.430> turn<00:05:59.669> this<00:05:59.819> screw<00:06:00.060> in

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
idle faster is you turn this screw in

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.719 
idle faster is you turn this screw in
clockwise<00:06:01.050> now<00:06:01.680> if<00:06:01.800> your<00:06:01.919> machine<00:06:02.039> idles<00:06:02.520> too

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
clockwise now if your machine idles too

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.249 
clockwise now if your machine idles too
fast<00:06:02.969> then<00:06:03.270> you<00:06:03.300> want<00:06:03.509> it<00:06:03.629> to<00:06:03.719> idle<00:06:03.960> slower

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
fast then you want it to idle slower

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.439 
fast then you want it to idle slower
just<00:06:04.620> basically<00:06:04.919> turn<00:06:05.279> it<00:06:05.460> out<00:06:05.580> until<00:06:06.270> you're

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
just basically turn it out until you're

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.089 
just basically turn it out until you're
happy<00:06:06.569> with<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.020> speed<00:06:07.289> that<00:06:07.409> it's<00:06:07.589> idling<00:06:07.800> at

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
happy with the speed that it's idling at

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.519 
happy with the speed that it's idling at
so<00:06:08.669> it's<00:06:08.789> really<00:06:09.089> simple<00:06:09.330> you<00:06:09.659> just<00:06:10.319> adjust

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:10.529 
so it's really simple you just adjust

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:12.980 
so it's really simple you just adjust
this<00:06:10.949> screw<00:06:11.099> here<00:06:11.490> to<00:06:12.089> the<00:06:12.240> desired<00:06:12.629> idle

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
this screw here to the desired idle

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.559 
this screw here to the desired idle
speed<00:06:13.289> that<00:06:13.620> you're<00:06:13.770> happy<00:06:13.949> with<00:06:14.360> for<00:06:15.360> I<00:06:15.389> end

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:15.569 
speed that you're happy with for I end

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.559 
speed that you're happy with for I end
