from<00:00:21.900> ECS<00:00:22.260> tuning<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> say<00:00:23.640> that

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
from ECS tuning I just like to say that

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.970 
from ECS tuning I just like to say that
was<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> solid<00:00:24.720> piece<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:24.990> looks<00:00:25.380> very<00:00:25.439> good<00:00:25.859> on

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
was a solid piece and looks very good on

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.550 
was a solid piece and looks very good on
the<00:00:26.070> car<00:00:26.300> I<00:00:27.300> read<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> bunch<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.080> forms<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the car I read a bunch of forms that

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.810 
the car I read a bunch of forms that
people<00:00:28.769> are<00:00:28.830> saying<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.220> actually<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.550> bigger

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
people are saying it's actually a bigger

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.500 
people are saying it's actually a bigger
diameter

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
diameter

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.630 
diameter
I'm<00:00:31.320> sorry<00:00:31.590> smaller<00:00:31.890> diameter<00:00:32.399> than<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I'm sorry smaller diameter than the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.610 
I'm sorry smaller diameter than the
factory<00:00:33.030> pulley<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.079> fact<00:00:34.110> not

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
factory pulley and that is in fact not

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.740 
factory pulley and that is in fact not
the<00:00:34.649> case<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> exact<00:00:35.910> same<00:00:36.059> diameter

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the case it is the exact same diameter

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
the case it is the exact same diameter
so<00:00:36.899> don't<00:00:37.079> worry<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:37.380> sacrificing<00:00:38.280> any

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
so don't worry about sacrificing any

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.920 
so don't worry about sacrificing any
kind<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:39.079> you<00:00:40.079> know<00:00:40.200> power<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.930> alright

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930

to do was drop the subframe down

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.670 
to do was drop the subframe down
basically<00:01:26.040> bottle<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> plastic<00:01:27.630> right<00:01:28.229> here

basically bottle the plastic right here
there's<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.700> subframe<00:01:30.360> screw<00:01:30.920> there's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
there's one subframe screw there's

another one right here and then there's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.890 
another one right here and then there's
another<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.000> right<00:01:36.210> here

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
a shade tree thing it's not all that

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.490 
a shade tree thing it's not all that
difficult<00:01:44.360> my<00:01:45.360> recommendation<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.079> everybody

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
difficult my recommendation to everybody

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
difficult my recommendation to everybody
trying<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> change<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.430> way<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
trying to change this way more on a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.039 
trying to change this way more on a
six-cylinder<00:01:48.689> models<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:50.280> vault<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.360> only

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
six-cylinder models this vault here only

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.429 
six-cylinder models this vault here only
back<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:52.920> probably<00:01:53.689> I'd<00:01:54.689> say<00:01:54.720> eight<00:01:55.110> turns

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
back it out probably I'd say eight turns

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
back it out probably I'd say eight turns
to<00:01:55.710> where<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.610> completely<00:01:57.030> out

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
to where it's it's not completely out

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.139 
to where it's it's not completely out
but<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.630> hanging<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.110> there<00:01:59.030> let's<00:02:00.030> all

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
but just hanging in there let's all

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.060 
but just hanging in there let's all
leave<00:02:00.299> these<00:02:00.509> front<00:02:00.810> two<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> other

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
leave these front two in and the other

support<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.319> subframe<00:02:23.650> once<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.700> get<00:02:24.819> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
support the subframe once you get the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.270 
support the subframe once you get the
back<00:02:25.120> four<00:02:25.450> bolts<00:02:25.810> out<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.010> can<00:02:27.130> lower

the subframe and then what that's going

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.290 
the subframe and then what that's going
to<00:02:28.810> allow<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:30.130> you'll<00:02:30.880> be<00:02:30.970> able<00:02:31.030> to

you<00:02:52.030> put<00:02:52.269> new<00:02:52.480> end<00:02:52.690> links<00:02:52.989> on<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.140> because<00:02:53.440> you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
you put new end links on it because you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.410 
you put new end links on it because you
know<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.519> in<00:02:54.610> links<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:54.970> took<00:02:55.180> off<00:02:55.299> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
it literally sounded like sand was in it

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.180 
it literally sounded like sand was in it
I<00:03:01.510> mean<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.720> was<00:03:01.810> an<00:03:01.930> awful<00:03:02.349> sound<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.920> that

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
was far as getting a lot of my noise

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.509 
was far as getting a lot of my noise
from<00:03:04.720> my<00:03:04.959> car

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
from my car

of clunk noises coming from the front of
the<00:03:11.140> car<00:03:11.380> even<00:03:11.799> after<00:03:12.099> they<00:03:12.220> change<00:03:12.519> the

the car even after they change the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.809 
the car even after they change the
control<00:03:13.030> arms<00:03:13.739> this<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.280> culprit<00:03:15.519> right

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
control arms this is the culprit right

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.000 
control arms this is the culprit right
here<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.890> sway<00:03:18.130> bar<00:03:18.400> bushing<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:20.010> throws

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
here the the sway bar bushing it throws

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.710 
here the the sway bar bushing it throws
itself<00:03:21.400> out<00:03:21.640> where<00:03:21.880> it's<00:03:22.000> bigger<00:03:22.299> diameter

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
itself out where it's bigger diameter

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720 
itself out where it's bigger diameter
than<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.290> actual<00:03:23.590> sway<00:03:23.920> bar<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:24.370> what<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.609> is

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
than the actual sway bar so what it is

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.280 
than the actual sway bar so what it is
is<00:03:24.910> when<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.329> go<00:03:25.420> through<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> turn<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.109> sway

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
is when you go through a turn the sway

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.630 
is when you go through a turn the sway
bar<00:03:26.470> shoots<00:03:26.799> in<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:26.980> back<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.340> push<00:03:27.519> a

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
bar shoots in the back of the push a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.699 
bar shoots in the back of the push a
Mesa<00:03:27.820> clunk<00:03:28.150> nose<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:29.319> you're<00:03:29.440> gonna<00:03:29.560> get

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
Mesa clunk nose so you're gonna get

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.410 
Mesa clunk nose so you're gonna get
clunk<00:03:29.950> noise<00:03:30.220> more<00:03:30.430> likely<00:03:30.819> it's<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.239> see

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
clunk noise more likely it's you see

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.750 
clunk noise more likely it's you see
this<00:03:31.720> here<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.230> bushing<00:03:32.620> or<00:03:32.829> gonna<00:03:33.670> be

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
this here the bushing or gonna be

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.220 
this here the bushing or gonna be
something<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.180> do<00:03:34.299> with<00:03:34.480> your<00:03:34.660> in<00:03:34.810> link<00:03:35.049> right

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
something to do with your in link right
