pigments<00:01:50.680> you<00:01:50.830> have<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.280> really<00:01:51.520> pack<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:51.880> on

pigments you have to really pack it on

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.330 
pigments you have to really pack it on
so<00:01:53.560> that<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.890> adheres<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.700> skin<00:01:56.340> so

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so that it adheres to the skin so

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.859 
so that it adheres to the skin so
worried<00:01:57.549> about<00:01:57.640> blending<00:01:58.180> later<00:01:58.420> because

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
worried about blending later because

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.719 
worried about blending later because
that<00:01:59.110> would<00:01:59.229> be<00:01:59.259> an<00:01:59.439> easy<00:01:59.590> step<00:02:00.070> we're<00:02:00.700> going

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
that would be an easy step we're going

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.940 
that would be an easy step we're going
to<00:02:00.939> move<00:02:01.149> on<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.600> our<00:02:01.630> third<00:02:01.780> color<00:02:02.289> which<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.920> a

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
to move on to our third color which is a

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.230 
to move on to our third color which is a
darker<00:02:03.610> blue<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.180> this<00:02:04.360> one<00:02:04.509> is<00:02:04.570> called<00:02:04.720> blue

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
darker blue and this one is called blue

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.359 
darker blue and this one is called blue
so<00:02:07.240> using<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.780> 252<00:02:08.319> we're<00:02:08.739> just<00:02:08.920> going<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.160> add

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
so using the 252 we're just going to add

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.040 
so using the 252 we're just going to add
that<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.910> end<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:12.030> we're<00:02:13.030> going<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.420> also

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
that to the end and we're going to also

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.300 
that to the end and we're going to also
deepen<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.680> crease<00:02:14.830> line<00:02:15.250> with<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.250> I'm

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
deepen the crease line with it so I'm

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.370 
deepen the crease line with it so I'm
just<00:02:18.489> going<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.910> lightly<00:02:19.180> blend<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.959> towards

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
just going to lightly blend this towards

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.500 
just going to lightly blend this towards
the<00:02:20.560> Azrael<00:02:20.920> blue<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.850> almost<00:02:22.030> kind

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
the Azrael blue so that it almost kind

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.660 
the Azrael blue so that it almost kind
of<00:02:22.720> disappears<00:02:23.380> right<00:02:23.799> into<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.220> light<00:02:24.430> blue

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
of disappears right into the light blue

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.030 
of disappears right into the light blue
and<00:02:25.380> I'm<00:02:26.380> going<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.650> use<00:02:26.709> my<00:02:26.860> 225<00:02:27.730> brush<00:02:28.420> and

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.460 
just soften that color a little bit and
also<00:02:33.280> blend<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.060> inwards<00:02:34.540> towards<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.290> light

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
also blend it inwards towards the light

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.870 
also blend it inwards towards the light
blue<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:38.130> then<00:02:39.130> again<00:02:39.430> don't<00:02:39.640> worry<00:02:39.700> about

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
blue and then again don't worry about

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.100 
blue and then again don't worry about
the<00:02:40.239> edge<00:02:40.380> because<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:42.549> can<00:02:42.900> easily<00:02:43.900> clean

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
the edge because you can easily clean

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.080 
the edge because you can easily clean
that<00:02:44.290> up<00:02:44.319> later<00:02:49.530> all<00:02:50.530> right<00:02:50.739> just<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:51.670> now

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
that up later all right just like so now

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.569 
that up later all right just like so now
we're<00:02:52.390> ready<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.690> line<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.320> I'm<00:02:54.130> going<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.430> be

we're ready to line and I'm going to be
using<00:02:54.850> fluid<00:02:55.690> line<00:02:55.959> in<00:02:56.170> black<00:02:57.100> track<00:02:57.609> and<00:02:58.769> they

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
using fluid line in black track and they

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.520 
using fluid line in black track and they
come<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.430> pot<00:03:00.640> like<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:02.290> i'm<00:03:02.380> also

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
come in a pot like this and i'm also

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.020 
come in a pot like this and i'm also
using<00:03:02.680> an<00:03:03.130> angled<00:03:03.280> brush<00:03:03.459> 208<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.910> I'm<00:03:06.970> going

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
using an angled brush 208 so I'm going

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.670 
using an angled brush 208 so I'm going
to<00:03:07.299> start<00:03:07.799> halfway<00:03:08.799> between<00:03:09.400> my<00:03:10.150> outer<00:03:10.680> corner

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
to start halfway between my outer corner

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.580 
to start halfway between my outer corner
and<00:03:11.890> my<00:03:12.730> eyebrows<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.390> then<00:03:13.959> I'm<00:03:14.200> just<00:03:14.380> going

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
and my eyebrows and then I'm just going

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.100 
and my eyebrows and then I'm just going
to<00:03:14.680> line<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.100> inwards<00:03:17.489> towards<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.820> inner

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.560 

but<00:03:22.860> I'm<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.190> going<00:03:23.460> to<00:03:23.520> line<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.820> two<00:03:24.210> thirds

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
but I'm just going to line it two thirds

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.460 
but I'm just going to line it two thirds
of<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.900> way<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.570> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.960> give<00:03:28.170> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
of the way and this is going to give the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.260 
of the way and this is going to give the
appearance<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.550> have<00:03:29.910> bigger<00:03:30.870> eyes<00:03:32.270> I'm

appearance that I have bigger eyes I'm
going<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.630> connect<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.260> bottom<00:03:34.710> now

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
going to connect that to the bottom now

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.310 
going to connect that to the bottom now
on<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.970> bottom<00:03:36.300> i'm<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:36.660> going<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.020> place<00:03:37.290> it

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
on the bottom i'm just going to place it

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.160 
on the bottom i'm just going to place it
underneath<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.610> lash<00:03:38.790> line<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.480> i'm<00:03:40.020> just

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
underneath the lash line and i'm just

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
underneath the lash line and i'm just
going<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.470> line<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:40.890> halfway<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:42.710> again<00:03:43.710> that's

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
going to line it halfway in again that's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.820 
going to line it halfway in again that's
going<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.640> create<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.300> illusion<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.620> my<00:03:46.770> is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
going to create the illusion the my is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.300 
going to create the illusion the my is
bigger<00:03:47.250> than<00:03:47.760> its<00:03:48.060> normal<00:03:48.630> size<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.310> then

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
bigger than its normal size and then

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.380 
bigger than its normal size and then
just<00:03:50.520> make<00:03:50.670> sure<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.150> corners<00:03:51.390> are

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
just make sure that the corners are

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.949 
just make sure that the corners are
attached<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.840> then<00:03:54.900> darken<00:03:55.770> is<00:03:55.920> needed<00:03:56.959> you

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
attached and then darken is needed you

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.260 
attached and then darken is needed you
can<00:03:58.110> also<00:03:58.260> thicken<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.550> lot<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.150> people

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
can also thicken this a lot of people

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.060 
can also thicken this a lot of people
prefer<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.750> thicker<00:04:00.959> line<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.470> then<00:04:01.680> just<00:04:01.860> wipe

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
prefer a thicker line and then just wipe

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.670 
prefer a thicker line and then just wipe
it<00:04:02.280> up<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.200> cleans<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
it up just like that and that cleans the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.190 
it up just like that and that cleans the
edges<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.160> your<00:04:05.190> eyeshadow<00:04:06.890> there<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.040> go<00:04:09.200> so

edges of your eyeshadow there you go so
just<00:04:10.890> work<00:04:11.130> on<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.790> line<00:04:12.030> until<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.600> get<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
just work on the line until you get the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.020 
just work on the line until you get the
right<00:04:13.050> thickness<00:04:13.560> or<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.640> right<00:04:17.030> intensity

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
right thickness or the right intensity

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.840
