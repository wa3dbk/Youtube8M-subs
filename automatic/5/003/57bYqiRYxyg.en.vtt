going to try to illustrate that in a in
a<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.699> interesting<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> theory<00:01:00.930> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
a more interesting way but the theory of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.039 
a more interesting way but the theory of
mind<00:01:01.320> basically<00:01:02.219> means<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.940> others<00:01:03.270> have

that are different from your own
does<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.520> make<00:01:11.700> sense<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:14.030> see<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.530> set

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
does that make sense so see if I can set

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.580 
does that make sense so see if I can set
