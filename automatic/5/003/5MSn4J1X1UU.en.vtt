hang<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.520> second<00:02:08.789> before

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
hang on there for just a second before

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.529 
hang on there for just a second before
we<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.209> on

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
we go on

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.720 
we go on
check<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:10.009> hydrogenated<00:02:11.009> soybean<00:02:11.250> oil<00:02:11.550> now

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
check out hydrogenated soybean oil now

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.870 
check out hydrogenated soybean oil now
so<00:02:11.790> let's<00:02:12.030> see<00:02:12.120> what's<00:02:12.360> actually

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
so let's see what's actually

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880 
so let's see what's actually
in<00:02:13.000> what<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.720> deal<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.020> with<00:02:14.080> hydrogenated

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
in what the deal is with hydrogenated

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.170 
in what the deal is with hydrogenated
oils<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.250> particular<00:02:15.610> because<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:15.880> covered

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
oils in particular because I covered

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.090 
oils in particular because I covered
this<00:02:16.270> recently<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.230> went<00:02:17.440> through<00:02:17.620> loads

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
this recently and I went through loads

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.040 
this recently and I went through loads
and<00:02:18.370> loads<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.790> stuff<00:02:19.000> regarding<00:02:19.720> what<00:02:19.960> it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
and loads of stuff regarding what it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.840 
and loads of stuff regarding what it
does<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.350> your<00:02:20.410> body<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.460> this<00:02:21.550> video<00:02:21.790> I

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
does to your body so in this video I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.190 
does to your body so in this video I
covered<00:02:21.970> recently<00:02:22.510> actually<00:02:22.690> there<00:02:23.110> were

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
covered recently actually there were

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.290 
covered recently actually there were
five<00:02:23.530> really<00:02:24.400> bad<00:02:24.550> things<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:24.970> all

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
five really bad things that all

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.180 
five really bad things that all
hydrogenated<00:02:26.260> oils<00:02:26.530> through<00:02:26.650> your<00:02:26.800> body<00:02:26.980> so

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
hydrogenated oils through your body so

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.160 
hydrogenated oils through your body so
really<00:02:27.640> these<00:02:27.760> hydrogenated<00:02:28.570> vegetable<00:02:28.750> oils

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
really these hydrogenated vegetable oils

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.380 
really these hydrogenated vegetable oils
so<00:02:29.590> check<00:02:29.770> these<00:02:29.920> out<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> top<00:02:30.970> five<00:02:31.180> were

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
so check these out so the top five were

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.570 
so check these out so the top five were
number<00:02:31.690> one<00:02:31.810> increasing<00:02:32.710> LDL<00:02:33.160> your<00:02:33.400> bad

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
number one increasing LDL your bad

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.130 
number one increasing LDL your bad
cholesterol<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.450> think<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.810> one<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:34.990> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
cholesterol and I think in one of the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.540 
cholesterol and I think in one of the
studies<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.890> increased<00:02:36.250> total

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
studies it just increased total

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.610 
studies it just increased total
cholesterol<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.690> second<00:02:38.050> was<00:02:38.230> causing

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
cholesterol the second was causing

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.290 
cholesterol the second was causing
inflammation<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.430> hardening<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.940> your

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
inflammation and hardening of your

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.700 
inflammation and hardening of your
arteries<00:02:40.690> that's<00:02:41.110> bad

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
arteries that's bad

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.200 
arteries that's bad
the<00:02:42.160> third<00:02:42.340> was<00:02:42.550> showing<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.940> potential

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
the third was showing the potential

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.950 
the third was showing the potential
correlation<00:02:44.020> with<00:02:44.500> colorectal<00:02:45.070> cancer<00:02:45.700> risk

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
correlation with colorectal cancer risk

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.210 
correlation with colorectal cancer risk
fourth<00:02:46.960> was<00:02:47.140> being<00:02:47.350> strongly<00:02:47.680> linked<00:02:48.070> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
fourth was being strongly linked to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.040 
fourth was being strongly linked to
heart<00:02:48.520> disease<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.600> fifth<00:02:49.810> was

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
heart disease and the fifth was

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.810 
heart disease and the fifth was
increasing<00:02:50.710> your<00:02:50.830> risk<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.160> heart<00:02:51.310> attack<00:02:51.580> and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
increasing your risk of heart attack and

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.300 
increasing your risk of heart attack and
just<00:02:52.330> your<00:02:52.480> overall<00:02:52.660> risk<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.260> dying<00:02:53.530> so

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
just your overall risk of dying so

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.550 
just your overall risk of dying so
that's<00:02:54.550> what<00:02:54.790> hydrogenated<00:02:55.540> oils<00:02:55.840> do<00:02:56.020> again

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
that's what hydrogenated oils do again

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.960 
that's what hydrogenated oils do again
I'm<00:02:56.680> gonna<00:02:56.830> link<00:02:57.040> up<00:02:57.160> below<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.460> that<00:02:57.550> as<00:02:57.730> well

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
I'm gonna link up below to that as well

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.250 
I'm gonna link up below to that as well
there's<00:02:58.150> no<00:02:58.270> sense<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.570> me<00:02:58.660> repeating<00:02:59.110> it

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
there's no sense of me repeating it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.350 
there's no sense of me repeating it
that's<00:02:59.830> the<00:03:00.010> second<00:03:00.340> one<00:03:00.460> hydrogenated

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
that's the second one hydrogenated

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360 
that's the second one hydrogenated
soybean<00:03:01.720> oil<00:03:02.050> now<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.620> third<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.250> called

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
soybean oil now the third is called

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.580 
soybean oil now the third is called
sodium<00:03:03.730> acid<00:03:04.270> pyrophosphate<00:03:04.660> let's<00:03:05.410> take<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
sodium acid pyrophosphate let's take a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.360 
sodium acid pyrophosphate let's take a
look<00:03:05.710> at<00:03:05.800> some<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:05.950> these<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.160> again

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
look at some of these and again

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.640 
look at some of these and again
phosphates<00:03:07.270> are<00:03:07.390> also<00:03:07.510> added<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.960> soda<00:03:08.320> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
phosphates are also added to soda and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.350 
phosphates are also added to soda and
there's<00:03:09.310> another<00:03:09.460> interesting<00:03:09.820> reason<00:03:10.240> why

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
there's another interesting reason why

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.120 
there's another interesting reason why
soda<00:03:10.660> damages<00:03:11.140> your<00:03:11.290> enamel<00:03:11.530> which<00:03:11.980> is

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
soda damages your enamel which is

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.830 
soda damages your enamel which is
because<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.640> phosphate<00:03:13.060> you've<00:03:13.690> ever

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
because of the phosphate you've ever

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.000 
because of the phosphate you've ever
noticed<00:03:13.990> how<00:03:14.200> there's<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.410> lot<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.620> young<00:03:14.710> kids

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
noticed how there's a lot of young kids

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.040 
noticed how there's a lot of young kids
these<00:03:15.130> days<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.850> have<00:03:16.120> very<00:03:16.390> stained<00:03:16.810> and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
these days that have very stained and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.770 
these days that have very stained and
discolored<00:03:17.500> teeth<00:03:17.710> even<00:03:18.520> though<00:03:18.850> there's<00:03:19.660> no

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
discolored teeth even though there's no

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.970 
discolored teeth even though there's no
reason<00:03:20.080> why<00:03:20.170> they<00:03:20.290> should<00:03:20.470> have<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.650> where

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
reason why they should have that where

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.170 
reason why they should have that where
they're<00:03:21.100> young<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:21.460> it's<00:03:21.610> really<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.880> sugar

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
they're young but it's really the sugar

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.330 
they're young but it's really the sugar
and<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.600> phosphate<00:03:23.020> consumption<00:03:23.890> so

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
and the phosphate consumption so

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.460 
and the phosphate consumption so
phosphoric<00:03:24.910> acid<00:03:25.270> acidifies<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.260> also

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
phosphoric acid acidifies and also

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.770 
phosphoric acid acidifies and also
flavors<00:03:26.920> cokes<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.910> colas<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.510> kind<00:03:28.720> of

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
flavors cokes and colas and that kind of

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.540 
flavors cokes and colas and that kind of
thing<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.050> again<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.740> removes<00:03:30.160> tooth

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
thing and again that removes tooth

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.010 
thing and again that removes tooth
enamel<00:03:30.820> but<00:03:31.270> what<00:03:31.420> about<00:03:31.600> all<00:03:31.780> these<00:03:31.900> other

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
enamel but what about all these other

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.660 
enamel but what about all these other
things<00:03:32.320> we<00:03:32.470> talked<00:03:32.680> about<00:03:32.770> now<00:03:33.460> what<00:03:33.610> you

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
things we talked about now what you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.830 
things we talked about now what you
might<00:03:33.820> find<00:03:34.030> really<00:03:34.150> interesting<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.630> that

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
might find really interesting is that

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.020 
might find really interesting is that
sodium<00:03:35.200> acid<00:03:35.590> pyrophosphate<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.310> actually

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
sodium acid pyrophosphate is actually

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.210 
sodium acid pyrophosphate is actually
added<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.540> french<00:03:37.780> fries<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.710> reduce<00:03:39.040> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
added to french fries to reduce the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.410 
added to french fries to reduce the
levels<00:03:39.490> of<00:03:39.580> a<00:03:39.640> carcinogen<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.390> a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
levels of a carcinogen so a

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.990 
levels of a carcinogen so a
cancer-causing<00:03:40.870> agent<00:03:41.530> called<00:03:42.130> acrylamide

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
cancer-causing agent called acrylamide

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.300 
cancer-causing agent called acrylamide
now<00:03:43.959> this<00:03:44.110> is<00:03:44.230> actually<00:03:44.500> used<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.770> offset<00:03:45.250> that

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
now this is actually used to offset that

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.860 
now this is actually used to offset that
but<00:03:45.640> there<00:03:45.730> are<00:03:45.760> other<00:03:45.910> uses<00:03:46.120> for<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.480> as<00:03:46.600> well

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
but there are other uses for it as well

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.900 
but there are other uses for it as well
it<00:03:47.440> also<00:03:47.620> prevents<00:03:47.950> discoloration<00:03:48.760> of

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
it also prevents discoloration of

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.760 
it also prevents discoloration of
certain<00:03:49.150> liquids<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.660> it<00:03:50.050> helps<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.470> canned

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
certain liquids and it helps with canned

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.960 
certain liquids and it helps with canned
goods<00:03:51.040> as<00:03:51.160> well<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.459> again<00:03:51.580> it's<00:03:51.880> another

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
goods as well so again it's another

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.180 
goods as well so again it's another
preserving<00:03:52.600> agent<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.500> that's<00:03:53.709> kind<00:03:54.070> of

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
preserving agent but that's kind of

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.720 
preserving agent but that's kind of
creepy

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
creepy

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.710 
creepy
that<00:03:55.209> it's<00:03:55.390> used<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.860> prevent<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.790> carcinogen

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
that it's used to prevent a carcinogen

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.720 
that it's used to prevent a carcinogen
occurring<00:03:59.320> in<00:03:59.470> your<00:03:59.560> french<00:03:59.800> fries<00:03:59.950> now

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
occurring in your french fries now

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.460 
occurring in your french fries now
probably<00:04:01.150> chicken<00:04:01.810> nuggets<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.170> pervert

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
probably chicken nuggets of pervert

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.590 
probably chicken nuggets of pervert
preserved<00:04:03.040> or<00:04:03.280> produced<00:04:03.670> very<00:04:03.910> similarly<00:04:04.270> so

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
preserved or produced very similarly so

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.270 
preserved or produced very similarly so
there's<00:04:05.410> something<00:04:05.680> kind<00:04:05.830> of<00:04:05.920> started<00:04:06.190> going

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
there's something kind of started going

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.310 
there's something kind of started going
on<00:04:06.459> there<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:06.910> then<00:04:07.300> another<00:04:07.390> study<00:04:07.810> done<00:04:08.050> on

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
on there and then another study done on

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.080 
on there and then another study done on
phosphates<00:04:09.190> again<00:04:09.610> there<00:04:09.760> are<00:04:09.850> many

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
phosphates again there are many

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.030 
phosphates again there are many
different<00:04:10.510> phosphate<00:04:11.110> additives<00:04:11.290> in<00:04:11.890> our

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
different phosphate additives in our

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.190 
different phosphate additives in our
food<00:04:12.250> chain<00:04:12.520> found<00:04:13.360> that<00:04:13.510> phosphates<00:04:13.959> could

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
food chain found that phosphates could

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.840 
food chain found that phosphates could
lead<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.410> dietary<00:04:14.920> imbalances<00:04:15.070> including

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
lead to dietary imbalances including

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.520 
lead to dietary imbalances including
osteoporosis<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:16.780> know<00:04:16.870> long-term

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
osteoporosis you know long-term

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.560 
osteoporosis you know long-term
consumption<00:04:17.920> consumption<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.940> that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
consumption consumption and that

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.510 
consumption consumption and that
typically<00:04:19.840> from<00:04:20.290> meat<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:20.800> processed<00:04:21.010> foods

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
typically from meat and processed foods

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.550 
typically from meat and processed foods
so<00:04:22.060> those<00:04:22.360> are<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.540> three<00:04:22.870> main<00:04:23.110> ingredients

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
so those are the three main ingredients

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.980 
so those are the three main ingredients
we<00:04:23.620> looked<00:04:23.800> at<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:23.980> TBHQ<00:04:24.550> sodium<00:04:25.510> acid<00:04:25.810> para

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
we looked at a TBHQ sodium acid para

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.290 
we looked at a TBHQ sodium acid para
phosphate<00:04:26.470> as<00:04:26.650> well<00:04:27.160> as<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.520> hydrogenated

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
phosphate as well as the hydrogenated

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.960 
phosphate as well as the hydrogenated
soybean<00:04:28.510> oil<00:04:28.870> now<00:04:29.350> does<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.100> mean<00:04:30.340> with

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
soybean oil now does that mean with

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.280 
soybean oil now does that mean with
McDonald's<00:04:31.540> or<00:04:31.690> chicken<00:04:31.960> nuggets<00:04:31.990> as

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
McDonald's or chicken nuggets as

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.550 
McDonald's or chicken nuggets as
cancerous<00:04:32.650> no<00:04:33.430> but<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.540> be<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.810> judge<00:04:35.050> right

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
cancerous no but you be the judge right

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.200 
cancerous no but you be the judge right
some<00:04:36.130> of<00:04:36.220> those<00:04:36.340> things<00:04:36.520> don't<00:04:36.850> sound<00:04:37.150> too

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
some of those things don't sound too

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.820 
some of those things don't sound too
good<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.570> me<00:04:37.660> we<00:04:37.870> know<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.230> negative<00:04:38.560> effects

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
good to me we know the negative effects

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.710 
good to me we know the negative effects
of<00:04:38.920> hydrogenated<00:04:39.580> oils<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:39.940> we<00:04:40.330> know<00:04:40.510> that

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
of hydrogenated oils and we know that

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.740 
of hydrogenated oils and we know that
generally<00:04:41.650> speaking<00:04:42.060> it's<00:04:43.060> okay<00:04:43.480> to<00:04:43.540> buy

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
generally speaking it's okay to buy

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.350 
generally speaking it's okay to buy
cheap<00:04:44.140> things<00:04:44.500> but<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.730> one<00:04:45.940> thing<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.240> would

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
cheap things but the one thing I would

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.540 
cheap things but the one thing I would
never<00:04:46.540> buy<00:04:46.750> cheap<00:04:47.080> is<00:04:47.290> food<00:04:47.590> because<00:04:48.310> again

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
never buy cheap is food because again

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.850 
never buy cheap is food because again
food<00:04:48.880> quality<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.630> gonna<00:04:50.080> be<00:04:50.200> impacted<00:04:50.620> by<00:04:50.740> its

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
food quality is gonna be impacted by its

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.920 
food quality is gonna be impacted by its
price<00:04:51.130> if<00:04:51.370> it's<00:04:51.490> cheap<00:04:51.760> food<00:04:52.060> by<00:04:52.570> default

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
price if it's cheap food by default

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.910 
price if it's cheap food by default
they're<00:04:53.080> not<00:04:53.170> gonna<00:04:53.290> pay<00:04:53.500> for<00:04:53.740> high<00:04:53.860> quality

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
they're not gonna pay for high quality

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.650 
they're not gonna pay for high quality
ingredients<00:04:54.430> because<00:04:54.970> they<00:04:55.090> can't<00:04:55.300> justify

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
ingredients because they can't justify

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.740 
ingredients because they can't justify
the<00:04:55.840> cost<00:04:56.140> so<00:04:56.830> be<00:04:57.550> very<00:04:57.820> careful<00:04:58.360> especially

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
the cost so be very careful especially

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.050 
the cost so be very careful especially
if<00:04:59.440> you<00:04:59.620> like<00:04:59.890> fast<00:05:00.130> food<00:05:00.310> because<00:05:00.700> chances
