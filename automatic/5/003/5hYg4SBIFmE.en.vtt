out<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.750> plastic<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> plastic<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
out the plastic so that the plastic is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.760 
out the plastic so that the plastic is
you<00:01:48.390> don't<00:01:48.570> want<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> plastic<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:49.619> when

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you don't want the plastic on there when

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.160 
you don't want the plastic on there when
you<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:51.000> clean<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.479> acetone

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you go to clean them with acetone

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.870 
you go to clean them with acetone
because<00:01:52.380> it'll<00:01:52.740> start<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.340> melting<00:01:53.759> away

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
because it'll start like melting away

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.370 
because it'll start like melting away
the<00:01:54.090> plastic<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> already<00:01:55.950> took<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.960> covers

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the plastic so I already took the covers

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.550 
the plastic so I already took the covers
off<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.920> them<00:01:59.070> all<00:01:59.630> my<00:02:00.630> bearings<00:02:01.079> otherwise

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
off of them all my bearings otherwise

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.649 
off of them all my bearings otherwise
this<00:02:01.799> video<00:02:01.979> would<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.240> long

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
this video would be really really long

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.690 
this video would be really really long
so<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.920> next<00:02:05.070> thing<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> want

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
to do is you're going to want to take I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.590 
to do is you're going to want to take I

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
have the little

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.720 
have the little
I'm<00:02:12.170> going<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.410> use<00:02:12.530> my<00:02:12.740> little<00:02:12.980> cleaner<00:02:13.280> thing

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
I'm going to use my little cleaner thing

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.210 
I'm going to use my little cleaner thing
you<00:02:13.970> take<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> lid<00:02:14.540> off<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:15.860> see<00:02:16.040> that

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
you take the lid off and you see that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.480 
you take the lid off and you see that
there's<00:02:17.290> spacers<00:02:20.800> just<00:02:21.800> want<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.130> take<00:02:22.250> this

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
there's spacers just want to take this

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.620 
there's spacers just want to take this
off<00:02:22.760> then<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.630> start<00:02:23.960> loading<00:02:24.320> your<00:02:25.630> bearings

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
off then you start loading your bearings

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.110 
off then you start loading your bearings
on<00:02:26.960> here<00:02:30.130> just<00:02:31.130> put<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> spacer<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.090> between

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
on here just put the spacer in between

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.020 
on here just put the spacer in between
each<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.170> there's<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.670> want<00:02:34.670> there<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.820> be<00:02:34.940> a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
each so there's a want there to be a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.560 
each so there's a want there to be a
space<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.450> between<00:02:35.750> each<00:02:36.820> bearing<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.390> they

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
space in between each bearing so they

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:50.160 
space in between each bearing so they
get<00:02:38.720> cleaned<00:02:39.140> properly

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.580 

then<00:02:50.830> you're<00:02:51.010> going<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.220> take<00:02:52.140> your<00:02:53.140> bottle

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
then you're going to take your bottle

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.540 
then you're going to take your bottle
you're<00:02:53.920> going<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.160> take<00:02:54.480> your<00:02:55.620> acetone<00:02:56.620> I'm

you're going to take your acetone I'm

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:04.800 
you're going to take your acetone I'm
just<00:02:57.700> going<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.910> pour<00:03:03.150> how<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.180> do<00:03:04.330> about<00:03:04.540> an

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
inch and I have liquid in there he goes

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.220 
inch and I have liquid in there he goes
up<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.910> about<00:03:13.090> here<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:15.490> you<00:03:15.640> just<00:03:16.230> put

up to about here and then you just put

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.610 
up to about here and then you just put
your<00:03:17.410> bearings<00:03:18.040> inside<00:03:21.840> just<00:03:22.840> shake<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.320> make

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
your bearings inside just shake it make

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.870 
your bearings inside just shake it make
sure<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:23.950> tight<00:03:24.160> because<00:03:24.489> now<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:26.610> shake<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.820> a

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
sure it's tight because now I shake it a

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.580 
sure it's tight because now I shake it a
little<00:03:27.910> bit<00:03:29.760> open<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.209> kind<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.590> spin

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
little bit open it and I kind of spin

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:54.120 
little bit open it and I kind of spin
them<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.860> little<00:03:33.130> bit<00:03:37.680> again<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:52.739> dump<00:03:53.739> them<00:03:54.010> on

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
them a little bit again and dump them on

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.770 
them a little bit again and dump them on
the<00:03:54.190> towel<00:03:55.769> dry<00:03:56.769> them<00:03:56.950> off<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.160> bit<00:03:57.549> a<00:03:57.850> stone

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
the towel dry them off a bit a stone

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.460 
the towel dry them off a bit a stone
dries<00:03:59.519> pretty<00:04:00.519> fast<00:04:01.019> but<00:04:02.019> you<00:04:02.170> don't<00:04:02.320> want

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
dries pretty fast but you don't want

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.970 
dries pretty fast but you don't want
like<00:04:02.590> excess<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.730> there<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:05.440> kind<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.829> wipe

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
like excess in there I just kind of wipe

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.890 
like excess in there I just kind of wipe
them<00:04:06.250> off

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:29.260 

it's<00:04:14.530> more<00:04:15.010> love

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.409 

and<00:04:30.009> basically<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.460> next<00:04:31.610> thing<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.030> do<00:04:32.180> is

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
and basically the next thing you do is

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.640 
and basically the next thing you do is
you<00:04:32.930> want<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.319> take<00:04:33.800> your<00:04:34.750> bearing<00:04:35.750> lubricant

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
you want to take your bearing lubricant

I<00:04:36.710> know<00:04:36.800> Swiss<00:04:37.190> bones<00:04:37.490> makes<00:04:37.910> one<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.569> is<00:04:38.720> by

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
I know Swiss bones makes one this is by

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.510 
I know Swiss bones makes one this is by
quick<00:04:39.400> Lube<00:04:40.430> there's<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.180> few<00:04:41.389> different<00:04:41.720> ones

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
quick Lube there's a few different ones

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.820 
quick Lube there's a few different ones
and<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:44.750> don't<00:04:44.930> want<00:04:45.080> them<00:04:45.229> to<00:04:45.380> dry<00:04:45.680> out

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
and you don't want them to dry out

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.650 
and you don't want them to dry out
that's<00:04:46.069> important<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.669> keep<00:04:46.880> them<00:04:47.180> well

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
that's important to keep them well

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.330 
that's important to keep them well
lubricated<00:04:48.440> so<00:04:48.590> after<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:48.860> clean<00:04:49.130> them<00:04:49.280> I

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
lubricated so after I clean them I

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.550 
lubricated so after I clean them I
always<00:04:49.520> put<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:50.090> little<00:04:50.690> bit<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:51.020> this<00:04:51.259> so

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
always put a little bit of this so

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.230 
always put a little bit of this so
usually<00:04:51.889> do<00:04:52.099> about<00:04:52.340> two<00:04:53.110> little<00:04:54.789> drops<00:04:55.789> in

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
usually do about two little drops in

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.020 
usually do about two little drops in
each<00:04:56.389> one

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
each one

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:05.740 
each one

like<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:08.600> then<00:05:09.560> I<00:05:09.590> usually<00:05:10.010> look<00:05:10.940> at

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
like that and then I usually look at

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.530 
like that and then I usually look at
make<00:05:11.420> sure<00:05:11.630> that<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.140> coverings<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:14.000> casings

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
make sure that the coverings the casings

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.230 
make sure that the coverings the casings
are<00:05:14.870> clean<00:05:15.260> I<00:05:15.590> wipe<00:05:15.770> them<00:05:15.980> off<00:05:16.100> and<00:05:16.910> then<00:05:17.060> you

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
are clean I wipe them off and then you
