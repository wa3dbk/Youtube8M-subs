00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
things in my team would be addressed

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.600 
things in my team would be addressed
namely<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.080> 131<00:03:31.590> which<00:03:31.950> I'm<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.160> big<00:03:32.370> fan<00:03:32.580> of

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
namely the 131 which I'm a big fan of

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.880 
namely the 131 which I'm a big fan of
because<00:03:32.959> technically<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.500> should<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.769> able

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
because technically you should be able

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.830 
because technically you should be able
to<00:03:35.040> run<00:03:35.220> all<00:03:35.489> offenses<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.209> defenses<00:03:36.269> and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
to run all offenses and defenses and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.930 
to run all offenses and defenses and
find<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.200> right<00:03:37.380> combination<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.220> not<00:03:38.730> have

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
find the right combination and not have

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.520 
find the right combination and not have
the<00:03:39.060> game's<00:03:39.299> mechanics<00:03:39.480> get<00:03:40.049> in<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.200> way<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.350> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
the game's mechanics get in the way of a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.410 
the game's mechanics get in the way of a
sound<00:03:40.769> defense<00:03:41.190> 131<00:03:41.940> shouldn't<00:03:42.329> be

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
sound defense 131 shouldn't be

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.210 
sound defense 131 shouldn't be
considered<00:03:42.900> cheese<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.500> I've<00:03:43.829> railed

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
considered cheese and I've railed

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.460 
considered cheese and I've railed
against<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:44.790> my<00:03:44.940> team<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.390> no<00:03:45.540> avail<00:03:45.660> you

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
against this in my team to no avail you

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.039 
against this in my team to no avail you
know<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.709> my<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:47.040> my<00:03:47.070> videos<00:03:47.870> but<00:03:48.870> they

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
know in my in my videos but they

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.350 
know in my in my videos but they
realized<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.860> that's<00:03:49.890> pretty<00:03:50.220> cool<00:03:50.430> if

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
realized that and that's pretty cool if

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.270 
realized that and that's pretty cool if
131<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.170> unbalanced<00:03:52.739> or<00:03:52.799> an<00:03:52.920> unfair<00:03:53.160> advantage

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
131 is unbalanced or an unfair advantage

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.610 
131 is unbalanced or an unfair advantage
then<00:03:53.700> I'm<00:03:53.820> all<00:03:54.030> for<00:03:54.060> them<00:03:54.570> adjusting<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.230> you

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
then I'm all for them adjusting that you

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.229 
then I'm all for them adjusting that you
just<00:03:55.829> have<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.130> run<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.370> defense<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
just have to run the defense that the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.970 
just have to run the defense that the
offense<00:03:57.690> doesn't<00:03:57.900> expect<00:03:58.320> or<00:03:58.709> run<00:03:58.890> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
offense doesn't expect or run the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.560 
offense doesn't expect or run the
defense<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.370> disrupts<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.910> offense<00:04:00.269> it

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
defense that disrupts the offense it

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.930 
defense that disrupts the offense it
should<00:04:00.840> be<00:04:00.870> any<00:04:01.170> defense<00:04:01.709> not<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.130> one<00:04:02.370> one

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
should be any defense not just one one

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.009 
should be any defense not just one one
shouldn't<00:04:03.180> have<00:04:03.360> an<00:04:03.450> advantage<00:04:03.660> over<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
shouldn't have an advantage over the

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.390 
shouldn't have an advantage over the
other<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.350> was<00:04:04.530> really<00:04:04.739> pleased<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.250> hear

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
the booth it's the same seemed a shame

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.580 
the booth it's the same seemed a shame
to<00:04:25.229> see<00:04:25.530> Steve<00:04:25.770> Kerr<00:04:26.010> go

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
to see Steve Kerr go

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.230 
to see Steve Kerr go
but<00:04:26.889> you<00:04:27.250> know<00:04:27.340> that'll<00:04:27.580> be<00:04:27.699> awesome<00:04:27.850> and

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
but you know that'll be awesome and

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.840 
but you know that'll be awesome and
finally<00:04:28.990> I'm<00:04:29.620> excited<00:04:30.010> about<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.490> defense

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
finally I'm excited about the defense

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.400 
finally I'm excited about the defense
being<00:04:31.120> balanced<00:04:31.540> for<00:04:31.690> my<00:04:31.810> team<00:04:32.020> I'm<00:04:32.169> hoping

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
being balanced for my team I'm hoping

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.320 
being balanced for my team I'm hoping
that<00:04:32.470> they<00:04:32.680> stick<00:04:32.919> with<00:04:33.130> that<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:34.240> know

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
that they stick with that and you know

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.240 
that they stick with that and you know
that<00:04:34.360> 131<00:04:35.050> or<00:04:35.199> any<00:04:35.350> other<00:04:35.530> defense<00:04:35.919> isn't<00:04:36.100> a

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
that 131 or any other defense isn't a

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.500 
that 131 or any other defense isn't a
big<00:04:36.460> advantage<00:04:36.729> they're<00:04:37.180> addressing

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
big advantage they're addressing

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.570 
big advantage they're addressing
