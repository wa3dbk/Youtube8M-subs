00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.660
 road that will guide you throughout the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.279
 coaching 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.619

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.419
 from one step to another by clicking on 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 the triangles just below in a 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:34.530
 cake there are five basic ingredients 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.080
 flour yeast eggs sugar 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.000
 and the butter all the cakes leave 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.750
 an assembly of these five ingredients 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.120
 basic 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.579
 we can of course add some but also 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.680
 remove it but that's the basis 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.469
 the classic of classics is the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.809
 four quarters for that it's easy 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.390
 takes a quarter of an hour a quarter of sugar 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.180
 a quarter of flour a quarter of butter the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.149
 first thing we weigh 3 e what must 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.800
 to make about 180 grams then we weighs 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 the same amount of butter or made do 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.869
 the same amount of sugar and the same 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.539
 amount of flour first thing in 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.360
 a salad bowl we break eyes and then we 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.039
 the sugar mixture with a whip and there the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.050
 mixture must whiten a little what wants 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.970
 to say we integrated air into the dough 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.460
 and it's a good thing to succeed 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.000
 in a bowl the flour is mixed with 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.950
 the yeast 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.450
 it must be done systematically for 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.490
 be sure that the yeast is well 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.770
 spread out and that the round cake 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.280
 evenly in the flour mixture 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.280
 yeast one incorporates the egg mixture and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.100
 sugar mix well and finally add 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.020
 melted butter 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 finally we choose the mold that can be 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.700
 a cake mold a miss cake mold or a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.610
 savarin mold the one with the hole in 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.220
 middle one sleeps the mold even though the anti 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.259
 adhesive and then we add the mixture 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.610
 who is in the salad bowl using a 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.890
 maryse which allows to recover well 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.670
 all the dough for cooking 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.380
 these 45 minutes baked at 180 ° from 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.600
 35 minutes I advise you to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.610
 look at this cake is well golden and a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.899
 little test to see if the cui you 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.820
 plant a knife blade 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.100
 and if it comes out dry is that the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.100
 cake is cooked 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.100
 no 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.390
 for a chocolate cake a share of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.489
 the same recipe but we remove a 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.140
 part of the flour and butter that 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.459
 naturally replaces with chocolate for 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.910
 that you need 3rd 150 g of sugar in 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.050
 powder 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.000
 100 g of butter 100 g of flour 1 sachet 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.950
 yeast and 100 g of chocolate 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.510
 if we like a lot of chocolate we can 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.390
 put more for example me I have 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.390
 put 150 g one mixes the waters and the south 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.300
 flour and yeast then we do 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.300
 melt chocolate with butter 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.410
 we mix everything and cook 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.410
 like a normal cake 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.750
 if we can not decide between a 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.210
 you guys nature and a chocolate cake 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.890
 we can make a marble cake we take 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.720
 the paw of the basic cake that divides 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.180
 in two and then in one of the two 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.940
 containers are added 50 g of chocolate 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:22.180
 melted in a cake mold is deposited 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.280
 half of the dough nature then the dough 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.040
 chocolate and finally the rest of the dough 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:33.670
 nature we cook like a cake 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.290
 normal is 30 minutes at 180 ° the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.430
 chocolate fondant it is by definition 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.200
 less dry 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.239
 so what do we do well 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.630
 withdraw some or all of the 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.520
 flour 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.590
 just be careful if you do not put some 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.420
 any flour the fondant will really 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.080
 very very loud and you will need a 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.080
 spoon for eating 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.250
 Congratulations you are a cake pro 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.930
 now we will go to the decor and 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.060
 for that I will give you some 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.540
 tips simple frosting 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.430
 chocolate 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.079
 it's very simple and will add a 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.840
 touch of treats to your cake 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.879
 for that you do it are 30 g of 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.530
 chocolate 3 tablespoons cream 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.019
 fresh and 10 g of butter 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.000
 this is called a ganache have 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.299
 stirred well and we cover the top of the 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.299
 cake 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.150
 if you are very greedy you can even 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.940
 cut the cake in half and drill it with 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.300
 the even simpler ganache the sugar 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.760
 ice cream or cocoa on a clear cake on 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.320
 covers up earlier with cocoa and on 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.210
 a chocolate cake earlier with some 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.010
 icing sugar because it's the contrast that 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.530
 will do the effect for a dusting 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.330
 regular you put the icing sugar or 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.620
 cocoa in a colander and you 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.210
 tap on the cake 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.270
 last trick to play it big 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:55.370
 pastry chef use a stencil at the moment 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.370
 dusting for example a spoon 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.370
 in conclusion is doing tests if you 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.110
 prefer more crispy cakes 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.460
 it will be necessary to put a little less flour 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.170
 more butter and sugar 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.000
 if you prefer them a little bit more 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.520
 dry you will simply put more than 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.980
 flour and less butter you can 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.830
 also replace the flour with 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.480
 cornstarch master of kirsch rum 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.670
 almond alcohol to give taste 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.040
 or beat the egg whites 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.200
