I'm going to put inset in here so that
you<00:00:55.239> can<00:00:55.359> see<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:56.499> difference<00:00:56.890> on<00:00:57.070> this<00:00:57.309> you

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
you can see the difference on this you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.450 
you can see the difference on this you
can<00:00:58.120> see<00:00:58.359> that<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.750> one<00:00:59.079> on<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.320> left<00:00:59.530> has<00:00:59.949> a

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
can see that the one on the left has a

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.289 
can see that the one on the left has a
taper<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.420> going<00:01:02.260> down<00:01:02.559> from<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.489> top<00:01:03.729> to

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
taper to it going down from the top to

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.520 
taper to it going down from the top to
the<00:01:04.330> bottom<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.259> gets<00:01:05.439> smaller<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.759> on<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the bottom it gets smaller and on the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.190 
the bottom it gets smaller and on the
regular<00:01:08.530> Allen<00:01:09.070> screw<00:01:09.670> here<00:01:09.909> it's<00:01:10.539> straight

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
regular Allen screw here it's straight

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.440 
regular Allen screw here it's straight
threads<00:01:11.530> all<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.799> way<00:01:11.860> through<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.090> can't

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
threads all the way through so you can't

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.219 
threads all the way through so you can't
be<00:01:13.630> taking<00:01:14.049> and<00:01:15.479> screwing<00:01:16.479> this<00:01:16.720> thing<00:01:16.930> all

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
be taking and screwing this thing all

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.169 
be taking and screwing this thing all
the<00:01:17.380> way<00:01:17.470> down<00:01:17.680> because<00:01:18.070> if<00:01:18.220> you<00:01:18.340> do<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.909> runs

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
the way down because if you do that runs

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.639 
the way down because if you do that runs
that<00:01:19.390> for<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.659> next<00:01:19.899> time<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.080> rebuild<00:01:20.560> the

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
that for the next time you rebuild the

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.859 
that for the next time you rebuild the
engine<00:01:21.210> anyway<00:01:22.210> we're<00:01:22.330> gonna<00:01:22.479> show<00:01:22.659> you<00:01:22.720> how

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
engine anyway we're gonna show you how

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:49.170 
engine anyway we're gonna show you how
we<00:01:22.899> repair<00:01:23.770> this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.880 

you<00:01:49.660> start<00:01:49.960> off<00:01:50.080> by<00:01:50.290> doing<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.740> whole

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
you start off by doing the whole

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:16.300 
you start off by doing the whole
oversize

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.800 

you'll<00:02:16.640> be<00:02:16.849> using<00:02:18.340> special

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
you'll be using special

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:33.230 
you'll be using special
cap<00:02:21.410> here

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.850 

now<00:02:33.540> what's<00:02:33.870> interesting<00:02:34.080> about<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.590> is

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
now what's interesting about this is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.750 
now what's interesting about this is
just<00:02:35.600> copiers<00:02:36.600> straight<00:02:37.410> bread

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
just copiers straight bread

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.660 
just copiers straight bread
appearances<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.840> they<00:02:40.989> make<00:02:41.230> actually<00:02:42.129> has

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
appearances that they make actually has

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.809 
appearances that they make actually has
three<00:02:43.330> kids<00:02:43.569> on

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
three kids on

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.000 
three kids on
the<00:02:45.090> inside<00:02:45.510> will<00:02:46.140> actually<00:02:46.530> go<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.799> with<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the inside will actually go in with a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.620 
the inside will actually go in with a
tapered<00:02:47.670> pipe<00:02:48.510> plug<00:02:48.810> he's<00:02:49.469> actually

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
tapered pipe plug he's actually

00:02:50.630 --> 00:03:25.670 
tapered pipe plug he's actually
form<00:02:50.870> these<00:02:51.110> threads<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.800> spin<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.610> bottle

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:35.809 

yeah

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.149 

normally<00:03:36.819> what<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.150> would<00:03:37.180> do<00:03:37.450> with<00:03:37.719> these

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
normally what you would do with these

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:44.000 
normally what you would do with these
inserts<00:03:39.359> is<00:03:40.359> to<00:03:40.719> use<00:03:40.930> a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.339 

a<00:03:44.099> little<00:03:44.610> cutter<00:03:44.939> like<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.239> go<00:03:45.840> down<00:03:46.019> and

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
a little cutter like this go down and

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.360 
a little cutter like this go down and
get<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.560> release<00:03:46.769> down<00:03:47.159> here

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
get a release down here

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.690 
get a release down here
or<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.970> copy<00:03:49.900> answer

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
or the copy answer

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.480 
or the copy answer
since<00:03:52.330> this<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.750> an<00:03:52.870> external<00:03:53.200> application<00:03:53.770> we

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
since this is an external application we

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.160 
since this is an external application we
really<00:03:54.760> don't<00:03:54.880> need<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.270> do<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.630> so<00:03:55.840> I'm<00:03:55.959> not

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
really don't need to do that so I'm not

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.410 
really don't need to do that so I'm not
gonna<00:03:56.380> do<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.680> at<00:03:57.640> least<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:58.060> way<00:03:58.209> hopefully

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
gonna do it at least that way hopefully

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.320 
gonna do it at least that way hopefully
whoever<00:03:58.990> gets<00:03:59.350> this<00:03:59.530> thing<00:03:59.800> next<00:04:00.010> time<00:04:00.330> will

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
whoever gets this thing next time will

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.080 
whoever gets this thing next time will
know<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.569> there<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.410> an<00:04:02.560> insert

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.920 

there's<00:04:05.569> our<00:04:06.520> special<00:04:07.520> tap

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
there's our special tap

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.879 
there's our special tap
I<00:04:09.959> get<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> little<00:04:10.799> bit<00:04:10.980> boiled<00:04:11.400> put<00:04:11.579> on<00:04:11.700> here

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.610 

yes

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.659
