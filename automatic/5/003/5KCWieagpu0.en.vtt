and we're going to put this band into
the<00:01:00.449> reducing<00:01:00.960> dye<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the reducing dye so we're going to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.830 
the reducing dye so we're going to
shrink<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> find<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
shrink it now so that's going to find a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.050 
shrink it now so that's going to find a
hole<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.290> where<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> wedding<00:01:08.250> band<00:01:08.610> just

hole here where the wedding band just

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
hole here where the wedding band just
sits<00:01:09.420> slightly<00:01:09.740> above<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:13.140> actual<00:01:13.290> dye

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
sits slightly above the actual dye

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.219 
sits slightly above the actual dye
itself<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.150> allow<00:01:15.390> us<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.600> compress

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
itself that will allow us to compress

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.270 
itself that will allow us to compress
that<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.500> shall<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.920> spin<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that in and we shall just spin that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.660 
that in and we shall just spin that
round<00:01:22.610> like<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.350> then<00:01:25.350> simply<00:01:25.920> pull

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
round like that and then simply pull

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.090 
round like that and then simply pull
down<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.090> handle

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.899 

push<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.409> into<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.680> dye<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.430> we'll<00:01:35.640> turn<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
push it into the dye and we'll turn it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.140 
push it into the dye and we'll turn it
over<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:37.040> must<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> same<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.729> side<00:01:38.909> just

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
over I must do the same to the side just

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.630 
over I must do the same to the side just
to<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.330> sure<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.250> not<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.400> sized

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
to make sure that it's not be sized

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.380 
to make sure that it's not be sized
evenly<00:01:49.310> then<00:01:50.310> we'll<00:01:50.549> check<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> upon<00:01:51.210> our

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
evenly then we'll check it upon our

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.880 
evenly then we'll check it upon our
triplet<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.950> once<00:01:53.250> you'll<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.590> check

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
triplet and once you'll see and we check

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.080 
triplet and once you'll see and we check
it<00:01:56.039> from<00:01:56.190> both<00:01:56.520> sides<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.880> make<00:02:00.060> sure

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it from both sides as well and make sure

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.850 
it from both sides as well and make sure
that's<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> same<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:01.380> absolutely

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that's the same and that's absolutely

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.770 
that's the same and that's absolutely
spot-on<00:02:07.069> it's<00:02:08.069> now<00:02:08.160> back<00:02:08.369> at<00:02:08.519> our<00:02:08.640> bench<00:02:08.819> just

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
spot-on it's now back at our bench just

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.570 
spot-on it's now back at our bench just
going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.410> an<00:02:11.370> inside<00:02:11.760> buff<00:02:12.030> stick

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
going to get in an inside buff stick

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.970 
going to get in an inside buff stick
just<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.700> gently
