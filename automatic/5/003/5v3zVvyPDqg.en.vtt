he walked there

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.740 
he walked there
out<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.340> Christ<00:02:13.610> there<00:02:13.820> they're<00:02:14.090> liars<00:02:14.390> if

out of Christ there they're liars if

out of Christ there they're liars if
they<00:02:14.810> don't<00:02:14.960> keep<00:02:15.110> his<00:02:15.260> Commandments<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
they don't keep his Commandments so the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.340 
they don't keep his Commandments so the
question<00:02:17.150> then<00:02:17.300> would<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.450> how<00:02:17.780> long<00:02:18.080> between

question then would be how long between

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
non-christian for you know a decade or

non-christian for you know a decade or
two<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.550> then<00:02:34.670> they<00:02:34.790> come<00:02:35.000> back<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:35.420> then

they call that period backsliding that's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.400 
they call that period backsliding that's
problematic<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.720> think<00:02:38.900> if<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:39.050> look<00:02:39.200> at<00:02:39.260> what

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
problematic I think if you look at what

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.960 
problematic I think if you look at what
the<00:02:39.500> New<00:02:39.590> Testament<00:02:39.620> describes<00:02:40.250> we're<00:02:40.790> all

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
the New Testament describes we're all

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.820 
the New Testament describes we're all
going<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.420> stumble<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:41.870> many<00:02:41.900> ways<00:02:42.260> as<00:02:42.530> James

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
going to stumble in many ways as James

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.340 
going to stumble in many ways as James
three<00:02:43.610> says<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.210> we're<00:02:44.420> not<00:02:44.660> going<00:02:44.960> to<00:02:45.080> live

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
three says but we're not going to live

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.650 
three says but we're not going to live
these<00:02:45.500> lives<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:46.040> apostasy<00:02:46.400> for<00:02:47.090> decades<00:02:47.450> at<00:02:47.630> a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
these lives of apostasy for decades at a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.930 
these lives of apostasy for decades at a
time<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.170> would<00:02:48.680> question<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.220> happened<00:02:49.730> in

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
time I would question what happened in

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.120 
time I would question what happened in
that<00:02:50.060> person's<00:02:50.480> life<00:02:50.570> as<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.110> child<00:02:51.920> as<00:02:52.100> a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
that person's life as a child as a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.670 
that person's life as a child as a
teenager<00:02:52.220> was<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.330> genuine<00:02:53.870> conversion<00:02:54.110> if

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
teenager was that genuine conversion if

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.770 
teenager was that genuine conversion if
it<00:02:54.830> was<00:02:55.010> they<00:02:55.250> would<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.580> had<00:02:55.730> an<00:02:56.060> experience

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it was they would have had an experience

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.750 
it was they would have had an experience
that<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.410> think<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.100> commensurate<00:02:58.610> with<00:02:58.700> the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
that I think is is commensurate with the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.340 
that I think is is commensurate with the
New<00:02:58.850> Testament<00:02:58.880> they<00:02:59.720> would<00:02:59.930> come<00:03:00.170> to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
New Testament they would come to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.380 
New Testament they would come to
conviction<00:03:00.920> they<00:03:01.370> would<00:03:01.550> be<00:03:01.670> disciplined<00:03:02.270> by

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
conviction they would be disciplined by

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.240 
conviction they would be disciplined by
the<00:03:02.420> Lord<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:03.080> see<00:03:03.260> they<00:03:03.590> would<00:03:03.770> be<00:03:03.920> brought

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
the Lord to see they would be brought

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.940 
the Lord to see they would be brought
back<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.030> place<00:03:05.270> of<00:03:05.540> walking<00:03:06.530> again<00:03:06.650> with

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
back to the place of walking again with

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.590 
back to the place of walking again with
Christ<00:03:07.250> we<00:03:07.550> can<00:03:07.670> sin<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.090> can<00:03:08.210> send<00:03:08.450> big

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
Christ we can sin we can send big

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.480 
Christ we can sin we can send big
obviously<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.350> we<00:03:09.500> are<00:03:10.040> going<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.370> be

it is and to repent how long does that

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.530 
it is and to repent how long does that
take<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:49.160> can't<00:03:49.340> answer<00:03:49.550> that<00:03:49.730> question<00:03:49.910> but

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
take I can't answer that question but

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.690 
take I can't answer that question but
it's<00:03:50.690> certainly<00:03:50.930> not<00:03:50.990> decades<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.040> years<00:03:52.550> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
it's certainly not decades and years and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.340 
it's certainly not decades and years and
years<00:03:52.880> as<00:03:53.030> you<00:03:53.150> hear<00:03:53.300> people<00:03:53.420> talk<00:03:53.780> about<00:03:53.960> I

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
years as you hear people talk about I

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.510 
years as you hear people talk about I
think<00:03:54.410> there<00:03:54.710> are<00:03:54.800> times<00:03:55.040> when<00:03:55.190> we<00:03:55.280> try<00:03:55.430> to

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
think there are times when we try to

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.840 
think there are times when we try to
fight<00:03:55.790> God<00:03:56.030> for<00:03:56.330> a<00:03:56.360> day<00:03:56.390> or<00:03:56.660> two<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.370> God<00:03:58.370> God

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
fight God for a day or two and God God

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.400 
fight God for a day or two and God God
gets<00:03:59.120> us<00:03:59.330> so<00:03:59.600> then<00:03:59.750> would<00:03:59.840> you<00:03:59.960> say<00:04:00.020> that<00:04:00.290> this

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
gets us so then would you say that this

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.230 
gets us so then would you say that this
question<00:04:00.680> maybe<00:04:00.950> I'm<00:04:01.130> backsliding<00:04:02.000> comes

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
question maybe I'm backsliding comes

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.660 
question maybe I'm backsliding comes

more from people's circumstantial

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.940
