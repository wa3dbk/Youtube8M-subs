00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.590
 this by the thermal judge in March 2013 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.360
 is a remake of the classic mega drive 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.460
 which launched a few years ago when 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.680
 I learned that this game launched me 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.810
 I was really happy because I liked it 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.460
 very old game so I wanted to see the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.949
 what they did with the new look 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.019
 I really was impressed by the graphics 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.390
 they are really very beautiful they are neither 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 realistic but nothing that gets in the way 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.800
 they are realistic yet fanciful 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.320
 so they are always imaginative and well 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.450
 the environments the hands this game 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 were composed of the great kirkhope who 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 It's the same guy who made the boxwood songs. 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.469
 cases I always have dark blood tui e 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 other great games radius then is the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.489
 music is very similar to banjo 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.590
 kazooie ends up getting distracted a little more 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 You do not know any of them so go 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.770
 get hit for you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.000
 this game is very musical the phases in 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.920
 different tracks for what is 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 happening on the screen when the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.850
 begins to collapse something more 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.440
 The music becomes more hectic. 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.920
 when you fall into the water for example 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.780
 music is over the water is not 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 this theme exists in some parts of 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.159
 game reminiscent of fantasy the movie 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.299
 old fantasy even since the music 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.770
 really is one ever of the action sack 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.360
 but if you are one of those longing 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.430
 do you really like the mega drive song 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.659
 you can the options and put the songs 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.369
 mega drive 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.229
 so will play music 15 mega drive in the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.000
 your playstation 3 or computer is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.590
 Where are you playing the photos are? 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.509
 very similar when the classic has the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 same themes a phase of forest to speech 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.439
 of toy and so goes then if you 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.299
 know classic game you already know 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.460
 exactly like that the next phase this 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.259
 take some of the novelty of the game 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 I really mean the story because the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.070
 story is exactly the same as mega 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 drive too so if you already played 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.630
 mega drive you've already received spoiler from 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.610
 yourself but for those who do not know the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.399
 story is the following the witch came and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.130
 kidnapped the mini nÃ© to get the beauty 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.049
 and be beautiful and more powerful with 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.030
 youth beauty of the mini fuck that was a 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.430
 rat is a friend rafaela who is so pretty 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.049
 how foxy is this my classic review 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.820
 b it's cool to do a remake of 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.399
 reviewed story neton is not really the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.929
 strong is that the strong is the gameplay they 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.710
 really improved the mega 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.990
 drive running through very slow 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.730
 and until the lungs were very slow 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.590
 also did not have much precision with his 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.410
 jumps in this game is slightly more 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.320
 but the jumps and movement of the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.420
 minc is much more fluid and needs to have 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.220
 certain passages until the game becomes 3d to 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.690
 camera goes up a little so you can 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.970
 control a link to all directions 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.370
 not only right and left time than the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.320
 game also had a nice touch of 2.5 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.120
 You're not just going to the right game. 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.400
 also turns and this gives a variety 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.310
 nice thing in phases one thing that takes this 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.880
 game itself is the durability of it the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.800
 replay 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.220
 the really very short game I have 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.630
 that 16 world dried world has two phases 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.730
 of a boss is basically the same 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.160
 amount of mega plastic phases 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.200
 drive though I feel here that the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.060
 this version are slightly smaller than the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.920
 the mega drive I think you can be the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.930
 in this game faster than the game 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.210
 mega drive even men occurs because the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.340
 game released on various consoles including 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.920
 cellular phones then maybe the phases had 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.990
 received a downgrade know they had to 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.200
 has decreased in phase size to 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.000
 fit into different media and consoles 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.890
 then you can play the phases and 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.290
 catch secrets you left behind 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.820
 but if you play well you can already 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.100
 catch all the secrets at once 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.990
 Do you get new clothes with secrets? 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.640
 They seem to clothes honorees 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.230
 other games such as armor 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.230
 that read a lot of super nintendo game 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.700
 the image of the word luxury and outfit 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.610
 of course the explorer outfit that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.890
 Remember the Sunday game and theft cap 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.290
 card works like word and castle 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.090
 from the peach of the 64 and 60 mario she that you 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.830
 enter the phases you have chosen but the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.720
 rooms of the castle have states that 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.000
 you were making the team fell killing 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.800
 the bosses the team I'm running against 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.560
 clock is very reminiscent of the crash 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.780
 bandicoot 1 2 and 3 that at the beginning of the phase 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.000
 there is a clock you catch he was 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.250
 so you pass by running in the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.080
 peace and win something that reminds 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.580
 enough up to a speed the run because 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.990
 this game is very practical to do this type 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.880
 thing as the controls are well 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.340
 simple just one button other pure button 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.460
 Attacks you can not maneuver 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.830
 extreme maneuvers and you can 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.600
 Generate this game well open up and enjoy yourself 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.859
 do a speed the run but in my 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.720
 this does not help much in the 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.850
 replay something that is kind of like this 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.310
 game but it does not disturb so much are some 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.470
 customers and pang qing with 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.419
 in it our game even closed one or 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.430
 twice but I believe it 's mine. 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.440
 Guilty, I thought you 're not very well. 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.720
 but do not shout lightly at killing the boss 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.430
 wants to climb on his body to be bugged 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.830
 him or not doing this in the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.230
 routine that even was fun to talk to 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.710
 truth but even with all this this 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.960
 game is very worth it receives malta 8/10 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.580
 if you like 2d platform games 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.139
 even more of mickey is looking for a 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.480
 little fresh air from the modern games 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.639
 nowadays this game is very worthwhile 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.440
 is available on various steam consoles 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.520
 I believe that nowadays it is not 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.590
 more so at the time he launched then 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.600
 Have fun and see how it goes. 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.600
 make a real remake 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.360
 ae 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.290
 now i want your review your opinion 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.790
 his review that the first video 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.800
 a supposed series that I want to try 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.050
 bring a series of reviews on the channel 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.300
 more serious games than the year playing 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.430
 lately both modern and 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.740
 the idea is to make 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.010
 games that did not fit was with games 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.860
 fresh reviews the haters so I 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.930
 would bring a game and vary direct review to 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.030
 point the same service without much joke 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.920
 Or very heavy editing not to 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.690
 stay so complex and spend a lot on 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.740
 time of blood and could spend with 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.960
 video games etc 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.430
 come in then I want these videos to be 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960
 extras on the channel 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.150
 I do not want it to be a video of 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.210
 week or something like that I want him to 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.670
 be an extra video so if you enjoy it or 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.950
 do not like to comment on it because you 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.540
 I do not like it, and you can rest easy. 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.520
 that I will do my best for these 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.820
 videos do not delay the next cold in 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.820
