chance to get one the just a great
overall<00:00:20.520> system<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.300> let's<00:00:21.510> take<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> look

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
overall system on it let's take a look

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.269 
overall system on it let's take a look
at<00:00:22.199> them<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.500> they<00:00:22.650> come<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.920> two<00:00:23.039> styles

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
at them here they come in two styles

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.160 
at them here they come in two styles
they<00:00:23.580> come<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> partially<00:00:24.570> serrated<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
they come in the partially serrated and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.790 
they come in the partially serrated and
the<00:00:25.260> plain<00:00:25.529> edge<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.840> in<00:00:27.840> true<00:00:28.320> Parker

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the plain edge and in true Parker

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.380 
the plain edge and in true Parker
fashion<00:00:29.220> we're<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.460> look<00:00:29.670> at<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> serrated

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
fashion we're gonna look at the serrated

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.680 
fashion we're gonna look at the serrated
one<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.430> made<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.790> USA<00:00:33.210> it's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
one the it's made in the USA it's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.240 
one the it's made in the USA it's
designed<00:00:34.020> by<00:00:34.140> RJ<00:00:34.440> Martin<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.829> has<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> slight

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
designed by RJ Martin it has a slight

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.650 
designed by RJ Martin it has a slight
safety<00:00:35.730> which<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> unique<00:00:36.630> because

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
safety which is kind of unique because

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
safety which is kind of unique because
it<00:00:37.340> horseshoes<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.550> around<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:40.680> firing

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it horseshoes in around the the firing

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.729 
it horseshoes in around the the firing
mechanism<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.210> see<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:43.469> it's

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
mechanism there as you can see so it's

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.700 
mechanism there as you can see so it's
the<00:00:44.809> 6061<00:00:46.969> anodized<00:00:47.969> aluminum<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the 6061 anodized aluminum and if you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.910 
the 6061 anodized aluminum and if you
look<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.370> mean<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.449> supposed<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.680> black

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
look I mean it it's supposed to be black

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.430 
look I mean it it's supposed to be black
but<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.460> also<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> midnight

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
but it also has kind of like a midnight

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.950 
but it also has kind of like a midnight
blue<00:00:55.770> hue<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> inserts<00:00:57.840> are

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
blue hue to it because the inserts are

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.520 
blue hue to it because the inserts are
black<00:00:58.140> as<00:00:58.320> well

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
black as well

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.639 
black as well
and<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.550> there's<00:00:59.699> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.559> contrast<00:01:01.559> here

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and so there's kind of a contrast here

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619 
and so there's kind of a contrast here
if<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.370> light<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> depends<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> lighting

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
if the light it depends on the lighting

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.560 
if the light it depends on the lighting
you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.519> sometimes<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:06.299> what<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you can see and sometimes with what it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359 
you can see and sometimes with what it
shows<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> camera<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:07.890> seeing<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
shows up on the camera I'm not seeing it

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.120 
shows up on the camera I'm not seeing it
either<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.860> depends

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
either but so it just kind of depends

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.940 
either but so it just kind of depends
with<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.520> 3-way<00:01:12.210> reversible<00:01:12.810> clip<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.799> right

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
with it 3-way reversible clip for right

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.499 
with it 3-way reversible clip for right
hand<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.729> right-handed<00:01:15.270> carry

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
hand so you can do right-handed carry

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
hand so you can do right-handed carry
like<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.020> set<00:01:16.170> now<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.350> tip<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.830> tip

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
like what it's set now for tip up tip

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.070 
like what it's set now for tip up tip
down<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.659> also<00:01:18.810> do

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
down and then you can also do

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.440 
down and then you can also do
left-handed<00:01:19.710> tip<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.180> there's<00:01:21.180> too<00:01:21.270> much

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
left-handed tip up there's too much

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
left-handed tip up there's too much
going<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:21.990> over<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> tip<00:01:23.100> down

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
going on over here for a tip down

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
going on over here for a tip down

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
but let's open it up here and take a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.910 
but let's open it up here and take a
look<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> action<00:01:29.720> fires<00:01:30.720> hard<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.680> nice

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
look at the action fires hard it's nice

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
look at the action fires hard it's nice
the<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.610> weight<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.090> 5<00:01:33.299> ounces<00:01:33.689> overall

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the the weight on it's 5 ounces overall

the the weight on it's 5 ounces overall
blade<00:01:34.860> length<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.430> three<00:01:35.670> point

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
blade length is going to be three point

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
blade length is going to be three point
nine<00:01:35.909> inches<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.869> shy<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.380> four<00:01:37.979> inch

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
nine inches so just shy of the four inch

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
nine inches so just shy of the four inch
mark<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.729> there's<00:01:39.450> some<00:01:39.659> jumping<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.229> here

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
mark here there's some jumping up here

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.280 
mark here there's some jumping up here
at<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> top<00:01:41.240> which<00:01:42.240> fits<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.750> perfectly

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
at the top which fits in perfectly

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
at the top which fits in perfectly
