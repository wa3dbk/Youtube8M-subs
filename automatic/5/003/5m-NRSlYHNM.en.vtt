reasons but when we walked at graduation

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.450 
reasons but when we walked at graduation
that<00:01:47.170> was<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.320> special<00:01:47.710> group<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:47.950> guys<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.159> I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
that was a special group of guys that I

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.240 
that was a special group of guys that I
was<00:01:48.640> able<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.900> go<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.290> school<00:01:50.560> with<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.070> and

was able to to go to school with and and

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.429 
was able to to go to school with and and
then<00:01:51.820> even<00:01:52.240> more<00:01:52.450> special<00:01:52.900> than<00:01:53.020> those<00:01:53.200> guys<00:01:53.409> I

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
then even more special than those guys I

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.200
