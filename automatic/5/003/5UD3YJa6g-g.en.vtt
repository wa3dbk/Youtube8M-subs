00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.080
 vegan collection 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.510
 so yes went to Belgium window 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.130
 in total about something from 500 more euros 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.550
 brought this along 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.550
 golden dragon 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.350
 blasts she described it as a paper 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:36.739
 shred a both we come from on paper 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:42.559
 with one hair the two small baskets tot 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:45.289
 I also have many options to have the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.309
 triangle string by jude 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.260
 are 10 than mila tricks to each other we 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.710
 via pakistan 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.319
 like most fantastic per package 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.299
 in three packs we look at 3 pieces with 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.899
 packages 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.899
 itinerant 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.520
 of course the tows still live new 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.469
 password 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:17.539
 blind man this is a small amount 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:21.439
 of 14 threads asuka 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:24.079
 Ron you need something like that on the outside 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.250
 we have the the reason chyna farmer who 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.399
 those pieces anyway 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.310
 I finally had one of 2 times 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.200
 tedsters of small plates and 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.909
 ones and they couldn't do windows like that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.740
 so i have a bigger going back for that 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.130
 the same price 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.880
 and this was 2 euros 10 so was getting it 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.880
 ridiculously cheap 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:49.030
 major cities 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.420
 the string tractors 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:02.320
 are just jumping jacks that are a bit 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.320
 herbal rubber 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.160
 and then have health flares there 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.860
 seemed to have quite a bit of it 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.810
 then we have the chain 60 and night 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.870
 became 62 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 once from paul ritch and or fiber 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.269
 and lieke van tube I have no clue 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.670
 does not make the same song different 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.670
 so that both so much in him 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.769
 probably would be and in a wash 70 80 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.720
 cents more expensive independent we have 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.680
 fountains 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.340
 hour option three times was only 5 euros 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.379
 so it is almost impossible anymore 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.629
 we have the bla bla bla bla bla bla 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.709
 bla bla bla too 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:57.590
 also a fountain quite a bit of pain 600 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.430
 gram we have had last year too 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.310
 highly recommended to have the kanji after 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.299
 twice and edna 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.609
 Normally there are three different ones 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.470
 types of these fountains 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.569
 only yes they have one accident 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.090
 swapped to printed twice the 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.980
 kanji there are highly recommended 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.829
 beautiful fountains 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.859
 would you take money for the trip or hand it 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.859
 twice 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.670
 Come on call it the tryater 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:31.900
 come back fire though have the six pack that 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.250
 his own habit and bombs on one 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.290
 string 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.569
 highly recommended and you can do that in 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.690
 and receipts 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:50.790
 13 euros logical but have free 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:53.520
 received because you 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.580
 and then do not reach the battery and the 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.930
 batteries help but we like 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.050
 first the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.300
 sagita twice 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.100
 500 grams looks a bit like one 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.630
 rocket to launch a cap there it is 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.400
 nice there was a recommendation but only half an hour 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.340
 5 6 euros 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.430
 took that we were so early 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.190
 feeling person of virtual counter cookies 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.970
 so can show where we fantasy 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.420
 kick and their code park 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.890
 plot are both 100 grams 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.750
 this beam shot to these 16 shots 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.400
 we bought this one extra because it is 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.060
 damaged 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:45.060
 we hope that this will just come 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:50.520
 at the pan full of blood palm or exercise 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:54.630
 blue palm palm garden so wypall one 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.370
 series all 16 shots and all 200 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.980
 grams 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.520
 we arrive at the ride mounting three white ones 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.370
 shots 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.690
 I don't know how many grams of course 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.090
 comes new 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.290
 does not really matter 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.480
 and the rest of the pots that interests 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.480
 are all 200 grams 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:21.330
 then start at china 'beauty looked 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:23.310

 we shook the tunnel and looked with 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.020
 15 large we have the 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.860

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.690
 forest

 fine thin debts have the tiger 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.000
 sprite 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.129
 phantom show the eagle time spaces 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.759
 taller 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:40.800
 happie moment 16 shots all looked 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:46.210
 receive 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:53.830
 we do have a bigtree 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:57.430
 I musÃ©e no a space flight 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.180
 five small arrows have the bottle 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.539
 rockets 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:11.710
 from anyway these are special because is 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:14.889
 you put the top you get the poles here 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:18.120
 she may have had me sort of first 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:18.120
 from fountain from sperm 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:30.040
 and then you go the skies together and 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:33.870
 where of course the union be people 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:37.960
 find interesting here 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:40.390
 it is highly recommended though 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.810
 to go get fireworks earlier because me 

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:46.480
 You just get really much more discount 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.240
 I think we put something at 30% each 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.940
 daughter discount or more 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:56.380
 and anyway with some pots because 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:59.800
 that clearance was mostly 50% from that time 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:04.860
 really and really an application 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:08.170
 well and this was the 2012 collection 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.740
 2013 2014 needed 

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:14.670
 this is not all there is more to come 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.670
 then I'll see you next time
