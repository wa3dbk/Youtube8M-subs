00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
it everything's all screwed off ridges

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.340 
it everything's all screwed off ridges
put<00:05:43.370> on<00:05:43.550> all<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.240> vents<00:05:44.600> all<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.870> boots<00:05:45.110> are

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
put on all the vents all the boots are

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.640 
put on all the vents all the boots are
done<00:05:46.780> everything's<00:05:47.780> completed<00:05:48.229> so<00:05:48.500> in<00:05:48.590> a

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
done everything's completed so in a

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.529 
done everything's completed so in a
nutshell<00:05:48.860> in<00:05:49.400> order<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:50.000> figure<00:05:50.210> out<00:05:50.330> how<00:05:50.479> many

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
nutshell in order to figure out how many

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.330 
nutshell in order to figure out how many
how<00:05:51.020> many<00:05:51.050> panels<00:05:51.410> you<00:05:51.620> need<00:05:51.740> for<00:05:51.889> a<00:05:51.919> job<00:05:52.130> like

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
how many panels you need for a job like

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.100 
how many panels you need for a job like
this<00:05:52.400> measure<00:05:53.210> it<00:05:53.389> from<00:05:53.479> the<00:05:53.570> bottom<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.080> the

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
this measure it from the bottom to the

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.740 
this measure it from the bottom to the
top<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:54.700> then<00:05:55.700> since<00:05:55.940> these<00:05:56.150> kind<00:05:56.389> of<00:05:56.450> panels

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
top and then since these kind of panels

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.120 
top and then since these kind of panels
are<00:05:56.900> three<00:05:57.110> foot<00:05:57.320> wide<00:05:57.350> you<00:05:57.650> figure<00:05:57.950> from<00:05:58.039> that

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
are three foot wide you figure from that

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.370 
are three foot wide you figure from that
corner<00:05:58.520> all<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.150> way<00:05:59.389> to<00:05:59.450> that<00:05:59.600> end<00:05:59.870> this<00:06:00.169> was

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
corner all the way to that end this was

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.610 
corner all the way to that end this was
I<00:06:00.979> think<00:06:01.910> it<00:06:02.060> was<00:06:02.180> 69<00:06:02.720> feet<00:06:03.050> so<00:06:03.289> you<00:06:03.380> divide

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
I think it was 69 feet so you divide

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.110 
I think it was 69 feet so you divide
that<00:06:03.830> by<00:06:03.979> three<00:06:04.280> and<00:06:04.430> that's<00:06:04.520> how<00:06:04.729> many<00:06:04.880> panels

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
that by three and that's how many panels

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.120 
that by three and that's how many panels
you'll<00:06:05.419> need<00:06:05.630> and

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
you'll need and

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.600 
you'll need and
over<00:06:07.820> here<00:06:08.030> do<00:06:08.540> the<00:06:08.630> same<00:06:08.870> thing<00:06:09.400> all<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.460> way

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
over here do the same thing all the way

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.610 
over here do the same thing all the way
down<00:06:10.880> to<00:06:11.030> the<00:06:11.150> end<00:06:11.360> and<00:06:11.630> you<00:06:12.260> can<00:06:12.350> save<00:06:12.590> your

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
down to the end and you can save your

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.410 
down to the end and you can save your
little<00:06:12.860> drops<00:06:13.220> and<00:06:13.610> you<00:06:13.670> can<00:06:13.820> use<00:06:13.970> them<00:06:14.150> up<00:06:14.270> on

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
little drops and you can use them up on

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.060 
little drops and you can use them up on
the<00:06:14.480> other<00:06:14.630> side<00:06:14.960> you<00:06:15.350> know<00:06:15.440> offset<00:06:15.920> on<00:06:16.040> the

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
the other side you know offset on the

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.790 
the other side you know offset on the
valleys<00:06:16.550> or<00:06:17.210> you<00:06:17.600> can<00:06:17.750> just<00:06:17.930> you<00:06:18.380> know<00:06:18.410> you<00:06:18.560> can

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
valleys or you can just you know you can

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.680 
valleys or you can just you know you can
go<00:06:18.920> up<00:06:19.160> see<00:06:19.640> how<00:06:19.730> we<00:06:19.880> came<00:06:20.090> in<00:06:20.300> here<00:06:20.390> and<00:06:20.510> cut

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
go up see how we came in here and cut

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.660 
go up see how we came in here and cut
off<00:06:20.810> this<00:06:20.960> valley<00:06:21.260> cut<00:06:22.010> back<00:06:22.160> down<00:06:22.370> you<00:06:22.520> can

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
off this valley cut back down you can

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.550 
off this valley cut back down you can
figure<00:06:22.970> every<00:06:23.300> three<00:06:23.540> foot<00:06:23.780> increments<00:06:24.080> start

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
figure every three foot increments start

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.840 
figure every three foot increments start
from<00:06:24.710> that<00:06:24.830> edge<00:06:25.010> just<00:06:25.040> measure<00:06:25.430> over<00:06:25.700> three

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
from that edge just measure over three

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.690 
from that edge just measure over three
foot<00:06:26.030> increments<00:06:26.320> and<00:06:27.320> then<00:06:27.500> you<00:06:27.650> can<00:06:27.800> pretty

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
foot increments and then you can pretty

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.250 
foot increments and then you can pretty
much<00:06:28.790> figure<00:06:29.150> it<00:06:29.360> out<00:06:29.480> that<00:06:29.510> way<00:06:29.900> and<00:06:31.660> if<00:06:32.660> this

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
much figure it out that way and if this

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.400 
much figure it out that way and if this
porch<00:06:33.950> right<00:06:34.280> here<00:06:34.780> extend<00:06:35.780> it<00:06:35.870> out<00:06:35.990> say<00:06:36.260> it

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
porch right here extend it out say it

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.380 
porch right here extend it out say it
went<00:06:36.620> out<00:06:36.800> and<00:06:37.160> around<00:06:37.490> this<00:06:37.640> deck<00:06:37.910> down<00:06:38.180> here

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
went out and around this deck down here

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.750 
went out and around this deck down here
at<00:06:38.450> the<00:06:38.540> bottom<00:06:39.040> then<00:06:40.040> all<00:06:40.160> you<00:06:40.370> do<00:06:40.520> is<00:06:40.640> you'd

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
at the bottom then all you do is you'd

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.570 
at the bottom then all you do is you'd
figure<00:06:41.060> how<00:06:41.180> many<00:06:41.240> panels<00:06:41.860> you<00:06:42.860> know<00:06:43.010> wide<00:06:43.370> it

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
figure how many panels you know wide it

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.340 
figure how many panels you know wide it
goes<00:06:43.730> that<00:06:43.940> way<00:06:44.150> and<00:06:44.390> then<00:06:44.780> measure<00:06:44.990> from<00:06:45.110> the

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
goes that way and then measure from the

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.590 
goes that way and then measure from the
bottom<00:06:45.590> to<00:06:45.890> the<00:06:45.950> top<00:06:45.980> and<00:06:46.910> just<00:06:47.240> add<00:06:47.390> those

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
bottom to the top and just add those

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.000 
bottom to the top and just add those
couple<00:06:47.990> of<00:06:48.050> panels<00:06:48.230> right<00:06:48.590> there<00:06:48.770> and<00:06:48.890> you

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
couple of panels right there and you

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.890 
couple of panels right there and you
still<00:06:49.490> do<00:06:49.640> this<00:06:49.760> drop<00:06:50.270> thing<00:06:50.540> the<00:06:50.660> same<00:06:50.840> way

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
still do this drop thing the same way

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.160 
still do this drop thing the same way
and<00:06:51.650> I<00:06:51.830> recommend<00:06:52.370> that<00:06:52.490> whenever<00:06:52.760> you're

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
and I recommend that whenever you're

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.300 
and I recommend that whenever you're
measuring<00:06:54.170> for<00:06:54.320> a<00:06:54.350> job<00:06:54.590> like<00:06:54.800> this<00:06:55.040> when<00:06:55.220> you

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
measuring for a job like this when you

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.380 
measuring for a job like this when you
plan<00:06:55.490> on<00:06:55.520> doing<00:06:55.820> it<00:06:55.910> yourself

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
plan on doing it yourself

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.330 
plan on doing it yourself
I<00:06:56.510> would<00:06:57.020> recommend<00:06:57.500> say<00:06:57.740> on<00:06:57.860> the<00:06:57.950> job<00:06:58.160> like

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
I would recommend say on the job like

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.310 
I would recommend say on the job like
this<00:06:58.520> but<00:06:58.760> about<00:06:58.970> two<00:06:59.300> extra<00:06:59.780> panels<00:07:00.200> with<00:07:00.290> the

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
this but about two extra panels with the

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.710 
this but about two extra panels with the
longest<00:07:00.680> ones<00:07:00.920> just<00:07:01.130> in<00:07:01.280> case<00:07:01.520> that<00:07:02.480> way<00:07:02.660> you

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
longest ones just in case that way you

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.240 
longest ones just in case that way you
don't<00:07:02.840> have<00:07:02.960> to<00:07:03.080> worry<00:07:03.290> about<00:07:03.410> stopping<00:07:03.830> you

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
don't have to worry about stopping you

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.440 
don't have to worry about stopping you
know<00:07:04.370> when<00:07:04.550> you<00:07:04.610> get<00:07:04.760> up<00:07:04.850> there<00:07:04.880> to<00:07:05.090> finish<00:07:05.240> the

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
know when you get up there to finish the

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.430 
know when you get up there to finish the
job<00:07:05.630> up<00:07:05.840> you<00:07:05.930> got<00:07:06.080> everything<00:07:06.260> that<00:07:06.410> you<00:07:06.560> need
