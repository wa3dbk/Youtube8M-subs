bottom says selection item is a bucket

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.179 
bottom says selection item is a bucket
of<00:01:03.270> water<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> exact<00:01:04.979> same

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
of water and this is the exact same

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.950 
of water and this is the exact same
thing<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.760> would<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.510> second

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
thing that you would do for a second

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
thing that you would do for a second
tier<00:01:07.080> God<00:01:07.500> which<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.310> give<00:01:08.610> yourself<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.030> gold

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
tier God which is give yourself a gold

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.100 
tier God which is give yourself a gold
block<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.830> bucket<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.220> water<00:01:11.990> bucket<00:01:12.990> on

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
block and a bucket of water bucket on

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
block and a bucket of water bucket on
one<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.380> works<00:01:13.619> bucket<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.189> water<00:01:14.430> ah<00:01:20.060> ok

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
one of this works bucket of water ah ok

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.140 
one of this works bucket of water ah ok
so<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:22.619> put<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.890> down<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.850> click<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
so you put this down and you click it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.219 
so you put this down and you click it
tada<00:01:25.490> now<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> powers<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.540> Oceanus

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
tada now you have the powers of Oceanus

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.179 
tada now you have the powers of Oceanus
and<00:01:29.600> Oceanus<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.810> probably<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> more

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and Oceanus is probably one of the more

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.749 
and Oceanus is probably one of the more
is<00:01:32.900> more<00:01:33.900> combat<00:01:34.380> oriented<00:01:34.799> I'd<00:01:35.310> say<00:01:35.579> than

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
is more combat oriented I'd say than

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.179 
is more combat oriented I'd say than
Poseidon<00:01:36.240> because<00:01:36.840> they're<00:01:37.619> kind<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.920> coming

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
Poseidon because they're kind of coming

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.100 
Poseidon because they're kind of coming
right<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.549> pairs<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.299> oceanis<00:01:39.960> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
right now in pairs so oceanis is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.730 
right now in pairs so oceanis is
matching<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.560> against<00:01:42.229> Poseidon<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.560> like

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
matching up against Poseidon just like

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.039 
matching up against Poseidon just like
Ares<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.460> matched<00:01:44.790> against<00:01:45.180> hyphen<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
Ares is matched against hyphen like that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.039 
Ares is matched against hyphen like that
so<00:01:47.000> passive<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> heals<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.810> long<00:01:48.930> as

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
so passive is that it heals as long as

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.660 
so passive is that it heals as long as
it's<00:01:49.200> raining<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> demonstrate<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's raining and to demonstrate this and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.679 
it's raining and to demonstrate this and
I'm<00:01:50.729> actually<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> use<00:01:51.149> its<00:01:51.390> ultimate

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
I'm actually going to use its ultimate

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.490 
I'm actually going to use its ultimate
which<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.140> make<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> rain<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.570> 250<00:01:55.290> power

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
which is make it rain so for 250 power

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.560 
which is make it rain so for 250 power
and<00:01:56.280> you'll<00:01:56.549> notice<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> got

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and you'll notice that when I got

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.109 
and you'll notice that when I got
Oceanus<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.530> glory<00:01:58.920> was<00:01:59.189> reduced<00:01:59.610> by<00:01:59.729> six

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
Oceanus my glory was reduced by six

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.289 
Oceanus my glory was reduced by six
thousand<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.380> costs<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.759> glory

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
thousand so it actually costs you glory

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
thousand so it actually costs you glory
so<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.110> buying<00:02:04.380> their<00:02:04.710> allegiance

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so you're like buying their allegiance

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.219 
so you're like buying their allegiance
and<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:06.299> don't<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:06.930> I've<00:02:07.049> demonstrated

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and I don't know if I've demonstrated

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
and I don't know if I've demonstrated
before<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:07.920> when<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.099> die<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.819> lose<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
before but when you die you can lose the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.510 
before but when you die you can lose the
Alliance<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.709> your<00:02:10.970> Titans

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
Alliance of one of your Titans

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
so here you can see it'll cost me nine

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.440 
so here you can see it'll cost me nine
thousand<00:02:15.100> glory<00:02:15.310> because<00:02:15.520> i<00:02:15.670> have<00:02:15.790> 100<00:02:16.210> ready

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
thousand glory because i have 100 ready

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.040 
thousand glory because i have 100 ready
to<00:02:17.290> purchase<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.890> next<00:02:18.280> titan<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.900> can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
to purchase the next titan and you can

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.630 
to purchase the next titan and you can
actually<00:02:20.320> have<00:02:20.590> unlimited<00:02:21.130> titans<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:21.580> they

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
actually have unlimited titans but they

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.360 
actually have unlimited titans but they
cost<00:02:21.820> something<00:02:22.030> like<00:02:22.170> 80,000<00:02:23.170> glory<00:02:23.440> towards

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
cost something like 80,000 glory towards

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.130 
cost something like 80,000 glory towards
the<00:02:24.520> end<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:24.910> they're<00:02:25.180> not<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:25.780> easy<00:02:25.960> to

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
the end so they're not really easy to

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.650 
the end so they're not really easy to
come<00:02:26.350> by<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.430> will<00:02:27.700> lose<00:02:27.910> them<00:02:28.180> in

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
come by and you will lose them in

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.090 
come by and you will lose them in
battles<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.320> stuff<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:31.620> will<00:02:32.620> make<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.860> rain

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
battles and stuff so I will make it rain

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.770 
battles and stuff so I will make it rain
make<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.120> rain<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.950> says<00:02:36.190> they're<00:02:37.180> started

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
make it rain and it says they're started

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.430 
make it rain and it says they're started
a<00:02:37.870> rainstorm<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.680> demonstrate<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.660> you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
a rainstorm so to demonstrate that you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.600 
a rainstorm so to demonstrate that you
do<00:02:41.650> heal<00:02:41.980> I'm<00:02:42.220> gonna<00:02:42.430> make<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.670> zom<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:44.610> zombie

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
do heal I'm gonna make a zom a zombie

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.960 
do heal I'm gonna make a zom a zombie
and<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.950> can<00:02:48.100> see<00:02:48.280> even<00:02:48.490> though<00:02:48.820> he's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
and you can see even though he's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.750 
and you can see even though he's
attacking<00:02:49.360> me<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.130> don't<00:02:51.310> know<00:02:51.370> why<00:02:51.520> oh

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
attacking me and I don't know why oh

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.820 
attacking me and I don't know why oh
because<00:02:51.880> I'm<00:02:52.060> wearing<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.330> ton<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.510> armor<00:02:52.900> that

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
because I'm wearing a ton of armor that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.570 
because I'm wearing a ton of armor that
would<00:02:53.980> do<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:54.850> as<00:02:55.180> he<00:02:56.050> hits<00:02:56.290> me<00:02:56.410> you'll<00:02:57.370> see

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
would do it so as he hits me you'll see

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.940 
would do it so as he hits me you'll see
that<00:02:57.790> my<00:02:58.240> damage<00:02:58.570> is<00:02:58.660> going<00:02:58.870> down<00:02:59.080> or<00:02:59.500> my

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
that my damage is going down or my

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.590 
that my damage is going down or my
health<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.340> going<00:03:00.580> down<00:03:00.730> but<00:03:00.940> it's<00:03:01.030> also<00:03:01.180> going

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
health is going down but it's also going

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.990 
health is going down but it's also going
up<00:03:01.870> by<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.110> little<00:03:02.380> bit<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.650> I'm<00:03:03.250> at<00:03:03.430> less<00:03:03.970> than

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
up by a little bit and I'm at less than

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.150 
up by a little bit and I'm at less than
half<00:03:04.240> healthier<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.840> kill<00:03:05.050> it<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.860> can<00:03:05.980> see

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
half healthier I kill it and you can see

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.060 
half healthier I kill it and you can see
that<00:03:06.190> fairly<00:03:06.760> constantly<00:03:07.770> my<00:03:08.770> health<00:03:08.950> is

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
that fairly constantly my health is

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.740 
that fairly constantly my health is
regenerating<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.680> goes<00:03:11.860> up<00:03:12.750> something

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
regenerating and it goes up something

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.500 
regenerating and it goes up something
like<00:03:13.780> half<00:03:14.620> at<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.890> time<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.370> also<00:03:15.910> prometheus

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
like half at a time and also prometheus

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.620 
like half at a time and also prometheus
I<00:03:16.810> changed<00:03:17.620> his<00:03:17.830> passive<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.580> that<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:19.060> no

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
I changed his passive so that it's no

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.890 
I changed his passive so that it's no
longer<00:03:20.610> keeping<00:03:21.610> your<00:03:21.730> inventory<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.660> death

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
longer keeping your inventory on death

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.390 
longer keeping your inventory on death
and<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.170> might<00:03:23.380> change<00:03:23.560> us<00:03:23.740> back<00:03:23.770> when<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.160> bug

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
and I might change us back when I bug

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.880 
and I might change us back when I bug
fix<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.850> but<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.690> was<00:03:25.870> way<00:03:26.080> too<00:03:26.110> glitchy<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.800> it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
fix it but it was way too glitchy and it

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.560 
fix it but it was way too glitchy and it
caused<00:03:27.070> too<00:03:27.250> many<00:03:27.370> conflicts<00:03:27.910> for<00:03:28.270> me<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.420> keep

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
caused too many conflicts for me to keep

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.280 
caused too many conflicts for me to keep
so<00:03:29.459> temporarily<00:03:30.690> Prometheus<00:03:31.690> heels<00:03:31.990> pretty

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
so temporarily Prometheus heels pretty

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.530 
so temporarily Prometheus heels pretty
fast<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:33.280> also<00:03:33.400> matches<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.000> mythology

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
fast so that also matches the mythology

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.120 
fast so that also matches the mythology
you<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:34.930> read<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:35.200> if<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.350> want<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.770> something

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
you can read it if you want to something

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.699 
you can read it if you want to something
like<00:03:36.250> his<00:03:36.730> liver<00:03:37.030> gets<00:03:37.240> eaten<00:03:37.480> every<00:03:37.870> day<00:03:38.020> so

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
like his liver gets eaten every day so

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.830 
like his liver gets eaten every day so
he<00:03:39.010> has<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.220> heal<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.610> every<00:03:40.450> night<00:03:40.630> or

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
he has to heal it every night or

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.500 
he has to heal it every night or
something<00:03:41.020> like<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.760> anyways<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:43.330> get

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
something like that anyways you get

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.160 
something like that anyways you get
double<00:03:43.870> healing<00:03:44.170> power<00:03:44.350> in<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:45.160> rain<00:03:45.340> as

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
double healing power in the rain as

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.080 
double healing power in the rain as
Oceanus<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.320> prometheus<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.760> second

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
Oceanus and prometheus so the second

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.760 
Oceanus and prometheus so the second
ability<00:03:49.240> is<00:03:50.820> one<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:51.880> my<00:03:51.940> favorites<00:03:52.209> also<00:03:52.330> it's

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
ability is one of my favorites also it's

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.650 
ability is one of my favorites also it's
it's<00:03:53.770> basically<00:03:54.250> hand-to-hand<00:03:55.150> combat<00:03:55.540> and

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
it's basically hand-to-hand combat and

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.540 
it's basically hand-to-hand combat and
for<00:03:56.410> this<00:03:56.530> demonstration<00:03:56.770> I'll<00:03:57.310> give<00:03:57.459> myself

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
for this demonstration I'll give myself

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.230 
for this demonstration I'll give myself
a<00:03:57.790> cow<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:59.020> if<00:03:59.320> I<00:03:59.650> right<00:04:00.010> click<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:00.370> cow<00:04:00.580> I'm

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
a cow so if I right click this cow I'm

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.360 
a cow so if I right click this cow I'm
right<00:04:01.540> clicking<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:01.990> can't<00:04:02.170> tell<00:04:02.380> nothing

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
right clicking it you can't tell nothing

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.250 
right clicking it you can't tell nothing
happens<00:04:03.880> but<00:04:04.180> if<00:04:04.390> I<00:04:04.600> do<00:04:04.990> it<00:04:05.080> with<00:04:05.170> my<00:04:05.200> fist<00:04:07.260> what

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
happens but if I do it with my fist what

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.330 
happens but if I do it with my fist what
is<00:04:08.500> going<00:04:08.709> on

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
is going on

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.070 
is going on
you<00:04:11.340> should<00:04:11.550> try<00:04:11.670> over<00:04:11.940> here<00:04:11.970> or<00:04:12.960> maybe

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
you should try over here or maybe

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.810 
you should try over here or maybe
something<00:04:13.380> broke<00:04:15.320> no<00:04:16.320> console<00:04:16.709> errors<00:04:16.980> well

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
something broke no console errors well

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
about about like the damage of an iron

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.870 
about about like the damage of an iron
sword<00:05:06.990> or<00:05:07.200> so<00:05:07.380> maybe<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.890> little<00:05:08.040> less<00:05:08.250> again

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
sword or so maybe a little less again

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.940 
sword or so maybe a little less again
like<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.540> stone<00:05:09.840> sword<00:05:10.080> but<00:05:10.650> it's<00:05:10.770> fairly

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
like a stone sword but it's fairly

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.560 
like a stone sword but it's fairly
consistent<00:05:11.640> and<00:05:11.790> it's<00:05:12.150> pretty<00:05:12.330> good<00:05:12.510> for

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
consistent and it's pretty good for

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.870 
consistent and it's pretty good for
slowing<00:05:12.900> them<00:05:13.110> down<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.440> water<00:05:13.650> has<00:05:13.890> pretty

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
slowing them down the water has pretty

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.780 
slowing them down the water has pretty
good<00:05:15.080> properties<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.260> messing<00:05:16.710> with<00:05:16.830> them<00:05:17.010> so

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
good properties of messing with them so

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.520 
good properties of messing with them so
just<00:05:18.450> don't<00:05:18.540> do<00:05:18.690> this<00:05:18.810> too<00:05:19.050> close<00:05:19.290> to<00:05:19.470> your

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
just don't do this too close to your

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.460 
just don't do this too close to your
redstone<00:05:19.950> stuff<00:05:20.400> because<00:05:20.850> it<00:05:21.000> will<00:05:21.120> mess<00:05:21.300> up

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
redstone stuff because it will mess up

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.800 
redstone stuff because it will mess up
other<00:05:22.470> than<00:05:22.800> that<00:05:22.890> it's<00:05:23.790> a<00:05:24.000> it's<00:05:24.570> a<00:05:24.630> pretty

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
other than that it's a it's a pretty

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.330 
other than that it's a it's a pretty
neat<00:05:25.110> ability<00:05:25.590> especially<00:05:25.740> when<00:05:26.220> you're

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
neat ability especially when you're

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.830 
neat ability especially when you're
caught<00:05:26.460> empty-handed<00:05:26.910> I<00:05:27.240> mean<00:05:27.750> obviously

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
caught empty-handed I mean obviously

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.540 
caught empty-handed I mean obviously
it's<00:05:28.229> if<00:05:28.350> you<00:05:28.440> have<00:05:28.530> a<00:05:28.560> diamond<00:05:28.919> sword<00:05:29.100> or<00:05:29.280> bow

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
it's if you have a diamond sword or bow

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.490 
it's if you have a diamond sword or bow
you'd<00:05:29.820> want<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.060> use<00:05:30.210> that<00:05:30.240> but<00:05:30.750> if<00:05:31.229> someone

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
you'd want to use that but if someone

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.810 
you'd want to use that but if someone
just<00:05:31.620> starts<00:05:31.950> punching<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.400> out<00:05:32.520> of<00:05:32.640> the<00:05:32.700> blue

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
just starts punching you out of the blue

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.490 
just starts punching you out of the blue
and<00:05:32.910> you<00:05:33.150> need<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.360> defend<00:05:33.600> yourself<00:05:33.750> is<00:05:34.140> one

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
and you need to defend yourself is one

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.040 
and you need to defend yourself is one
of<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.710> most<00:05:35.130> damaging<00:05:35.700> ways<00:05:35.850> to<00:05:36.000> do<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.300> so

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
of the most damaging ways to do that so

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.960 
of the most damaging ways to do that so
Oceanus<00:05:37.830> is<00:05:37.950> really<00:05:38.160> good<00:05:38.310> for<00:05:38.430> combat<00:05:38.790> and

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
Oceanus is really good for combat and

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.580 
Oceanus is really good for combat and
his<00:05:39.090> last<00:05:39.270> ability<00:05:39.690> is<00:05:39.750> also<00:05:40.050> pretty<00:05:40.169> combat

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
his last ability is also pretty combat

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.040 
his last ability is also pretty combat
based<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:41.070> it's<00:05:41.190> squid<00:05:41.669> and<00:05:41.900> for<00:05:42.900> this

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050

based and it's squid and for this
demonstration<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.860> will<00:05:43.979> be<00:05:44.220> binding<00:05:44.790> it<00:05:45.440> i'm

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
demonstration I will be binding it i'm

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.909 
demonstration I will be binding it i'm
pretty<00:05:46.620> sure<00:05:46.770> i<00:05:46.860> already<00:05:47.130> showed<00:05:47.400> how<00:05:48.210> to<00:05:48.270> bind

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
pretty sure i already showed how to bind

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.710 
pretty sure i already showed how to bind
skills<00:05:49.919> to<00:05:50.280> an<00:05:50.430> item<00:05:50.790> but<00:05:51.120> i'll<00:05:51.240> do<00:05:51.390> it<00:05:51.479> again

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
skills to an item but i'll do it again

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.150 
skills to an item but i'll do it again
here<00:05:52.350> i'm<00:05:52.500> going<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.710> bind<00:05:52.919> it<00:05:52.979> to<00:05:53.100> this

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
here i'm going to bind it to this

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.529 
here i'm going to bind it to this
repeater<00:05:53.490> so<00:05:53.669> I<00:05:53.729> just<00:05:53.910> all<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.090> have<00:05:54.210> to<00:05:54.300> do<00:05:54.419> is

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
repeater so I just all I have to do is

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:55.640 
repeater so I just all I have to do is
type<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.780> name<00:05:54.930> of<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.080> skill<00:05:55.320> which<00:05:55.500> is

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
type the name of the skill which is

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.540 
type the name of the skill which is

this diode and I can put a cow here for
demonstrations<00:06:03.410> and<00:06:04.410> you'll<00:06:04.560> see<00:06:04.710> that<00:06:04.740> if<00:06:04.950> i

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039
