 six people with alex like it so will be 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 truly a night of a thousand 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.870
 emotions and we will all dance for the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 errors he has undergone is so therefore not 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.860
 we can not speak a little of this 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.379
 collaboration for this single e 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.809
 even a little bit of the piece without a bit 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.420
 I met two numerici federico 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.129
 years ago after the solidarity and from there it is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.710
 immediately born a beautiful mister g 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.840
 have seen florence we have started 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.610
 writing to collaborate has seen that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.430
 it looked like piano in English and from 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.400
 scores 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.590
 and also collaboration with gangs 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.020
 followed the whole we are piece of 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.680
 which will be released in September with the paul lei 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.540
 94 cent areas on the subject of giffoni 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.390
 what do you think of this festival of 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.930
 these very prepared guys are 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.180
 disquieting, I have to say, but it's beautiful 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.240
 and there really is an atmosphere that gives you 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.050
 hope precisely in the young 45 years and 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.270
 does not show them 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.790
 piero a great manager you have 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.380
 clearly understood he saw us nothing 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.850
 also because the only festival in the world 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.070
 of very young boys and the air that is 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.270
 always breathe 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.159
 I invite 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.909
 and you go to my house with these goes like this 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.070
 nice nothing and instead what do you think of 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.590
 this year's motto carpe diem much that 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.189
 followed usually you struggle 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.020
 carpe diem seize the moment I seek 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.659
 always taking the passing trains 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.670
 because if the train passes away and not 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.459
 take are the same 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.849
 there was a single hears what's there 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.950
 in store for future projects this summer has 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.330
 the fact that you run with a hull is that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 my album will be released or in Italian 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.680

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.870
 wait really because the fact is not me 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.659

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.659

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.450
 had liked it very much and therefore everything in 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.470
 Italian so it will be more or less there is a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.299

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.400
 on passion 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:04.340
 we say that I write inspired that to 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.340
 people therefore also to the very young 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.250
