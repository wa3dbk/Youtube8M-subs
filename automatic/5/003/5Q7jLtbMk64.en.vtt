00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
black fleece additive so you're not

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.570 
black fleece additive so you're not
going<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.750> necessarily<00:02:27.900> need<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:29.400> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
going to necessarily need all that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.520 
going to necessarily need all that
carbon<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.330> jimJam<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.230> you're<00:02:31.350> going<00:02:31.470> to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
carbon and jimJam that you're going to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.940 
carbon and jimJam that you're going to
need<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> lot<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.890> other<00:02:32.070> boards<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> strips

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
need a lot of other boards so the strips

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.430 
need a lot of other boards so the strips
down<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.610> bit<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.900> still<00:02:37.140> get<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> lot

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
down just a bit but you still get a lot

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.470 
down just a bit but you still get a lot
