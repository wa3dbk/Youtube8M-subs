when we get to that so first of all

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.569 
when we get to that so first of all
these<00:01:39.659> guys<00:01:39.720> were<00:01:40.020> explained<00:01:40.350> was<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.159> basics

of the game when she says she doesn't we

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.899 
of the game when she says she doesn't we
don't<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> explain<00:01:45.479> everything<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
don't have to explain everything and so

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.260 
don't have to explain everything and so
we'll<00:01:48.360> figure<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.899> mostly<00:01:49.140> for<00:01:49.229> ourself

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
we'll figure out that mostly for ourself

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.690 
we'll figure out that mostly for ourself
what<00:01:51.270> makes<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.630> game<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:52.290> cool<00:01:52.700> as

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
what makes this game really cool as

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.130 
what makes this game really cool as
you'll<00:01:53.909> see<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.390> we're<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> actually

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you'll see here we're about to actually

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.050 
you'll see here we're about to actually
start<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:55.950> control<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.579> how<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.850> get

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
start to get into control is how you get

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.399 
start to get into control is how you get
the<00:01:57.149> monsters<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.079> police-station

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the monsters and the police-station

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.080 
the monsters and the police-station
version<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.130> awesome<00:01:59.610> because<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> could

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
version it was awesome because you could

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
version it was awesome because you could
you<00:02:00.420> take<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.840> CD<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> PlayStation

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you take the CD out of the PlayStation

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.749 
you take the CD out of the PlayStation
and<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.149> music<00:02:03.810> CD<00:02:04.020> into<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.799> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and you put a music CD into it and that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.999 
and you put a music CD into it and that
CD<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.509> generate<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> monster<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
CD would generate a monster and so you

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
CD would generate a monster and so you
would<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.280> through<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.729> your<00:02:08.910> hundreds<00:02:09.450> of

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
would go through all your hundreds of

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.150 
would go through all your hundreds of
music<00:02:09.869> CDs<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.470> try<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
music CDs and try to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.980 
music CDs and try to
a<00:02:11.190> monster<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:12.030> liked<00:02:12.300> since

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
a monster that you really liked since

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.030 
a monster that you really liked since
you<00:02:13.110> can't<00:02:13.290> do<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.500> with<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.710> gameboy

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
you can't do that with the gameboy

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.520 
you can't do that with the gameboy
advance<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.550> there<00:02:14.820> way<00:02:14.970> around<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
advance so there way around that is to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.250 
advance so there way around that is to
use<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:17.100> letter<00:02:17.730> system<00:02:18.240> when<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.870> start<00:02:19.140> out

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
use a letter system when you start out

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.810 
use a letter system when you start out
you<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.530> only<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.040> four<00:02:20.280> letters<00:02:20.640> but

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
you can only put in four letters but

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.080 
you can only put in four letters but
just<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.630> make<00:02:21.870> words<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.740> whatever<00:02:23.460> put<00:02:23.970> in

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
just just make words or whatever put in

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.720 
just just make words or whatever put in
a<00:02:24.180> bunch<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.450> weird<00:02:24.810> random<00:02:25.260> things<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.860> just

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
a bunch of weird random things and just

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.490 
a bunch of weird random things and just
try<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:26.970> make<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> monster<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.840> you're<00:02:28.170> going

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
try to make a monster that you're going

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.150 
try to make a monster that you're going
to<00:02:28.530> enjoy<00:02:29.040> using<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:31.070> preferably<00:02:32.070> I

to enjoy using you think preferably I

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.560 
to enjoy using you think preferably I
would<00:02:32.220> suggest<00:02:32.520> starting<00:02:32.730> with<00:02:33.000> something

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
would suggest starting with something

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.440 
would suggest starting with something
that's<00:02:33.840> got<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> lot<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.320> power<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.190> power<00:02:35.820> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
that's got a lot of power and power and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.730 
that's got a lot of power and power and
accuracy<00:02:37.110> or<00:02:37.620> power<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.280> defense<00:02:39.530> you'll<00:02:40.530> see

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
accuracy or power and defense you'll see

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.680 
accuracy or power and defense you'll see
here<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.610> didn't<00:02:41.970> think<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.570> anything

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
here I really didn't think of anything

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.600 
here I really didn't think of anything
else<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.080> also<00:02:43.680> forgot<00:02:43.950> how<00:02:44.040> many<00:02:44.190> letters<00:02:44.370> I

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
else I also forgot how many letters I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.550 
else I also forgot how many letters I
could<00:02:44.760> put<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.090> even<00:02:45.630> though<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.810> he<00:02:46.140> tells<00:02:46.380> you

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
could put in even though we he tells you

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.050 
could put in even though we he tells you
so<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.100> just<00:02:47.370> hit<00:02:47.640> G<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.600> bunch<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.170> times<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
so I just hit G a bunch of times and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.750 
so I just hit G a bunch of times and
ended<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:53.100> start<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.550> generate

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
ended it and then we start to generate

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.080 
ended it and then we start to generate
our<00:02:54.000> monster<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:55.140> goes<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.560> little

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
our monster it goes to this little

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
our monster it goes to this little

as<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.510> case<00:03:15.630> with<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:16.020> guy<00:03:17.120> that's<00:03:18.120> for

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
as is the case with this guy that's for

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.180 
as is the case with this guy that's for
a<00:03:18.360> name<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:18.900> stuck<00:03:19.470> with<00:03:19.500> regular<00:03:19.980> rock

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
a name I just stuck with regular rock

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.400 
a name I just stuck with regular rock
it's<00:03:20.580> not<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.150> my<00:03:21.420> Pokemon<00:03:21.870> LP<00:03:22.200> were

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
it's not like the my Pokemon LP were

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.310 
it's not like the my Pokemon LP were
just<00:03:23.010> giving<00:03:23.490> them<00:03:23.580> random<00:03:24.120> names<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:25.140> names

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
just giving them random names the names

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.570 
just giving them random names the names
are<00:03:25.470> already<00:03:25.560> strange<00:03:25.860> enough<00:03:26.040> here<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.280> figure

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
are already strange enough here I figure

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.650 
are already strange enough here I figure
so<00:03:27.420> we<00:03:27.450> got<00:03:27.780> our<00:03:27.930> starting<00:03:28.350> monster<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.660> now

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
so we got our starting monster and now

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.540 
so we got our starting monster and now
we<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.530> go<00:03:31.860> back<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.459> our<00:03:32.490> ranch<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:34.160> then<00:03:35.160> we

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
we can go back to our ranch and then we

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.940 
we can go back to our ranch and then we
can<00:03:35.700> finally<00:03:36.060> start<00:03:36.120> training<00:03:36.690> them<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.830> way

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
can finally start training them the way

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.560 
can finally start training them the way
that<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.280> training<00:03:38.640> works<00:03:38.820> is<00:03:39.150> as<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.450> can

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
that the training works is as you can

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.060 
that the training works is as you can
see<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.930> top<00:03:40.080> left<00:03:40.350> there<00:03:40.500> at<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.770> year

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
see in the top left there at the year

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.580 
see in the top left there at the year
the<00:03:41.430> air<00:03:41.489> starts<00:03:41.790> at<00:03:41.910> one<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.600> years<00:03:42.750> one<00:03:43.020> you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
the air starts at one the years one you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.130 
the air starts at one the years one you
have<00:03:43.680> four<00:03:44.160> weeks<00:03:44.430> in<00:03:44.670> each<00:03:44.820> month<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.480> it

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
have four weeks in each month and it

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.710 
have four weeks in each month and it
takes<00:03:46.320> one<00:03:46.560> week<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.950> train<00:03:47.160> them<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:48.540> how

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
takes one week to train them this how

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.150 
takes one week to train them this how
you<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:48.930> train<00:03:49.110> them<00:03:49.230> as<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.770> here

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
you can train them as you can see here

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.560 
you can train them as you can see here
you<00:03:50.910> can<00:03:50.940> increase<00:03:51.980> some<00:03:52.980> of<00:03:53.070> their<00:03:53.190> stats<00:03:53.570> but

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
you can increase some of their stats but

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.300 
you can increase some of their stats but
massively<00:03:54.989> while<00:03:55.380> decreasing<00:03:55.590> some<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.190> them

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
massively while decreasing some of them

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.390 
massively while decreasing some of them
by<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.459> little<00:03:56.730> bit<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:57.989> rest<00:03:58.320> which<00:03:59.130> will

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
by a little bit you can rest which will

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.970 
by a little bit you can rest which will
ensure<00:03:59.580> must<00:03:59.940> arrest<00:04:00.560> what<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.650> need<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.860> do

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
ensure must arrest what you need to do

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.040 
ensure must arrest what you need to do
every<00:04:02.250> few<00:04:02.730> weeks<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.810> doesn't<00:04:03.989> get

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
every few weeks so that it doesn't get

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.110 
every few weeks so that it doesn't get
burnt<00:04:04.290> out<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.650> special<00:04:05.550> is<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.730> place<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.000> can

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
burnt out and special is a place you can

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.370 
burnt out and special is a place you can
go<00:04:06.209> when<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.420> start<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.690> accumulate<00:04:06.959> some

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
go when you start to accumulate some

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.780 
go when you start to accumulate some
money<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.880> you'll<00:04:08.880> be<00:04:09.060> able<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:10.670> have<00:04:11.670> them

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
money and you'll be able to have them

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.850 
money and you'll be able to have them
trained<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.360> specific<00:04:12.870> attribute<00:04:13.709> like

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
trained in the specific attribute like

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.010 
trained in the specific attribute like
strength<00:04:14.220> or<00:04:14.430> speed<00:04:14.670> or<00:04:14.880> accuracy<00:04:15.450> we'll<00:04:15.900> go

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
strength or speed or accuracy we'll go

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.539 
strength or speed or accuracy we'll go
through<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.320> different<00:04:16.680> attributes<00:04:17.130> once

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
through that different attributes once

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.490 
through that different attributes once
we<00:04:17.669> get<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.940> them<00:04:18.140> right<00:04:19.140> now<00:04:19.289> I'm<00:04:19.410> just

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
we get to them right now I'm just

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.349 
we get to them right now I'm just
showing<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.770> guys<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.280> basic<00:04:20.700> menus<00:04:21.060> of

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
showing you guys the basic menus of

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.290 
showing you guys the basic menus of
got<00:04:22.019> our<00:04:22.169> first<00:04:22.289> monster<00:04:22.740> going<00:04:23.060> it's<00:04:24.060> pretty

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
got our first monster going it's pretty

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.089 
got our first monster going it's pretty
expensive<00:04:24.449> to<00:04:24.810> do<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.169> 3,000<00:04:25.710> gold<00:04:25.800> you

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
expensive to do this is 3,000 gold you

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.189 
expensive to do this is 3,000 gold you
start<00:04:26.340> with<00:04:26.490> 5,000<00:04:27.419> gold<00:04:27.569> so<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.810> don't<00:04:28.080> want

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
start with 5,000 gold so you don't want

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.659 
start with 5,000 gold so you don't want
to<00:04:28.259> do<00:04:28.319> this<00:04:28.439> rock<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.740> bat<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.129> here's<00:04:29.550> a

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
to do this rock the bat and here's a

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.300 
to do this rock the bat and here's a
trainee<00:04:29.909> here's<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.330> battle<00:04:30.629> schedule<00:04:31.020> rather

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
trainee here's a battle schedule rather

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.619 
trainee here's a battle schedule rather
this<00:04:32.310> shows<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.639> when<00:04:32.879> the<00:04:32.909> tournaments<00:04:33.569> are

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
this shows you when the tournaments are

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.719 
this shows you when the tournaments are
held<00:04:33.659> or<00:04:34.110> start<00:04:34.439> off<00:04:34.530> in<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> d<00:04:34.860> rank<00:04:35.159> and<00:04:35.370> then

held or start off in the d rank and then
when<00:04:35.879> you<00:04:35.939> beat<00:04:36.180> this<00:04:36.360> one<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:37.069> GIMA<00:04:38.069> official

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
when you beat this one the GIMA official

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.629 
when you beat this one the GIMA official
d<00:04:39.030> rank<00:04:39.270> then<00:04:39.479> you<00:04:39.539> move<00:04:39.689> up<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.050> C<00:04:40.229> rank<00:04:40.639> we

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
d rank then you move up to the C rank we

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.520 
d rank then you move up to the C rank we
also<00:04:41.759> see<00:04:41.969> loyalty<00:04:42.419> down<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:42.810> bottom<00:04:43.139> that

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
also see loyalty down the bottom that

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.379 
also see loyalty down the bottom that
that<00:04:43.919> goes<00:04:44.069> up<00:04:44.189> pretty<00:04:44.310> fast<00:04:44.610> it's<00:04:44.939> not<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.120> big

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
that goes up pretty fast it's not a big

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.640 
that goes up pretty fast it's not a big
deal<00:04:45.539> but<00:04:45.750> your<00:04:45.930> monster<00:04:46.289> will<00:04:46.439> kind<00:04:46.590> of

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
deal but your monster will kind of

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.469 
deal but your monster will kind of
falter<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.129> combat<00:04:47.490> if<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.729> loyalty<00:04:48.180> is<00:04:48.300> too

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
falter and combat if the loyalty is too

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.779 
falter and combat if the loyalty is too
low<00:04:48.830> as<00:04:49.830> you'll<00:04:50.099> see<00:04:50.219> when<00:04:50.310> we<00:04:50.430> actually<00:04:50.550> get

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
low as you'll see when we actually get

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.830 
low as you'll see when we actually get
into<00:04:50.849> a<00:04:51.000> real<00:04:51.180> battle<00:04:51.479> and<00:04:52.729> that<00:04:53.729> is<00:04:54.330> pretty

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
into a real battle and that is pretty

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.379 
into a real battle and that is pretty
much<00:04:55.110> going<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.860> do<00:04:56.490> it<00:04:56.639> for<00:04:56.789> that<00:04:56.879> look<00:04:57.120> again

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
much going to do it for that look again

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.020 
much going to do it for that look again
at<00:04:57.539> the<00:04:57.659> training<00:04:58.250> there's<00:04:59.250> accuracy<00:04:59.879> if

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
at the training there's accuracy if

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.080 
at the training there's accuracy if
there's<00:05:00.210> power<00:05:00.650> accuracy<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.340> chance<00:05:02.940> of

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
there's power accuracy is the chance of

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.939 
there's power accuracy is the chance of
course<00:05:03.270> if<00:05:03.419> your<00:05:03.539> move<00:05:03.690> hitting<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.139> guess

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
course if your move hitting I guess

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.219 
course if your move hitting I guess
we're<00:05:05.129> going<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.370> do<00:05:06.330> power<00:05:06.599> training<00:05:06.960> real

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
we're going to do power training real

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.209 
we're going to do power training real
quick<00:05:07.379> there<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:07.650> this<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:07.770> how<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:07.919> training

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219 
quick there and this is how a training

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.790 
quick there and this is how a training
regimen<00:05:08.729> goes<00:05:09.199> yeah<00:05:10.199> he<00:05:10.409> does<00:05:10.530> something<00:05:10.650> like

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
regimen goes yeah he does something like

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.649 
regimen goes yeah he does something like
this<00:05:11.009> you<00:05:11.490> can<00:05:11.580> just<00:05:11.759> hit<00:05:11.819> a<00:05:11.969> button<00:05:12.210> skip

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
this you can just hit a button skip

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:14.779 
this you can just hit a button skip
through<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.930> there<00:05:13.409> was<00:05:13.529> a<00:05:13.560> success<00:05:14.009> the<00:05:14.610> power

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
through it there was a success the power

through it there was a success the power
goes<00:05:15.029> up<00:05:15.150> by<00:05:15.300> four<00:05:15.569> as<00:05:15.870> your<00:05:15.990> monster<00:05:16.289> gets

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
goes up by four as your monster gets

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:18.529 
goes up by four as your monster gets
older<00:05:16.800> if<00:05:16.919> you'll<00:05:17.069> start<00:05:17.279> to<00:05:17.400> get<00:05:17.909> more<00:05:18.300> power
