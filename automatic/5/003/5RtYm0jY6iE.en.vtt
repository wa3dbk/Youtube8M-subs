00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:16.889
 but this fair bet is straight 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.889
 Julian in the middle 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.880
 you did not come in the middle another one 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.540
 Julian then and use your reindeer 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.950
 outside there in the name the curve to the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.230
 punching out to take well there that 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.739
 that's all about this obstacle 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.570
 says if you look at your obstacles already 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.050
 look at the good use your reindeer 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 outside left reindeer rat the middle 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.019
 wimille 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.019
 it's less serious 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.429
 think well his treatons jump in the middle 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.359
 the fault is nothing that will make it 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.359
 attentive is better 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.400
 no 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.460
 you prepare Julian by left hand 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.460
 on the vertical you come on the vertical 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.250
 at it is read 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.640
 come a little further when we 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.990
 gallo the form is well in sync with 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.830
 more rhythm is take your gallo 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 look at any obstacle 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.570
 ah the brave warn 9.5 is going 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.360
 here 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.500
 think of your rhythm 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.900
 you did not have the good gallop there when he 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.530
 got out of your turn so if the place 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.480
 is not good 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 the horse does not have any other option 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.840
 than to stop so think when you go 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.290
 go back in your course take a good 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.600
 gallop 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.730
 you want to go down to 2 minutes in it's going 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.260
 walking upstairs not quietly and 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.260
 revisit for course in your head there 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.430
 I am the instructions that I received 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.230
 data since it reminds me and me 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.090
 repeat stone durand just before 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.430
 to go on the track he tells me gallop the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.780
 gallop the track the gallop the rest you do not have 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.580
 not in time to even occupy 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.260
 strides he also explains to me that he 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.670
 must go around the auxerre have 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.670
 to attack the sason 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.390
 he forgot his volt already 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.780
 he's off to a gallop - it's already 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 a good thing so installed in a 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:41.200
 bungalow that's good then 3,5 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.200
 steamship rage
