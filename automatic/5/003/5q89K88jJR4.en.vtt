00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.690
 great jobs as they are 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.769
 the other day I was in a restaurant and 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.840
 suddenly the subject that was in the 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.119
 next table began to drown 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.610
 because it seemed like a good idea to swallow 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.770
 an olive as expected 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.560
 I quickly started thinking that the face 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.390
 red that the subject had did not look 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.550
 nothing when the cartoons put 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.610
 blue the faces of the characters that 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.699
 they are suffocating but if a character 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.220
 of cartoons already have blue skin 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.620
 let's say a smurf of what color 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.090
 would you say if you were speaking clearly 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.789
 that the screams of people do not 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.550
 they gave a lot of time to think about that and 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.969
 I decided that I had to do something like that 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.019
 I decided to investigate further if orcas 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.730
 a smurf whose color is 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.820
 start this question are that a 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.949
 Smurf needs oxygen to live what 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.170
 which is a quite valid assumption 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.660
 whereas the Smurfs are afraid of 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.840
 drowned as much as any 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.460
 creature that needs air the most 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.340
 of the creatures on this earth 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.039
 we need oxygen to live the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.500
 brain that only 2% of the mass 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.509
 body of a human needs more or 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.149
 minus 20 percent of the oxygen that 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.399
 we breathe if the brain did not receive 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.310
 oxygen for more than three minutes the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.229
 brain cells will begin to die and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.870
 only ten minutes are enough for the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.620
 damage to the brain is irreversible 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.970
 but because we need oxygen 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.350
 because we can not consume another degree 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.450
 let's say carbon dioxide 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.600
 the short answer is because oxygen 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.670
 He loves to steal electrons 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.590
 electrons and oxygen are very parts 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.159
 important in the generation process 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.530
 of energy from the body the energy that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.509
 our body consumes comes in the form of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.750
 a molecule named triphosphate of 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.240
 adenosine the cells of our body 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.850
 they work very hard to convert the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.860
 glucose in this molecule and one of the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.200
 waste products are the electrons 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.600
 that if they are not removed from the line of 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.900
 production get stuck and you can not 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.010
 generate more adenosine triphosphate 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.019
 leaving the body cells without 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.140
 enough energy to follow 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.209
 running oxygen is responsible 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.490
 to collect the electrons for christie 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.820
 gas watching the production 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.340
 but let's go back with our blue friends 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.200
 if the smurfs require oxygen they should 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.110
 of having a molecule that carries the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.060
 oxygen in your bloodstream in 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.820
 vertebrates this molecule belongs to the group 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.330
 heme with an iron atom at its center 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.850
 the hemoglobin another pretty test 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.670
 forceful if the Smurfs and the tongue 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.430
 red and in mammals this is caused 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.040
 by hemoglobin red cells 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.380
 white cells and platelets are the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.830
 blood components and they are 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.540
 floating in the plasma that is crystalline 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.760
 but at the highest volume they represent 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.820
 the red cells in the blood is the one 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.250
 it gives the red coloration that we know 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.590
 blood rich in oxygen from a red 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.990
 very bright while the blood 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.590
 out of tune is a darker color of 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.629
 red with coffee tones 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.260
 Your wrist's ways may seem 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.120
 blue but the color is also red 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.459
 blue only is the result of light 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.500
 through your skin and to all 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.200
 vertebrates share the red of the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.410
 blood do creation actually if 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.629
 exists but is a little further away from 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.310
 the mer list for example the crabs 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.739
 horseshoe do not have hemoglobin in the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.629
 blood reading so pro molecule 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.140
 based on copper to transport the 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.640
 oxygen in your blood the emotion mine 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.860
 although the Smurfs do not seem to be 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.260
 mammals if we can say that they are 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.230
 vertebrates so this is a good 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.530
 track about the color of his blood but 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.299
 if they need a stronger test 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.120
 there is a chapter where Smurfette 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.560
 he made a wish to mother nature 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.120
 but for the desire to have an effect 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.760
 you have to prick your finger to 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.230
 offer blood to change and although this 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.780
 show that maybe the Smurfs 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.639
 they did a little satanic too 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.989
 shows that your blood is effectively 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.349
 red 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.410
 now when a vertebrate with skin without 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:31.169
 no type of hair is suffocated 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.150
 let's say a human when not receiving oxygen 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.280
 enough the heart will try to 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.889
 compensate for the situation by pumping blood 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.440
 faster to try to oxygenate the 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.720
 brain is why their faces are 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.669
 they put red because the capillaries in the 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.790
 surface of your skin dilate and the 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.250
 Blood is concentrated there 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.770
 assuming that the same thing happens to the 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.950
 Smurfs with the pigment combination 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:00.100
 on his skin and blood red 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.100
 their faces would turn this color 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.140
 so with the hexadecimal code already 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.690
 they can go ask for color paint and 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.090
 tube suffocated and I hope that with this 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.689
 answer stop orgaz Smurfs even 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.119
 if they do it in the name of science 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:21.599
 they are peaceful creatures we should 

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:23.249
 mark the Smurfs is illegal the 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.409
 discarded with this video wants to start 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:27.479
 to be born and where he solves questions of 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.879
 this universe as well as universes 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.979
 fictitious so if you have any 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.709
 ask me do not hesitate to leave me 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.029
 in the comments box even from 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:39.269
 investigate until you find a 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.799
 answer that satisfies your questions already 

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:42.979
 They know that if they liked this chatting 

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:46.379
 can share the video with their friends 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.089
 like to subscribe to the channel if 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.029
 on twitter and all those things that 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:54.019
 you do what we are riding and 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.019
 we will see each other in the future
