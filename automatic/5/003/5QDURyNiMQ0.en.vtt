00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.000 
each other we're almost frightened of
each<00:00:17.699> other<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.270> very<00:00:18.390> tactical<00:00:19.020> nobody

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
each other it's very tactical nobody

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.859

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
our team thought was probably similar to

our team thought was probably similar to
those<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.199> could<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.859> could<00:00:25.980> push<00:00:26.160> on

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
those that we could we could push on

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.769 
those that we could we could push on
more<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.670> could<00:00:26.789> wood<00:00:27.029> could<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:27.599> bit

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
more we could wood could be a little bit

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.800 
more we could wood could be a little bit
braver<00:00:28.670> having<00:00:29.670> got<00:00:29.820> ourselves<00:00:29.970> two<00:00:30.300> girls<00:00:30.660> in

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

braver having got ourselves two girls in
front<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.230> think<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.160> thought<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.460> should

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
front I think we we thought we should

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.130 
that i thought we worked very well as a
team<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.940> know<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.750> lapse<00:02:34.990> in

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
concentration away further for the first

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.900 
concentration away further for the first
goal<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.890> tottenham<00:02:39.250> scored<00:02:39.550> i<00:02:39.670> thought

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
goal that tottenham scored i thought

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.050 
goal that tottenham scored i thought
that<00:02:40.120> we<00:02:40.300> were<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:42.190> defended<00:02:42.670> well<00:02:42.850> as<00:02:43.030> a
