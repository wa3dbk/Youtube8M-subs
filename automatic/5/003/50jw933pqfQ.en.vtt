00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 "Illegal Medicines in Chicken Feathers" 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.205
 Between 1940 and 1971, synthetic estrogen DES (diethylstilbestrol) was prescribed 

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:18.770
 several million pregnant women with the promise to help prevent abortion. 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.803
 Problems were first pointed out in 1953 when scientists realized that DES 

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:25.851
 it was not only an ineffective prevention of abortion, but it could also have harmful effects. 

00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:29.070
 However, a strong and emotionally targeted advertising 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.186
 that it was still in use - until 1971. 

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:39.070
 It was then found to cause vaginal cancer in the daughters of mothers who used it. 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.704
 DES was also used to suppress growth in girls who were expected to "grow up." 

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:50.603
 too high. ”As the pediatric textbook from 1968 said:“ Above-average girls can 

00:00:50.603 --> 00:00:53.738
 disadvantage. The problem is, for example, buying an elegant one 

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:59.204
 clothes; the victim is then incapable of working in sought-after positions, such as a stewardess. 

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:04.569
 The problem also arises when choosing suitable dance partners. ” 

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:11.769
 However, most people do not know that DES has been used most in livestock sectors. 

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:15.092
 It was intended to improve the conversion of feed into meat for cattle and chickens. 

00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:19.036
 Within one year of approval, millions of livestock have become part of the feed. 

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.103
 Although this substance was identified as a proven human carcinogen in 1971, 

00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:27.587
 it was not until 1979 that the use of DES in the meat industry was completely banned. 

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:31.370
 They currently use implants with other types of synthetic estrogens. 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.837
 However, even decades after the DES ban, we still meet 

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:41.564
 with consequences: increased incidence of birth defects, even up to the third generation. 

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:49.506
 Arsenic is another human carcinogen that has fed chickens, this time billions of pieces. 

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:53.937
 Arsenic ends not only in meat, as I said before, 

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:58.404
 but also in feathers of slaughtered chickens, which is reused as feed. 

00:01:58.404 --> 00:02:01.703
 You know, a third of a bird's body is inedible. 

00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:06.236
 What are they doing with the billions of kilograms of heads, bones, guts and feathers? 

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:09.970
 Fertilizer and animal feed. 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.668
 Feather meal is fed to chickens, pigs, beef cattle, sheep and fish. 

00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:16.625
 The feathers themselves are not nutritious, 

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.770
 therefore, entrails, heads, and claws are added to increase the protein content. 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.005
 Manure is added to the feed to increase the mineral content. 

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:28.230
 The problem is that feather meal used in feed can be involved 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.304
 on the additional exposure of people consuming arsenic meat. 

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:37.036
 This test allowed researchers to take a more detailed picture. 

00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:43.204
 By analyzing feather meal, they can figure out the further fed the chickens. 

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:54.504
 "Feather meal: Until recently unrecognized way into the food chain 

00:02:54.504 --> 00:02:59.270
 various pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are returning. "All samples were tested for antibiotics 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.491
 positive. Traces of 2-10 different species were detected in each sample, 

00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:07.137
 including fluoroquinolones that have been banned for years. 

00:03:07.137 --> 00:03:11.202
 So the poultry industry is either still using it 

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:15.719
 these medicines, or are used in other animals that feed the chickens. 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.970
 Anyway, feeding feather meal 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.387
 chickens are still exposed to this medicine. 

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:22.653
 It is therefore a violation of the Chickens Feeding Act. 

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:27.284
 This creates a cycle of repeated exposure to prohibited drugs. 

00:03:27.284 --> 00:03:31.916
 The following information is even stranger. 

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:35.550
 Half a dozen other drugs were found in the feathers. 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.417
 Prozac, antihistamine, fungicide, sex hormone and caffeine. 

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:45.350
 Why doesn't the poultry industry just say no to these drugs? 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.650
 Antihistamines seem to need the respiratory problems that animals suffer. 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.177
 When you imprison tens of thousands of chickens in a prison-like hall 

00:03:53.177 --> 00:04:01.000
 it is needed. Caffeine then helps keep the chickens alert; they can eat more and grow faster.
