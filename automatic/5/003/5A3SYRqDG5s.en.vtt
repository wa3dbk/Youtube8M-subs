first nuketown has that little spawn

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.720 
first nuketown has that little spawn
thing<00:00:51.090> where<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.500> easily<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.280> kills

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
thing where you can easily get kills

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180 
thing where you can easily get kills
from<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.719> long-range<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:56.010> either

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
from a long-range if you are either

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.310 
from a long-range if you are either
using<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.730> sniper<00:00:57.059> rifle<00:00:57.800> an<00:00:58.800> assault<00:00:59.789> rifle

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960 
mainly a burst weapon like an m16 or g11
and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.619> you're<00:01:04.739> able<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.189> kills<00:01:05.670> across

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and then you're able to get kills across

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.450 
and then you're able to get kills across
the<00:01:06.090> map<00:01:06.240> relatively<00:01:06.990> easy<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.740> with

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the map relatively easy with this with

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
the map relatively easy with this with
this<00:01:08.490> simple<00:01:08.850> spawn<00:01:09.270> thing<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.350> me

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this simple spawn thing and you see me

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
this simple spawn thing and you see me
try<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> beginning<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:12.210> two

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
try it at the beginning of these two

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.499 
try it at the beginning of these two
rounds<00:01:13.020> they<00:01:13.799> don't<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.040> help<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.060> so

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
rounds they don't really help you out so

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.149 
rounds they don't really help you out so
much<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.049> side<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.470> side<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.799> more<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
much on this side this side is more of a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.760 
much on this side this side is more of a
counter<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> opposing<00:01:19.080> side<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
counter for the opposing side but on the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070 
counter for the opposing side but on the
opposing<00:01:20.100> side<00:01:20.450> you're<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.780> me<00:01:21.900> do

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
opposing side you're going to see me do

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.920 
opposing side you're going to see me do
it<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.280> when<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.369> switch<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.630> fourth

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.620 
fourth Ram you're gonna see me go ahead
and<00:01:30.750> try<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.430> basically<00:01:32.430> what<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and try it basically what it is is you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
and try it basically what it is is you
just<00:01:33.810> run<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.140> through<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.380> door<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.189> I'm

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
just run it through the door and you I'm

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.460 
just run it through the door and you I'm
aiming<00:01:36.090> directly<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.900> spot<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.140> now

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
aiming directly at this spot right now

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.469 
aiming directly at this spot right now
but<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.829> usually<00:01:38.220> where<00:01:38.460> I've<00:01:39.030> run<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.270> the

looking<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:57.000> helps<00:01:57.570> me<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> lot<00:01:58.110> this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
looking at and this helps me a lot this

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.100 
looking at and this helps me a lot this
helped<00:01:58.920> me<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.219> lot<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.610> game<00:01:59.759> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
helped me out a lot in this game and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.959 
helped me out a lot in this game and
it's<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.290> easy<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.430> pick<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.790> few

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
it's really easy when you pick up a few

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.609 
it's really easy when you pick up a few
kills<00:02:03.210> at<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.450> beginning<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.439> Rhine

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
kills at the beginning of the Rhine

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.340 
kills at the beginning of the Rhine
because<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> way<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:06.240> gives<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.570> team<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
because that way it gives your team and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.660 
because that way it gives your team and
opportunity<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> push<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.520> there's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
opportunity to push up because there's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
opportunity to push up because there's
not<00:02:08.819> as<00:02:08.940> many<00:02:09.060> players<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> opposing<00:02:10.200> team

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
not as many players on the opposing team

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.460 
not as many players on the opposing team
which<00:02:11.420> allows<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.720> an<00:02:12.780> easier<00:02:13.110> right

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
which allows for an easier right

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.440 
which allows for an easier right
win<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:13.920> my<00:02:14.070> opinion<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.670> basically<00:02:15.300> you're

and it's going to put me in very bad
situations<00:02:31.290> when<00:02:31.440> someone<00:02:31.740> else<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:31.950> using
