00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:21.300
 The good lap you guys are working with 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.290
 the project and I need to flatten this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.970
 play here so it is this planar 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.450
 I stumble and then I came across a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.309
 question that he is very mistaken 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.350
 I 'm going to take the camera I'm going to show 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.350
 for you using the ruler 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 as you can see here 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.870
 he has a ruler that is in one piece 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.809
 is one meter and thirty-five 35 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.800
 length and she who in the center she is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.829
 giving three millimeters difference can 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.499
 see her at the tip and she comes 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.050
 opening and have three boys to take 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:07.170
 this on the plain a hard way even 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.170
 even with full electric is a lot 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.690
 It gives a terrible job. 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:19.980
 so what's the point here I'm going to take 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:22.980
 this is an aluminum guide that my 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.930
 Rail I have right but could be 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.080
 a ruler any there that you 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.200
 I was going to take it with the saw and then 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.560
 we just full to clean even 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.150
 to make any difference left the saw 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.930
 to whom I will make you then 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.640
 accompany 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.780
 You have to see how I as the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.780
 result of this 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:34.900
 It only hurts that I just cut out I 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:37.310
 I took here a very thin fillet is 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.310
 more than this to take it all in 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.520
 full square mountain is little for the plant 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:49.810
 It would be very good then it can be quite 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.810
 thing and now puts the piece back upright 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:05.440
 I love you, you can see the difference is over 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:10.550
 so now just pass it flat 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.120
 To do this cleaning order here 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.700
 just to get these little pets that stay 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.070
 here of a certain brand but what had 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.180
 that the plenary has been picked up ok 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.490
 This is 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.190
 Leave this tip to you to facilitate 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.690
 work much faster and more 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.310
 efficient 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.390
 A hug to everyone and until a next 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.640
 opportunity 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.770
 good job for all remembering always 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.520
 to use safety equipment 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.520
 to the next
