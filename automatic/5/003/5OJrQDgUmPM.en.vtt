next<00:00:00.599> we're<00:00:00.989> going<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.230> look<00:00:01.560> at<00:00:01.920> the

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
next we're going to look at the

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.450 
next we're going to look at the
components<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.600> an<00:00:04.200> embedded<00:00:06.649> system<00:00:09.590> and<00:00:10.590> we

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
components of an embedded system and we

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.419 
components of an embedded system and we
said<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.840> embedded<00:00:13.170> system<00:00:13.920> had<00:00:14.400> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
said that the embedded system had a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.060 
said that the embedded system had a
computer<00:00:16.220> inside<00:00:17.630> so<00:00:18.630> we'll<00:00:18.810> represent<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
computer inside so we'll represent the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.040 
computer inside so we'll represent the
computer<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.180> little<00:00:21.480> integrated

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050

is<00:01:38.899> we<00:01:39.799> will<00:01:40.009> see<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:40.700> embedded<00:01:41.509> systems<00:01:42.049> are

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
is we will see that embedded systems are

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.740 
is we will see that embedded systems are
ubiquitous<00:01:44.179> in<00:01:45.009> industry<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.750> industrial

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
ubiquitous in industry so industrial

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.029 
ubiquitous in industry so industrial
embedded<00:01:48.229> systems<00:01:48.740> are<00:01:49.130> robots<00:01:51.039> inventory

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
embedded systems are robots inventory

control<00:01:54.670> manufacturing<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:56.539> is<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.780> very

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
control manufacturing this is a very

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.559 
control manufacturing this is a very
large<00:01:57.380> sector<00:01:57.920> for<00:01:58.159> embedded<00:01:58.549> systems<00:01:58.580> all

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
large sector for embedded systems all

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.370 
large sector for embedded systems all
right<00:01:59.780> so<00:01:59.959> now<00:02:00.140> let's<00:02:00.170> talk<00:02:00.709> about<00:02:00.950> the

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
right so now let's talk about the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.730 
right so now let's talk about the
computer<00:02:03.380> all<00:02:04.280> right<00:02:04.610> as<00:02:04.819> we<00:02:05.630> see<00:02:06.110> embedded

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
computer all right as we see embedded

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.210 
computer all right as we see embedded
systems<00:02:07.429> are<00:02:07.700> everywhere<00:02:08.410> they're<00:02:09.410> estimated

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
systems are everywhere they're estimated

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.199 
systems are everywhere they're estimated
over<00:02:11.120> five<00:02:11.959> billion<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:15.790> these<00:02:16.790> embedded

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
over five billion of these embedded

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.289 
over five billion of these embedded
systems<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:17.989> our<00:02:18.110> world<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:19.030> these<00:02:20.030> are

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
systems in our world and these are

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.130 
systems in our world and these are
computers<00:02:20.900> hidden<00:02:21.530> inside<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.730> devices<00:02:23.480> so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
computers hidden inside of devices so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.720 
computers hidden inside of devices so
let's<00:02:24.380> look<00:02:24.709> inside<00:02:24.980> an<00:02:25.700> embedded<00:02:26.390> system<00:02:27.730> it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
let's look inside an embedded system it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.340 
let's look inside an embedded system it
has<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> computer<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:32.630> when<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.139> say

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
has a computer and the when you say

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.710 
has a computer and the when you say
computer<00:02:33.769> most<00:02:34.160> people<00:02:34.549> think<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.980> x86<00:02:37.720> which

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
computer most people think of x86 which

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.170 
computer most people think of x86 which
is<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.109> standard<00:02:39.500> computer<00:02:39.889> in<00:02:40.220> personal

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
is the standard computer in personal

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.860 
is the standard computer in personal
computers<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:42.799> now<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:43.069> have<00:02:43.870> coming

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
computers and but now we have coming

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.530

our<00:03:33.950> storage<00:03:34.280> element<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.900> what<00:03:36.710> you're

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
our storage element and and what you're

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.960 
our storage element and and what you're
going<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.040> learn<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.490> this<00:03:37.730> class<00:03:38.000> is<00:03:38.710> IO<00:03:39.710> is<00:03:40.220> IO

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
going to learn in this class is IO is IO

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.990 
going to learn in this class is IO is IO
is<00:03:41.480> where<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.870> interface<00:03:42.200> happens<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.760> is

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
is where the interface happens this is

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.120 
is where the interface happens this is
the<00:03:44.150> glue<00:03:44.480> which<00:03:45.230> will<00:03:45.440> connect<00:03:45.890> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
the glue which will connect the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.760 
the glue which will connect the
components<00:03:46.790> together<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:48.080> we<00:03:48.260> will<00:03:48.440> see

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
components together and so we will see

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.740 
components together and so we will see
that<00:03:49.010> this<00:03:49.250> aisle<00:03:49.760> will<00:03:49.970> have<00:03:50.180> a<00:03:50.210> couple<00:03:50.660> of

before we go on let's make a list of the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.410 
before we go on let's make a list of the
important<00:04:09.320> considerations<00:04:10.120> when<00:04:11.120> building

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
important considerations when building

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.010 
important considerations when building
an<00:04:11.690> embedded<00:04:12.170> system<00:04:12.850> first<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.180> foremost<00:04:14.720> is

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
an embedded system first and foremost is

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.880 
an embedded system first and foremost is
the<00:04:15.530> ability<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:16.100> test<00:04:16.670> or<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.420> verify<00:04:17.890> we're

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
the ability to test or to verify we're

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.030 
the ability to test or to verify we're
going<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.130> place<00:04:19.400> embedded<00:04:20.060> systems<00:04:20.570> in

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
going to place embedded systems in

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.909 
going to place embedded systems in
important<00:04:22.040> life<00:04:22.580> critical<00:04:23.480> situations<00:04:24.200> where

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
important life critical situations where

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.060 
important life critical situations where
if<00:04:25.190> we<00:04:25.520> make<00:04:25.700> a<00:04:25.730> mistake<00:04:26.290> we<00:04:27.290> could<00:04:27.530> lose<00:04:27.770> not

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
if we make a mistake we could lose not

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.730 
if we make a mistake we could lose not
only<00:04:28.400> money<00:04:28.640> but<00:04:28.990> loss<00:04:29.990> of<00:04:30.230> life

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
only money but loss of life

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.550 
only money but loss of life
so<00:04:31.100> when<00:04:31.669> building<00:04:32.000> an<00:04:32.240> embedded<00:04:32.660> system<00:04:32.870> the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
so when building an embedded system the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.980 
so when building an embedded system the
ability<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:34.220> test<00:04:34.580> or<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.030> verify<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.630> works

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
ability to test or to verify it works

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.800 
ability to test or to verify it works
will<00:04:36.350> be<00:04:36.500> extremely<00:04:36.890> important<00:04:37.640> of<00:04:37.810> course

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
will be extremely important of course

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.960 
will be extremely important of course
we're<00:04:39.500> engineers<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.310> we<00:04:40.640> would<00:04:40.790> like<00:04:40.940> to

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
we're engineers and we would like to

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.380 
we're engineers and we would like to
make<00:04:41.240> some<00:04:41.450> money<00:04:41.660> so<00:04:42.850> another<00:04:43.850> important

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
make some money so another important

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.960 
make some money so another important
consideration<00:04:44.540> embedded<00:04:45.530> systems<00:04:45.980> is<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.700> is

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
consideration embedded systems is the is

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.600 
consideration embedded systems is the is
the<00:04:47.480> ability<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:48.080> make<00:04:48.260> profit<00:04:48.740> which<00:04:49.280> as<00:04:49.460> you

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
the ability to make profit which as you

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.240 
the ability to make profit which as you
know<00:04:49.640> is<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.390> combination<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.440> market<00:04:51.980> share

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
know is a combination of market share

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.159 
know is a combination of market share
and<00:04:52.460> that's<00:04:53.120> making<00:04:53.600> something<00:04:54.020> that

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
and that's making something that

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.770 
and that's making something that
everybody<00:04:54.560> wants<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.830> buy<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:58.300> reducing<00:04:59.300> the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
everybody wants to buy and reducing the

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.590 
everybody wants to buy and reducing the
cost<00:04:59.919> which<00:05:00.919> is<00:05:00.950> both<00:05:01.370> development<00:05:02.030> cost<00:05:02.270> and

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
cost which is both development cost and

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.020 
cost which is both development cost and
manufacturing<00:05:03.350> cost<00:05:03.590> as<00:05:04.600> we<00:05:05.600> saw<00:05:05.810> also<00:05:06.230> that

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
manufacturing cost as we saw also that

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.030 
manufacturing cost as we saw also that
these<00:05:08.030> systems<00:05:08.450> are<00:05:08.930> powered<00:05:09.169> often<00:05:09.890> by

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
these systems are powered often by

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.960 
these systems are powered often by
batteries<00:05:10.669> so<00:05:11.450> power<00:05:11.919> which<00:05:12.919> affects<00:05:13.370> size

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
batteries so power which affects size

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.890 
batteries so power which affects size
and<00:05:14.419> heat<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:14.900> cost<00:05:15.320> is<00:05:15.740> extremely<00:05:16.460> important

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
and heat and cost is extremely important

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.310 
and heat and cost is extremely important
