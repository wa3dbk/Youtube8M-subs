fun again I I guess playing that way
it's<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.119> conducive<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.810> having<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it's not really conducive to having a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's not really conducive to having a
high<00:01:40.470> kill<00:01:40.860> death<00:01:41.100> ratio<00:01:41.220> which<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.939> don't<00:01:42.000> care

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
high kill death ratio which I don't care

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.050 
high kill death ratio which I don't care
about<00:01:42.450> or<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> high<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:43.619> loss<00:01:43.829> ratio<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
about or a high when loss ratio which I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.600 
about or a high when loss ratio which I
