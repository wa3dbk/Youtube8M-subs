00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.629
 [Music] 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.179
 i 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:26.510
 [Music] 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.710
 [Music] 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.710
 we are not going to say 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.280
 we would be with 23 points 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.280
 against time and partly lola 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.180
 the second part of auction 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.180
 [Music] 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.439
 it would be more 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.319
 [Music] 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.340
 [Music] 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.200
 of your preference 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.480
 followed by two strokes in the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.110
 in the left hand in the right hand 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.110
 so 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.870
 [Music] 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.270
 and good finally the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.270
 kill me 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.920
 this apology 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.920
 with the left hand 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.660
 so if you put 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.190
 yes 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.730
 [Music] 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.670
 to take out the small part of the slide 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.659
 I executed it in the following way 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.659
 I hold the tip 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.660
 in this area and the only thing you have to 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.910
 to do is to walk your foot 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.910
 go up then 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.900
 well sometimes it would be all 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.430
 USA 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.430
 two
