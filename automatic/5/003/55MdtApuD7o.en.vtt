but it's just like if I'm a sub cedar I

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.730 
but it's just like if I'm a sub cedar I
can't<00:01:56.360> hurt<00:01:56.570> Celebi<00:01:56.990> at<00:01:57.110> all<00:01:57.259> why<00:01:57.470> would<00:01:57.619> you

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
can't hurt Celebi at all why would you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.580 
can't hurt Celebi at all why would you
not<00:01:57.890> bring<00:01:58.130> Celebi<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:58.850> right<00:01:59.119> there<00:01:59.560> but<00:02:00.560> he

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
not bring Celebi in right there but he

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.070 
not bring Celebi in right there but he
didn't<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.280> because<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.180> I<00:02:02.630> got<00:02:03.020> a

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
didn't and because of that I got a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.929 
didn't and because of that I got a
worthless<00:02:03.380> toxic<00:02:04.040> off<00:02:04.189> on<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.549> thing<00:02:04.759> and

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
worthless toxic off on that thing and

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.910 
worthless toxic off on that thing and
that<00:02:05.240> causes<00:02:05.509> me<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.810> protect<00:02:06.350> instead<00:02:06.799> of

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
that causes me to protect instead of

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.490 
that causes me to protect instead of
getting<00:02:07.159> up<00:02:07.280> more<00:02:07.460> substitutes<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:09.380> I'm

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
getting up more substitutes and now I'm

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.590 
getting up more substitutes and now I'm
against<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.860> Heatran<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.489> if<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.759> had<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.269> sub

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
against the Heatran that if I had a sub

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.860 
against the Heatran that if I had a sub
or<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.260> leech<00:02:12.650> seed<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.489> could<00:02:14.060> deal<00:02:14.329> with<00:02:14.600> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
or a leech seed on I could deal with and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.830 
or a leech seed on I could deal with and
instead<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.350> cannot<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.299> sucks<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.720> have<00:02:17.780> to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
instead I cannot so that sucks I have to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.300 
instead I cannot so that sucks I have to
go<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.019> my<00:02:18.140> only<00:02:18.350> thing<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.739> can<00:02:18.860> take<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> hit

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
go to my only thing that can take a hit

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.340 
go to my only thing that can take a hit
and<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.820> take<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.120> hit<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:20.840> because<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and it can take a hit but because of the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.640 
and it can take a hit but because of the
burn<00:02:21.530> axe<00:02:21.799> they<00:02:21.980> can't<00:02:22.220> take<00:02:22.430> two<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.900> left

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
burn axe they can't take two so I left

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.610 
burn axe they can't take two so I left
at<00:02:24.829> this<00:02:25.010> point<00:02:25.850> just<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.390> him<00:02:26.630> empty

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
at this point just to have him empty

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.470 
at this point just to have him empty
baton<00:02:27.980> pass<00:02:28.250> out<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.910> way<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.209> maybe

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
baton pass out so that way you can maybe

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.060 
baton pass out so that way you can maybe
survive<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.470> then<00:02:30.590> get<00:02:30.739> me<00:02:30.829> a<00:02:30.860> switch

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
survive and then get me a switch

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.560 
survive and then get me a switch
advantage<00:02:31.459> while<00:02:31.610> still<00:02:31.850> being<00:02:31.970> death<00:02:32.269> fodder

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
advantage while still being death fodder

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.930 
advantage while still being death fodder
later<00:02:32.930> or<00:02:33.260> he<00:02:34.010> ends<00:02:34.190> up<00:02:34.220> just<00:02:34.280> switching<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
later or he ends up just switching and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.300 
later or he ends up just switching and
flat<00:02:35.660> out<00:02:35.690> right<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.260> I'm<00:02:36.410> expecting<00:02:36.680> he's

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
flat out right so I'm expecting he's

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.800 
flat out right so I'm expecting he's
most<00:02:37.519> likely<00:02:37.610> scarf<00:02:38.120> he<00:02:38.269> kind<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.480> has<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.780> be

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
most likely scarf he kind of has to be

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.470 
most likely scarf he kind of has to be
scarf<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:40.130> I'm<00:02:40.700> gonna<00:02:40.850> go<00:02:41.030> into<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:41.329> guy

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
scarf and I'm gonna go into this guy

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.240 
scarf and I'm gonna go into this guy
which<00:02:41.750> it's<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.110> most<00:02:42.320> obvious<00:02:42.620> play<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.100> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
which it's the most obvious play in the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.979 
which it's the most obvious play in the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
chance to protect and figure things out

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.940 
chance to protect and figure things out
and<00:03:22.520> go<00:03:22.670> from<00:03:22.910> there<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:24.320> then<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.770> make<00:03:24.920> a

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
and go from there and then I make a

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.860 
and go from there and then I make a
critical<00:03:25.490> mistake<00:03:25.610> here<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.150> switch<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.630> drag

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
critical mistake here I switch to drag

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.630 
critical mistake here I switch to drag
that's<00:03:27.170> fine<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.470> expect<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.220> turn<00:03:28.430> or

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.550 
whatever and I don't set up stealth rock
I<00:03:31.520> don't<00:03:31.940> know<00:03:32.060> why<00:03:32.330> I<00:03:32.360> don't<00:03:32.810> set<00:03:33.200> up<00:03:33.230> stealth

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
I don't know why I don't set up stealth

I don't know why I don't set up stealth
rock<00:03:33.800> I<00:03:34.100> went<00:03:34.670> for<00:03:34.820> damage<00:03:35.920> partially<00:03:36.920> because

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
rock I went for damage partially because

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.730 
rock I went for damage partially because
I<00:03:37.970> wanted<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.690> see<00:03:38.840> if<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.050> can<00:03:39.260> sweep<00:03:39.500> with

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
I wanted to see if I can sweep with

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.110 
I wanted to see if I can sweep with
something<00:03:40.070> later<00:03:40.280> on<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.730> want<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.030> get

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
something later on and I want to get

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.510 
something later on and I want to get
damage<00:03:41.450> on<00:03:41.570> everything<00:03:41.990> but<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.650> really<00:03:42.709> should

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
damage on everything but I really should

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.030 
damage on everything but I really should
have<00:03:43.820> went<00:03:44.000> stealth<00:03:44.270> rock<00:03:44.480> first<00:03:45.040> because

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
have went stealth rock first because

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.820 
have went stealth rock first because
then<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.250> could<00:03:46.310> switch<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.670> Umbreon<00:03:47.300> here<00:03:47.830> and

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
then I could switch to Umbreon here and

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.910 
then I could switch to Umbreon here and
I'd<00:03:48.950> be<00:03:49.100> a-ok<00:03:49.730> instead<00:03:50.720> as<00:03:51.020> much<00:03:51.530> as<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.740> know<00:03:51.800> I

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
I'd be a-ok instead as much as I know I

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.880 
I'd be a-ok instead as much as I know I
need<00:03:52.220> this<00:03:52.430> guy<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.940> I<00:03:53.510> sacrifice<00:03:54.470> them<00:03:54.650> for<00:03:54.830> the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
need this guy I I sacrifice them for the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.220 
need this guy I I sacrifice them for the
sake<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.070> stealth<00:03:55.430> rock<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.940> that's<00:03:56.230> not

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
sake of stealth rock and that's not

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.160 
sake of stealth rock and that's not
worth<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.590> either<00:03:57.800> so<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.700> compound<00:03:59.360> compound

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
worth a either so I compound compound

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.800 
worth a either so I compound compound
one<00:04:00.980> mistake<00:04:01.370> with<00:04:01.760> another<00:04:02.120> mistake<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
one mistake with another mistake and

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.540 
one mistake with another mistake and
that's<00:04:02.989> just<00:04:03.650> not<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.400> way<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:04.640> win<00:04:05.150> games

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
that's just not the way you win games

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.699 
that's just not the way you win games
but<00:04:07.550> it<00:04:08.120> that's<00:04:08.450> that's<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.959> past<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.470> what

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
but it that's that's in the past so what

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.590 
but it that's that's in the past so what
can<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:09.920> do<00:04:09.980> from<00:04:10.190> there<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.519> go<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.150> Umbreon

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
can I do from there I go to Umbreon

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.780 
can I do from there I go to Umbreon
mostly<00:04:12.050> just<00:04:12.200> as<00:04:12.350> fodder<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.040> can<00:04:13.340> see<00:04:13.640> what

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
mostly just as fodder so I can see what

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.599 
mostly just as fodder so I can see what
he<00:04:13.880> brings<00:04:14.150> out<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.570> then<00:04:14.840> go<00:04:15.050> from<00:04:15.230> there

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
he brings out and then go from there

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.150 
he brings out and then go from there
because<00:04:16.609> if<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.330> try<00:04:18.140> and<00:04:18.380> get<00:04:18.620> an<00:04:18.739> advantage

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
because if I try and get an advantage

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.460 
because if I try and get an advantage
and<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.609> end<00:04:19.790> up<00:04:19.940> being<00:04:20.150> wrong<00:04:20.540> then<00:04:20.930> I'm<00:04:21.049> really

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
and I end up being wrong then I'm really

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.470 
and I end up being wrong then I'm really
screwed<00:04:21.799> so<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.100> figured<00:04:22.550> I'll<00:04:22.669> just<00:04:22.700> waste<00:04:23.270> my

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
screwed so I figured I'll just waste my

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.730 
screwed so I figured I'll just waste my
father<00:04:23.750> now<00:04:23.990> because<00:04:24.260> that's<00:04:24.410> what<00:04:24.530> father

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
father now because that's what father

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.670 
father now because that's what father
does<00:04:25.840> obviously<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.900> can't<00:04:27.200> go<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.380> Drac

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
does obviously I can't go to Drac

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.930 
does obviously I can't go to Drac
anymore<00:04:28.300> otherwise<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.480> would<00:04:29.720> right<00:04:30.020> now<00:04:30.940> but

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
anymore otherwise I would right now but

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.550 
anymore otherwise I would right now but

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
to predict that I wasn't sub seed so

maybe<00:05:05.970> you'll<00:05:06.150> continue<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.840> predict<00:05:07.169> that

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
maybe you'll continue to predict that

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.860 
maybe you'll continue to predict that
I'm<00:05:07.650> not<00:05:07.860> sub<00:05:08.160> seed<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:09.060> scare<00:05:09.419> him<00:05:09.570> away<00:05:09.720> but

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
I'm not sub seed and scare him away but

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.100 
I'm not sub seed and scare him away but
it<00:05:10.199> didn't<00:05:10.470> and<00:05:11.280> then<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:11.970> realized<00:05:12.509> that<00:05:12.780> oh

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
it didn't and then I realized that oh

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.749 
it didn't and then I realized that oh
wait<00:05:13.320> he's<00:05:13.530> got<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.710> completely<00:05:14.250> offensive

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
wait he's got a completely offensive

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.340 
wait he's got a completely offensive
Celebi<00:05:15.419> I<00:05:15.449> also<00:05:15.660> thought<00:05:15.870> he<00:05:16.020> might<00:05:16.169> recover

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
Celebi I also thought he might recover

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.499 
Celebi I also thought he might recover
but<00:05:17.160> now<00:05:17.310> I<00:05:17.340> remember<00:05:17.820> he<00:05:17.940> has<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.060> completely

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
but now I remember he has a completely

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.960 
but now I remember he has a completely
offensive<00:05:18.930> Celebi<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:22.220> I<00:05:23.220> just<00:05:23.490> decided<00:05:23.880> to

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
offensive Celebi and I just decided to

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.790 
offensive Celebi and I just decided to
kill<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:24.539> at<00:05:24.750> least<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.139> get<00:05:25.199> something

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
kill it so at least I get something

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.050 
kill it so at least I get something
