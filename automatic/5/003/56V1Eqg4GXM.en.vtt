striking<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.640> should<00:03:05.880> probably<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.570> silver

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
striking it should probably be silver

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.500 
striking it should probably be silver
and<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.100> silver<00:03:08.700> some<00:03:08.940> reason<00:03:09.300> it

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
and if it's not silver some reason it

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.000 
and if it's not silver some reason it
will<00:03:09.600> be<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> pretty<00:03:09.990> tasty<00:03:10.440> bronze<00:03:10.680> card

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
will be a pretty tasty bronze card

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.220 
will be a pretty tasty bronze card

what<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> brilliant<00:03:25.500> turnaround<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.340> think

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
what a brilliant turnaround is I think

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.670 
what a brilliant turnaround is I think
they<00:03:26.670> went<00:03:26.760> 25<00:03:27.209> games<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.690> being<00:03:27.780> might<00:03:28.590> have

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
they went 25 games and being might have

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.860 
they went 25 games and being might have
been<00:03:28.800> 26<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.430> end<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.180> then<00:03:30.330> last<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:30.660> we've

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
been 26 the end and then last so we've

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.570 
been 26 the end and then last so we've
got<00:03:31.019> Wilson<00:03:31.230> Wilson's<00:03:32.130> probably<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.430> best

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
got Wilson Wilson's probably the best

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.970 
got Wilson Wilson's probably the best
player<00:03:32.790> team<00:03:33.060> mainly<00:03:33.840> due<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.110> his<00:03:34.440> pace<00:03:34.709> along

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
player team mainly due to his pace along

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.699 
player team mainly due to his pace along
he's<00:03:35.430> got<00:03:35.640> electric<00:03:36.540> pace<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.050> pretty<00:03:37.380> decent

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
he's got electric pace and pretty decent

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.100 
he's got electric pace and pretty decent
finishing<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.000> would<00:03:39.239> recommend<00:03:39.269> Wilson

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
finishing so I would recommend Wilson

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.320 
finishing so I would recommend Wilson
it's<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> bit<00:03:40.410> more<00:03:40.530> expensive<00:03:40.769> though<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:42.120> if

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
it's a bit more expensive though but if

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.300 
it's a bit more expensive though but if
I<00:03:42.989> had<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.260> only<00:03:43.620> get<00:03:43.800> one<00:03:43.950> player<00:03:44.040> from<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
I had to only get one player from the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
I had to only get one player from the
team<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.610> probably<00:03:44.940> would<00:03:45.030> be<00:03:45.060> Wilson<00:03:45.720> or

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
team it probably would be Wilson or

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.620 
team it probably would be Wilson or
