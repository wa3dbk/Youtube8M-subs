don't like about the double what the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.670 
don't like about the double what the
clippings<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.569> they're<00:02:17.810> both<00:02:18.050> so

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
clippings is that they're both so

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.229 
clippings is that they're both so
they're<00:02:18.920> not<00:02:19.099> flat<00:02:19.430> at<00:02:19.760> all<00:02:19.940> um<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.730> would

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
they're not flat at all um so I would

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.280 
they're not flat at all um so I would
rather<00:02:23.450> them<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:24.080> one<00:02:24.470> left<00:02:24.819> instead<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:26.290> two

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
rather them have one left instead of two

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.380 
rather them have one left instead of two
webs<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.920> try<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.459> sew<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.819> together<00:02:29.000> because

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
webs and try to sew it together because

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.059 
webs and try to sew it together because
it<00:02:29.510> makes<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:29.989> thick<00:02:30.349> so<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:30.739> feel<00:02:31.040> like

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
it makes it really thick so I feel like

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.800 
it makes it really thick so I feel like
they<00:02:31.340> should<00:02:31.370> put<00:02:31.730> more<00:02:31.970> hair<00:02:32.269> on<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.480> track

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
they should put more hair on the track

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.390 
they should put more hair on the track
instead<00:02:33.019> of<00:02:33.230> trying<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.560> put<00:02:33.739> like<00:02:33.920> two<00:02:34.160> webs

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
instead of trying to put like two webs

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.699 
instead of trying to put like two webs
together<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.510> that's<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> only<00:02:35.840> car<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.440> i
