00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.690

 A letter has been added 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.159
 I can not see the deco characters now, but this color is a little black 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.340
 about 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.329
 this 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.329
 I can not see this because the colors of the desktops overlap 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.130
 I will edit this from now 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:15.540

 Even if it does so in terms of sustainability 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.920
 Because it comes out in various ways 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.020
 I will explain from now on 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.710

 At first, this is not checked, so if you want to put it outside, it is pale to display the outer frame 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.750

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.040
 It is displayed here 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:32.560
