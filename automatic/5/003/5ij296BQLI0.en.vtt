00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
and the controller now the first thing

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.070 
and the controller now the first thing
that<00:00:25.150> you're<00:00:25.240> going<00:00:25.300> to<00:00:25.420> want<00:00:25.600> to<00:00:25.689> do<00:00:25.810> is<00:00:26.050> be

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
that you're going to want to do is be

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.840 
that you're going to want to do is be
familiar<00:00:26.680> with<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.949> lighting<00:00:27.340> fixture

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
familiar with the lighting fixture

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.080 
familiar with the lighting fixture
itself<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:29.109> if<00:00:29.980> you<00:00:30.160> look<00:00:30.340> here<00:00:30.580> at<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:30.789> front

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
itself so if you look here at the front

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.000 
itself so if you look here at the front
first<00:00:31.510> of<00:00:31.660> all<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.960> front<00:00:32.470> of<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.650> lighting

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
first of all the front of the lighting

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.950 
first of all the front of the lighting
fixture<00:00:33.430> you're<00:00:34.059> going<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.239> see<00:00:34.420> basically

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
fixture you're going to see basically

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.880 
fixture you're going to see basically

with either our G or B that's red green
or<00:00:42.580> blue<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:43.479> is<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.750> basis<00:00:44.199> of<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.440> LED

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
or blue this is the basis of the LED

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.799 
or blue this is the basis of the LED
configuration<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:45.970> this<00:00:46.479> is<00:00:46.600> what<00:00:46.720> you're

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
configuration and this is what you're

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.000 
configuration and this is what you're
going<00:00:46.900> to<00:00:46.989> be<00:00:47.080> looking<00:00:47.379> at<00:00:47.559> because<00:00:47.830> what

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
going to be looking at because what

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.250 
going to be looking at because what
you're<00:00:48.100> going<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.309> notice<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:48.820> when<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.600> plug

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
you're going to notice is when you plug

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.509 
you're going to notice is when you plug
in<00:00:50.409> the<00:00:50.470> controller<00:00:50.860> or<00:00:51.040> later<00:00:51.220> you're<00:00:51.430> going

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
in the controller or later you're going

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.399 
in the controller or later you're going
to<00:00:51.580> be<00:00:51.699> able<00:00:51.729> to<00:00:51.940> mix<00:00:52.210> these<00:00:52.510> colors<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.229> these

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
to be able to mix these colors and these

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.259 
to be able to mix these colors and these
color<00:00:53.799> is<00:00:54.070> going<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.280> create<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.640> palette<00:00:55.089> so

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
color is going to create the palette so

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.579 
color is going to create the palette so
that<00:00:55.420> way<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.720> you'll<00:00:55.839> have<00:00:55.900> your<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.350> rest

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
that way that you'll have your the rest

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.350 
that way that you'll have your the rest
of<00:00:56.739> your<00:00:56.830> light<00:00:57.070> wherever<00:00:57.699> you're<00:00:58.000> shining

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
of your light wherever you're shining

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.490 
of your light wherever you're shining
them

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.040 

you

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.070 

now<00:01:09.800> on<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.250> edge<00:01:10.430> here<00:01:10.460> if<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.150> look<00:01:11.390> you'll

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
now on the edge here if you look you'll

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.600 
now on the edge here if you look you'll
notice<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.380> we<00:01:12.590> have<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.920> basic<00:01:13.310> screw

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
notice that we have the basic screw

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.780 
notice that we have the basic screw
basis<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.020> want<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.200> unscrew<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.580> can

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
basis so if you want to unscrew you can

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.830 
basis so if you want to unscrew you can
you<00:01:16.940> know<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.360> just<00:01:17.390> for<00:01:17.720> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
you know this is just for the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.870 
you know this is just for the
maneuvering<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.740> way<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:18.920> have<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.190> you

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
maneuvering so that way you have a you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.780 
maneuvering so that way you have a you
know<00:01:20.000> 90<00:01:20.360> degree<00:01:20.750> angle<00:01:21.220> that's<00:01:22.220> just<00:01:22.490> just

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
know 90 degree angle that's just just

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.000 
know 90 degree angle that's just just
for<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.060> angles<00:01:23.450> it's<00:01:23.630> very<00:01:23.840> basic<00:01:24.290> now<00:01:24.890> on

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
for the angles it's very basic now on

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.670 
for the angles it's very basic now on
the<00:01:25.100> back<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.580> will<00:01:25.730> notice<00:01:25.970> here<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.680> you

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
the back you will notice here that you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.650 
the back you will notice here that you
have<00:01:27.890> your<00:01:28.040> in<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.370> out<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.360> where<00:01:29.540> the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
have your in and out this is where the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.260 
have your in and out this is where the
signal<00:01:30.020> goes<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.230> so<00:01:31.070> anything<00:01:31.760> that's<00:01:31.790> coming

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
signal goes in so anything that's coming

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.510 
signal goes in so anything that's coming
from<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.780> relay<00:01:33.050> box<00:01:33.290> or<00:01:33.680> from<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.070> dimmer<00:01:34.400> or

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
from the relay box or from the dimmer or

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.280 
from the relay box or from the dimmer or
from<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.000> controller<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:35.750> going<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:35.960> go<00:01:36.080> in

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
from the controller it's going to go in

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.070 
from the controller it's going to go in
to<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:36.950> input<00:01:37.300> later<00:01:38.300> we<00:01:38.540> are<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.840> plug

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
to the input later we are going to plug

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.050 
to the input later we are going to plug
it<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.680> can<00:01:39.830> really<00:01:40.010> see<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.370> the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
it in so that you can really see the the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.150 
it in so that you can really see the the
full<00:01:41.300> configuration<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.290> then<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.920> same

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
full configuration and then the same

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.070 
full configuration and then the same
thing<00:01:43.460> here<00:01:43.730> is<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.060> output<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.780> now<00:01:44.990> if

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
thing here is the output so now if

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.110 
thing here is the output so now if
you're<00:01:45.230> going<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.440> chain<00:01:45.740> up<00:01:45.820> several<00:01:46.820> of

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
you're going to chain up several of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.910 
you're going to chain up several of
these<00:01:47.240> units<00:01:47.660> together<00:01:47.870> then<00:01:48.680> you're<00:01:48.830> going

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
these units together then you're going

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.220 
these units together then you're going
to<00:01:49.010> want<00:01:49.160> to<00:01:49.250> go<00:01:49.370> input<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.150> then<00:01:50.600> output<00:01:51.080> will

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
to want to go input and then output will

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.920 
to want to go input and then output will
go<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.680> next<00:01:51.980> input<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:53.360> therefore<00:01:53.810> you

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
go to the next input so therefore you

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.740 
go to the next input so therefore you
create<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.410> daisy<00:01:55.100> chain<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.910> light<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.510> you<00:01:56.570> can

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
create a daisy chain of light so you can

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.050 
create a daisy chain of light so you can
put<00:01:56.960> three<00:01:57.680> four<00:01:58.220> we're<00:01:58.490> going<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.670> use<00:01:58.790> for

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
put three four we're going to use for

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.330 
put three four we're going to use for
for<00:01:59.390> this<00:01:59.480> particular<00:01:59.720> example<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:01.040> can<00:02:01.220> do

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
for this particular example you can do

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.630 
for this particular example you can do
12<00:02:01.990> 20<00:02:02.990> or<00:02:03.140> more<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.770> depends<00:02:04.220> on<00:02:04.340> your

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
12 20 or more it depends on your

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.610 
12 20 or more it depends on your
controller<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.450> your<00:02:05.570> power<00:02:05.810> options<00:02:06.440> you

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
controller and your power options you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.720 
controller and your power options you
may<00:02:06.770> have<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.070> have<00:02:07.190> an<00:02:07.310> additional

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
may have to have an additional

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.060 
may have to have an additional
controller<00:02:08.149> if<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:08.480> do<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
controller if you do that so this is the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.490 
controller if you do that so this is the
fixture
