 you can say that show on my 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.600
 admiration for the coast selection 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.450
 rich that can be showing that the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.570
 Concacaf has how to defend himself in 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.890
 the world and well here we are 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.890
 unfortunately losing the match 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.160
 with this against a team that is called 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.250
 man that good got us a goal with 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.960
 with this an omen and some others 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.720
 elements and to tie the game to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.720
 61 minute and we tied the game with 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.170
 this one with ingmar 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.940
 and good with this center shot of the month and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 that ended it for one nothing more and that 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.690
 good between the defense I just do not know 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.740
 if you end up paying once again nothing 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.110
 plus 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 we saved ourselves from the game to rival us 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.759
 will win by the end and so will end the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.280
 match with a score of 1 to 1 I had 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.380
 14 shots he had 12 a very match 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.119
 hard fought and good the other party that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.610
 we are in second place with a 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.070
 point is take also have a point and 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.450
 this one after us and this pro cross 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 which is the rival of right now is in 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.039
 last place and he lost his 60th game and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.929
 well let's start the game a 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.909
 center that ends up growing martínez 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.770
 between the demands bounces the wins a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.270
 time more-martínez and mark us the 1 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.119
 they will be 114 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 we go another move at least 76 since 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.500
 does with the party we work with 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.600
 running man and we put this stroke that 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.060
 hit on the post and if it hits and good it was 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.319
 win the pole in vis lag and draw 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.330
 of the match tied him 277 if he handed us 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.580
 very much this game cost us 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.140
 a lot of work and month because no 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.209
 we will attack but because the rival player 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.860
 it has been defined pretty well and good 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.540
 after the head bounces he wins 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.430
 martínez martínez he spends robinho 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.580
 robinho who returned martínez is 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.549
 solito martínez and unmarked the 2 to 1 at 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.310
 minute 85 this looks like that's over and 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.350
 good 168 we had a great time and rita 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.290
 that the goalkeeper wants to gloger is 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.690
 adler and determines stopping adler and so 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.359
 we stopped dealt 2 to 1 the rival player 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.160
 shot eight times and we 11 and band the 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.280
 we have very complicated for the third 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.570
 our player's match against the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.060
 that we are going to face has four 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.750
 points this pro club has 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.520
 3 this 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.500
 still keeps four of us 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.110
 we only have one we are in last 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.100
 place we have to win and by galicia and 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.500
 well we started that way, I split a ball 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.050
 coleman for arrieta and arrieta that already 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.240
 it ends up bursting that post and we're leaving 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.800
 another play that I smell the desire 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.680
 then they are balls if we get this 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.200
 whiplash by the goalkeeper's stick and we 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.330
 Mark 1 to 0 to minute 11 once more 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.630
 we are starting losing a match 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.700
 and good is another play another play 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.560
 after his goal then we're going to 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.830
 make this goal with bolaños that we are going 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.750
 of three defenses 44 of people around us 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.480
 and from there we hit the ball and enter 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.370
 crossed satin without opportunity for his 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.220
 Goalkeeper that I think was weaving 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.040
 feller and good we other plays are us 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.420
 It will fix though Busting acosta 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.670
 that you may not say that 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.040
 Hernández Hernández wants low and with 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.860
 left leg marks us this goal already 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.780
 we are losing the match 2 to 1 a 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.490
 played with a lot of bad luck that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.650
 after a very good sweep of that 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.990
 player and a ball that our 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.120
 defense does not get it out marks us the 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.670
 they do not mark us the two to one with hernandez 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.380
 that is not even left-handed and well we 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.049
 we go another play a pitch for 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.730
 bolaños and bolaños that low and almost 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.200
 falling marks the 2 to 2 622 I say 32 and 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.870
 well we already managed to vote the game and 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.300
 the minute 41 this the anp is going to 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.090
 pass your disguise your goalkeeper marchetti and 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.860
 with a magnet that sweeps it 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.949
 and arrieta that bursts the goal 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.199
 we put all the power of the shot to 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.210
 shoot that goal and so go win the 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.280
 match 3 to 2 before the end of the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.139
 first time a first time that good 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.970
 it's costing us a lot because good 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.139
 You'll see how are statistics to 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.300
 halftime 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:53.229
 I have 16 guys the rival game has 2 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.270
 and with those two shots he kept us two 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.540
 times below on the scoreboard and good 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.250
 we are not going to this goal of arrieta that 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.970
 I put a little bit of the word but good 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.800
 we already scored this goal with larreta and 176 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.260
 we are going to score this goal with colima 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.530
 these later on dribble and a little bit of 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.070
 we put them this goal placed with with in 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.350
 one and we are already in the game 5 to 2 that 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.240
 second time we are doing better and 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.800
 well we go another play we won 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.740
 with Rodriguez after a wrong pass 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.450
 from the game to rival we beat him with so much 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.820
 power that hits the post and gets 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.060
 unattainable paraguay den félder and those 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.470
 desire of the match 6 to 2 and so ends the 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.660
 we won it 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.020
 six days the rival game leaves the 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.950
 match at minute 82 we throw 23 23 times 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.940
 the rival player threw 6 we won 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.420
 widely this game we see if we 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.030
 reach to move to phase to eighths of 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.950
 final and good if it was not reached and we passed 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.470
 as a second second group 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.290
 after 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.930
 and well we are facing another 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.240
 germany team that has balotelli 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.050
 and benzema 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.330
 is a great team and we are going to the 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.240
 better sections arrieta that hits the 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.190
 Latin blog for a goalkeeper and 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.310
 we had hit once more with bolaños 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:19.009
 and we are in the match 1 to 0 a minute 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.560
 53 until the second time we're 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.900
 putting to win this player in the 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.370
 player that good plays quite well and 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.250
 good a pitch for benzema gives a 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:32.360
 pass satin long benzema that beats us one 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:34.490
 once more to umaña and we mark a 165 and 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.220
 came once again because omen did what 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.810
 same and so impresses us and started to 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.960
 where the first game we played with 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.849
 costa rica but good in this match 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.979
 of the cut of the end mark them like this and 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:48.889
 another goal and good after this error 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:51.080
 with whom you navas mark us 2 to 1 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:54.050
 there was an error how good it was that we could not 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.610
 how it happened since from behind average 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.400
 court in the burst of the rival player 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.700
 it fell to benzema and benzema only the 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.890
 attack 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.380
 after a serious error of keylor 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.110
 navas to 172 we are losing the game 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.420
 and good for here the game we are 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.040
 above and above and we did not achieve it and 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.410
 after a backlash the rival game 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.150
 this goal marks us convinced that good 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.790
 it leaves us with no opportunities to say 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.420
 to keep moving forward kill us the 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.580
 party let's kill the possibility 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.680
 you are already watching how he celebrates 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.140
 driving like crazy because good I 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.120
 it really was very close to the draw 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.880
 but then I did not succeed and it ended 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.610
 losing 3 to 1 and so we are out of the 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:38.180
 global here statistics see the 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:40.610
