going up the neck but it's just gonna be

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.940 
going up the neck but it's just gonna be
on<00:00:55.510> one<00:00:55.750> string<00:00:56.080> it's<00:00:56.290> gonna<00:00:56.410> be<00:00:56.500> on<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:56.710> third

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
on one string it's gonna be on the third

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:17.749 
on one string it's gonna be on the third
string

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.350 

pretty<00:01:18.479> easy<00:01:18.630> exercise<00:01:19.820> but<00:01:20.820> maybe<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.149> little

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
pretty easy exercise but maybe a little

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.959 
pretty easy exercise but maybe a little
more<00:01:21.600> difficult<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:23.369> execute

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
more difficult to actually execute

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.050 
more difficult to actually execute
because<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.039> takes<00:01:26.280> practice<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.939> get

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
because it just takes practice to get

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:45.120 
because it just takes practice to get
this<00:01:31.340> but<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.789> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> fun

notice I'm giving a little bit of

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:59.800 
notice I'm giving a little bit of
emphasis<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.800> first<00:01:48.130> note<00:01:48.400> of<00:01:48.550> each<00:01:48.700> role

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
and all of these exercises can be moved

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:24.140 
and all of these exercises can be moved
around<00:02:04.620> yeah<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.520> started

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.550 
some of the boredom of open string rolls
over<00:03:06.750> because<00:03:07.750> you're<00:03:07.900> still<00:03:08.080> repeating

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560
