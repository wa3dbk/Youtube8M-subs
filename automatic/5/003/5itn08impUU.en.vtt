00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.050
 hello to all and crafter and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.389
 kraft his stars but we end up 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.929
 today on my pc for the beginning of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.930
 tutorial for my episode 43 deep xbox 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.720
 kraft so we find ourselves today 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.119
 for a little tip you had me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.029
 asked for how to remove 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.830
 almost all, so I guarantee you 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.540
 a suppression of the interface of 99% 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.309
 could actually have an interface 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.960
 blank when playing minecraft or 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.809
 alright to make videos what I 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 can understand how we can do on 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.860
 pc for example on pc is pretty cool 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.920
 we can completely remove the interface 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.149
 so the little trick on xbox is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:56.070
 to have so already horizons and 360 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.890
 revolution so already here are the two 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.840
 software will be in the description 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 so me then I plugged my usb stick 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.510
 with my backup so I took the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 backup starbucks I will put you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.970
 also download like that you 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 will have something up to date with the famous bug 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 will be able to see the interface so you 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.320
 put on your desk very simply 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.220
 then I delete it and so is it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180
 was waiting for him I'm going to do a little 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.340
 backup in case then so next 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.619
 you launch 360 revolution and you have 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 on minecraft so there you put open 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.700
 so you load I will not load the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.180
 copy i will charge the other you the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.259
 load and so the trick is going to be you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.490
 are forced to do like that then 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.840
 after there are tricks for example you 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.710
 can very well put a button and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.619
 everything but you will see that it is not 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.979
 as well as that so there I myself 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.530
 put that max hall in time thing and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.909
 you are going to make the first menu 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.140
 drop down of the first thing that appears 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.600
 you type s and you take that name then 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.420
 hasnia snos our blocks and snowball so 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 we must take this no no box and the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 blocks of snow and snow ball that's the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.689
 snowballs the snow is the little 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.840
 layer of snow that links the dirt 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.429
 so the mud when you play and suddenly 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.929
 that's what allows you to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.879
 to have a near- blank interface seen 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.700
 that it's an element that when the lady 1 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.140
 does not appear then it turns out that me 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.120
 when I play with it does not appear from 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.189
 everything on the screen and that when I film 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.989
 there is a tiny bit that appears 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.340
 so it's pretty weird I do not know 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.989
 why did this test for yourself 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.359
 you will see that it is good 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.950
 so you take snow suite you 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.989
 select the line by clicking here 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.900
 as if you select like that and 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.819
 you put this all to kill roussely 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.620
 selective ie put all the 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.450
 other objects on the line it's the same 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.889
 that the selected line so here is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.180
 you have the snow and then we could 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.650
 test fast done me I'm going to want to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.810
 test anyway with you you can 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.980
 maybe test with their graces so 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.180
 that they have the grass so that is the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.669
 small layer of grass that can be removed 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.540
 over the mud for example when we 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.269
 wants 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.319
 plow and so that can be 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.799
 nice so I'll put some 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.900
 each 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.519
 and I would like to test whether with a 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.230
 object that does not exist in minecraft 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.250
 what does it do so no when we 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.480
 takes an object that does not exist in 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.109
 minecraft ie an object of the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.639
 future version 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.989
 this should buggy so do not 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.810
 so show me what I'm going 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.849
 to take something that I'm sure it is 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.940
 the nether bricks do so who are the 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.340
 brick barriers of a heather so 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.879
 we do not have in the game yet so I 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.729
 I 'll give it back 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.889
 some and possibly I can 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:25.349
 even put me for example mycelium 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.209
 making of the special grass 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.010
 which is gray in fact it's like 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.000
 the grass that burned so here you are 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.290
 put a little what you and I do you 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.060
 advise to put on all our 1 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.930
 put on all our is the thing that 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.449
 walk then you put file save in 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.750
 bottom right here it's 360 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:45.590
 revolution files gold images inline 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.599
 you close everything is fine that ends well 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.729
 then one you pick up your 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:55.019
 saving you has slipped into 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:56.909
 horizons the saa bottom meters the same 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.629
 west hospital of flash blood package 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.370
 drive star go so that's it ok 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.379
 then you close and the next 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.729
 part you put the usb key on 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.489
 your xbox and the next part is 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:11.370
 so find on xbox right now 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.459
 here we are again on xbox so 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.600
 so you see that I have so in my 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.630
 closed off 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.150
 if you like the famous derb lake 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.740
 then snow so to say fast done 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.930
 so so the age and the ball so I 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.930
 will ask it to not mislead 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.660
 here for example 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.250
 So here we see here a bug a block 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.110
 a little buggy so it's the famous block 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.880
 grass that I actually took that you 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.260
 directly gives a block of land that 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.450
 when I asked him there is directly from 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.590
 the eruption 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.410
 so that can always be useful 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.300
 so do not hesitate or transfer it if 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.770
 you need it to go faster 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.000
 for decorating stuff like that 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.100
 can be quite practical so I 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.340
 I'm going to put it away with my 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.750
 koffi nasa bronze blocks standing 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.540
 and so you see that every 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.470
 sites quickly there in fact his good bah 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.070
 on empty slots 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.660
 yeah either the famous barriers 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.770
 of a heather never taken but seen 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.570
 that it does not exist on the game they 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.070
 do not appear at all 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.150
 when we go over well here but it 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.410
 word are there so first of all so you 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.460
 have your plates and you see that when 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.380
 I have the plate there is nothing that 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.600
 then appears to me on my screen there is 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.670
 has absolutely nothing that appears to you on 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.220
 the video you see a slight little spike 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.350
 white slightly on the bottom when I 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.660
 step you will see you a slight white peak 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.680
 but I sincerely on my video there is 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.200
 nothing so it's super weird 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.810
 by the way like me on my video 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.220
 there is nothing that appears and you 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.720
 have the little white spike so then 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.940
 after that it's pretty simple you're in 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.150
 video settings and you pc the interface 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.910
 you put it to 0% by setting it to 0% 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:59.190
 you delete the cross the messages and 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:00.870
 that's why you do not have 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.400
 absolutely nothing and you have a 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.800
 almost blank screen then me as I 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.270
 you say you see yourself on the video a 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.890
 little white spike but me that I 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.870
 really nothing me I really have a full 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.700
 screen without a little white peak ago 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.050
 really nothing we advise to try I 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.150
 will put my card for download 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.370
 do not hesitate to go there and you will see 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.590
 that I play in hd etc 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.230
 but you will see that on the screen you 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.510
 have nothing and that 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.280
 if even if you are not filming and you see 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.450
 that on the video there is then that in fact 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.850
 I have nothing I have not small 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.840
 plants so that disappointed me a little but 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.790
 I admit that it removes anyway 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.230
 a lot of interface after you can 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:38.500
 possibly bar add an account or 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.810
 add black stripes 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.470
 you can add an interface to 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.610
 example the camera interface so 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.080
 so here's after you to tweak 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.580
 to make videos with no rendering 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.180
 badly I think that by putting small 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.180
 black bands 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.870
 it's a little filmed effect without putting 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.490
 big bands 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.040
 here it is practical so after there but 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.650
 the trick of a button i will you 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.660
 show 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.940
 but the button is still visible 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:12.110
 as the little white piece you go 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:14.450
 see then it must be seen that I find 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.480
 that if we put ourselves on a green surface 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:20.000
 to see the gray button see you 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.370
 still more finally stands out more than 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.930
 the little white piece so here I am 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.940
 I think it's a pretty trick 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.470
 simple and that does not hurt too much after 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.570
 good always make sure to do 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:35.390
 a little a little work behind post 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:36.950
 post-filming what's this set and 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.060
 video also serves you to have all the 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.310
 references and all links to 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.030
 horizons towards my card and this is my card 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.230
 I will put it for download 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.450
 live on my channel 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:47.870
 so you have it you'll see it right
