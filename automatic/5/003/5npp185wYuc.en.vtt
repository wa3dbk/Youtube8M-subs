00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.309
 today we are at the holy park 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.349
 paul we are launching the holiday campaign 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.929
 of popular relief and this is a 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.939
 day of celebration that we offer to 1500 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.290
 people from all over the island 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.770
 france of our cities island departments 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.689
 of France 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.090
 the idea is especially to make them live 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.220
 a great moment of happiness because the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.540
 everyday life and not necessarily easy 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.540
 for the families we help 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.930
 the goal of this summer campaign is 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.110
 to leave thousands of children 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.970
 young people from families on vacation but 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.340
 we also have a rope to our bow 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.840
 this year is to make sure that 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.940
 we create the conditions for the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.890
 development of a children's movement 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.110
 friends of the world and we will have three 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.230
 kids villages buddies of the world who 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.880
 will welcome children from 50 countries 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.960
 foreigners and that's going to bring a lot of 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.220
 heat it's nice to see that 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.780
 families having fun is going all the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.470
 volunteers who are there everyone is 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.689
 caught in this whirlwind of energy that 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.729
 the kids we make it like that the 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.270
 shout behind us and it's good 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.880
 energy 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.240
 but it's really for the future 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.320
 to more fun and more beautiful for 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.320
 little ones to count them 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.049
 no but the pressure for a scam 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 it was really good 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.469
 we came to have fun with the children 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.829
 yeah that's right it's nice to 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.380
 children 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.159
 because that sum was gone with 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.549
 nie I can not bring them back here 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.049
 the journey is expensive and so that's 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.929
 really the opportunity for my children 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.189
 to be able to get out a little bit of writing 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.600
 it's not the first time I 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.670
 participates in a rescue operation 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.869
 popular it must be the third or 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.729
 fourth time and each time it's 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.950
 moments of pleasure and happiness 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.329
 shared with the kids just coming 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.640
 then to meet those who did not 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.840
 not the means to come to the concert or 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.340
 to buy cd I think it's 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.340
 important slabs and then
