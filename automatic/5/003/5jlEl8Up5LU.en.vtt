00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
 so 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.730
 it is thus possible to the mission of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.859
 manage 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.109
 everything that is out of school time gold 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.480
 so much class so the safety of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.650
 students in the school 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.199
 she manages it so a team of 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.470
 supervisors one must also manage the 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.089
 absences the students so and the delays 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.629
 it can make support now you 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:47.089
 missed courses of anything the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.019
 Lorraine justify your accent this 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.089
 means in need of engraving 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.489
 now why his costs we have 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.260
 also conflict management 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.710
 wearing class we work a lot 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.920
 in relation with therefore with parents 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.890
 consultation the social worker 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 nurse the direction of the teachers 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:16.830
 of course that I do not think either 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.690
 it is a job that is complementary 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 of ours and that is indispensable I 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.310
 am a third major teacher and so 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.710
 there we worked really all year long 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.119
 not only for problems of 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.200
 class management because I had in 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.310
 charge a class that was still 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.410
 quite dynamic 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.500
 and then after for all that is 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.500
 orientation 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:59.810
 you're here on stage Saturday in a 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.700
 college ranked zep the appellation more 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.479
 exact these networks of academic success 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 we have two holding two flagship axes 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.069
 of our project institutions that are 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.709
 fulfillment and success 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.340
 and his school life team is 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.269
 charged with an essential point in 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.200
 establishing their breast 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.569
 of schools 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000
 a fortiori in this one is the 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.440
 compliance with the rules of procedure 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.480
 thank you I do not understand the lakers and the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.390
 five is where you bring back your deficiencies 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.000
 at the last minute 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.650
 no matter then the problem of trail 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.209
 of cpe is that very often she 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.200
 works in the emergency ie 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.599
 that they have a lot to do 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.739
 all the time and so I 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.230
 the impression that they are all the time 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.680
 disturb that they do not really have the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.280
 time by moment to ask and from and 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.900
 reflect 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:01.819
 finally it's like managing 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:04.750
 serenely you tour the 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.750
 mountains please I welcome 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.970
 me the role of the cps was monitored m 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.890
 punishments when we do stupid things 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.510
 we have plenty of things yes it's a role 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.519
 important but it would be better than this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.720
 that she's not here because when we 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.430
 do nonsense afterwards if we are 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.989
 punished but the role of the cps and to us 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.120
 help when there are problems and 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.940
 watch over the students just do 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.220
 attention to college yes we 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.350
 will consider 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.320
 to ask for help from Mrs. Threats 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.770
 and if there is a group it is a big 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.500
 problem for example 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.170
 harassment 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.170
 and these practices are the piece 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.540
 7 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.130
 this task tree makes this 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.630
 really is not a job of any 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.890
 rest is a job that is 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.459
 exciting to say of those who 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.290
 the exercise 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.630
 but it's a very hard job 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:25.530
 physical who who requires qualities 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.120
 multiple me what I appreciate in the 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.760
 work of cpe is to work with 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.550
 different people that it is 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.370
 significantly more worked with 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.419
 teachers with that with students 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.820
 I really like working with 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.480
 pupils each child is different 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.220
 every child in his way of tracing 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.750
 traits and there I find that it is 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.860
 that these rich that we go a lot of 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.009
 things to learn every day 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.569
 from everyone when 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.550
 I like to do here it is to go up 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.689
 work projects on guidance 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.139
 it's something that I like too 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:04.729
 a lot everything I have the opportunity 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.729
 to do well
