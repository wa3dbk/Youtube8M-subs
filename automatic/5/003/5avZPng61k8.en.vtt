00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello everyone, today I will spend 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.569
 first test of the dryer 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.970
 ezidri ultra 1000 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.330
 I'll start with pastila as planned 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.730
 but earlier before buying this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.070
 drying the combine I have been a mystery 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 apple juice and after 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.260
 Juice left a lot of so-called 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.170
 cake that was failed 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.900
 apple drink rolled up and also 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.590
 turned out such a soft consistency when 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 figurative 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.710
 I decided to try to make from it 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.480
 marshmallow she looks very good I for 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.760
 taste since it was already failed 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.629
 added some orange juice here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.300
 boiled 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.460
 and it was about 100 grams of honey but 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.700
 my big bowl turned out this torah 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.710
 and I'm now laying the tumble dryer and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.610
 so I feel that I will even have 4 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 laying such a layer lay out 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.629
 definitely need to post with such here 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.739
 here are sections flat and not necessarily 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 on a typewriter 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.220
 separately that is, first we laid 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.430
 tier to the lush pallet section and then 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.520
 already laying we go dryer combine 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.189
 that is, a tray is taken a section for 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 poster 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.360
 laid out not to the same fit 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.119
 in the machine so i'm laying 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.600
 oil did not smear try what 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.500
 get show you a super taste and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 enjoyable 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.619
 when drying , it may even become 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.000
 better because the mass dries out and how 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.210
 drying rule 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.270
 the product is more sweet 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.619
 when the whole process will pass I can 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.170
 taste and tell you your 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.290
 taste sensations why not worth it 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.259
 mash it in the machines themselves 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.790
 because with sloppy motion 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.310
 who can get here in this 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.009
 hole and get into the motor then you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.259
 lose your warranty and can typewriter 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.439
 spoil that's why the whole layout 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.479
 produced separately and then 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.899
 The tray is transferred to this section. 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.899
 combine harvester 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.640
 as I said in the review here these here 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.890
 section sold separately in the base 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.790
 complete only one such here 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.190
 pogrom but they can be purchased separately 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.460
 which is very convenient and so the last lotos 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.020
 loaded all five trays I will have 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.700
 marshmallow apple was such a big 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.040
 apple sauce bowl 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.160
 many more he left tent exactly 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.410
 enough but I do n't have them so if 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.770
 enjoy wise to think about 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.470
 tom to get another couple of trays 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.480
 benefits are not sold grandfather what good 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.140
 these models are firms izidri 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.840
 so set the temperature at 55 degrees 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.250
 for marshmallow 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.780
 several minutes are recommended and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.040
 then drive the car and 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.349
 bed 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.390
 Now she had me a little bit in a couple 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.030
 minute will work with the lid open 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.440
 now you will hear how it makes noise after 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.269
 warming up 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.349
 close the lid let it work itself 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.959
 after closing the lid the noise decreased than 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.440
 as this machine will stand on 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.200
 the kitchen that room especially heard the noise 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.690
 there will be no average time of drying pastes 12 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.299
 14 hours but since I have it 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.269
 lined not very thin layer i think 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.610
 that the drying time will be longer since I 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.090
 I put on the night that I can with calm 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.340
 soul 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.470
 drink rest till tomorrow already there in 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.989
 during the day I will gaze 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.450
 how she behaves and when she will be 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.690
 I am ready to take off and demonstrate 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.120
 you what I did 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.050
 in general, eight hours have passed since 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.640
 bookmarks 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.340
 I look like that 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.180
 candy has, in general, and was ready 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.180
 just eight hours 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.580
 you need to take it off already because no 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.860
 nowhere 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.819
 some wet places 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.920
 fits well on a pallet 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.199
 dried so now i will 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.100
 turn off this jug on the combine and 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.500
 try marshmallow as I said 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.979
 of the pen was very strong say on 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.650
 also how products are used 3 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.590
 times juice was squeezed out then made 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.620
 drink and here's the result also marshmallow 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.630
 so it does not have a strong flavor to 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.880
 yet some apples smell from 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.990
 The only thing that I did not grease 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.169
 these layers 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.470
 and now probably will not take off very 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.570
 it is convenient to use such parts 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.349
 turn and take off the same here and there 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.680
 dried up 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.539
 but served all this time I slept 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.759
 maybe it was even possible a little bit 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:03.470
 before and check and turn off 12 hours 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.340
 average drying time here I have it 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.070
 dried up 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.770
 For a goose already absolutely should more 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.440
 it is not necessary to keep it possible because 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.960
 now more than 40 degrees 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.690
 the environment is very hot forfeit and 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.930
 apparently sushi will also be very fast we 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.659
 pay perimeter walked lifting 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.949
 the edge has reached the fog is already easier go if 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.979
 it would be oiled 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:31.039
 already been and of course from here 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.880
 I can take the first pastila ready 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.630
 roll up 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.630
 like this 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.699
 it turns out this layer is convenient 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:50.430
 keep conveniently correct pain but here 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:54.060
 the first pastila is ready for such tight 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.050
 Sausages turned out if we look at 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.349
 these ones 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.919
 layers for marshmallow this they are practically 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:04.530
 neat so i have a desire 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:08.069
 lubricate the next time with oil even while 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.080
 does not arise here if you have such 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.240
 machine do the pastille share 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.520
 please your experience whether it is necessary 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.770
 oil each time or it is a measure 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.310
 This is not necessarily I took off without 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:23.280
 problems broke nothing at the same time and 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:34.110
 clean section I have hours left and 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:36.900
 Immediately and through the pipe awesomely tastes very 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.099
 good for me and very tasty 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.220
 I am very pleased 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:44.159
 This is the first use of this dryer for me. 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.820
 I still have a couple left 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.159
 be add 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.560
 nuts or something else and try 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:52.050
 early look in the dryer and 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.180
 maybe even it won't cost 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.520
 dry but i would say it was made 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.889
 it tasted perfect 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.050
 amazing recommend highly recommend 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.030
