this<00:00:01.560> tutorial<00:00:01.860> will<00:00:02.460> explain<00:00:02.790> levels<00:00:03.240> of

this tutorial will explain levels of

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.630 
this tutorial will explain levels of
evidence<00:00:03.689> based<00:00:04.170> on<00:00:04.410> research<00:00:04.830> study<00:00:05.190> design

so<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.690> can<00:00:06.899> find<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> best<00:00:07.500> evidence

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
so that you can find the best evidence

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.070 
so that you can find the best evidence
for<00:00:08.340> your<00:00:08.429> practice<00:00:08.639> using<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.300> database<00:00:09.630> it
