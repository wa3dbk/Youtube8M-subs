00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
this style for my understanding from

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.390 
this style for my understanding from
other<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.660> dark<00:00:27.960> beers<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:28.949> stouts<00:00:29.189> and

other really dark beers like stouts and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.710 
other really dark beers like stouts and
porters<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.090> there's<00:00:30.269> not<00:00:30.359> supposed<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
porters is that there's not supposed to

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.709
