00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
okay what I want to do is make like a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.320 
okay what I want to do is make like a
windsurfer<00:01:17.720> width<00:01:18.159> bit<00:01:19.159> of<00:01:19.280> central<00:01:19.820> bamboos

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
windsurfer width bit of central bamboos

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.539 
windsurfer width bit of central bamboos
all<00:01:20.600> tied<00:01:20.899> together<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.950> then<00:01:22.729> just<00:01:23.030> with

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
all tied together and then just with

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.389 
all tied together and then just with
couple<00:01:25.549> of<00:01:26.289> outriggers<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:29.030> either<00:01:29.299> side<00:01:29.750> for

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
couple of outriggers on either side for

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.289 
couple of outriggers on either side for
stability<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:34.310> then<00:01:34.610> in<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.819> middle<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.179> this

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
stability and then in the middle of this

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.919 
stability and then in the middle of this
one<00:01:35.740> can<00:01:36.740> have<00:01:36.860> one<00:01:37.130> upright<00:01:37.600> we'd<00:01:38.600> like<00:01:38.780> an

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
one can have one upright we'd like an

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.389 
one can have one upright we'd like an
improvised<00:01:39.440> sail<00:01:39.799> on<00:01:40.069> it

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
improvised sail on it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.760 
improvised sail on it
bamboo<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.360> perfect<00:01:42.020> for<00:01:42.200> building<00:01:42.350> rafts

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
bamboo is perfect for building rafts

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.430 
bamboo is perfect for building rafts
it's<00:01:43.340> strong<00:01:43.729> doesn't<00:01:44.299> absorb<00:01:44.720> water<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
it's strong doesn't absorb water and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.949 
it's strong doesn't absorb water and
most<00:01:45.920> importantly<00:01:46.490> it's<00:01:46.729> hollow<00:01:46.970> full<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:47.810> air

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
most importantly it's hollow full of air

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.430 
most importantly it's hollow full of air
and<00:01:48.229> super<00:01:48.890> buoyant<00:01:49.899> what<00:01:50.899> I'm<00:01:50.990> trying<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.289> do

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
and super buoyant what I'm trying to do

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.480 
and super buoyant what I'm trying to do
here<00:01:51.709> is<00:01:52.520> just<00:01:52.759> create<00:01:53.149> these<00:01:53.899> for<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.229> holes

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
here is just create these for the holes

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.080 
here is just create these for the holes
through<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.670> bamboo<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:57.520> then<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.640> just<00:01:58.850> put

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
through the bamboo and then I just put

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.039 
through the bamboo and then I just put
small<00:01:59.840> of<00:02:00.020> it

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.660 

straight<00:02:03.740> through<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.159> mall<00:02:06.430> that's<00:02:07.430> going

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
straight through the mall that's going

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.480 
straight through the mall that's going
to<00:02:07.729> give<00:02:08.110> good<00:02:09.110> rigidity<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:12.920> raft<00:02:13.250> needs

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
to give good rigidity to this raft needs

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.490 
to give good rigidity to this raft needs
to<00:02:13.610> be<00:02:13.760> strong<00:02:14.060> but<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.630> also<00:02:14.750> needs<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.230> big

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
to be strong but it also needs to be big

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.570 
to be strong but it also needs to be big
enough<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.920> support<00:02:16.250> me<00:02:16.430> in<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.640> sea<00:02:16.850> swell

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.200
