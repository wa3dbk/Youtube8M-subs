00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
all right let's take a look at the next

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.720 
all right let's take a look at the next
thing<00:03:55.910> I<00:03:57.580> locate

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:13.900 

um<00:04:04.640> okay<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:07.580> yeah<00:04:08.580> so<00:04:09.390> basically<00:04:09.599> all<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.989> does

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.520 

let's<00:04:14.910> take<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> screenshot<00:04:15.599> without<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.350> UI

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
let's take a screenshot without the UI

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.000 
let's take a screenshot without the UI
present<00:04:17.540> just<00:04:18.540> as<00:04:18.840> if<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.350> were<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.799> first

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
present just as if you were in first

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.090 
present just as if you were in first
person<00:04:20.280> mode<00:04:21.109> I'm<00:04:22.109> sure<00:04:22.560> there's<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.889> way<00:04:22.979> to

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
person mode I'm sure there's a way to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.280 
person mode I'm sure there's a way to
disable<00:04:23.460> your<00:04:23.729> UI<00:04:23.970> otherwise<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.200> can

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
disable your UI otherwise so you can

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.210 
disable your UI otherwise so you can
take<00:04:25.440> those<00:04:25.560> type<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.800> pictures<00:04:26.570> but<00:04:27.919> yeah<00:04:28.919> I

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
take those type of pictures but yeah I

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.670 
take those type of pictures but yeah I
guess<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:29.700> just<00:04:29.850> makes<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.300> handy<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:31.440> know<00:04:31.560> so

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
guess it just makes it handy you know so

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.370 
guess it just makes it handy you know so
you<00:04:31.770> can<00:04:31.860> hotkey<00:04:32.729> it<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.660> then<00:04:33.930> do<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.169> at<00:04:34.260> any

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
you can hotkey it and then do it at any

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.640 
you can hotkey it and then do it at any
time<00:04:34.650> without<00:04:34.770> having<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.250> hit<00:04:35.340> any

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
time without having to hit any

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.219 
time without having to hit any
