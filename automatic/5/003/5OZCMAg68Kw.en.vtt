00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.520
 but today friends as they were I hope that 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.280
 be in awe, speak to you, 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.890
 now I bring you this game called team 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.990
 chip that from the production of give car 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.210
 company the producers that make veto 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.099
 the good berge the game I saw it now in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.990
 a tweet he put and good part when 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 you have zero downloads then they are 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.170
 I bring for the game to see 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.910
 basically this is the flag live to see 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.760
 that plan live in its essence until not 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.590
 changes nothing but the interface so 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.300
 say it and we have to do exactly 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.260
 the same 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.680
 changes are the things that the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.680
 birdie 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.059
 I think it changes how good it moves 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.750
 practically all the same is the one that 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.750
 failure is music 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.950
 and he has left to review if he continues studying 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.650
 many times the bird is going to tell you that 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 you're really stupid you do not have agility 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.150
 in your hands and all the fools 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.860
 I mean here as I am in a 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.170
 position of the camera watching the camera 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.530
 I can not record well I can not play well 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.600
 true in the rough 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.979
 and we continue because the music is 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.340
 until that this activity or the music of 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.340
 dumbass 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.460
 and well-being 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.460
 You see, I'm a bad guy 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.070
 to see to see we concentrate more for the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.070
 mother listen listen 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.140
 Well, that's all practically the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.710
 game does not have anything good credits in there 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.970
 encompass aitor programming by law and 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.460
 we can see here in all we give 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.070
 good credit more than anything what I'm going 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.780
 to play not because he is a fan of flash live 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.690
 but because they are going to give them income 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.850
 to cover so that it continues to produce this 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.130
 as it is called vettel to see if they had 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.800
 how the situation is going if you do not have 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.840
 He left a small link of how two walk 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.490
 from vettel to see and also the application 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.800
 so that the download is only for 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.400
 Android is free that only for 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.350
 android but very soon it will be for ios 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.750
 that's all because the video is super fast 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.160
 that is, it does not have much to show 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.410
 game is only for them to know the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.090
 application that's something super quickie 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.670
