Oh hundreds of guitars thousands of
guitars<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.180> uniquely<00:00:18.869> different<00:00:19.460> but<00:00:20.460> they

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
guitars all uniquely different but they

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.540 
guitars all uniquely different but they

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
all have one thing in common and that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.810 
all have one thing in common and that
strings<00:00:23.990> not<00:00:24.990> only<00:00:25.380> are<00:00:25.529> strings<00:00:25.950> an<00:00:26.189> integral

part<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> guitar<00:00:27.509> they're<00:00:28.200> the<00:00:28.349> direct

fact different tensions and gauges will
not<00:00:34.920> only<00:00:35.130> change<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> tonal<00:00:36.239> quality<00:00:36.780> of

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
not only change the tonal quality of

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.479 
not only change the tonal quality of
your<00:00:37.020> instrument<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.739> they'll<00:00:37.920> affect<00:00:38.040> your

your instrument but they'll affect your

playing style as well and that's the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.729 

I<00:00:59.690> thought<00:01:00.690> I'll<00:01:00.750> show<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.260> first

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
I thought I'll show you this one first

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.380 
I thought I'll show you this one first
since<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> oldest<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.360> most

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
since it's the oldest and the most

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
since it's the oldest and the most
simplest<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> guitars<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> know

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
simplest of the guitars and you know

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
simplest of the guitars and you know
this<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> gives<00:01:06.030> most<00:01:06.420> people

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
this is the one that gives most people

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.330 
this is the one that gives most people
most<00:01:06.960> problems<00:01:07.470> putting<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> strings<00:01:08.130> on

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
most problems putting the strings on

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980 
most problems putting the strings on
probably<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> actually

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
probably because you have to actually

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.710 
probably because you have to actually
tie<00:01:10.619> them<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.490> opposed<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.210> passing

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
tie them on as opposed to just passing

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.109 
tie them on as opposed to just passing
them<00:01:12.810> through<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.080> hole<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.920> most<00:01:14.119> electric

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
them through a hole as in most electric

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.080 
them through a hole as in most electric
guitars<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.770> acoustic<00:01:16.770> guitars<00:01:17.130> again<00:01:17.880> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
guitars and acoustic guitars again as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
guitars and acoustic guitars again as
many<00:01:18.390> variations<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
many variations but this is the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.420 
many variations but this is the
generally<00:01:20.580> accepted<00:01:20.700> way<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.390> tying<00:01:21.659> Aleman

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
generally accepted way of tying Aleman

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
generally accepted way of tying Aleman
with<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> few<00:01:23.729> changes<00:01:23.970> within<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:25.020> just

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
with a few changes within it if you just

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.649 
with a few changes within it if you just
follow<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.649> through<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.210> take<00:01:27.390> two

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
follow it through I like to take two

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.680 
follow it through I like to take two
turns<00:01:27.960> around<00:01:28.290> once<00:01:28.770> I've<00:01:28.950> passed<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.399> through

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
turns around once I've passed it through

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.540 
turns around once I've passed it through
although<00:01:30.690> one<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:31.410> work<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.009> two<00:01:32.220> gives<00:01:32.490> me

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
although one will work the two gives me

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.370 
although one will work the two gives me
your<00:01:32.880> feeling<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.690> a<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:34.050> bit<00:01:34.140> more

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
your feeling that I'm a little bit more

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.730 
your feeling that I'm a little bit more
secure<00:01:34.800> once<00:01:35.700> you've<00:01:36.090> got<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:36.420> under<00:01:37.200> itself

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
secure once you've got it under itself

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.950 
secure once you've got it under itself
twice<00:01:38.039> just<00:01:38.610> take<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> slack<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.720> tighter

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
twice just take the slack up the tighter

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.010 
twice just take the slack up the tighter
the<00:01:40.200> string<00:01:40.470> goes<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.909> more<00:01:42.090> firm<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.690> holds

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the string goes the more firm it holds

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
the string goes the more firm it holds
itself<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.979> once<00:01:44.190> it's<00:01:44.399> under<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.179> not

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
itself so once it's under there it's not

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.969 
itself so once it's under there it's not
going<00:01:45.750> anywhere<00:01:45.869> especially<00:01:46.229> once<00:01:46.800> is

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
going anywhere especially once is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.370 
going anywhere especially once is
tensioned<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.330> end<00:01:48.600> again<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.170> have

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
tensioned and at this end again you have

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.059 
tensioned and at this end again you have
to<00:01:49.560> physically<00:01:50.009> tie<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:51.679> for<00:01:52.679> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:52.950> bit

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
to physically tie it on for a little bit

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.919 
to physically tie it on for a little bit
of<00:01:53.159> extra<00:01:53.429> security<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.569> this<00:01:54.690> way<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
of extra security I do it this way I

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.859 
of extra security I do it this way I
leave<00:01:55.289> a<00:01:55.319> couple<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.130> inches<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.729> slack<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
leave a couple of inches of slack and

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.280 
leave a couple of inches of slack and
then<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.800> tie<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.220> little<00:01:59.700> knot<00:01:59.880> first<00:02:03.290> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
then just tie the little knot first to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.440 
then just tie the little knot first to
let<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> single<00:02:05.009> knot<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
let a single knot just that's all it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
let a single knot just that's all it
does<00:02:06.600> again<00:02:06.960> as<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> string<00:02:07.649> tensions<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
does again as the string tensions up it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.750 
does again as the string tensions up it
comes<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.329> itself<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:11.130> more<00:02:11.280> tension

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
comes on itself and the more tension

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.690 
comes on itself and the more tension
there<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:13.110> firmer<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.620> holds<00:02:13.980> itself<00:02:14.310> so

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
there is the firmer it holds itself so

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.670 
there is the firmer it holds itself so
the<00:02:14.850> strings<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.299> going<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.750> slide<00:02:16.049> one<00:02:16.530> of

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the strings not going to slide one of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.740 
the strings not going to slide one of
the<00:02:16.739> greatest<00:02:17.010> inventions<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.420> string

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
the greatest inventions the string

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.280 
the greatest inventions the string
winder<00:02:19.019> saves<00:02:19.910> literally<00:02:20.910> hours<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.110> that's

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
winder saves literally hours and that's

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.590 
winder saves literally hours and that's
basically<00:02:22.769> other<00:02:23.519> than<00:02:23.670> tuning<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.299> up<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
basically other than tuning it up to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.530 
basically other than tuning it up to
ditch<00:02:24.950> nylon<00:02:25.950> strings<00:02:26.250> do<00:02:26.489> tend<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.940> stretch<00:02:27.329> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
ditch nylon strings do tend to stretch a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.140 
ditch nylon strings do tend to stretch a
lot<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.070> guitars<00:02:29.430> tend<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.910> stay

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
lot and so the guitars tend to stay

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.660 
lot and so the guitars tend to stay
outta<00:02:30.450> tune<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> day<00:02:31.829> or<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.220> until<00:02:32.370> they

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
outta tune for a day or so until they

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.479 
outta tune for a day or so until they
settle<00:02:32.940> down<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.780> that's<00:02:33.989> basically<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.430> a

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489

the string through I found that that's

the string through I found that that's
holes<00:03:33.069> in<00:03:33.640> all<00:03:34.060> instances<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:35.500> only<00:03:35.739> time<00:03:35.950> I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
holes in all instances the only time I

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.680 
holes in all instances the only time I
will<00:03:36.190> lock<00:03:36.610> them<00:03:36.819> on<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.090> I'll<00:03:37.180> show<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.450> how

will lock them on and I'll show you how
I<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.170> when<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.470> get<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.860> thinner<00:03:39.160> string

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
I do that when I get to a thinner string

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.089 
I do that when I get to a thinner string
is<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.450> unwound<00:03:41.049> strings<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.650> first<00:03:41.890> a

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
is on the unwound strings the first a

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.920 
is on the unwound strings the first a
second<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.730> sometimes<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.390> third<00:03:43.630> on

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
second and sometimes the third on

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.699 
second and sometimes the third on
electric<00:03:44.440> guitars<00:03:45.450> for<00:03:46.450> several<00:03:46.840> reasons<00:03:47.380> I

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
electric guitars for several reasons I

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.009 
electric guitars for several reasons I
don't<00:03:48.370> really<00:03:48.760> know<00:03:48.970> if<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.239> needs<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.690> lock<00:03:49.840> it

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
don't really know if it needs to lock it

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.750 
don't really know if it needs to lock it
on<00:03:50.140> but<00:03:50.319> I<00:03:50.349> just<00:03:50.410> find<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.920> physically<00:03:51.400> easier

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
on but I just find it physically easier

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.690 
on but I just find it physically easier
and<00:03:52.030> again<00:03:52.299> bringing<00:03:52.599> that's<00:03:52.810> attention

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
and again bringing that's attention

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.270 
and again bringing that's attention
that's<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.420> famous<00:03:55.750> strip<00:03:56.230> 50<00:03:56.829> years<00:03:57.010> old

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
that's it the famous strip 50 years old

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.940 
that's it the famous strip 50 years old
and<00:03:57.430> still<00:03:57.670> going<00:03:57.730> strong<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.569> okay<00:03:58.959> now<00:03:59.260> this

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
and still going strong and okay now this

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.610 
and still going strong and okay now this
one<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.579> very<00:04:00.849> different<00:04:01.000> from<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.690> others<00:04:02.019> in

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
one is very different from the others in

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.229 
one is very different from the others in
as<00:04:02.799> much<00:04:03.040> as<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.370> string<00:04:03.640> comes<00:04:03.910> in<00:04:04.060> through

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
as much as the string comes in through

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.819 
as much as the string comes in through
the<00:04:04.390> back<00:04:04.569> of<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.810> guitar

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
the back of the guitar

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.059 
the back of the guitar
and<00:04:06.340> comes<00:04:06.670> out<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:06.910> front<00:04:07.620> now<00:04:08.620> when<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:08.920> get

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
and comes out the front now when you get

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.550 
and comes out the front now when you get
up<00:04:09.130> this<00:04:09.459> end<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.910> fender<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:11.049> gets<00:04:11.319> much

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
up this end on a fender it gets much

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.470 
up this end on a fender it gets much
simpler<00:04:12.010> this<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.790> caps<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.150> I'm<00:04:13.269> gonna

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
simpler this is the caps and I'm gonna

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.720 
simpler this is the caps and I'm gonna
be<00:04:13.660> putting<00:04:14.049> this<00:04:14.200> string<00:04:14.560> on<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.280> normally

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
be putting this string on so I normally

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.180 
be putting this string on so I normally
leave<00:04:15.910> another<00:04:16.269> couple<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.720> inches<00:04:16.979> about<00:04:17.979> the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
leave another couple of inches about the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.810 
leave another couple of inches about the
distance<00:04:18.639> of<00:04:18.789> another<00:04:19.060> two<00:04:20.519> machine<00:04:21.519> heads

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
distance of another two machine heads

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.120 
distance of another two machine heads
there<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.360> then<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.930> cut<00:04:23.289> it<00:04:23.320> before<00:04:23.560> as

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
there and then I cut it before as

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.770 
there and then I cut it before as
tension<00:04:24.610> it<00:04:24.729> which<00:04:24.850> is<00:04:25.000> unlike<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.510> other

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
tension it which is unlike the other

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.129 
tension it which is unlike the other
guitars<00:04:26.370> then<00:04:27.370> this<00:04:27.580> end<00:04:27.820> just<00:04:28.180> goes<00:04:28.419> straight

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
guitars then this end just goes straight

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.350 
guitars then this end just goes straight
down<00:04:29.470> into<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.280> hole<00:04:30.750> Bend<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:33.150> through<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
down into the hole Bend it through the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.870 
down into the hole Bend it through the
little<00:04:34.630> slot<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.080> then<00:04:35.169> just<00:04:35.440> crank<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.520> it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
little slot and then just crank it up it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.420 
little slot and then just crank it up it
doesn't<00:04:37.060> get<00:04:37.300> any<00:04:37.539> easier<00:04:38.100> I'll<00:04:39.100> show<00:04:39.370> you

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
doesn't get any easier I'll show you

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.070 
doesn't get any easier I'll show you
another<00:04:39.610> string<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.270> this<00:04:40.419> one<00:04:40.630> an<00:04:40.750> unwound

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
another string on this one an unwound

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.260 
another string on this one an unwound
string<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:42.039> reason<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.580> picked<00:04:42.820> this<00:04:43.210> is

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
string the reason I picked this is

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.620 
string the reason I picked this is
because<00:04:43.870> fenders<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.620> straps<00:04:45.210> have<00:04:46.210> a

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
because fenders and straps have a

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.529 
because fenders and straps have a
problem<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:48.280> other<00:04:48.490> guitars<00:04:48.910> don't<00:04:49.240> have

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
problem that other guitars don't have

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.610 
problem that other guitars don't have
and<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.350> problem<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.950> at<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:51.310> end<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:53.470> it's

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
and the problem is at this end and it's

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.770 
and the problem is at this end and it's
the<00:04:53.770> distance<00:04:54.220> from<00:04:54.700> here<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.120> where<00:04:55.660> it

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
the distance from here to where it

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.860 
the distance from here to where it
actually<00:04:56.169> attaches<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:57.070> so<00:04:57.400> long<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
actually attaches is so long and the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.870 
actually attaches is so long and the
string<00:04:59.169> needs<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.620> be<00:04:59.740> pulled<00:05:00.010> down<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.400> little

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
string needs to be pulled down a little

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.440 
string needs to be pulled down a little
bit<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.479> stop<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.900> coming<00:05:02.889> out<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.070> slot<00:05:03.610> right

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
bit to stop it coming out the slot right

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.540 
bit to stop it coming out the slot right
so<00:05:04.900> they<00:05:05.139> have<00:05:05.169> these<00:05:05.470> little<00:05:05.710> string<00:05:06.160> trees

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
so they have these little string trees

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.490 
so they have these little string trees
and<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.150> works<00:05:07.360> for<00:05:07.599> the<00:05:07.690> first<00:05:07.960> string<00:05:08.320> and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
and it works for the first string and

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.990 
and it works for the first string and
the<00:05:08.560> second<00:05:08.950> string<00:05:09.250> because<00:05:09.520> those<00:05:09.760> that

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
the second string because those that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.140 
the second string because those that
both<00:05:10.840> have<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.110> similar<00:05:11.590> problem<00:05:11.970> with<00:05:12.970> their

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
both have a similar problem with their

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.610 
both have a similar problem with their
angle<00:05:13.710> okay<00:05:14.710> now<00:05:14.919> here<00:05:15.130> we<00:05:15.160> have

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
angle okay now here we have

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.760 
angle okay now here we have
the<00:05:16.550> famous<00:05:16.850> Les<00:05:17.270> Paul<00:05:17.600> this<00:05:17.990> one<00:05:18.199> again<00:05:18.560> is

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
the famous Les Paul this one again is

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.560 
the famous Les Paul this one again is
different<00:05:19.010> from<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.490> other<00:05:19.639> three<00:05:19.760> this<00:05:20.330> has

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
different from the other three this has

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.270 
different from the other three this has
a<00:05:20.600> separate<00:05:21.050> tell<00:05:21.290> piece<00:05:21.560> which<00:05:21.830> comes<00:05:22.100> off

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
a separate tell piece which comes off

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.280 
a separate tell piece which comes off
and<00:05:22.430> gets<00:05:22.639> lost<00:05:22.910> if<00:05:23.270> you're<00:05:23.419> not<00:05:23.540> careful<00:05:23.810> and

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
and gets lost if you're not careful and

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.990 
and gets lost if you're not careful and
this<00:05:24.560> has<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.949> holes<00:05:25.190> that<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.520> string<00:05:25.790> goes

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
this has the holes that the string goes

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.610 
this has the holes that the string goes
through<00:05:26.389> okay<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.139> two<00:05:27.320> little

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
through okay and the two little

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.719 
through okay and the two little
open-ended<00:05:28.100> bits

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
open-ended bits

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.400 
open-ended bits
it's<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:29.090> string<00:05:29.360> tension<00:05:29.660> alone<00:05:30.139> that

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
it's the string tension alone that

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.200 
it's the string tension alone that
actually<00:05:30.770> holds<00:05:31.130> this<00:05:31.220> piece<00:05:31.520> on<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:32.120> I've

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
actually holds this piece on and I've

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.210 
actually holds this piece on and I've
got<00:05:32.270> all<00:05:32.540> the<00:05:32.690> strings<00:05:33.020> on<00:05:33.290> there<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:34.040> this

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
got all the strings on there and this

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.830 
got all the strings on there and this
just<00:05:34.520> hooks<00:05:34.880> on<00:05:35.600> to<00:05:35.810> there<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.330> will<00:05:38.570> hold

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
just hooks on to there and it will hold

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.780 
just hooks on to there and it will hold
itself<00:05:39.229> in<00:05:39.440> as<00:05:39.590> soon<00:05:39.740> as<00:05:39.860> I've<00:05:40.010> got<00:05:40.040> one<00:05:40.370> string

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
itself in as soon as I've got one string

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.150 
itself in as soon as I've got one string
on<00:05:40.970> go<00:05:41.479> to<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:41.720> first<00:05:42.110> string<00:05:42.470> since<00:05:42.830> it's<00:05:43.040> an

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
on go to the first string since it's an

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.689 
on go to the first string since it's an
unwound<00:05:43.460> won't<00:05:43.940> pass<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.540> through<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:46.520> hole

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
unwound won't pass it through the hole

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.180 
unwound won't pass it through the hole
in<00:05:46.940> a<00:05:47.030> capstone<00:05:47.479> first<00:05:47.840> then<00:05:48.710> I<00:05:48.830> give<00:05:49.010> myself

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
in a capstone first then I give myself

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.700 
in a capstone first then I give myself
an<00:05:49.610> inch<00:05:49.789> inch<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.389> a<00:05:50.479> half<00:05:50.510> and<00:05:51.139> just<00:05:51.410> tension

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
an inch inch and a half and just tension

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.629 
an inch inch and a half and just tension
it<00:05:52.039> a<00:05:52.070> little<00:05:52.280> bit<00:05:52.520> then<00:05:53.180> I<00:05:53.270> take<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:55.130> loose

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
it a little bit then I take the loose

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.990 
it a little bit then I take the loose
end<00:05:55.910> and<00:05:56.419> pass<00:05:56.990> it<00:05:57.289> under<00:05:57.710> itself<00:05:58.039> back

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
end and pass it under itself back

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.960 
end and pass it under itself back
towards<00:05:59.479> the<00:05:59.630> far<00:06:00.350> end<00:06:00.620> of<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.800> guitar<00:06:00.970> once

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
towards the far end of the guitar once

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.210 
towards the far end of the guitar once
it's<00:06:02.210> under<00:06:02.570> there<00:06:02.750> I<00:06:03.020> just<00:06:03.680> put<00:06:03.889> out<00:06:03.919> the

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
it's under there I just put out the
