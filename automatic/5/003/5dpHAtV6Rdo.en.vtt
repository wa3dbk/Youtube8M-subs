00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
out once it's coming out you'll notice
the<00:00:36.750> pattern<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.800> release<00:00:38.040> dates

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the pattern that as the release dates

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.979 
the pattern that as the release dates
come<00:00:38.550> up<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.000> items<00:00:39.360> become<00:00:39.719> available
