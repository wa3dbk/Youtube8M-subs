that you can't pick up with the bucket
I'm<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.490> sure<00:01:38.730> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.910> meant<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.330> able<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I'm not sure if you meant to be able to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.610 
I'm not sure if you meant to be able to
fit<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> doesn't<00:01:40.530> work<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:42.470> then<00:01:43.470> you've

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
fit that doesn't work and then you've

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.510 
fit that doesn't work and then you've
got<00:01:43.650> these<00:01:44.160> i<00:01:44.960> actually<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.140> trees<00:01:46.520> there

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
got these i actually like trees there

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.220 
got these i actually like trees there
coca<00:01:48.270> bushes<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.840> fiscally

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
coca bushes and so you can more fiscally

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.690 
coca bushes and so you can more fiscally
knock<00:01:52.410> them<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> normal<00:01:53.250> tree<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
knock them down like a normal tree and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.450 
knock them down like a normal tree and
you<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.270> these<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.740> logs<00:01:55.740> cocoa<00:01:56.190> bean

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you get these little logs cocoa bean

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.270 
you get these little logs cocoa bean
logs<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:58.050> you<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.350> knock<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.920> trees

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
logs and you can knock down the trees

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.510 
logs and you can knock down the trees
bushes<00:02:00.350> get<00:02:01.350> sapiens<00:02:03.500> it's<00:02:04.500> saplings<00:02:04.980> etc<00:02:05.430> or

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
bushes get sapiens it's saplings etc or

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
bushes get sapiens it's saplings etc or
asleep<00:02:05.880> artists<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.899> actually<00:02:10.019> pick

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
asleep artists and you can actually pick

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.580 
asleep artists and you can actually pick
up<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.409> leaves<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:10.830> well<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:12.990> if<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
up the leaves as well so if you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.550 
up the leaves as well so if you
obviously<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.040> sheer<00:02:15.620> go

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.500 

so<00:02:20.560> we'll<00:02:20.710> slow<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.370> should<00:02:21.610> be<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:21.970> it's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
so we'll slow that it should be but it's

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.120 
so we'll slow that it should be but it's
fine<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.050> get<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> cocoa<00:02:23.620> bean<00:02:23.650> leaves

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
fine so you get the cocoa bean leaves

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.570 
fine so you get the cocoa bean leaves
and<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.550> can<00:02:24.790> see<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:25.600> normal<00:02:25.930> leaves

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and you can see and like normal leaves

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.680 
and you can see and like normal leaves
um<00:02:27.580> another<00:02:28.090> thing<00:02:28.210> you<00:02:28.420> have<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:30.690> Easter

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
um another thing you have is a Easter

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.690

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
flower put in there actually um

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.100 
flower put in there actually um
yeah<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.000> have<00:02:37.090> these<00:02:37.300> two<00:02:37.690> flower<00:02:38.040> that's

yeah so you have these two flower that's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.360 
yeah so you have these two flower that's
stuff<00:02:41.110> I'll<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.350> think<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.740> adds<00:02:41.860> new<00:02:42.130> color

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
stuff I'll I think it adds new color

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.460 
stuff I'll I think it adds new color
will<00:02:43.060> eventually<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.880> um<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.000> can<00:02:46.900> find<00:02:47.200> one

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
will eventually and um I can find one

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.120 
will eventually and um I can find one
around<00:02:47.650> here<00:02:48.040> somewhere<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.990> Easter<00:02:50.709> eggs

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
around here somewhere the Easter eggs

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.810 
around here somewhere the Easter eggs
are<00:02:52.260> dumb<00:02:53.260> items<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.980> ground<00:02:54.250> beef<00:02:54.580> and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
are dumb items on the ground beef and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.750 
are dumb items on the ground beef and
and<00:02:55.830> top<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:57.160> one<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.770> these<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.550> just

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
and top this one so these you can just

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.560 
and top this one so these you can just
find<00:03:00.940> randomly<00:03:01.630> placed<00:03:01.870> around<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.170> bar<00:03:02.260> and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
find randomly placed around the bar and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.090 
find randomly placed around the bar and
as<00:03:04.570> we<00:03:04.959> found<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.350> each<00:03:05.440> day<00:03:05.650> we<00:03:05.830> actually

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
as we found that each day we actually

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.900 
as we found that each day we actually
found<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.370> tune<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:09.040> before<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.430> go<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.880> I

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
found a tune but before I go to that I

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.370 
found a tune but before I go to that I
will<00:03:10.120> shade<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.360> chocolate<00:03:10.959> eggs<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:11.320> you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
will shade the chocolate eggs so you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.900 
will shade the chocolate eggs so you
obviously<00:03:11.530> get<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.950> chocolate<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.550> that's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
obviously get the chocolate and that's

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.440 
obviously get the chocolate and that's
edible<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.100> actually<00:03:15.340> said<00:03:15.880> quite<00:03:16.209> an

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
edible so that actually said quite an

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.570 
edible so that actually said quite an
effective<00:03:17.380> way<00:03:17.770> of<00:03:17.800> healing<00:03:18.430> yourself<00:03:18.700> and

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
effective way of healing yourself and
