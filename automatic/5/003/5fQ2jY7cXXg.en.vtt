00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.350
 this time we will learn to play 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.870
 one of your most predictions 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.219
 repeated as gratitude repaired 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.780
 everything to do this video lesson of 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.990
 rammstein to have announced it well 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.330
 light air you see, you are going to see that it is a 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.480
 video lesson simple 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.540
 tuning situates so starting from the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.750
 nitro we lower all the strings a note 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.940
 it's also worth a couple of hits 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.550
 put a couple of notes so that it is 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.550
 more complete in this intro 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.699
 and what does the keyboardist do? 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.570
 we have just this way of doing it with 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:55.890
 the 21 fret 5 string guitar 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.809
 5 of 23 fret 7 of the string 3 is worth and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.969
 the rope 4 we leave it to the air 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.930
 we cover a little with your finger 1 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.930
 to keep it from ringing 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.460
 we go down 3 after 3 frets 8 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.210
 we slide from 3 to 5 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.300
 and again slide eight or ten personal 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.370
 and again we would start again 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.610
 it's worth that you have seen the games in 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.260
 the ropes and flavors of power 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.080
 we had two ropes to have a place 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.640
 all the power chords we do 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.340
 all in the same dishes worth 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.159
 so 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.759
 a little bit of pallium you already know 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.759
 little rope 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.910
 and then here is another cash that 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.030
 oil there is bottom that makes a kind 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.030
 of 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.560
 it's worth we do it in the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.600
 string 5 fret 3 slide to 1 and in 1 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.600
 we let go so that it sounds dance 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.610
 and the other game that we're going to do 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.459
 which is from 6 on the rope 5 in 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.890
 the rope 4 we leave it cover a 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.650
 little finger 1 finger 3 what 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.780
 we put on the 8th fret of the string 3 and 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.490
 we make slade towards 3 of rope 5 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.930
 with that same port of balÃ©s is the game 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.930
 from the jack you know 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.150
 and from here the game that he makes is 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.150
 just with the rope if you go out 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.350
 ok that's the game then they kept 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.630
 a couple of parts that are based on 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.920
 the same chords are worth in this case of 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.590
 power that would be on the frets 7 8 5 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.640
 and the air is worth then they would be something like that 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.640
 how do we start the air 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.099
 as you have seen what is time is 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.099
 continuous is very the potato ta ta ta 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.970
 7 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.750
 5 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.750
 8 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.099
 and the body asks you here to splice 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.000
 with the next rixos deis account now 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.680
 if it comes natural 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.680
 let's do it all the tug 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.580
 walesa me is one of the things that I most 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.710
 like the rating issues is that it is 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.960
 how do some riffs link with others with 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.610
 that natural way that is that as 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.560
 you're playing what you've heard the song and 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.900
 He asks for your body and you do not need to be 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.730
 there pending of what I do because it is 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.870
 somehow it comes out only worth 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.550
 there would be a single gray and a small 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.870
 cash that I will explain later 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.450
 first you write service that is 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.450
 based on this same thing and it's the ruiz 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.820
 so to speak frame in which it is 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.400
 same but slowly they are and they are 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.820
 long chords would be two of strings and 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.820
 d out 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.810
 and is it again that laugh again 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.810
 the body 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.280
 stop 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.470
 and now we are going to make you a small 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.260
 cortecito to explain you that effect that 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.910
 they do with the keyboard we're going to 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.729
 put us to the guitar 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.010
 to leave the finished topic is valid for 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.120
 that sounds a lot more complete is worth 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.370
 one of lords we've seen at 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.320
 principle that is with the rope if it comes out 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.210
 of notes on the subject that you have to in 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.930
 what effect are we going to make? 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.930
 with the guitar 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.770
 well come up we could serve 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.390
 then it's the same types of chords 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.950
 that we have been doing before with the 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.540
 I play the octaves that would be a kind 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.400
 of power chord but removing what 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.410
 which is the third finger going down in one 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.070
 rope vall and releasing the five 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:20.690
 losada four so I repeat from 1 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:23.510
 fret 12 string 503 fret 14 string 3 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.220
 ok and the rope 4 we leave it alone and 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.230
 nothing we cover a little with the student 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.600
 so that it does not sound and 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.980
 and we look for a little bit of distortion 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.700
 then with the big toe in the 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.230
 strings with the hand of the pick in the 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.580
 ropes 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:42.800
 it's as if we were going to make a 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.130
 harmonic and then it would be to do the 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.130
 game 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:53.629
 and we download that same drawing of the chord 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.629
 Fret number 15 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.160
 ballack that would be the last single 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:11.100
 to finish 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:14.190
 Ramstein mount this light theme 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.530
 I hope I have served you and 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.750
