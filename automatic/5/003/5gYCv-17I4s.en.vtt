well once again I have played around

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.240 
well once again I have played around
with<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.699> gray<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.829> dark<00:00:59.039> gray

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
with the gray and you know the dark gray

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.939 
with the gray and you know the dark gray

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
with the snow blocks okay I think that a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.890 
with the snow blocks okay I think that a
dark<00:01:05.580> gray<00:01:05.729> looks<00:01:05.970> pretty<00:01:06.390> cool<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
dark gray looks pretty cool for the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.859 
dark gray looks pretty cool for the
exterior<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> try<00:01:09.570> or

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
exterior so probably going to try or

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.590 
exterior so probably going to try or
test<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.439> other<00:01:10.619> colors<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.070> well<00:01:11.600> something

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
test some other colors as well something

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.929 
test some other colors as well something
is<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.840> fire<00:01:13.280> probably<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> fireplace<00:01:14.790> in

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
