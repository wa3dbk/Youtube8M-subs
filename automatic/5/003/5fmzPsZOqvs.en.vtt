00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you know I love good sound and I hooked

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.010 
you know I love good sound and I hooked
up<00:01:51.689> placing<00:01:52.380> 3<00:01:52.560> through<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.130> know<00:01:54.020> digitally

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
up placing 3 through you know digitally

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
up placing 3 through you know digitally
through<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:55.350> pc<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:55.920> produced<00:01:56.280> sound<00:01:56.549> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
through my pc which produced sound and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.940 
through my pc which produced sound and
it<00:01:57.000> was<00:01:57.180> incredible<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.409> yeah<00:01:58.680> that's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it was incredible so yeah that's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.080 
it was incredible so yeah that's
definitely<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.430> best<00:01:59.640> course<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.030> do

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
definitely the best course you can do

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.600 
definitely the best course you can do
that<00:02:00.180> with<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.509> xbox<00:02:00.990> 360<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.619> well

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that with your xbox 360 as well

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.070 
that with your xbox 360 as well
now<00:02:02.730> another<00:02:03.390> thing<00:02:03.480> is<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:06.810> also

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
now another thing is is that it's also

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.900 
now another thing is is that it's also
about<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.590> router<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:08.369> my<00:02:08.670> router

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
about your router now my router

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.370 
about your router now my router
apparently<00:02:09.630> judging<00:02:09.960> from<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.200> other

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
apparently judging from what other

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.900 
apparently judging from what other
PlayStation<00:02:10.860> members<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.280> set<00:02:11.520> our<00:02:11.730> place

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
PlayStation members that set our place

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
PlayStation members that set our place
to<00:02:12.060> owners<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.480> there<00:02:12.630> they<00:02:12.960> said<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.260> those

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to owners on there they said that those

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.260 
to owners on there they said that those
likely<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> calls<00:02:14.220> maybe<00:02:14.460> my<00:02:14.670> router<00:02:14.910> which

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
likely the calls maybe my router which

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.870 
likely the calls maybe my router which
actually<00:02:15.600> might<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.680> problem<00:02:17.010> because<00:02:17.610> my

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
actually might be a problem because my

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.430 
actually might be a problem because my
route<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.210> not<00:02:18.360> exactly<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> best<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.350> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
route is not exactly the best on the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.220 
route is not exactly the best on the
market<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.240> most<00:02:21.240> likely<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.540> will<00:02:21.600> see<00:02:21.960> exactly

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
market so most likely I will see exactly

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.900 
market so most likely I will see exactly
what's<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.920> be<00:02:23.070> said<00:02:23.220> about<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
what's to be said about that in the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.350 
what's to be said about that in the
future<00:02:25.850> let's<00:02:26.850> see<00:02:27.000> anything<00:02:27.420> else<00:02:27.540> um

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.990 

the<00:02:31.930> controllers<00:02:32.470> are<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:33.310> my<00:02:33.550> opinion<00:02:33.820> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the controllers are in my opinion the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.580 
the controllers are in my opinion the
controls<00:02:34.360> are<00:02:34.540> hidden<00:02:34.780> mist<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.200> mean<00:02:35.440> yes

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
controls are hidden mist I mean yes

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
control us a good such we can charge it

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.270 
control us a good such we can charge it
up<00:02:37.330> but<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.200> mean<00:02:38.560> I'm<00:02:38.740> just<00:02:38.800> saying<00:02:39.100> me

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
up but I mean I'm just saying me

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.370 
up but I mean I'm just saying me
personally<00:02:39.700> I've<00:02:39.820> got<00:02:39.970> using<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.450> my<00:02:40.570> xbox<00:02:40.960> 360

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
personally I've got using to my xbox 360

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.340 
personally I've got using to my xbox 360
controller<00:02:41.410> because<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.370> used<00:02:42.550> on<00:02:42.730> my<00:02:42.790> pc<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.660> it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
controller because I used on my pc so it

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.260 
controller because I used on my pc so it
does<00:02:44.560> get<00:02:44.710> kind<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.010> hard<00:02:45.280> for<00:02:45.340> me<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.820> play<00:02:46.090> it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
does get kind of hard for me to play it

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.750 
does get kind of hard for me to play it
on<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:47.320> know<00:02:47.410> play<00:02:47.620> user<00:02:47.890> control<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.640> my

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
on you know play user control this is my

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.000 
on you know play user control this is my
preference<00:02:49.030> that's<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.690> how<00:02:50.050> things<00:02:50.500> go

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
preference that's just how things go

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.250 
preference that's just how things go
with<00:02:51.190> me<00:02:51.400> that's<00:02:51.640> no<00:02:51.820> reason<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.540> not<00:02:52.810> buy<00:02:53.020> one

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
with me that's no reason to not buy one

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.170 
with me that's no reason to not buy one
at<00:02:53.380> all<00:02:53.500> because<00:02:54.160> there<00:02:54.400> are<00:02:54.520> ways<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.760> hook<00:02:55.060> up

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
at all because there are ways to hook up

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.670 
at all because there are ways to hook up
loan<00:02:55.360> point<00:02:56.020> case<00:02:56.170> isn't<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.530> reason

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
loan point case isn't that reason

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.940 
loan point case isn't that reason
apartment<00:02:57.130> at<00:02:57.190> all<00:02:57.930> another<00:02:58.930> thing<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.140> the

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
360 that was wrong actually there was a

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.150 
360 that was wrong actually there was a
lot<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:27.880> net<00:03:28.300> was<00:03:28.570> everyone<00:03:29.230> I'm<00:03:29.380> used<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.070> I

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
lot of net was everyone I'm used and I

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.740 
lot of net was everyone I'm used and I
have<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.370> lot<00:03:30.640> more<00:03:30.850> thing<00:03:31.150> around<00:03:31.360> here<00:03:31.570> and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
one that used was compatible so also

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.940
