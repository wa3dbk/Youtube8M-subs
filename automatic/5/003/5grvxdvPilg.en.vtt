00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
do need the transformation for this so

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.490 
do need the transformation for this so
more<00:00:23.189> than<00:00:23.490> fifty<00:00:23.910> five<00:00:24.119> lovely<00:00:24.689> mumbo<00:00:24.990> tokens

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and yeah this transformation is 25 and I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.780 
and yeah this transformation is 25 and I
just<00:01:25.619> wanted<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.950> show<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> because<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.759> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
just wanted to show it because it is a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.580 
just wanted to show it because it is a
necessity<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.900> getting<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.509> transformation

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
necessity for getting the transformation

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.819 
necessity for getting the transformation
so<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.950> know<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.540> necessity<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.290> getting

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
so I know it is a necessity for getting

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.450 
so I know it is a necessity for getting
the<00:01:36.020> gin<00:01:37.020> journals<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.590> that's<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.340> this

worm yeah oh and this B you press you
keep<00:01:49.630> hold<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:50.050> B<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.800> go<00:01:50.950> faster<00:01:51.490> but<00:01:51.970> there's

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
keep hold of B to go faster but there's

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.620 
keep hold of B to go faster but there's
no<00:01:52.630> attack<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.340> be<00:01:54.520> very<00:01:54.790> careful<00:01:55.150> if<00:01:55.479> you're

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
the subbers are all here because I

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.469 
the subbers are all here because I
undefeated<00:02:06.520> them<00:02:06.670> yet<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:06.910> is<00:02:07.210> one<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.420> the

jiggy's but if you visit the Beehive

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.250 
jiggy's but if you visit the Beehive
before<00:02:12.370> getting<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> jiggy<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.300> summer<00:02:13.600> the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
before getting the jiggy in summer the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.460 
before getting the jiggy in summer the
jig<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.590> there<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:16.090> one<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.810> isn't<00:02:17.230> there

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
jig is there in this one it isn't there

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.190 
jig is there in this one it isn't there
so<00:02:18.220> once<00:02:18.910> again<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.630> zippers<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:20.050> there

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
so once again the zippers are there
