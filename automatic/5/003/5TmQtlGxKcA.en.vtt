game<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.080> me<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.710> being<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> radar

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
game for me not being on the radar

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
game for me not being on the radar
really<00:01:20.939> slows<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> pace<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> game<00:01:22.170> down

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
really slows the pace of the game down

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.200 
really slows the pace of the game down
and<00:01:22.799> don't<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.130> me<00:01:23.250> wrong<00:01:23.280> I'll<00:01:23.640> use<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> few

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and don't get me wrong I'll use it a few

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.420 
and don't get me wrong I'll use it a few
times<00:01:24.360> myself<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.439> real<00:01:25.650> still<00:01:25.950> flowed<00:01:26.220> out

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
times myself and a real still flowed out

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160 
times myself and a real still flowed out
but<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> find<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.330> having<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.780> perky

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
but I find that just having this perky

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200 
but I find that just having this perky
in<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> game<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.740> changes<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> pace<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
in the game just changes the pace of it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.850 
in the game just changes the pace of it
and<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.479> makes<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> lot<00:01:31.320> more<00:01:31.530> annoying

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and just makes it a lot more annoying

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
and just makes it a lot more annoying
than<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.520> needs<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> chose<00:01:33.540> assessing

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
than it needs to be so I chose assessing

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.899 
than it needs to be so I chose assessing
in<00:01:34.229> particular<00:01:34.560> because<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> did<00:01:35.579> find<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
in particular because I did find that

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.609 
in particular because I did find that

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
the game very weird and very kind of

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.150 
the game very weird and very kind of
glitchy<00:04:30.020> almost<00:04:30.620> sometimes<00:04:30.830> when<00:04:31.130> people

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
glitchy almost sometimes when people

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.580 
glitchy almost sometimes when people
were<00:04:31.490> using<00:04:31.730> it<00:04:32.000> so<00:04:32.450> another<00:04:32.810> absolute<00:04:33.350> bane

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590

this when I really shouldn't and stopped

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.100 
this when I really shouldn't and stopped
some<00:04:37.760> real<00:04:37.970> nice<00:04:38.120> shrieks<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.540> like<00:04:38.690> going<00:04:38.930> on

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
the game at all it was a silly idea so

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.860 
the game at all it was a silly idea so
number<00:04:44.420> 2<00:04:44.600> goes<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:44.960> commando<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:50.360> my<00:04:50.540> number

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
number 2 goes to commando so my number

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.140 
number 2 goes to commando so my number
one<00:04:51.080> worst<00:04:51.440> perk<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:52.070> all<00:04:52.280> time<00:04:52.610> in<00:04:52.910> Call<00:04:53.120> of

Duty goes to my Tom I absolutely hate
this<00:04:56.840> perk<00:04:57.140> it<00:04:57.410> seemed<00:04:57.770> ridiculous<00:04:58.700> when<00:04:59.030> you

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
this perk it seemed ridiculous when you

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.630 
this perk it seemed ridiculous when you
take<00:04:59.420> a<00:04:59.450> death<00:04:59.810> you<00:05:00.320> automatically<00:05:01.040> drop<00:05:01.430> a

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
take a death you automatically drop a

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.820 
take a death you automatically drop a
live<00:05:01.910> grenade<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.810> don't<00:05:03.080> know<00:05:03.260> why<00:05:03.620> they

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
live grenade I don't know why they

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.590 
live grenade I don't know why they
thought<00:05:03.980> this<00:05:04.160> would<00:05:04.310> be<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.430> fun<00:05:04.700> idea<00:05:04.730> how

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
thought this would be a fun idea how

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.570 
thought this would be a fun idea how
they<00:05:05.840> thought<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.110> would<00:05:06.200> be<00:05:06.290> a<00:05:06.320> good<00:05:06.530> idea<00:05:06.710> who

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
they thought it would be a good idea who

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.730 
they thought it would be a good idea who
knows<00:05:07.850> but<00:05:08.330> they<00:05:08.450> put<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:08.840> in<00:05:08.960> in<00:05:09.260> cod4

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
knows but they put it in in cod4

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.220 
knows but they put it in in cod4
probably<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.400> worst<00:05:10.580> thing<00:05:10.850> about<00:05:10.970> cod4<00:05:11.510> was

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
probably the worst thing about cod4 was

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.080 
probably the worst thing about cod4 was
the<00:05:12.380> ridiculous<00:05:12.980> martyrdom<00:05:13.580> don't<00:05:13.850> forget<00:05:14.030> he

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
the ridiculous martyrdom don't forget he

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.490 
the ridiculous martyrdom don't forget he
had<00:05:14.210> free<00:05:14.420> time<00:05:14.600> frag<00:05:14.930> in<00:05:15.080> there<00:05:15.200> as<00:05:15.290> well<00:05:15.440> so

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
had free time frag in there as well so

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.380 
had free time frag in there as well so
if<00:05:15.710> you<00:05:15.800> had<00:05:15.890> free<00:05:16.100> times<00:05:16.310> frag<00:05:16.670> and<00:05:16.880> while

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
if you had free times frag and while

Adam<00:05:17.480> you<00:05:17.810> had<00:05:18.020> four<00:05:18.380> grenades<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.520> on<00:05:19.610> some

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
Adam you had four grenades and on some

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.930 
Adam you had four grenades and on some
maps<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.810> made<00:05:21.080> it<00:05:21.260> really<00:05:21.650> stupid<00:05:22.490> it<00:05:22.670> and<00:05:22.850> it

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
maps it made it really stupid it and it

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.900 
maps it made it really stupid it and it
just<00:05:23.150> seemed<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.480> completely<00:05:24.440> only<00:05:25.250> benefit

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910

the bad players anyone who's decent

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.320 
the bad players anyone who's decent

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
you and sometimes there was no getting

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.050 
you and sometimes there was no getting
away<00:05:42.020> from<00:05:42.290> them<00:05:42.440> so<00:05:42.650> my<00:05:43.100> all-time<00:05:43.520> worst<00:05:43.760> perk

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
away from them so my all-time worst perk

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.700
