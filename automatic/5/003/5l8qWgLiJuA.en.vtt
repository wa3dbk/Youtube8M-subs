actually had to write up to four papers
per<00:01:43.070> week<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:43.880> topics<00:01:44.240> are<00:01:44.360> very

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
per week but the topics are very

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.389

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.760 
interesting and I did learn a lot from
it<00:01:46.729> another<00:01:47.330> tip<00:01:47.659> of<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:48.020> would<00:01:48.320> give<00:01:48.530> for

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
it another tip of that I would give for

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.340 
it another tip of that I would give for
pre-vet<00:01:49.549> student<00:01:49.909> is<00:01:50.119> that<00:01:50.509> try<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.110> get<00:01:51.259> to

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
pre-vet student is that try to get to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.779 
pre-vet student is that try to get to
know<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.560> graduate<00:01:51.860> students<00:01:52.250> here<00:01:52.399> they

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
know the graduate students here they

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.669 
know the graduate students here they
provides<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:53.390> much<00:01:53.509> volunteer<00:01:54.020> opportunities

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
provides so much volunteer opportunities

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.310 
provides so much volunteer opportunities
with<00:01:55.009> research<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.869> honestly<00:01:56.869> who<00:01:57.080> does<00:01:57.229> it

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
with research and honestly who does it

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
with research and honestly who does it
like<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.560> free<00:01:57.710> help

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
