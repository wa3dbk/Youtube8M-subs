00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.150 
and then I can pick up where I left off
just<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.149> easily<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:58.320> there<00:00:58.469> won't<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.010> much

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
just as easily but there won't be much

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.729 
just as easily but there won't be much
differences<00:00:59.670> between<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.600> road<00:01:01.230> 10<00:01:01.410> million

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
all the goodness that was in the road 10

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.719 
all the goodness that was in the road 10
million<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.890> won't<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.280> often

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
on and actually I think what happened

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.330 
on and actually I think what happened
was<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.180> think<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.570> way<00:04:00.690> up<00:04:00.900> glitched

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
was is that I think the way up glitched

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.910 
was is that I think the way up glitched
because<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.790> searched<00:04:03.540> from<00:04:03.870> i<00:04:04.080> saw<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.799> i

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
because I searched from i saw and i

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.680 
because I searched from i saw and i
thought<00:04:05.160> now<00:04:05.430> looks<00:04:05.610> quite<00:04:05.790> cheap<00:04:06.000> i<00:04:06.180> Luke<00:04:06.420> if

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
thought now looks quite cheap i Luke if

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.150 
thought now looks quite cheap i Luke if
I<00:04:06.780> didn't<00:04:07.049> add<00:04:07.140> him<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.290> my<00:04:07.410> watch<00:04:07.650> list<00:04:07.680> and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
I didn't add him to my watch list and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.560 
I didn't add him to my watch list and
then<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.910> said<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.269> there<00:04:09.360> was<00:04:09.450> nothing

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
then it said that there was nothing

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.620 
then it said that there was nothing
under<00:04:09.989> 200k<00:04:10.670> like<00:04:11.670> for<00:04:11.880> anyone<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.360> had<00:04:12.480> to

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.789 
search a specific details to find him so
I<00:04:15.000> think<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.390> web<00:04:15.870> app<00:04:16.079> was<00:04:16.260> glitching<00:04:16.530> and

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
I think the web app was glitching and

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.740 
I think the web app was glitching and
hating<00:04:17.100> him<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.459> was<00:04:17.609> incredibly<00:04:18.150> lucky<00:04:18.570> and

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
hating him so I was incredibly lucky and

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.070 
hating him so I was incredibly lucky and
