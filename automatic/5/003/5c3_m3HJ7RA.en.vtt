00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.750
 lex after all being on the ground with us was the big man at biodiversity 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.880
 he must also excel himself what you have played a wonderful game 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:14.909
 he is not expected to get a kikkoman very weak at the start 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.409
 with the team 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.799
 well there I am actually in the team designated man to actually 

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:23.979
 he simply takes the team there and also immediately pushes forward 

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.719
 and tries to force the equalizer as quickly as possible 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.189
 luckily I got the ball from my feet and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.519
 he shoots me in 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.579
 and from that moment on I immediately went forward again 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.940
 to get the team forward we finally have 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.920
 that we shook each other a bit because it was dramatic at the start 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.570
 from our janus crazier often often the start is good should be less now it was 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.570
 exactly the other way around actually yes no that's certainly certain after 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 if the score turns out to be so many times 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.310
 all may always have a bad start so little emma well it was the start 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.710
 his start was dramatic marco b team in tow to take the audience 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.440
 try to get well it always has an advantage to you 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.370
 you are not only interested with that goal but also the man of the first in the in 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.159
 the bag is also just that the unions 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.819
 Real if is or were you very important disadvantage was that I want tasty 

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.870
 competition today certainly for myself also an I think other guys too 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.470
 have played a good game man well we just need this line 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.730
 need to extend 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.160
 damn in is that starts then just come back because then walk this 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.659
 would explain 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.109
 what then the reversal brings what will make the big difference after twenty minutes 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.130
 I think it is mainly because of the fact that we start very weak and 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.220
 days were constantly playing the rear window were constantly albert 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.940
 ballin we were looking for we were constantly looking for an erwin the keeper 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.990
 love challenges playing the long ball and yes the second half didn't fall either 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.150
 good and therefore hattem nrc constant possession and yes ultimately a state 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.900
 that first goal too 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.560
 a long ball actually well I miss a fantastic goal from the police 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
 yes that may not happen again and yes i think it 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.010
 solutions on the outside to smile ford coppola in this competition 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.430
 could not reach them 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.479
 your outdated vitesse and twente still have a catch up credit 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.279
 battle for place two is completely open after tonight 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.799
 an absolute I think yes yes I have never given up the place two 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.439
 championship we are not talking about anything at all and I want that too 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.689
 not at all but 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.669
 yes place 2 is for us two people a goal where there where angry 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:24.619
 I think messages are yes
