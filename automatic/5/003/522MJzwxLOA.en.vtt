the way it used to be used to be under

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.399 
the way it used to be used to be under
under<00:01:33.299> let's<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.670> under<00:01:35.670> thousand<00:01:36.479> rpms<00:01:37.020> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
under let's see under thousand rpms and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.340 
under let's see under thousand rpms and
now<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.170> 11-12

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
now it's up on the 11-12

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.620 
now it's up on the 11-12
I<00:01:40.500> will<00:01:41.490> say<00:01:43.820> don't<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> anywhere<00:01:45.479> else

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
I will say don't take it anywhere else

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.560 
I will say don't take it anywhere else
don't<00:01:46.020> change<00:01:46.320> any<00:01:47.100> sensors<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> car

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
don't change any sensors from the car

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.240 
don't change any sensors from the car
your<00:01:49.439> master<00:01:50.070> flow<00:01:50.220> sensor<00:01:51.229> well<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:53.040> want

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
your master flow sensor well if you want

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.539 
your master flow sensor well if you want
to<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.640> replace<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:55.340> clean<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
to you can replace it if not clean it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.219 
to you can replace it if not clean it
and<00:01:58.009> you<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.189> also<00:01:59.340> try<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.729> unplug<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.079> if

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and you can also try to unplug it and if

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.770 
and you can also try to unplug it and if
your<00:02:01.409> car<00:02:01.619> doesn't<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.130> anything<00:02:02.630> when<00:02:03.630> it's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
your car doesn't do anything when it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.320 
your car doesn't do anything when it's
on<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.799> means<00:02:05.899> this<00:02:06.899> sensor<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.409> bad

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
on that means this sensor is bad

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.950 
on that means this sensor is bad
and<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.990> have<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.320> replace<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:11.030> or<00:02:12.030> clean<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.720> if

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
and we have to replace it or clean it if

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.660 
and we have to replace it or clean it if
it<00:02:13.170> works<00:02:15.350> well<00:02:16.350> than<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.740> don't<00:02:17.070> change<00:02:17.310> any

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it works well than that don't change any

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.390 
it works well than that don't change any
old<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.480> censors<00:02:18.930> if<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.260> take<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.770> up<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
old to censors if we take it to up the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.880 
old to censors if we take it to up the
diagnostic<00:02:21.180> they're<00:02:22.140> gonna<00:02:22.260> tell<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.680> that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.820 
diagnostic they're gonna tell you that
the<00:02:23.010> o2<00:02:23.190> sensors<00:02:23.850> are<00:02:24.150> bad<00:02:24.500> that's<00:02:25.500> why<00:02:25.680> they

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the o2 sensors are bad that's why they

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.400 
the o2 sensors are bad that's why they
made<00:02:26.670> me<00:02:26.790> change<00:02:26.970> all<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.390> o2<00:02:27.690> sensors<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
made me change all the o2 sensors the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.750 
made me change all the o2 sensors the
pressures<00:02:29.210> sensors<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:31.530> Dan<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:32.490> was<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
pressures sensors and I Dan it was a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.830 
pressures sensors and I Dan it was a
master<00:02:33.180> flow<00:02:33.390> sensor<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.850> if<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.330> have<00:02:36.510> an<00:02:36.630> air

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
master flow sensor so if you have an air

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.380 
master flow sensor so if you have an air
intake<00:02:37.020> here<00:02:37.490> what<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.610> wanna<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.060> want

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
intake here what you wanna do you want

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.970 
intake here what you wanna do you want
to<00:02:39.450> wrap<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.690> right<00:02:39.990> here<00:02:40.230> with<00:02:40.470> electrical

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
to wrap it right here with electrical

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.400 
to wrap it right here with electrical
tape<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.910> your<00:02:42.540> brake<00:02:42.870> pump<00:02:43.170> right<00:02:43.350> here

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
tape because your brake pump right here

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.400 
tape because your brake pump right here
will<00:02:43.890> make<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> hole<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:45.630> right<00:02:45.930> there<00:02:46.140> touching

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
will make a hole is right there touching

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.790 
will make a hole is right there touching
as<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:46.830> can<00:02:46.980> see<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.490> touching<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:49.620> wrap

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
as you can see it's touching just wrap

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.400 
as you can see it's touching just wrap
the<00:02:49.950> real<00:02:50.130> rule<00:02:50.340> taking<00:02:50.970> good<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.410> I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
the real rule taking good and I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.490 
the real rule taking good and I
guarantee<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.310> will<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.610> no<00:02:53.820> problems

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
guarantee you will have no problems

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.370 
guarantee you will have no problems
other<00:02:55.500> than<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.840> think<00:02:57.840> I'm<00:02:58.140> done<00:02:58.350> with

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
other than that I think I'm done with

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.320 
other than that I think I'm done with
this<00:02:58.590> problem<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.430> been<00:02:59.580> going<00:02:59.850> on<00:02:59.940> for<00:03:00.210> like

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
this problem it's been going on for like

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.690 
this problem it's been going on for like
months<00:03:00.540> already<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:02.190> seems<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.550> be
