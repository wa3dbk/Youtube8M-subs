00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Open the app of Touch Wizard (phone button) and select the script SendGift.lua that I wrote. (This version of V2 is the love activity of these days) 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.000
 Back to the game 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
 Please pull the list of gifts to the first pen, the demonstration starts from the middle 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.600
 Demonstration to send 5 gifts 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.100
 Confirm that the screen does not jump to the wrong position 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.100
 Start receiving and transmitting 

00:00:34.573 --> 00:00:37.500
 If the first gift delivery process runs normally, receiving and transmitting it should end without a few clicks. 

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:45.675
 Because this is not careful, only stay 1 for demonstration. 

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:47.100
 Wait for the loop to finish.... 

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:57.000

 End of the gift reply program 

00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:08.300
 Take a gift to start 

00:01:14.793 --> 00:01:17.700
 Here only fixed the bottom right corner 

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.800
 Even the demonstration also draws cookies... 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.700
 Waiting for @@, will not be stuck here, etc. will jump out 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
