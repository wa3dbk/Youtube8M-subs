00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
lick is okay so the pattern is this one

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.660 
lick is okay so the pattern is this one
pattern<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.259> pentatonic<00:01:34.770> scale<00:01:35.040> we're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
pattern for the pentatonic scale we're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.179

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
and then on the B string we're gonna go

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.610 
and then on the B string we're gonna go
six<00:01:56.790> eight<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.480> then<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.810> high<00:01:59.050> E<00:01:59.290> string<00:01:59.320> we're

six eight and then a high E string we're

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.760 
six eight and then a high E string we're
gonna<00:01:59.710> go<00:01:59.860> five<00:02:00.100> eight<00:02:00.660> so<00:02:01.660> it's<00:02:01.810> B<00:02:02.110> string<00:02:02.410> six

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
gonna go five eight so it's B string six

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.470 
gonna go five eight so it's B string six
a<00:02:03.120> high<00:02:04.120> E<00:02:04.150> string<00:02:04.360> five<00:02:05.010> okay<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:07.300> you<00:02:07.360> guys

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
a high E string five okay so you guys

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.110 
a high E string five okay so you guys
know<00:02:07.720> what<00:02:07.900> I'm<00:02:07.990> thinking<00:02:08.350> about<00:02:11.850> when<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:12.880> take

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.300 
know what I'm thinking about when I take
you<00:02:13.240> guys<00:02:13.270> through<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.690> lick<00:02:13.990> okay

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
you guys through this lick okay

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.800 
you guys through this lick okay
and<00:02:15.580> again<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:15.910> pattern<00:02:16.180> 4<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.690> guys

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
and again it's pattern 4 so if you guys

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.750 
and again it's pattern 4 so if you guys
don't<00:02:17.020> know<00:02:17.140> all<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.680> five<00:02:17.890> positions<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
don't know all the five positions of the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.270 
don't know all the five positions of the
pentatonic<00:02:19.330> pattern<00:02:19.560> hop<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.740> over<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.950> Johnny

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
pentatonic pattern hop on over to Johnny
