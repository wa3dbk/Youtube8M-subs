00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
shape maintained so what I use is this

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.630 
shape maintained so what I use is this
little<00:00:13.480> tiny<00:00:13.690> thing<00:00:14.430> here<00:00:15.430> I<00:00:15.760> mean<00:00:15.910> it's<00:00:17.640> it's

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
little tiny thing here I mean it's it's

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.329 
little tiny thing here I mean it's it's
it's<00:00:18.850> for<00:00:19.179> beards<00:00:19.630> for<00:00:19.900> men's<00:00:20.080> beards<00:00:20.589> so<00:00:21.220> they

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:21.339 
it's for beards for men's beards so they

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.859 
it's for beards for men's beards so they
can<00:00:21.490> trim<00:00:21.699> it<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:22.000> stuff<00:00:22.269> that's<00:00:22.480> really

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
can trim it and stuff that's really

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.630 
can trim it and stuff that's really
small<00:00:23.199> I<00:00:23.439> find<00:00:23.830> that<00:00:23.890> it<00:00:24.009> works<00:00:24.039> or<00:00:24.279> they<00:00:24.429> get<00:00:24.609> a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
small I find that it works or they get a

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.849 
small I find that it works or they get a
huge<00:00:24.759> losing<00:00:25.240> bulky<00:00:26.199> obviously<00:00:26.619> you<00:00:26.710> have<00:00:26.830> a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
huge losing bulky obviously you have a

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.179 
huge losing bulky obviously you have a
better<00:00:27.070> chance<00:00:27.369> of<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:28.810> further<00:00:29.650> than<00:00:30.009> the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
better chance of going further than the

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.790 
better chance of going further than the
line<00:00:30.369> here<00:00:30.789> or<00:00:31.079> the<00:00:32.079> line<00:00:32.230> that<00:00:32.410> you<00:00:32.470> have<00:00:32.500> in

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
line here or the line that you have in

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.689 
line here or the line that you have in
the<00:00:32.860> back<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:34.120> use<00:00:34.540> a<00:00:34.750> number<00:00:35.680> three<00:00:36.160> guard<00:00:36.460> the

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
the back I use a number three guard the

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.569 
the back I use a number three guard the
reason<00:00:36.969> I<00:00:37.059> do<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.239> is<00:00:37.390> because<00:00:37.690> I<00:00:37.870> don't<00:00:38.579> like

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
reason I do that is because I don't like

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.750 
reason I do that is because I don't like
the<00:00:39.789> look<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.210> being<00:00:40.690> completely<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:42.280> bald

on<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.600> side<00:00:43.809> I<00:00:43.840> think<00:00:44.050> it's<00:00:44.350> just<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.739> little

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
on the side I think it's just a little

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.180 
on the side I think it's just a little
too<00:00:45.100> much<00:00:45.280> for<00:00:45.879> my<00:00:46.030> own<00:00:46.149> taste<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.440> then<00:00:48.160> I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
too much for my own taste and then I

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.069

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you're doing the side shape for the very

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.669 
you're doing the side shape for the very
first<00:02:07.439> time<00:02:07.819> when<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.910> first<00:02:09.270> did<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.720> cut

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
first time when I first did this I cut

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.280 
first time when I first did this I cut
it<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.890> about<00:02:10.920> here<00:02:11.690> it's<00:02:12.690> about<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:13.080> there

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it to about here it's about right there

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.780 
it to about here it's about right there
and<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.920> wanted<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.610> bit

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and then I wanted to go a little bit

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.910 
and then I wanted to go a little bit
further<00:02:14.970> back<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.599> wish<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.870> had<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:16.620> far<00:02:16.830> as

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
further back and I wish I had as far as

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.229 
further back and I wish I had as far as
how<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.160> looks<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.580> didn't<00:02:17.790> make<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.910> huge

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
how it looks it didn't make a huge

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.600 
how it looks it didn't make a huge
difference<00:02:18.660> but<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:19.680> far<00:02:19.890> as<00:02:19.920> maintaining<00:02:20.340> it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
difference but as far as maintaining it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.729 
difference but as far as maintaining it
it<00:02:20.700> did<00:02:20.910> not<00:02:21.630> being<00:02:21.900> able<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.110> see<00:02:22.290> behind<00:02:22.620> my

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
here where some of the hair started to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.130 
here where some of the hair started to
grow<00:02:26.700> out<00:02:27.060> cuz<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.360> can't<00:02:27.569> reach<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.080> I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
I get closer to the edge here this to me

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.650 
I get closer to the edge here this to me
is<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:44.299> hardest<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.900> scariest<00:02:46.500> area<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:48.510> so

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
is the hardest and scariest area and so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.789 
you're gonna see how I do it use my hand
to<00:02:50.580> block<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.420> best<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.319> go<00:02:52.530> when<00:02:52.769> I

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
to block it best I can and I go when I

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.309 
to block it best I can and I go when I
do<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.220> you'll<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:53.819> me<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.239> an<00:02:54.360> up

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
direction so that I'm not grabbing on to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.520 
direction so that I'm not grabbing on to
these<00:02:58.980> hairs

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.950 

you

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.200 

okay<00:03:11.960> so<00:03:12.020> I've<00:03:12.200> gotten<00:03:12.470> as<00:03:12.560> close<00:03:12.800> as<00:03:13.010> I'm

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
okay so I've gotten as close as I'm

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.990 
okay so I've gotten as close as I'm
comfortably<00:03:14.210> willing<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:15.020> go

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.380 

and<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.810> use<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.820> painter<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> had<00:03:21.360> a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and I use a painter so I had a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.610 
and I use a painter so I had a
paintbrush<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.160> wasn't<00:03:23.520> using<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.620> don't

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
paintbrush that I wasn't using I don't

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.560 
paintbrush that I wasn't using I don't
never<00:03:25.740> use<00:03:25.950> them<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.220> big<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.700> but<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.150> found

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
never use them this big so but I found

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.300 
never use them this big so but I found
that<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.750> works<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:27.960> well<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.350> trying<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
that it works really well with trying to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
that it works really well with trying to
get<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.910> little<00:03:30.270> hairs<00:03:30.540> off<00:03:30.960> of<00:03:31.950> my<00:03:32.220> face<00:03:32.460> and

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
get the little hairs off of my face and

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:43.370 
get the little hairs off of my face and
my<00:03:33.540> ears<00:03:40.460> so<00:03:41.460> I<00:03:42.090> come<00:03:42.570> back<00:03:42.690> with<00:03:42.870> my<00:03:42.900> scissors

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
my ears so I come back with my scissors

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.910 
my ears so I come back with my scissors
now<00:03:43.710> what<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:45.020> especially<00:03:46.020> because<00:03:46.470> my<00:03:46.710> hair

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
now what I do especially because my hair

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.850 
now what I do especially because my hair
is<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.040> dark<00:03:47.750> I'll<00:03:48.750> kind<00:03:48.990> of<00:03:49.080> turn<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.560> way<00:03:49.800> so

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
is so dark I'll kind of turn this way so

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.710 
is so dark I'll kind of turn this way so
that<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.340> light<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.790> hitting<00:03:51.090> me<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.540> can

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
that the light is hitting me and I can

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.810 
that the light is hitting me and I can
see<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.200> little<00:03:52.320> strands<00:03:52.860> sticking<00:03:53.370> up<00:03:53.610> here

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
see the little strands sticking up here

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.460 
see the little strands sticking up here
that<00:03:54.720> probably<00:03:54.930> won't<00:03:55.080> make<00:03:55.170> too<00:03:55.320> much<00:03:55.410> sense

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
that probably won't make too much sense

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.440 
that probably won't make too much sense
until<00:03:55.890> you're<00:03:55.980> actually<00:03:56.280> doing<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.670> but<00:03:57.360> if

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
until you're actually doing it but if

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.580 
until you're actually doing it but if
you<00:03:57.540> just<00:03:57.750> kind<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.959> move<00:03:58.230> your<00:03:58.410> head<00:03:58.500> around

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
you just kind of move your head around

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.710 
you just kind of move your head around
in<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.920> sort<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.250> angle<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.910> can<00:04:00.090> kind<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.420> see

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
in a sort of angle you can kind of see

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.550 
in a sort of angle you can kind of see
the<00:04:00.959> little<00:04:01.080> pieces<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.530> are<00:04:01.770> that<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
the little pieces that are that the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:13.059 
the little pieces that are that the
razor<00:04:04.560> didn't<00:04:05.459> get

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.450 

all<00:04:13.519> right<00:04:13.700> there<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.090> have<00:04:14.299> it
