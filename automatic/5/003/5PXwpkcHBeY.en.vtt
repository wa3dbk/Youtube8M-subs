00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
together and you can see how it makes

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.390 
together and you can see how it makes
the<00:02:07.350> pages<00:02:08.330> but<00:02:09.330> I've<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:09.510> taken<00:02:09.990> one<00:02:10.890> of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the pages but I've just taken one of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
the pages but I've just taken one of
these<00:02:11.550> two<00:02:11.880> igloo<00:02:12.240> pins<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.810> chubby<00:02:13.110> one<00:02:14.210> and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
these two igloo pins the chubby one and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.080 
these two igloo pins the chubby one and
make<00:02:16.560> sure<00:02:16.770> all<00:02:16.980> your<00:02:17.190> envelopes<00:02:17.640> go<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
make sure all your envelopes go in the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.090 
make sure all your envelopes go in the
same<00:02:18.300> direction<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.870> put<00:02:22.620> down<00:02:22.890> your

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
same direction and just put down your

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.720 
same direction and just put down your
glue<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:25.140> want<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.410> get<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.800> close<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
glue you want to get it as close to the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.720 
glue you want to get it as close to the
edge<00:02:26.880> as<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.240> can<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.680> work<00:02:28.920> as<00:02:29.100> quickly<00:02:29.430> as

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
edge as you can and work as quickly as

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.230 
edge as you can and work as quickly as
you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.370> you'll<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.730> permanent

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
you can so that you'll have a permanent

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.880 
you can so that you'll have a permanent
bond<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:33.840> line<00:02:34.710> up<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:35.040> edges<00:02:36.890> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
bond and just line up your edges and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:46.220 
bond and just line up your edges and
keep<00:02:38.220> gluing<00:02:38.610> these<00:02:38.760> down<00:02:43.850> very<00:02:44.850> simple<00:02:45.660> you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
keep gluing these down very simple you

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:59.020 
keep gluing these down very simple you
can<00:02:46.260> see<00:02:46.590> how<00:02:46.710> quickly<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.280> goes

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.750 

this<00:02:59.600> glue<00:02:59.870> does<00:03:00.080> dry<00:03:00.350> very<00:03:00.590> quickly<00:03:00.890> though

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.059 

so<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.819> want<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.150> work<00:03:05.300> as<00:03:05.480> fast<00:03:05.870> as<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.260> can

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.850 

this<00:03:13.069> first<00:03:13.940> one<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.209> did<00:03:14.569> I<00:03:14.780> used<00:03:15.200> Elmer's<00:03:15.590> glue

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
this first one I did I used Elmer's glue

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.030 
this first one I did I used Elmer's glue
and<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.160> was<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.610> too<00:03:16.940> wet

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
and that was just too wet

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.770 
and that was just too wet
this<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.250> much<00:03:19.489> better<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.420> took<00:03:20.600> it

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
this is much better and it took it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.380 
this is much better and it took it
forever<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.470> dry<00:03:22.989> okay

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
forever to dry okay

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.300 
forever to dry okay
put<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> cap<00:03:26.750> back<00:03:27.020> on<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:27.739> won't<00:03:27.950> dry

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
put the cap back on so this won't dry

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.680 
put the cap back on so this won't dry
out<00:03:29.620> now<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.680> can<00:03:31.010> see<00:03:31.310> we<00:03:31.880> have<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.239> pages

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
out now you can see we have the pages

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.570 
out now you can see we have the pages
for<00:03:33.620> our<00:03:33.680> album<00:03:34.360> now<00:03:35.360> for<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.750> cover<00:03:36.580> because
