00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
lashes and they've grown pretty much

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.580

since the last time I've shown my
natural<00:03:20.160> lashes<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.760> video<00:03:21.030> depth<00:03:21.780> I've

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
natural lashes on the video depth I've

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.990 
natural lashes on the video depth I've
actually<00:03:22.230> used<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.830> serum<00:03:23.250> called

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
actually used this serum called

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.850 
actually used this serum called
li<00:03:24.810> lash<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:26.130> really<00:03:26.310> helped<00:03:26.750> basically

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
li lash and it really helped basically

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.160 
li lash and it really helped basically
extend<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.220> length<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.090> my<00:03:30.240> lashes<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.750> also

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
extend the length of my lashes and also

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.110 
extend the length of my lashes and also
think<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.440> them<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.950> bit<00:03:32.100> if<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.730> see<00:03:33.060> in

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
think of them a little bit if you see in

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.570 
think of them a little bit if you see in
my<00:03:33.240> previous<00:03:33.570> videos<00:03:33.959> they<00:03:34.140> were<00:03:34.200> pretty

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
my previous videos they were pretty

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.940 
my previous videos they were pretty
short<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:36.410> they<00:03:37.410> won<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:38.450> full<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.650> I'm

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
short and they won this full so I'm

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.040 
short and they won this full so I'm
applying<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.880> lower<00:03:42.270> lash<00:03:42.540> line<00:03:42.570> as

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
applying it on the lower lash line as

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.690 
applying it on the lower lash line as
well<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:45.440> if<00:03:46.440> they<00:03:46.680> get<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:47.040> little<00:03:47.220> bit<00:03:47.430> clumpy

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
well and if they get a little bit clumpy

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.500 
well and if they get a little bit clumpy
you<00:03:47.970> can<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.390> take<00:03:49.170> an<00:03:49.770> eyelash<00:03:50.760> brush<00:03:51.150> and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510
