00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.920
 hello friends here is commenting a 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.029
 new video for you that I am going to 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.490
 bring the first video of my channel and base 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.250
 simply what you already know that 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.500
 more I like minecraft that is 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.869
 and make headlines 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.490
 it's something I do that what I most 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.440
 impresses in minecraft that is to do 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.410
 pixel art and well I will bring one 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.090
 that is there as you can see that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.530
 you will have seen in the title what it is that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 is the red bull 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.870
 tell you that I'm going to leave the image in a 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 link in zach image and also I'm not going 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.610
 to put at the end of the video so that the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 copy and from where you want you will tell me 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 because I have not done a tutorial talking 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 of how it is done simply not what 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.250
 I did because what I'm trying 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.400
 do ok but I 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.610
 called more or less in half and already 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.340
 it lasted 36 minutes of the video and I do not want 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.790
 upload a one and a half hour tutorial 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.520
 more or less but well they recommend 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.600
 that you do this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.600
 this pixel art 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.070
 because it's me I think it's from the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.030
 best professionals that have been 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.649
 ok and I think they are and are almost 70 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.630
 of these almost 70 long and about 40 of 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.409
 wide you if you want you measure it in the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.719
 image but when I saw it it was more or less 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.609
 so you always tell that they have highlighted the 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.890
 image the image you have not found 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:46.789
 by google until I do not upload it clear 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.189
 It is an image made by me and also 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.759
 edited by me by also the some 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.619
 of the squared colors well some 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.179
 things that was not right poets a bull 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.260
 it would be different from the other 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.320
 let's see that the image is made by me 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.420
 and good and teach how I stay on 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.619
 pixel art 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.390
 let's simply see the tutorial 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.940
 who was explaining what colors 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.190
 I needed but well let's leave that 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.580
 aside let's see how he has 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.840
 left 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.270
 that I believe that the bulls these are 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.910
 difficult to do because it has a lot 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.610
 detail but it is one of the pixels that 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.750
 I have better stayed 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.240
 the best and note what is good 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.630
 I'm going to leave the image in images 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.560
 here 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.410
 without getting wet 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.810
 and I'm also going to put it at the end of 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.190
 video for you to do what 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.739
 you want to follow him in the video or the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.050
 description in sachs image so that 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.300
 can you do this tutorial I say this 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.790
 tutorial this image good I think that 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.000
 it's easy to do it's worth it 's the only thing 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:06.310
 has more difficulty are the bulls the 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.550
 bulls the bulls and the letters of network is 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.470
 much easier sections holds 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.310
 pretty simple and as you see is 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.310
 fairly good 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.260
 and you can even do it standing 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.750
 I do not know why I did it lying on the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.080
 ground but good although you can even 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.120
 to be standing as you want good 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.319
 well this has been all I hope that you 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.360
 have liked this the first video 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.940
 I will continue uploading videos of minecraft 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.000
 OK 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.860

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.530
 bug with the audio and so on 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.520
