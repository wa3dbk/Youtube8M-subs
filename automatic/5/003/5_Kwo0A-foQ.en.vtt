collecting items so what we could do is

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.710 
collecting items so what we could do is
if<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.430> can't<00:04:05.670> reach<00:04:05.910> something<00:04:05.940> we<00:04:06.420> can<00:04:06.600> give

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
go on golems get to work perfect that's

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.929 
go on golems get to work perfect that's
exactly<00:06:15.120> what<00:06:15.810> we<00:06:15.960> wanted<00:06:16.289> as<00:06:16.639> you<00:06:17.639> can<00:06:17.759> see

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
he's a little too close so keep that in

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.019 
he's a little too close so keep that in
mind<00:06:21.240> when<00:06:21.990> you're<00:06:22.169> doing<00:06:22.379> this<00:06:22.710> you<00:06:23.159> um<00:06:23.460> you

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
mind when you're doing this you um you

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:29.300

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
don't want to have your farms really

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.339 
don't want to have your farms really
close<00:06:29.490> by<00:06:29.699> because<00:06:30.090> some<00:06:30.330> gums<00:06:30.539> actually<00:06:31.229> have

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
close by because some gums actually have

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.709 
close by because some gums actually have
a<00:06:31.379> really<00:06:31.889> long<00:06:32.099> range<00:06:32.430> so<00:06:33.000> just<00:06:33.270> keep<00:06:33.509> that<00:06:33.539> in

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719 
a really long range so just keep that in

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.249 
a really long range so just keep that in
mind<00:06:34.020> when<00:06:34.259> you're<00:06:34.379> making<00:06:34.800> your<00:06:35.189> farms<00:06:35.580> um
