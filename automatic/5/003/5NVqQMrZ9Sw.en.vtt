00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:02.430
 for that 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.710
 we installed and dominated 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.710
 1 angular khadr at the end of the caen 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.980
 shelling 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.919
 he was chipping 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.239
 these percentages 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.939
 determined 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.619
 then be hours 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.259
 opposite course 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.669
 markers of the golan that already exists on the steering wheel 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.380
 we are not sure of a delay on the ball 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.380
 the European committee and then yourself 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.730
 it's pretty easy why I use 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.730
 a happy candles 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.320
 we have certainties 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.070
 coupon for 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.660
 bow 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 crimping with a small saw blade 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.540
 domtar to the matador but a rod of 8 to a little smart 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.950
 and this fall and it was overflowed of course 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.030
 interview further 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.670
 the nerve here 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.880
 good investments we take a good friend the piston 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.850
 pro 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.980
 the band is strong 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.680
 then 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.090
 we get up as soon as contributors it was the ends 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 difficulty 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.020
 we will not have the value in England by consulting that we go back 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.010
 european his commander and we go back in the opposite direction 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.359
 to bring to a contest during 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.359
 the sooner 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.070
 we could have been again 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.070
 the English label nothing and we necessarily 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.220
 the loser or pm age it lies 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.540
 on the average the first eu of memory performed on the abutting 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.869
 1 not good for the euro million to prove 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.750
 the greenback was quoting and then 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.080
 at least in water very well 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.340
 pm pm to 9 pm bravo carrera - his taste 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 in the case of the other 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.470
 we wish the Arabs because we will recalibrate the world 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.249
 two days with the band for me right now are worried 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.249
 and there we are sure we will have a good karma pmh accurate 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:18.199
 for these guys the two-month control of the fight against the Baltic there 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.249
 will learn nothing 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.249
 we learn that there is an audience that cheers 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.839
 we are waiting for you old master hope then we will put 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.019
 then in common with one hand in the morning m 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.099
 a first the only one 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.579
 the son 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.409
 he exists is unshakable 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.409
 we are a little 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.939
 to succeed 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.939
 the ninth place in thinness 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.419
 I went south back to the rule 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.549
 the ultimate stage in service 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.549
 for the analyst in this case all green 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.539
 so 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.779
 we will go back 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.609
 here is the ringtone 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.709
 and in return and very slowly we will all be dead 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.659
 until his state remains 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.659
 and when she addresses with the tenors with the world the point of advance 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.009
 we take a small step backwards 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.259
 we always find 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.259
 turned in his motor log 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.079
 and we look 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.079
 at nymex 1 36 'two goals 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.489
 what we want 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.199
 all closer 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.199
 at least 36 degrees by cutting down to have soiled the image 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.359
 that's not bad 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.069
 old annan
