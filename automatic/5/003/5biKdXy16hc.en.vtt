tracks<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> guess<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.680> hover<00:01:28.860> right

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
tracks or I guess it would hover right

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.340 
tracks or I guess it would hover right
tanks<00:01:30.150> hover<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.570> Star<00:01:30.810> Wars<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.110> don't<00:01:31.229> have

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
tanks hover in Star Wars they don't have

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.660 
tanks hover in Star Wars they don't have
tracks<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.619> let's<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> wheels<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.460> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
tracks so let's have the wheels on so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.140 
tracks so let's have the wheels on so
