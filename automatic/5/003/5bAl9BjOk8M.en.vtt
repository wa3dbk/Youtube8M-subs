inside pages
I<00:00:14.309> used<00:00:14.580> three<00:00:14.940> card<00:00:15.450> stocks<00:00:16.100> that<00:00:17.100> are<00:00:17.369> 18<00:00:18.150> by

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
I used three card stocks that are 18 by

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.590 
I used three card stocks that are 18 by
18<00:00:18.539> centimeters<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.680> use<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.090> same<00:00:21.270> color

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
18 centimeters I use to the same color

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.019 
18 centimeters I use to the same color
on<00:00:21.720> one<00:00:21.990> different<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.490> use<00:00:23.789> three

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
on one different but you can use three

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.359 
on one different but you can use three
different<00:00:24.060> colors<00:00:24.720> if<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.050> wish<00:00:25.289> I'm<00:00:25.890> showing

different colors if you wish I'm showing

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.509 
different colors if you wish I'm showing
you<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> small<00:00:27.660> piece<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.019> paper<00:00:28.519> first

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
you with a small piece of paper first

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.310 
you with a small piece of paper first
fold<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.900> half<00:00:31.230> making<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.980> rectangle<00:00:32.750> open<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
fold in half making a rectangle open and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340 
fold in half making a rectangle open and
holding<00:00:34.829> half<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> all<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> way<00:00:36.050> then<00:00:37.050> flip

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
holding half the all the way then flip

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.459 
holding half the all the way then flip
the<00:00:37.500> paper<00:00:37.710> over<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.700> fold<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.270> half<00:00:39.690> making<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the paper over and fold in half making a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.540 
the paper over and fold in half making a
triangle

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.130 

it's<00:00:48.550> important<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.420> flip<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.960> paper

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
it's important that you flip the paper

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.500 
it's important that you flip the paper
because<00:00:50.680> that<00:00:50.920> is<00:00:51.040> what<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.370> gonna<00:00:51.579> make<00:00:51.670> your

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
because that is what is gonna make your

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.220 
because that is what is gonna make your
paper<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:53.230> hold<00:00:53.470> by<00:00:54.219> itself<00:00:54.670> making<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.570> career

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.139 

now<00:00:59.230> this<00:00:59.829> is<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.040> way<00:01:00.220> you<00:01:00.430> will<00:01:00.610> prove<00:01:00.910> them

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
now this is the way you will prove them

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.160 
now this is the way you will prove them
together<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.670> can<00:01:03.699> use<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:04.089> total<00:01:04.570> sided<00:01:04.960> paper

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
together you can use a total sided paper

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.430 
together you can use a total sided paper
or<00:01:05.680> cardstock<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.790> has<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.540> same<00:01:07.780> color<00:01:08.140> on

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
or cardstock that has the same color on

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.090 
or cardstock that has the same color on
each<00:01:08.590> side<00:01:08.920> leg<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:10.000> minute<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.360> I<00:01:10.479> did

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
each side leg and the minute that I did

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.969 
each side leg and the minute that I did
if<00:01:12.100> you<00:01:12.460> use<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.659> one<00:01:13.810> sided<00:01:14.080> paper<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.800> way

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
if you use the one sided paper the way

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.940 
if you use the one sided paper the way
you<00:01:15.190> fold<00:01:15.550> its<00:01:16.030> report<00:01:16.690> in<00:01:17.440> writing<00:01:17.649> the

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
you fold its report in writing the

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.790 
you fold its report in writing the
decider<00:01:18.490> in<00:01:19.030> like<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.450> most<00:01:19.720> in<00:01:20.200> your<00:01:20.259> pattern

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.180 

this<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.070> going<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.460> be<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.210> back<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:54.320> this<00:01:55.040> is

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
this is going to be the back and this is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.550 
this is going to be the back and this is
gonna<00:01:55.370> be<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.550> fun

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
gonna be a fun

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.060 
gonna be a fun
I've<00:01:57.560> marked<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.460> pages<00:01:58.760> with<00:01:59.660> arrows<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:00.770> I

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
I've marked the pages with arrows so I

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.610 
I've marked the pages with arrows so I
know<00:02:01.130> which<00:02:01.580> side<00:02:01.910> goes<00:02:02.600> up<00:02:02.660> that<00:02:03.320> makes

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
know which side goes up that makes

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.250 
know which side goes up that makes
everything<00:02:03.980> easier<00:02:04.550> for<00:02:04.820> me<00:02:05.030> when<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.960> start

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
everything easier for me when I start

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260 
everything easier for me when I start
decorating<00:02:06.590> but<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.460> don't<00:02:07.640> really<00:02:07.970> need<00:02:08.090> to

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
decorating but you don't really need to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.830 
decorating but you don't really need to
do<00:02:08.390> this

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
do this

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.010 
do this
I<00:02:08.869> also<00:02:09.530> marked<00:02:10.280> her<00:02:10.520> with<00:02:10.850> excess<00:02:11.420> on<00:02:11.690> the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
I also marked her with excess on the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.170 
I also marked her with excess on the
side<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.530> are<00:02:12.770> going<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.370> covered<00:02:13.820> or

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
side that are going to be covered or

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.420 
side that are going to be covered or
blue<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.930> way<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.200> know<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:16.040> don't<00:02:16.280> have

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
blue that way I know that I don't have

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.670 
blue that way I know that I don't have
to<00:02:16.610> decorate<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.150> time<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.750> do<00:02:17.960> this<00:02:18.350> because

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
to decorate that time I do this because

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.400 
to decorate that time I do this because
I<00:02:19.070> decorate<00:02:19.490> all<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.850> pages<00:02:20.540> first<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.260> thing

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
I decorate all the pages first and thing

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.560 
I decorate all the pages first and thing
to<00:02:21.620> do<00:02:21.830> them<00:02:22.010> together<00:02:22.220> I'm<00:02:22.790> using<00:02:23.060> six

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
to do them together I'm using six

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.360 
to do them together I'm using six
different<00:02:23.810> colors<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.620> coordinate<00:02:24.890> very

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
different colors that coordinate very

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.460 
different colors that coordinate very
well<00:02:25.670> with<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.940> wrapping<00:02:26.270> paper<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.900> could

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
well with the wrapping paper I could

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.830 
well with the wrapping paper I could
some<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.980> them<00:02:28.160> have<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.820> make<00:02:28.970> triangles

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.850 

I<00:02:32.519> also<00:02:33.519> caught<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.750> wrapping<00:02:35.230> paper<00:02:35.260> into

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
I also caught the wrapping paper into

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.900 
I also caught the wrapping paper into
seven<00:02:36.280> point<00:02:37.060> five<00:02:37.390> by<00:02:37.810> seven<00:02:38.170> point<00:02:38.530> five

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
seven point five by seven point five

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.759 
seven point five by seven point five
centimeters<00:02:39.910> course<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:41.440> make<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
centimeters course to make the

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.250 
centimeters course to make the
journaling<00:02:42.250> spaces<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:43.090> meaning<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.720> use<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
journaling spaces in meaning I use the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.759 
journaling spaces in meaning I use the
triangles<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.879> I<00:02:46.450> lined<00:02:47.050> them<00:02:47.230> up<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.709> my

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
triangles and I lined them up on my

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.400 
triangles and I lined them up on my
cutting<00:02:48.430> mat<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.849> also<00:02:49.239> used<00:02:49.599> a<00:02:49.720> ruler<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.379> help

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410
