00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
watch this it's probably gonna be a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.790 
watch this it's probably gonna be a
manhole<00:02:11.129> clone<00:02:11.750> take<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.930> out

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.810

yeah just as I thought
it's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.660> manhole<00:02:19.050> clump

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
it's a manhole clump

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.480

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
doubt let's just give it a try

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.220 
doubt let's just give it a try
how<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.590> start<00:02:35.420> actually<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.750> instructions

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
how do I start actually the instructions

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.880 
how do I start actually the instructions
hold<00:02:37.440> our<00:02:37.820> key<00:02:38.820> function<00:02:39.560> before<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.680> games

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
hold our key function before the games

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.610 
hold our key function before the games
start<00:02:41.240> it's<00:02:42.240> like<00:02:42.420> game<00:02:42.600> Warner<00:02:42.900> Game<00:02:43.080> two<00:02:43.410> I'm

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
start it's like game Warner Game two I'm

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.960 
start it's like game Warner Game two I'm
gonna<00:02:43.740> guess<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:43.920> like<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.459> B<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.820> game

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
gonna guess it's like a or B on the game

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.350 
gonna guess it's like a or B on the game
and<00:02:45.120> watch<00:02:45.410> right<00:02:46.410> or<00:02:46.590> down<00:02:46.980> turn<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.120> sound

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
and watch right or down turn the sound

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.140 
and watch right or down turn the sound
on<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.810> off<00:02:48.900> alternatively<00:02:49.910> how<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.060> you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
on and off alternatively how can you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.430 
on and off alternatively how can you
have<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.330> sound<00:02:51.630> on<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.080> off<00:02:52.170> at<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.380> same

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
have the sound on and off at the same

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.100 
have the sound on and off at the same
times<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.100> paradox<00:02:53.580> okay<00:02:54.390> action<00:02:54.600> starts

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
