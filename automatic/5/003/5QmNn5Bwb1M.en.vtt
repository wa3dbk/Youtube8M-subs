00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.630 
here on YouTube was filled with cargo
cosmetics<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.650> think<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.039> April<00:00:26.460> box

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
cosmetics I think that was the April box

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.509 
cosmetics I think that was the April box
it<00:00:26.910> had<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.390> cargo<00:00:27.840> blush<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.500> cargo<00:00:29.039> lip<00:00:29.279> gloss

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
it had a cargo blush and cargo lip gloss

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.020 
it had a cargo blush and cargo lip gloss
cargo<00:00:30.320> mascara<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.710> cargo<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.369> shadow<00:00:32.759> I

cargo mascara and a cargo I shadow I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.700

think<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> excavated<00:00:33.960> value<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.469> box

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
think the excavated value for that box

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.130 
think the excavated value for that box
is<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:34.920> 110<00:00:35.700> dollars<00:00:36.149> now<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:36.809> twenty-five
