here you can kind of see those holes

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.279 
here you can kind of see those holes
that's<00:02:03.119> all<00:02:03.270> perfect<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.869> right<00:02:03.990> there<00:02:04.170> as

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
that's all perfect and right there as

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.719

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
air is not only flowing to the front of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
air is not only flowing to the front of
the<00:02:08.130> garment<00:02:08.310> its<00:02:08.700> flowing<00:02:09.090> through<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> arms

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the garment its flowing through the arms

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.810 
the garment its flowing through the arms
as<00:02:09.960> well<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.040> course<00:02:11.190> when<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.490> have<00:02:11.520> that

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
as well but of course when you have that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.640 
as well but of course when you have that
liner<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.210> it<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.690> liner<00:02:12.870> actually<00:02:13.230> goes<00:02:13.350> all

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
liner in it the liner actually goes all

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.720 
liner in it the liner actually goes all
the<00:02:13.680> way<00:02:13.860> down<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.430> full

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the way down it's a full

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.339 
the way down it's a full
sleeve<00:02:14.940> liner<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.450> does<00:02:15.629> block<00:02:15.900> off<00:02:16.140> those

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
sleeve liner so it does block off those

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.570 
sleeve liner so it does block off those
holes<00:02:16.620> when<00:02:17.040> you're<00:02:17.159> trying<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.400> keep

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
holes when you're trying to keep

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.610 
holes when you're trying to keep
yourself<00:02:17.700> warm<00:02:17.970> when<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.480> cool<00:02:18.659> out<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
yourself warm when it's cool out the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.599 
yourself warm when it's cool out the
Motorhead<00:02:20.010> jacket<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.640> definitely<00:02:20.909> a<00:02:21.180> classic
