00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:15.260
 louise me will cost you your vote with my alder 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.260
 king need he jamesina ryokan soup 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.440
 hello again today and her video for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.529
 You guys I go a lame team 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.570
 You and we are working on the remington 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.090
 pearl pro curl 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.980
 this is such a curling iron that no flap me 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.840
 but so only one the rod where you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.489
 must turn it around 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
 you get a very comprehensive block 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 where all safety things are 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.559
 but also just an instruction manual 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.140
 of the curling iron 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.239
 you also get a kind of cover with it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 in which you transport an art or 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.739
 of course there were also just sit 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.300
 Add heat-resistant gloves 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.100
 I am very happy with that myself because 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.870
 I hadn't been like that and gloves are 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.610
 I burned myself very often during it 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.430
 curls or style or whatever of mine 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.079
 her and then this does itself then like 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.480
 so you do not see a lid on but 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.619
 is really just a strain and state how you 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.479
 want to call it too 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.670
 there are three buttons on the curling iron and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.350
 plus that high temperatures can 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.109
 put and min with which the temperature 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.249
 lower can turn, and the on and off switch 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:19.499
 it can reach 210 degrees and most of the time I am sitting 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.479
 my curling irons in 200 degrees 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.209
 I do that now even if the lines are not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.740
 flicker more and they remain standing 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.119
 then you know the tang is hot one 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.779
 otherwise you can just let him go 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.299
 use 

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.869
 I'm going to split my hair in two 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.459
 halves 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.109
 the smaller the pluck the tighter the 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.509
 bead of course i just go both 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.919
 small and large picking suits 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.679
 so I grab it and turn it 

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:43.799
 has to go outside now 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.450
 I turn it under picking 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.039
 under pressure as you see I have 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.020
 the heat resistant gloves on and 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.630
 I can just touch the tongs with this 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.639
 you can feel the heat through it 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.719
 but it doesn't do any series you burn there 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:56.459
 not on either 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.319
 in between I find it very pleasant 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.919
 that you naturally fix the end 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.840
 must keep 

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:03.059
 I notice now anyway outset that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.139
 the pluck stays well on that on the 

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:05.579
 tongue 

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:07.079
 so he doesn't slide down and he 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.269
 just stays in place like 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.319
 I turned 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.319
 well I'm going to let him go 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.830
 and I'll hold it for a moment if it's then 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.620
 so that it can cool slightly 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.770
 before I release it, the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.540
 cnodder better in they say and i like him 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.450
 then let go i have one 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.100
 waves curl as you can see suit now 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.990
 a bit thinner and as well 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.210
 there will be some thicker picking 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.290
 so you different effects well 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.960
 can see 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.700
 I will just turn this in 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.380
 find yourself that give a nice effect if 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.570
 you curl the one pick and the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.190
 others inwards so that 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.140
 yes so that it looks a bit more natural 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.450
 sees concerns well before you do it 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.130
 end also as close as possible to the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.970
 tongs otherwise you get such a very straight 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.970
 piece at the bottom 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.260
 so I now have a somewhat thicker pick 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.750
 one that i just go at once 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.580
 try to do and we see if the tongs 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.830
 and then also grabs 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.000
 you can see these curls slightly coarse this 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.890
 says more a wave 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.840
 I now also have this side of a hair 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.970
 curled and as you can see this side is 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.890
 meanwhile you have become more loose 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.660
 curls a bit more I like that 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.459
 very beautiful itself 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.990
 because that of course says there I do 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.270
 there is no hair spray yet that I always do 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.950
 only when I'm completely done and so 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.840
 the curls can cool down heaven first 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.060
 well this is the rest of my hair it 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.770
 upper part and I actually go 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.020
 curl in the same way 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.630
 I pick one out and the other 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.480
 place I'll just inwardly and 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.220
 safety gloves above all else 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.590
 and I also try picking them there 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.790
 to hold for about 10 to 15 seconds 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.790
 and no longer 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.130
 it is through along with the job 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:03.540
 motivation you go 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:05.580
 you took your 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.590
 this is now the result i will take a moment 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.550
 you can see it well everywhere 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.550
 from each side 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.730
 I go out I get in there now I do 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.430
 use this hair spray from a moroccanoil 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.780
 the between lawrence hairspray 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.780
 with a current finish 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.770
 not too much because you don't know which year 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.390
 aggravate 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.730
 and of course you can make it as late as you 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.200
 I think this is beautiful 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.000
 what has because it does not like that 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.590
 super tight curls are I am going I do 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.220
 just brush through it 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.450
 because i never yolanthe beachy how 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.820
 meat-like effect very cool 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.900
 I hope that everything is not immediately there 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.340
 completely out 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.230
 I only go once 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.570
 no more than that 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.060
 ok that's really super nice here I had 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.250
 so very much of this effect 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.200
 well i really think it is very beautiful 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.460
 this is really my dream her so 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.480
 I put my hair up like 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.040
 have every day 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.570
 I don't know if you're that good on camera 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.850
 but my hair shines too 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.270
 immediately super nice and the fluff there 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.700
 completely out 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.700
 and this is how it looks from the back 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.050
 I've already turned off the tongs and me 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.220
 am really super satisfied with the tongs 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.660
 This is of course the first time I have 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.700
 use him but he is super easy 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.040
 in use you will be handy very quickly 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.600
 in and I think it's a whole thing anyway 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.250
 very bright glove to sit down 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.500
 because that makes everything just in it 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.300
 generally super much easier 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.010
 I have really said super many times in 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.390
 this piece 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.800
 I hope you stay that long and 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.110
 I 'll give you an update tomorrow 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.640
 about how my hair looks like 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.430
 diseases until tomorrow 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.050
 hey this is day two i have a whole one 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.850
 had a long day on internship it is now half 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.560
 six and its a bit like me but 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.240
 want anyway and I don't have a good light 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.669
 by the way, but I still want to do it 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.860
 give an update on the curls in my 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.590
 hair is no longer curled 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.500
 but 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.820
 beautiful waves as you can see a few 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.460
 pick especially here at the bottom 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.260
 yes there is almost nothing left of it 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.760
 a wave or a curl in which is is 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.190
 really completely sagged 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.320
 but yes here especially at the front 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.870
 clearly still in that battle 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.970
 and here too there are a few products 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.230
 in that are still beautifully waved so I am 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.930
 now very satisfied with it 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.230
 this remington pearl pro curl curling iron 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.490
