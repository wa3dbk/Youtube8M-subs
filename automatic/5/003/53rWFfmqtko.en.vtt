00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
upper a-arm and I was able to pop it out

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.220 
upper a-arm and I was able to pop it out
of<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:16.580> spindle<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.180> didn't<00:00:18.990> use<00:00:19.199> my

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
of the spindle here I didn't use my

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320 
of the spindle here I didn't use my
pickle<00:00:19.830> fork<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.730> right<00:00:20.970> here

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
pickle fork which is this right here

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.259 
pickle fork which is this right here
because<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:22.980> not<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.430> sure<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.029> this

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
because I'm not so sure that that this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.759 
because I'm not so sure that that this
is<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> side<00:00:24.779> that's<00:00:24.990> ripped<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.529> didn't

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769

popping but it comes there's a there's a
there's<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.420> groove<00:01:15.869> around<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:17.130> this

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
there's a groove around this then this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.969 
there's a groove around this then this
sits<00:01:17.610> into<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
sits into you can see that this is this

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
sits into you can see that this is this
is<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.630> snap<00:01:21.630> ring<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> two<00:01:24.570> holes

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
is the snap ring here and the two holes

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.249 
is the snap ring here and the two holes
right<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:26.040> these<00:01:26.810> these<00:01:27.810> ends

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
right there and then these these ends

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.030 
right there and then these these ends
fit<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> holes<00:01:29.990> like<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
fit in the holes like so and then you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.359 
fit in the holes like so and then you
squeeze<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.799> you

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
squeeze them like this and then you

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.539 
squeeze them like this and then you
squeeze<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:37.290> spreads<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.430> then

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
squeeze it and it it spreads it and then

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.359 
squeeze it and it it spreads it and then
you're<00:01:39.210> able<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:41.390> lift<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.540> up<00:01:42.659> over<00:01:43.110> now<00:01:43.369> now

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
you're able to lift it up over now now

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.560 
you're able to lift it up over now now
all<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.759> got<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> tap<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:47.360> upper<00:01:48.360> ball

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
all you got to do is tap that upper ball

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.609 
all you got to do is tap that upper ball
joint<00:01:48.860> down<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.600> come<00:01:51.780> out

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
joint down in it to come out

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.649 
joint down in it to come out
I'm<00:01:54.619> using<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.130> my<00:01:57.970> there's<00:01:58.970> another<00:01:59.390> one

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
I'm using it my there's another one

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.899 
I'm using it my there's another one
that's<00:01:59.840> gonna<00:01:59.960> take<00:02:00.290> some<00:02:00.320> work<00:02:00.590> because<00:02:01.159> it's

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
that's gonna take some work because it's

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.570 
that's gonna take some work because it's
up<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.240> there<00:02:02.479> I'm<00:02:03.080> using<00:02:03.380> my<00:02:06.220> hammer<00:02:07.220> with<00:02:07.549> a

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
up in there I'm using my hammer with a

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.570 
up in there I'm using my hammer with a
hard<00:02:07.939> plastic<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.950> let's<00:02:09.950> see<00:02:10.069> if<00:02:10.099> I<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.399> hold

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
hard plastic and let's see if I can hold

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:22.900 
hard plastic and let's see if I can hold
it<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:19.930> does<00:02:20.930> not<00:02:21.050> want<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.380> come<00:02:21.530> out<00:02:21.910> but

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
it and does not want to come out but

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.470 
it and does not want to come out but
it's<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:23.930> there<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:26.000> only<00:02:26.120> thing<00:02:26.269> we<00:02:26.360> can

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
it's in there so the only thing we can

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.509 
it's in there so the only thing we can
do<00:02:26.600> is<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:26.989> keep<00:02:27.170> hitting<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.130> until<00:02:28.220> we<00:02:28.489> can

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
do is just keep hitting it until we can

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.150 
do is just keep hitting it until we can
get<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:30.380> we<00:02:30.470> can<00:02:30.590> get<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.860> come<00:02:31.010> out

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's shiny right here that's where it

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.380 
it's shiny right here that's where it
that's<00:03:19.100> where<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.370> was<00:03:19.459> sitting<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
that's where it was sitting in that and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.809 
that's where it was sitting in that and
that<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.920> arm<00:03:22.220> there<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:24.350> if<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.160> we<00:03:25.430> look<00:03:25.609> at

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
that a arm there so and if I we look at

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.360 
that a arm there so and if I we look at
it<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.209> ripped<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:27.680> can<00:03:27.829> see<00:03:27.980> it's<00:03:28.130> ripped

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
it it is ripped you can see it's ripped

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.479 
it it is ripped you can see it's ripped
right<00:03:29.090> there<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:32.440> this<00:03:33.440> was<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.920> side<00:03:34.130> we

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
right there so this was the side we

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.979 
right there so this was the side we
could<00:03:34.670> have<00:03:34.790> used<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:35.060> pickle<00:03:35.390> fork<00:03:35.660> because<00:03:35.870> it

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
could have used a pickle fork because it

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.960 
could have used a pickle fork because it
was<00:03:36.079> already<00:03:36.470> ripped<00:03:36.799> but<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.489> can<00:03:37.639> see<00:03:37.819> right

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
was already ripped but you can see right

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.329 
was already ripped but you can see right
there
