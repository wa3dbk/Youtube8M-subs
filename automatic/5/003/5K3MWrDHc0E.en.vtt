won't<00:02:46.890> run<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.280> aftershock<00:02:47.790> because<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.300> will

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
won't run the aftershock because I will

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.130 
won't run the aftershock because I will
be<00:02:48.840> tempted<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.320> possibly<00:02:49.950> run<00:02:50.280> her<00:02:50.520> over<00:02:51.140> but

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
Jeep still it doesn't matter but so it's

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.910 
Jeep still it doesn't matter but so it's
nice<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:40.150> now<00:04:40.420> I<00:04:40.450> can<00:04:40.690> share<00:04:41.140> my<00:04:41.170> hobby<00:04:41.620> with

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
cold so we don't do it as much as we

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.090
