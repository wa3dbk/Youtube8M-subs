before he turns it on we think it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.660 
before he turns it on we think it's
really<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.110> perfect<00:01:40.409> fit<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.130> aircraft

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
really a perfect fit for this aircraft

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.550 
really a perfect fit for this aircraft
because<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> components<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.470> the

leading edge and this is really

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.740 
leading edge and this is really
important<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> efficiency<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> the

that a pilot will know when to turn it
on<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.460> can<00:02:15.910> turn<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.240> on<00:02:16.330> then<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.810> just

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
for one thing the system is going to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.380 
for one thing the system is going to
draw<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> less<00:02:26.950> than<00:02:26.980> 500<00:02:27.730> watts<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.210> that's

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
draw a less than 500 watts and that's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.710 
draw a less than 500 watts and that's
enough<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.810> clean<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.530> wing<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.310> tail<00:02:30.760> so

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
enough to clean the wing and tail so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.990 
enough to clean the wing and tail so
it's<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:32.080> very<00:02:32.440> efficient<00:02:33.010> system<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
it's a very efficient system and the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.730 
it's a very efficient system and the
electrical<00:02:34.390> system<00:02:34.750> won't<00:02:34.930> even<00:02:35.230> really<00:02:35.410> be

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
electrical system won't even really be

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.370 
electrical system won't even really be
affected<00:02:36.370> by<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.580> operation<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.230> obvious

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
affected by the operation so the obvious

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.500 
affected by the operation so the obvious
question<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.950> how<00:02:39.070> do<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:40.360> way

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
question is how do you do this the way

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.170 
question is how do you do this the way
it's<00:02:40.690> done<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.170> we<00:02:41.410> actually<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.700> system

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
it's done is we actually have a system

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.970 
it's done is we actually have a system
which<00:02:43.510> uses<00:02:43.810> these<00:02:44.110> electromechanical

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
which uses these electromechanical

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.390 
which uses these electromechanical
actuators<00:02:45.900> which<00:02:46.900> are<00:02:47.110> positioned<00:02:47.620> below<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
actuators which are positioned below the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.110 
actuators which are positioned below the
skin<00:02:48.720> these<00:02:49.720> actuators<00:02:50.610> expand<00:02:51.610> very<00:02:51.970> rapidly

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
skin these actuators expand very rapidly

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.960 
skin these actuators expand very rapidly
and<00:02:52.870> they<00:02:53.410> impart<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.920> small<00:02:54.250> deflection<00:02:54.790> but<00:02:54.940> a

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
and they impart a small deflection but a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.210 
and they impart a small deflection but a
very<00:02:55.240> high<00:02:55.450> g-force<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.470> skin<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:57.010> when

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
very high g-force to the skin and when

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.810 
very high g-force to the skin and when
that<00:02:57.370> happens<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:58.000> knocks<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.690> ice<00:02:58.840> off<00:02:59.080> the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
that happens it knocks the ice off the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.430 
that happens it knocks the ice off the
substructure<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:01.120> very<00:03:01.330> rigid<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.960> skin<00:03:02.260> is

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
substructure is very rigid the skin is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.710 
substructure is very rigid the skin is
just<00:03:02.470> slightly<00:03:03.100> flexible<00:03:03.490> just<00:03:03.850> enough<00:03:04.150> so

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
just slightly flexible just enough so

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.840 
just slightly flexible just enough so
that<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.930> can<00:03:05.050> move<00:03:05.470> when<00:03:06.070> we<00:03:06.280> hit<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.580> with<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
that it can move when we hit it with the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.940 
that it can move when we hit it with the
actuator<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:08.230> there<00:03:08.410> gonna<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.620> any

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
actuator is there gonna be any

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.860 
actuator is there gonna be any
particular<00:03:09.790> type<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.060> ice<00:03:10.360> it's<00:03:10.600> going<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> be

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
particular type of ice it's going to be

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.990 
particular type of ice it's going to be
more<00:03:11.020> effective<00:03:11.500> with<00:03:11.890> or<00:03:12.160> an<00:03:12.250> or<00:03:12.400> against

more effective with or an or against
well<00:03:13.660> harder<00:03:14.410> ice<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.800> easier<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> knock<00:03:15.670> off

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
well harder ice is easier to knock off

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.020 
well harder ice is easier to knock off
and<00:03:16.350> wet<00:03:17.350> our<00:03:17.470> ice<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:18.370> find<00:03:18.580> in<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.790> glaze
