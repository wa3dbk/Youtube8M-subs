00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.150
 then federalism is also in this 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.740
 moment there so it's been two or three days 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.090
 we're talking about a federal leap it's for 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.799
 the worst is for so it's up to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.900
 to say that it was very scary in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.270
 the idea that they may have happened to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 caen on a common political organ 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 is it's for it's really for 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.930
 demolish falls between them 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 that integration ben yeah okay 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.830
 so if you want to see you're going to do that I 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.170
 Join now and choose now 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.719
 to leave Europe invites ya not 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.860
 ask how from the moment 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.820
 the people who are supposed us 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.750
 represent left in this case 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.910
 Francois Hollande 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.370
 the socialists make policies of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.850
 right me I do not know anymore finally 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 suffrages here is that what is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.700
 can there be a difference 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 between the newspeak used by the right 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.690
 and 29 years old used by the gauge is 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.670
 lalonde because because there is no 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.180
 left is the right but you want 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.859
 say that in the atp socialist party 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.239
 no it's the same it's the reverse the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 even that's where this is where it's 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.320
 novlangue of there that one calls against 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 neoliberal revolution finally this is the one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.850
 of the ocde 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:19.800
 and so that's the idea that the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.120
 capitalism it's a good thing when 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.119
 you see it just regulate it a little 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.860
 and that's the idea of ​​opening by 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.550
 example a privative I do not know how 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.710
 tell you the educational market finally they 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.440
 go everything everything turned into a market 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.820
 privatize everything the socialists it's 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.100
 dominique strauss kahn who was going 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.840
 privatize the national education him 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.970
 it's the international privatizer 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.500
 since he was the fmi the fmi it's 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.450
 the body that privatizes policies 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.330
 public the agreement this guy there I am told 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.710
 that he is socialist 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.810
 he was going to do that in France no it's 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.160
 not him who will do it I remind that the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.380
 Americans 12 years saved three times in 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.440
 our history in 14 years 39 in 2011 at 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.630
 sofitel and so that will be another who the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.149
 will do but there is still a difference 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.000
 in the display at least in how 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:12.420
 we present the measures for example the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.220
 manual valls on the island to be able 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.959
 immigration because it's another 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.820
 we come from the thematic and supposed 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.380
 home right and the coming addition 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.170
 so I'll tell you the difference 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.820
 the difference between the right and the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.320
 liberal right and the social right no 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.310
 that's how she plays at the margin on 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.860
 about morals on aspects that are 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.299
 quite not insignificant like or the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.799
 suppression of the death penalty as 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.000
 authorization of same-sex marriage 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.320
 as 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.960
 greater flexibility in reception 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.710
 immigrants finally you see all this 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.390
 makes a difference there it is exactly 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.920
 like participatory management it's up to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.890
 say that they are more efficient by being 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.610
 less repressive it's a right that has 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.600
 understood while the other they are very 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.120
 taken openly repressive but 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:11.250
 honestly it's been since 1981 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.250
 still 40 years old 30 81 30 years old 80 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.510
 yes it's been 3 has made 33 years that does not 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.980
 play the scenario a shot the right that 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.870
 is nasty a blow the night before which 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.010
 arrives behind who passes the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.209
 stuff from the right and then the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.739
 right makes violent but a big blow 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.680
 then the right makes it go frankly 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.580
 there it's just huge what what one 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.890
 is between us he joined but it's 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.020
 so visible it's spectacular 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.020
 Finally I mean seeing something that 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.560
 it's the display 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.800
 of goals then where the elders 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.140
 ministers of the interior under sarkozy 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.730
 posted goals of deportation to 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.010
 the border 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.010
 expulsion of removal procedures 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.220
 left of writing tells us about goal 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.320
 of regularization, ie the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.360
 bad guys before we said we go in express 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.160
 and transparent and tells him we're going in 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.840
 regularize 39 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.430
 no no while the years they said 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.260
 that they were laughing exactly the 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.550
 same number of chords and the others but 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.170
 do not talk 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.980
 it's a very good example of people who 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.799
 regulates with it's great it's 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.910
 awesome there is more than bercy it's superb 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.670
 it is superb 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.350
 there is no more school failure in France 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:29.310
 it's forbidden to use the expression 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.310
 national education of deferred success 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.430
 it's his mom's marked site is pretty 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.820
 happy because suddenly it's 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.140
 success but it's success that has 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.550
 no place but it is here listening 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.750
 it's like negative growth 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.880
 rest of growth is still 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.640
 Is not it good to say to a 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.830
 child darling you did not you me 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.360
 would I be just going to succeed a little bit 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.360
 bling is good provided that the 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.070
 practices are aligned with the language 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.290
 Sicily the language just serves to 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.750
 to smoke and to maintain practices that 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.150
 are they fiercely 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.620
 repressive if you want it is odious 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.600
 at that moment I prefer that language 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.870
 would remain accurate is what I see 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.870
 clearer
