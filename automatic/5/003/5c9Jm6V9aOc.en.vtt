00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.870
My children do not like a cottage cheese. So I have to hide it in baking.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.000
Today I will make cottage cheese biscuits "Kissing". For my children.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.230
We need: 250 g cottage cheese, 200 g of the melted butter,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.989
1 cup flour and 1 cup sugar.

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.989
You can add vanilla.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:31.149
We shift the cottage cheese into a bowl.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.149
Mash with a fork.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.160
Mother would do anything to please  children.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.620

Stir until smooth.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.810
It turns a loose dough that slightly sticks to the hands.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.800
Sprinkle the table with the flour, the dough does not strongly adhered.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.030
Divide the dough into 2 parts.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.950
Roll out thinly - 3 mm thick.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.799
Cut out circles using a glass.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.379
We did not add sugar to the dough.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:15.909
So press the dough well one side to the sugar.

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.919
Fold in half.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.399

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.389
It turns like a "kiss".

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:36.389

The cookies are small and neat.

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.079
