well so you sort of need to know a
little<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.750> anatomy<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.220> for

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
little bit about anatomy but but for

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.969 
little bit about anatomy but but for
people<00:01:47.490> at<00:01:47.759> home<00:01:48.110> dogs<00:01:49.110> always<00:01:49.380> carries

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
people at home dogs always carries

people at home dogs always carries
stress<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.670> their<00:01:50.909> necks<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> good<00:01:52.439> place<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
stress in their necks so a good place to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.429 
stress in their necks so a good place to
start<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> neck<00:01:53.850> area<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> can

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
start is in the neck area and you can

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.719 
start is in the neck area and you can
simply<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.850> some<00:01:57.290> circular<00:01:58.729> movements

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
simply just do some circular movements

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.050 
simply just do some circular movements
around<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.390> neck<00:02:00.689> muscles<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.880> it's<00:02:02.880> always

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
around the neck muscles and it's always

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
around the neck muscles and it's always
a<00:02:03.090> good<00:02:03.270> idea<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.630> keep<00:02:03.960> an<00:02:04.140> eye<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.649> your<00:02:05.189> dog's

obviously seems very relaxed but I think

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.530 
obviously seems very relaxed but I think
it<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.640> important<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> know<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.300> every

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
it is important to know that not every

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.449 
it is important to know that not every
pet<00:02:12.750> would<00:02:13.230> necessarily<00:02:13.380> find<00:02:13.950> an<00:02:14.040> enjoyable

pet would necessarily find an enjoyable
perhaps<00:02:14.819> painful<00:02:15.240> right<00:02:15.390> yes<00:02:15.780> exactly

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
perhaps painful right yes exactly

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.260 
perhaps painful right yes exactly
especially<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:17.100> they<00:02:17.220> are<00:02:17.250> suffering<00:02:17.970> from<00:02:18.000> an

especially if they are suffering from an
injury<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.720> perhaps<00:02:19.050> you're<00:02:19.350> not<00:02:19.410> aware<00:02:19.530> of

injury that perhaps you're not aware of
so<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.940> should<00:02:21.240> watch<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.450> signs<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.640> panting

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
so you should watch for signs of panting

so you should watch for signs of panting
also<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:24.989> they<00:02:25.110> keep<00:02:25.319> turning<00:02:25.920> suddenly<00:02:26.160> if

also if they keep turning suddenly if
you're<00:02:26.850> sort<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.120> doing<00:02:27.180> some<00:02:27.660> movements

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you're sort of doing some movements

you're sort of doing some movements
around<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.709> rear<00:02:28.980> end<00:02:29.250> or<00:02:29.700> around<00:02:29.970> the

circular motion is that a typical
massage<00:02:55.319> motion<00:02:55.980> yes<00:02:56.489> yes<00:02:57.150> there's<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.959> sort

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
massage motion yes yes there's the sort

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.020 
massage motion yes yes there's the sort
of<00:02:58.319> two<00:02:58.590> main<00:02:58.890> types<00:02:59.220> there's<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.850> that's

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
of two main types there's one that's

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.420 
of two main types there's one that's
called<00:03:00.300> telling<00:03:00.690> t'en<00:03:00.900> touch<00:03:01.200> which<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.220> very

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
called telling t'en touch which is very

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.640 
called telling t'en touch which is very
much<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.060> kind<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.420> soft<00:03:03.870> circular

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
much just in kind of soft circular

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.050 
much just in kind of soft circular
motions<00:03:05.100> have<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.580> know<00:03:05.670> how<00:03:05.730> much<00:03:05.850> pressure

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
motions have you know how much pressure

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.900 
motions have you know how much pressure
to<00:03:06.269> do<00:03:06.510> well<00:03:06.800> not<00:03:07.800> very<00:03:07.830> much<00:03:08.130> pressure<00:03:08.580> okay

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
to do well not very much pressure okay

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.630 
to do well not very much pressure okay
sort<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.300> do<00:03:09.450> light<00:03:09.829> strokes<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.250> you're

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
sort of do light strokes and you're

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000 
sort of do light strokes and you're
basically<00:03:12.090> moving<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.870> faccia<00:03:13.170> which<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.860> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
basically moving the faccia which is the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.670 
basically moving the faccia which is the
lining<00:03:14.459> underneath<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.209> skin<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.440> might

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
lining underneath the skin so you might

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.110 
lining underneath the skin so you might
not<00:03:16.829> think<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.280> actually<00:03:17.730> you're<00:03:17.850> doing

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
not think that actually you're doing

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.090 
not think that actually you're doing
very<00:03:18.360> much<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.019> are<00:03:19.230> you're<00:03:19.590> keeping<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
very much but you are you're keeping the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.569 
very much but you are you're keeping the
muscles<00:03:20.690> flexible<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:23.130> know<00:03:23.250> your<00:03:23.430> sort

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
muscles flexible and you know your sort

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.330 
muscles flexible and you know your sort
of<00:03:23.900> moving<00:03:24.900> toxins<00:03:25.530> throughout<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> body

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
of moving toxins throughout the body

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.550 
of moving toxins throughout the body
just<00:03:26.459> by<00:03:26.940> doing<00:03:27.000> something<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.049> very

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
just by doing something like that very

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.710 
just by doing something like that very
