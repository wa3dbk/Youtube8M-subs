00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
let's call it nin for ninja and it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.150 
let's call it nin for ninja and it's
recessive<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.869> normal<00:00:31.230> allele<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.769> this

normal or wild-type allele I'll just

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.190 
normal or wild-type allele I'll just
just<00:00:37.440> give<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> plus<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.280> shorthand<00:00:39.200> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
just give it a plus for shorthand the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.790 
just give it a plus for shorthand the
cross<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.670> homozygous<00:00:42.600> slow<00:00:43.110> turtle<00:00:43.379> so

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
cross is a a homozygous slow turtle so

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.760 
cross is a a homozygous slow turtle so
let's<00:00:44.010> call<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> plus<00:00:44.520> plus<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.450> mated<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
let's call it plus plus is mated to a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.170 
let's call it plus plus is mated to a
homozygous<00:00:47.640> ninja<00:00:48.180> call<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> nin<00:00:49.410> nin<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
homozygous ninja call it nin nin and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.850 
homozygous ninja call it nin nin and
then<00:00:51.180> we're<00:00:51.360> told<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> f1r<00:00:52.260> interbred

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
then we're told that the f1r interbred

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.160 
then we're told that the f1r interbred
so<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> f1<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> know<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> be

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
so the f1 as you know are going to be

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.220 
so the f1 as you know are going to be
ninja<00:00:55.890> over<00:00:56.370> plus<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.600> those<00:00:57.780> guys<00:00:58.050> are

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
ninja over plus and if those guys are

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.689 
ninja over plus and if those guys are
interbred<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:59.129> what<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
interbred then what you're going to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.450 
interbred then what you're going to
expect<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> f2<00:01:01.109> from<00:01:01.829> our<00:01:01.980> standards

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
expect in the f2 from our standards

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
expect in the f2 from our standards
monohybrid<00:01:03.239> Mendelian<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.080> simple

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
monohybrid Mendelian with simple

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
monohybrid Mendelian with simple
dominance<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:05.129> you're<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
dominance is you're going to have a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.950 
dominance is you're going to have a
three-to-one<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:07.070> wild<00:01:08.070> type<00:01:08.250> 2<00:01:08.790> ninja<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
three-to-one of wild type 2 ninja so

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
three-to-one of wild type 2 ninja so
let's<00:01:10.200> go<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> 3<00:01:10.650> 2<00:01:11.280> 1<00:01:11.869> slow<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:14.100> ninja<00:01:14.520> okay

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
let's go to 3 2 1 slow to ninja okay

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.149 
let's go to 3 2 1 slow to ninja okay
because<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.900> were<00:01:16.020> told<00:01:16.290> before<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
because we were told before that the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.480 
because we were told before that the
slow<00:01:17.369> was<00:01:17.640> dominant<00:01:18.229> okay<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.340> issue

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
slow was dominant okay so the the issue

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.899 
slow was dominant okay so the the issue
with<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.650> we<00:01:22.650> don't<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.130> any<00:01:23.310> exact

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
with this one is we don't have any exact

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.359 
with this one is we don't have any exact
three<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.930> our<00:01:25.409> progeny<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:26.189> we've

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
three to one in our progeny what we've

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.730 
three to one in our progeny what we've
been<00:01:26.520> told<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.909> among<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> F<00:01:27.420> -<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.530> actually

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
been told is among the F - you actually

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.420 
been told is among the F - you actually
have<00:01:29.390> 25<00:01:30.390> slow<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> you've<00:01:31.950> got<00:01:33.110> 15<00:01:34.110> ninja<00:01:34.500> for

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
have 25 slow and you've got 15 ninja for

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.819 
have 25 slow and you've got 15 ninja for
a<00:01:35.460> total<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.850> 40<00:01:36.180> animals<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:37.740> going

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a total of 40 animals so if we're going

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.609 
a total of 40 animals so if we're going
to<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> chi-square<00:01:38.729> we're<00:01:39.600> gonna<00:01:39.689> ask<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
to do a chi-square we're gonna ask is is

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.889 
to do a chi-square we're gonna ask is is
this<00:01:40.860> different<00:01:41.549> from<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.360> three<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.720> or

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
this different from a three to one or

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.510 
this different from a three to one or
could<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.470> could<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.189> really

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
could this have could this really

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.800 
could this have could this really
happened<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:44.909> by<00:01:45.060> chance<00:01:45.360> by<00:01:45.509> random

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
happened just by chance by random

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.719 
happened just by chance by random
variation<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.280> know<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.610> can

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
variation and you know that this can

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.460 
variation and you know that this can
happen<00:01:47.880> sometimes<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
happen sometimes right if you if you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.010 
happen sometimes right if you if you
flip<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> coin<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.670> know<00:01:50.790> only<00:01:51.030> 40<00:01:51.540> times<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
flip a coin you know only 40 times you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.929 
flip a coin you know only 40 times you
might<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.500> exactly<00:01:52.649> twenty<00:01:53.340> twenty<00:01:53.670> even

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
might not get exactly twenty twenty even

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
might not get exactly twenty twenty even
though<00:01:54.060> you're<00:01:54.210> expected<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
though you're expected really is is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
though you're expected really is is
twenty<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.280> twenty<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.420> let's<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.079> we

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
twenty to twenty so let's just see if we

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.149 
twenty to twenty so let's just see if we
had<00:01:58.409> expected<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.340> three<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.390> one<00:02:00.500> out<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.710> 40

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
had expected a three to one out of 40

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.389 
had expected a three to one out of 40
animals<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:03.360> would<00:02:03.390> need<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.990> 30<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.680> ten

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
animals we would need to have 30 and ten

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.950 
animals we would need to have 30 and ten
so<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.880> very<00:02:06.060> important<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.509> chi-square

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
so this is very important in chi-square

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.869 
so this is very important in chi-square
is<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.229> keep<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.500> total<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.520> exact

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
is that you keep the total the exact

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.479 
is that you keep the total the exact
same<00:02:09.539> between<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:10.590> observed<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.220> expected

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
same between your observed and expected

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.000 
same between your observed and expected
categories

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
categories

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.839 
categories
and<00:02:13.099> then<00:02:13.250> we're<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.670> apply<00:02:13.790> this

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
and then we're just going to apply this

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.940 
and then we're just going to apply this
formula<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.629> chi-square<00:02:15.080> formula<00:02:15.110> which<00:02:15.769> is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
formula this chi-square formula which is

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.429 
formula this chi-square formula which is
observed<00:02:16.489> minus<00:02:17.269> expected<00:02:17.390> you're<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.379> to

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
observed minus expected you're going to

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.440 
observed minus expected you're going to
square<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.220> then<00:02:19.939> you're<00:02:20.060> going<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.239> put

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
square that and then you're going to put

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.649 
square that and then you're going to put
that<00:02:20.599> over<00:02:21.220> expected<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.269> case<00:02:23.450> of

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
that over expected so in the case of

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.009 
that over expected so in the case of
this<00:02:24.110> observed<00:02:24.980> minus<00:02:25.250> expected<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.939> five<00:02:26.689> so

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
this observed minus expected is five so

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:27.960 
this observed minus expected is five so
we're<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.290> square<00:02:27.470> that

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
we're going to square that

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.800 
we're going to square that
25<00:02:28.970> over<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.470> expected<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.040> 30<00:02:31.810> again

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
25 over the expected of 30 again

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.809 
25 over the expected of 30 again
observed<00:02:33.680> minus<00:02:33.920> expected<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.549> is<00:02:34.670> going<00:02:34.760> to

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
observed minus expected here is going to

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.910 
observed minus expected here is going to
be<00:02:34.940> five<00:02:35.209> we're<00:02:36.019> going<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.200> square<00:02:36.409> that<00:02:36.470> and

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
be five we're going to square that and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.099 
be five we're going to square that and
we're<00:02:37.400> gonna<00:02:37.489> put<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.760> over<00:02:37.849> expected<00:02:38.450> which

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
we're gonna put it over expected which

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.839 
we're gonna put it over expected which
is<00:02:39.260> 10<00:02:39.700> that's<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.000> give<00:02:41.120> us<00:02:41.269> about<00:02:41.799> 0.8

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
is 10 that's going to give us about 0.8

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.270 
is 10 that's going to give us about 0.8
that's<00:02:43.849> going<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.090> give<00:02:44.209> us<00:02:44.329> about<00:02:44.950> 2.5<00:02:45.950> or

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
that's going to give us about 2.5 or

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.970 
that's going to give us about 2.5 or
exactly<00:02:46.700> 2.5<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.900> end<00:02:48.079> our<00:02:48.440> total

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
exactly 2.5 and in the end our total

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.000 
exactly 2.5 and in the end our total
chi-square<00:02:49.519> which<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.510> actually<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.620> sum

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
chi-square which is actually the the sum

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.140 
chi-square which is actually the the sum
of<00:02:52.280> these<00:02:53.180> things<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.930> going<00:02:54.829> to<00:02:55.250> be<00:02:55.430> three

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
of these things is going to be three

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.229 
of these things is going to be three
point<00:02:56.359> three<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:58.010> then<00:02:58.250> we're<00:02:58.849> gonna<00:02:58.970> look<00:02:59.120> on

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
point three so then we're gonna look on

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.360 
point three so then we're gonna look on
the<00:02:59.329> chi-square<00:02:59.750> table<00:02:59.959> down<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.829> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
the chi-square table down here and the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.589 
the chi-square table down here and the
only<00:03:01.489> other<00:03:01.730> thing<00:03:01.849> we<00:03:01.909> need<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.120> know<00:03:02.329> is<00:03:02.480> how

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
only other thing we need to know is how

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.619 
only other thing we need to know is how
many<00:03:02.750> degrees<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.139> freedom<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.590> have<00:03:04.629> degrees

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
many degrees of freedom we have degrees

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.470 
many degrees of freedom we have degrees
of<00:03:05.659> freedom<00:03:06.139> is<00:03:06.409> basically<00:03:06.859> one<00:03:07.549> fewer<00:03:08.000> than

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
of freedom is basically one fewer than

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.390 
of freedom is basically one fewer than
the<00:03:08.540> two<00:03:08.870> categories<00:03:09.530> or<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.069> number<00:03:10.310> of

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the two categories or the number of

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.860 
the two categories or the number of
categories<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:11.000> you're<00:03:11.120> looking<00:03:11.359> at<00:03:11.480> here

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
categories that you're looking at here

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.080 
categories that you're looking at here
we're<00:03:12.349> looking<00:03:12.440> at<00:03:12.650> only<00:03:12.889> two<00:03:13.129> categories

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
we're looking at only two categories

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.300 
we're looking at only two categories
that<00:03:14.510> are<00:03:14.629> relevant<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.200> our<00:03:15.230> analysis<00:03:15.829> we're

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
that are relevant to our analysis we're

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.640 
that are relevant to our analysis we're
trying<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.670> figure<00:03:16.909> out<00:03:16.970> whether<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.379> ratio

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
trying to figure out whether the ratio

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.640 
trying to figure out whether the ratio
of<00:03:18.709> slow<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.310> ninja<00:03:19.519> is<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:20.120> different<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.530> so

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
of slow to ninja is is different and so

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.080 
of slow to ninja is is different and so
there's<00:03:21.799> only<00:03:21.859> two<00:03:21.980> outcomes<00:03:22.340> there's<00:03:22.970> really

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
there's only two outcomes there's really

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.400 
there's only two outcomes there's really
only<00:03:23.209> one<00:03:23.540> degree<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.989> freedom<00:03:24.639> in<00:03:26.410> another

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
only one degree of freedom in another

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.009 
only one degree of freedom in another
way<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:27.650> thinking<00:03:27.680> about<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.579> if<00:03:28.940> if<00:03:29.599> you

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
way of thinking about it is if if you

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.500 
way of thinking about it is if if you
had<00:03:30.169> altered<00:03:30.560> one<00:03:30.829> of<00:03:30.980> your<00:03:31.190> categories<00:03:32.090> say

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
had altered one of your categories say

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.979 
had altered one of your categories say
you<00:03:32.569> had<00:03:32.919> manipulated<00:03:33.919> the<00:03:33.980> number<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.310> slow

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
you had manipulated the number of slow

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.839 
you had manipulated the number of slow
how<00:03:35.989> many<00:03:36.230> other<00:03:36.440> categories<00:03:37.099> would<00:03:37.430> have<00:03:37.609> had

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
how many other categories would have had

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.569 
how many other categories would have had
to<00:03:38.000> change<00:03:38.329> because<00:03:38.599> of<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:38.930> okay<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:39.650> if<00:03:40.370> we

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
to change because of that okay so if we

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.610 
to change because of that okay so if we
were<00:03:40.699> if<00:03:41.299> we<00:03:41.329> were<00:03:41.419> flipping<00:03:41.629> a<00:03:41.840> coin<00:03:42.049> there's

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
were if we were flipping a coin there's

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.390 
were if we were flipping a coin there's
either<00:03:42.709> heads<00:03:42.980> or<00:03:43.099> tails<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:44.919> if<00:03:45.919> your<00:03:46.129> number

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
either heads or tails and if your number

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.220 
either heads or tails and if your number
of<00:03:46.430> heads<00:03:47.030> goes<00:03:47.329> up<00:03:47.569> your<00:03:47.810> number<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.049> tails

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
of heads goes up your number of tails

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.990 
of heads goes up your number of tails
has<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.709> go<00:03:48.799> down<00:03:48.980> because<00:03:49.400> those<00:03:49.489> are<00:03:49.609> related

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
has to go down because those are related

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.180 
has to go down because those are related
categories<00:03:50.180> okay<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.440> in<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.799> case<00:03:52.010> of

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
categories okay so in the case of

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.920 
categories okay so in the case of
flipping<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.549> coin<00:03:52.790> there's<00:03:53.120> two<00:03:53.299> categories

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
flipping a coin there's two categories

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.020 
flipping a coin there's two categories
the<00:03:54.410> degrees<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.739> freedom<00:03:54.889> is<00:03:55.280> only<00:03:55.459> one<00:03:55.790> and

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
the degrees of freedom is only one and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.720 
the degrees of freedom is only one and
that's<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:56.510> same<00:03:56.780> here<00:03:57.099> two<00:03:58.099> categories<00:03:58.609> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
that's the same here two categories the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.970 
that's the same here two categories the
degrees<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.030> freedom<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.569> one<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.650> we're<00:04:00.829> going

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
degrees of freedom is one so we're going

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.770 
degrees of freedom is one so we're going
to<00:04:01.069> look<00:04:01.250> in<00:04:01.489> our<00:04:01.639> degrees<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.000> freedom<00:04:02.180> one

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
to look in our degrees of freedom one

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.210 
to look in our degrees of freedom one
line<00:04:03.049> we're<00:04:03.319> gonna<00:04:03.440> look<00:04:03.590> all<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.919> way<00:04:04.010> down

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
line we're gonna look all the way down

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.210 
line we're gonna look all the way down
until<00:04:04.459> we<00:04:05.180> see<00:04:05.449> a<00:04:05.769> something<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.859> looks<00:04:07.040> like

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
until we see a something that looks like

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.759 
until we see a something that looks like
a<00:04:07.280> 3.3<00:04:08.150> becoming<00:04:08.959> closer<00:04:09.199> we're<00:04:09.530> coming

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
a 3.3 becoming closer we're coming

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.369 
a 3.3 becoming closer we're coming
closer<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.909> would<00:04:11.060> be<00:04:11.239> somewhere<00:04:12.109> in<00:04:12.349> here

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
closer and it would be somewhere in here

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.369 
closer and it would be somewhere in here
so<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.489> answer<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.060> question<00:04:14.479> is<00:04:14.659> what

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
so the answer to this question is what

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.250 
so the answer to this question is what
is<00:04:15.470> your<00:04:15.590> p<00:04:15.769> value<00:04:15.799> it<00:04:16.489> is<00:04:16.760> between<00:04:18.370> 0.1<00:04:19.370> and

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
is your p value it is between 0.1 and

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.879 
is your p value it is between 0.1 and
whoopsies<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:22.270> 0.05<00:04:23.270> okay<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.169> that's<00:04:24.409> that's

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
whoopsies and 0.05 okay so that's that's

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.300 
whoopsies and 0.05 okay so that's that's
the<00:04:25.130> answer<00:04:25.159> it's<00:04:25.490> greater<00:04:25.700> than<00:04:25.789> 0.05

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.030 

so<00:04:32.710> now<00:04:33.710> say<00:04:34.460> we<00:04:34.580> have<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.730> p-value<00:04:35.889> let's<00:04:36.889> say

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
so now say we have a p-value let's say

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.890 
so now say we have a p-value let's say
in<00:04:37.160> this<00:04:37.280> case<00:04:37.490> our<00:04:37.639> p-value<00:04:37.880> was<00:04:38.389> something

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
in this case our p-value was something

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.920 
in this case our p-value was something
like<00:04:39.020> 0.15<00:04:39.830> we<00:04:40.310> had<00:04:40.400> done<00:04:40.610> an<00:04:41.150> experiment<00:04:41.570> in

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
like 0.15 we had done an experiment in

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.270 
like 0.15 we had done an experiment in
this<00:04:42.020> case<00:04:42.260> I'm<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.710> researcher<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.460> I've<00:04:44.030> done

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
this case I'm a researcher and I've done

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.370 
this case I'm a researcher and I've done
an<00:04:46.280> experiment<00:04:46.970> using<00:04:47.419> a<00:04:47.510> drug<00:04:47.810> that<00:04:48.080> might

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
an experiment using a drug that might

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.129 
an experiment using a drug that might
enhance<00:04:48.980> performance<00:04:49.280> on<00:04:49.730> genetics<00:04:50.090> exams<00:04:50.419> so

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
enhance performance on genetics exams so

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.470 
enhance performance on genetics exams so
I<00:04:51.169> had<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.560> group<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.160> 50<00:04:52.490> experimental

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
I had a group of 50 experimental

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.750 
I had a group of 50 experimental
subjects<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:53.990> got<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.290> drug<00:04:54.530> but<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.550> course

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
subjects that got the drug but of course

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.830 
subjects that got the drug but of course
I<00:04:55.880> had<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.120> have<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.270> control<00:04:56.630> group<00:04:56.810> that

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
I had to have a control group that

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.890 
I had to have a control group that
didn't<00:04:57.560> get<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.830> drug<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.360> gave<00:04:59.690> him<00:04:59.780> a

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
didn't get the drug and I gave him a

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.990 
didn't get the drug and I gave him a
genetics<00:05:00.230> exam<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:00.889> let's<00:05:01.490> say<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.639> did

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
genetics exam and let's say I did

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.850 
genetics exam and let's say I did
observe<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.450> difference<00:05:02.870> between<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.560> two

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
observe a difference between the two

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.980 
observe a difference between the two
groups<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.280> observed<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.730> higher<00:05:05.330> exam<00:05:05.750> average

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
groups I observed a higher exam average

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.650 
groups I observed a higher exam average
in<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.410> experimental<00:05:06.830> group<00:05:07.040> okay<00:05:08.030> let's<00:05:08.480> say

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
in the experimental group okay let's say

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.350 
in the experimental group okay let's say
they<00:05:08.810> had<00:05:08.990> an<00:05:09.110> average<00:05:09.290> of<00:05:10.180> 85<00:05:11.180> percent

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
they had an average of 85 percent

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.260 
they had an average of 85 percent
instead<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.960> 80<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.520> I<00:05:13.580> do<00:05:13.640> a<00:05:13.730> statistical

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
instead of 80 so I do a statistical

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.730 
instead of 80 so I do a statistical
analysis<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:14.930> in<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.080> end<00:05:15.260> let's<00:05:15.470> say<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.620> get

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
analysis and in the end let's say I get

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.880 
analysis and in the end let's say I get
a<00:05:15.800> p-value<00:05:16.040> of<00:05:16.400> 0.15<00:05:17.620> given<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:18.740> information

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
a p-value of 0.15 given that information

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.590 
a p-value of 0.15 given that information
which<00:05:19.490> of<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.700> following<00:05:19.820> statements<00:05:20.240> is<00:05:20.480> the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
which of the following statements is the

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.510 
which of the following statements is the
most<00:05:20.780> true<00:05:21.169> and<00:05:21.410> some<00:05:21.980> people<00:05:22.190> have<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.310> really

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
most true and some people have a really

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.370 
most true and some people have a really
hard<00:05:22.669> time<00:05:22.729> with<00:05:22.910> this<00:05:23.060> because<00:05:23.360> there's<00:05:24.320> a

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
hard time with this because there's a

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.130 
hard time with this because there's a
lot<00:05:24.530> of<00:05:24.620> ways<00:05:24.800> of<00:05:25.010> phrasing<00:05:25.910> that<00:05:26.060> but<00:05:26.510> if<00:05:26.990> you

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
lot of ways of phrasing that but if you

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.900 
lot of ways of phrasing that but if you
if<00:05:27.260> you<00:05:27.380> really<00:05:27.530> understand<00:05:28.070> what<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.400> is<00:05:28.580> then

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
if you really understand what it is then

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.030 
if you really understand what it is then
the<00:05:29.540> phrasing<00:05:29.960> won't<00:05:30.139> won't<00:05:30.560> get<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:30.860> down

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
the phrasing won't won't get you down

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.430 
the phrasing won't won't get you down
and<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:31.400> what<00:05:31.639> what<00:05:32.030> it<00:05:32.120> really<00:05:32.330> means<00:05:32.660> when

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
and so what what it really means when

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.940 
and so what what it really means when
you<00:05:33.530> have<00:05:33.560> a<00:05:33.650> p-value<00:05:33.860> of<00:05:34.190> point<00:05:34.370> 1<00:05:34.490> 5<00:05:34.669> it<00:05:35.600> means

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
you have a p-value of point 1 5 it means

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.650 
you have a p-value of point 1 5 it means
even<00:05:36.950> if<00:05:37.190> there<00:05:37.310> hadn't<00:05:37.640> been<00:05:37.700> any<00:05:38.150> difference

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
even if there hadn't been any difference

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.900 
even if there hadn't been any difference
between<00:05:38.750> your<00:05:39.050> groups<00:05:39.229> at<00:05:39.470> all

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
between your groups at all

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.600 
between your groups at all
in<00:05:41.180> 15<00:05:41.780> percent<00:05:42.080> of<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.229> cases<00:05:42.380> you'd<00:05:42.740> still

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
in 15 percent of the cases you'd still

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.670 
in 15 percent of the cases you'd still
see<00:05:43.820> a<00:05:44.060> difference<00:05:44.540> at<00:05:44.810> least<00:05:44.990> as<00:05:45.380> large<00:05:45.560> as

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
see a difference at least as large as

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.830 
see a difference at least as large as
the<00:05:45.860> one<00:05:46.010> that<00:05:46.160> you<00:05:46.280> saw<00:05:46.520> ok<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:47.300> even<00:05:47.570> if<00:05:47.750> you

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
the one that you saw ok so even if you

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.260 
the one that you saw ok so even if you
hadn't<00:05:48.140> treated<00:05:48.560> one<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.700> experimental

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
hadn't treated one of the experimental

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.520 
hadn't treated one of the experimental
groups<00:05:50.479> and<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:50.810> were<00:05:50.900> actually<00:05:51.050> looking<00:05:51.289> at

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
groups and you were actually looking at

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.190 
groups and you were actually looking at
two<00:05:51.770> control<00:05:52.220> groups<00:05:52.660> right<00:05:53.660> they<00:05:53.960> aren't

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
two control groups right they aren't

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.779 
two control groups right they aren't
always<00:05:54.410> going<00:05:54.620> to<00:05:54.680> have<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.010> exact<00:05:55.250> same<00:05:55.370> exam

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
always going to have the exact same exam

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:56.950 
always going to have the exact same exam
average<00:05:56.120> there's<00:05:56.300> always<00:05:56.419> going<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.630> be<00:05:56.690> some

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
average there's always going to be some

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.380 
average there's always going to be some
variation<00:05:57.260> as<00:05:58.190> statistics<00:05:58.729> tells<00:05:59.000> us<00:05:59.150> about

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
variation as statistics tells us about

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.140 
variation as statistics tells us about
that<00:05:59.570> variation<00:06:00.200> and<00:06:01.190> so<00:06:01.430> what<00:06:01.820> the<00:06:01.970> real

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
that variation and so what the real

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.790 
that variation and so what the real
answer<00:06:02.180> is<00:06:02.630> is<00:06:02.810> this<00:06:02.900> one<00:06:03.110> at<00:06:03.229> the<00:06:03.320> bottom<00:06:03.650> it

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
answer is is this one at the bottom it

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.170 
answer is is this one at the bottom it
says<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.010> difference<00:06:04.340> that<00:06:04.700> you<00:06:04.820> observe

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
says the difference that you observe

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.140 
says the difference that you observe
would<00:06:05.750> it<00:06:05.840> rise<00:06:06.020> in<00:06:06.320> 15<00:06:06.800> percent<00:06:07.250> of<00:06:07.460> cases

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
would it rise in 15 percent of cases

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.420 
would it rise in 15 percent of cases
when<00:06:08.900> you're<00:06:09.020> just<00:06:09.169> comparing<00:06:09.500> groups<00:06:10.190> that

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
when you're just comparing groups that

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.450 
when you're just comparing groups that
don't<00:06:11.050> that<00:06:12.050> don't<00:06:12.289> differ<00:06:12.740> in<00:06:13.039> any<00:06:13.190> real<00:06:13.430> way

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
don't that don't differ in any real way

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.880 
don't that don't differ in any real way
okay<00:06:14.150> if<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:14.300> just<00:06:14.330> had<00:06:14.630> two<00:06:15.169> control<00:06:15.620> groups

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
okay if you just had two control groups

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.659 
okay if you just had two control groups
of<00:06:16.130> 50<00:06:16.880> people<00:06:17.090> in<00:06:17.300> it<00:06:17.860> in<00:06:18.860> 15<00:06:19.280> percent<00:06:19.520> of<00:06:19.580> the

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
of 50 people in it in 15 percent of the

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.420 
of 50 people in it in 15 percent of the
cases<00:06:20.000> you<00:06:20.030> would<00:06:20.270> see<00:06:20.539> at<00:06:21.530> least<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:21.950> large<00:06:22.160> of

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
cases you would see at least a large of

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.070 
cases you would see at least a large of
a<00:06:22.789> difference<00:06:23.120> is<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.330> is<00:06:23.479> the<00:06:23.750> one<00:06:23.870> that<00:06:23.990> you

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
a difference is that is the one that you

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.250 
a difference is that is the one that you
observed<00:06:24.440> okay<00:06:24.919> now<00:06:25.760> what<00:06:26.300> it<00:06:26.419> can<00:06:26.720> to<00:06:26.900> tell<00:06:27.110> us

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
observed okay now what it can to tell us

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.020 
observed okay now what it can to tell us
what<00:06:27.440> a<00:06:27.470> p-value<00:06:27.680> can't<00:06:28.250> tell<00:06:28.520> us<00:06:28.640> is<00:06:28.760> what<00:06:28.940> is

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
what a p-value can't tell us is what is

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.180 
what a p-value can't tell us is what is
actually<00:06:29.660> happening<00:06:30.260> okay<00:06:30.830> you<00:06:30.890> can<00:06:31.039> only

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
actually happening okay you can only

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.529 
actually happening okay you can only
tell<00:06:31.490> us<00:06:31.580> about<00:06:31.760> the<00:06:31.880> probability<00:06:32.510> of

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
tell us about the probability of

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.270 
tell us about the probability of
something<00:06:32.780> happening<00:06:32.900> so<00:06:33.710> whenever<00:06:34.070> you<00:06:34.250> see

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
something happening so whenever you see

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.190 
something happening so whenever you see
something<00:06:34.700> like<00:06:34.729> this<00:06:35.060> the<00:06:35.780> difference<00:06:35.900> you

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
something like this the difference you

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.170 
something like this the difference you
observed<00:06:36.530> definitely<00:06:37.190> arose<00:06:37.400> by<00:06:37.580> chance<00:06:37.880> your

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
observed definitely arose by chance your

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.149 
observed definitely arose by chance your
drug<00:06:38.660> definitely<00:06:39.140> has<00:06:39.260> no<00:06:39.409> effect<00:06:39.740> on<00:06:39.860> exam

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
drug definitely has no effect on exam

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.820 
drug definitely has no effect on exam
performance<00:06:40.370> that's<00:06:41.240> that's<00:06:41.599> never<00:06:41.990> it's

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
performance that's that's never it's

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.679 
performance that's that's never it's
never<00:06:43.159> something<00:06:43.340> that<00:06:43.520> a<00:06:43.610> p-value<00:06:43.820> can

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:44.689 
never something that a p-value can

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.479 
never something that a p-value can
directly<00:06:44.959> tell<00:06:45.169> you<00:06:45.349> okay<00:06:45.979> staying<00:06:46.279> with<00:06:46.399> the

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:46.489 
directly tell you okay staying with the

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.369 
directly tell you okay staying with the
second<00:06:46.879> one<00:06:47.179> the<00:06:47.539> drug<00:06:47.779> is<00:06:47.899> effective<00:06:48.019> and

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379 
second one the drug is effective and

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:52.959 
second one the drug is effective and
only<00:06:48.679> 85%<00:06:49.189> of<00:06:49.549> the<00:06:49.639> subjects<00:06:50.709> again<00:06:51.969> p-values

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:52.969 
only 85% of the subjects again p-values

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:55.029 
only 85% of the subjects again p-values
can't<00:06:53.179> tell<00:06:53.360> you<00:06:53.479> exactly<00:06:54.049> what's<00:06:54.679> going<00:06:54.829> on

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 
can't tell you exactly what's going on

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.499 
can't tell you exactly what's going on
and<00:06:55.249> it<00:06:55.309> certainly<00:06:55.579> can't<00:06:55.789> tell<00:06:55.939> you<00:06:56.059> detailed

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
and it certainly can't tell you detailed

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.229 
and it certainly can't tell you detailed
information<00:06:56.689> like<00:06:57.379> that<00:06:57.669> the<00:06:58.669> next<00:06:58.789> one<00:06:59.059> says

00:06:59.229 --> 00:06:59.239 
information like that the next one says

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:01.989 
information like that the next one says
if<00:06:59.509> you<00:06:59.809> sample<00:07:00.049> 300<00:07:00.649> students<00:07:01.009> subjects

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:01.999 
if you sample 300 students subjects

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:03.609 
if you sample 300 students subjects
instead<00:07:02.269> of<00:07:02.360> a<00:07:02.419> hundred<00:07:02.659> okay<00:07:03.169> so<00:07:03.229> but<00:07:03.499> before

00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:03.619 
instead of a hundred okay so but before

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:05.799 
instead of a hundred okay so but before
you<00:07:03.919> add<00:07:03.979> 50<00:07:04.309> plus<00:07:04.489> 50<00:07:04.639> so<00:07:04.879> a<00:07:04.939> hundred<00:07:05.209> subjects

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:05.809 
you add 50 plus 50 so a hundred subjects

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:08.379 
you add 50 plus 50 so a hundred subjects
let's<00:07:06.439> say<00:07:06.589> you<00:07:06.649> you<00:07:07.279> tripled<00:07:07.789> the<00:07:07.879> size<00:07:08.059> of

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:08.389 
let's say you you tripled the size of

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:10.359 
let's say you you tripled the size of
your<00:07:08.509> study<00:07:08.749> so<00:07:08.929> now<00:07:09.049> you<00:07:09.110> have<00:07:09.229> 300<00:07:09.529> subjects

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:10.369 
your study so now you have 300 subjects

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:11.919 
your study so now you have 300 subjects
let's<00:07:10.909> say<00:07:11.059> the<00:07:11.179> magnitude<00:07:11.389> of<00:07:11.809> the

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:11.929 
let's say the magnitude of the

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:13.569 
let's say the magnitude of the
difference<00:07:12.079> stay<00:07:12.499> the<00:07:12.679> same<00:07:12.889> that<00:07:13.219> is<00:07:13.369> one

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:13.579 
difference stay the same that is one

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:15.699 
difference stay the same that is one
group<00:07:13.759> about<00:07:13.969> 85<00:07:14.449> percent<00:07:14.809> average<00:07:15.439> the<00:07:15.619> other

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:15.709 
group about 85 percent average the other

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:18.999 
group about 85 percent average the other
group<00:07:15.889> got<00:07:16.249> an<00:07:16.369> 80<00:07:16.549> percent<00:07:16.699> average<00:07:17.829> now<00:07:18.829> it

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.009 
group got an 80 percent average now it

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:20.679 
group got an 80 percent average now it
says<00:07:19.189> here<00:07:19.339> the<00:07:19.489> new<00:07:19.699> p-value<00:07:20.389> would<00:07:20.539> be

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:20.689 
says here the new p-value would be

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:23.109 
says here the new p-value would be
higher<00:07:20.959> but<00:07:21.589> that's<00:07:21.769> the<00:07:22.129> exact<00:07:22.399> opposite<00:07:22.969> of

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:23.119 
higher but that's the exact opposite of

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.179 
higher but that's the exact opposite of
what<00:07:23.209> would<00:07:23.449> happen<00:07:23.629> okay<00:07:24.079> as<00:07:24.259> you<00:07:24.860> increase

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:25.189 
what would happen okay as you increase

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:27.790 
what would happen okay as you increase
your<00:07:25.399> sample<00:07:25.819> size<00:07:25.969> the<00:07:26.629> p-value<00:07:27.229> is<00:07:27.379> going<00:07:27.559> to

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
your sample size the p-value is going to

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.709 
your sample size the p-value is going to
keep<00:07:28.009> getting<00:07:28.129> lower<00:07:28.459> and<00:07:28.610> lower<00:07:28.759> provided

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:29.719 
keep getting lower and lower provided

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:30.729 
keep getting lower and lower provided
that<00:07:29.809> the<00:07:29.959> magnitude<00:07:30.409> of<00:07:30.499> the<00:07:30.619> difference

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:30.739 
that the magnitude of the difference

00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:33.369 
that the magnitude of the difference
that<00:07:30.979> you<00:07:31.159> see<00:07:31.399> stays<00:07:32.059> the<00:07:32.239> same<00:07:32.269> okay<00:07:33.019> so<00:07:33.079> in

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:33.379 
that you see stays the same okay so in

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.769 
that you see stays the same okay so in
the<00:07:33.499> end<00:07:33.619> this<00:07:34.279> this<00:07:34.969> is<00:07:35.119> the<00:07:35.239> right<00:07:35.419> way<00:07:35.599> okay

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:35.779 
the end this this is the right way okay

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:40.539 
the end this this is the right way okay
so<00:07:36.469> I<00:07:36.499> hope<00:07:36.829> that<00:07:36.860> that<00:07:37.399> gives<00:07:38.029> you<00:07:38.119> some<00:07:38.329> help
