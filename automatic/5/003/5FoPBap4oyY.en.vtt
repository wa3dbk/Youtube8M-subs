00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.670
 very good that civic hardware seems 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.280
 today another video is very well where we 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.200
 help our friend juani king which 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.480
 wants a budget in a store 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 Argentina that has left us here with 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.830
 20 thousand pesos is to say that it has 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.510
 quite difficult because it does not 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.820
 they have almost stock of nothing and what 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.610
 they have is quite load pointless 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.010
 but well there we go 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.650
 first before you clarify what 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.440
 I wanted to do to not see touch but not 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.140
 there are no plates bazas conchi be of 97 and 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.879
 and he is 17 the only one and 7 there is no 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.200
 there's ni of the 4.775 series so this thing what 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.020
 that we had 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.960
 we will start first by the boxes the 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.660
 which is relatively cheap in this 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.580
 respect to others so it's not worth 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.740
 It is worthwhile to lower more in the quality of 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.170
 box this costume will be pretty 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.450
 balanced for everything we're going to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.710
 have on our computer to have very 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.950
 good cooling 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.620
 plenty of space for your graphic and it brings a 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.890
 pair of additional fans already 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.990
 posts that will give you as I say a better 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.990
 air flow is thus the guarantee of a 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.149
 year 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.729
 then we have the motherboard with us 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.619
 it's an oil 97 as I said before 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.850
 there are other chipset in this store the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.920
 soccer 1150 is a gigabyte 5 that of the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.200
 what was with this chipset was certainly 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 the best to play although a bit expensive 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.490
 with this will have an excellent sound for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.979
 to play 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 and many many things that come 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.000
 accompanied by it as we have port of 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.820
 m2 vital to put the ssd that has not 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.920
 been in the budget but we're going with 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.490
 it's total to spare and some very good 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 motherboard 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.440
 then we will have the processor that 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.070
 I said is the only i7 there is in this 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.680
 budget could not miss one the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.290
 4,790 k of the haswell refresh series 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.540
 fresholve better said as you know 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.800
 all the junk is much more to see than 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.020
 what speaks in addition to having a 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.800
 higher frequency of stock than what 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.220
 old hardware 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.780
 therefore it will be a machinist in addition to a 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.910
 Traiguén guarantee I do not know why in 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.830
 this shop a guarantee are about and 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.480
 back behind but almost no product 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.450
 has bathroom guarantee to know 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.140
 to refrigerate it we will be accompanied by a 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.540
 hyper master cooler 212 evo what good 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.120
 within those that had the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.340
 CPU fans that there was was the one 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.190
 down they went to this budget do not you 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.460
 will serve to make an overclock 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.740
 and very aggressive but yes to keep very 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.720
 good stock temperatures as you see other 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.720
 once a year warranty but as I say 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.960
 This will serve you in sunshine, although here 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.340
 do not put it if I'm not mistaken in the 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.620
 Spanish pages at least we 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.390
 It says that it does not support the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.180
 socket 1156 problems is compatible no 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.920
 I'm telling you 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.079
 yes, if you want to make openings 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.060
 you'll have to spend from mom and put in the 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.670
 tape action and I think I remember that no 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.040
 It was also not very expensive with respect to 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.060
 fans in this store 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.830
 so we continue with the branch 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.840
 to 1600 he exercised and latency 9 that as 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.020
 I knew the optimum for intel where yes it will be 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.239
 more performance and better temperatures 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.190
 they are the course air they are a little gray 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.200
 the truth but with this computer with 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.780
 this budget was the minimum 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.440
 we could put 16 gigas that will be left over 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.980
 both to play and to edit 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.680
 we follow then with the graph a 970 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.510
 much more powerful in games than the 290 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.850
 x from a md and for the same price 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.850
 also has a series vehicles and 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.160
 very very good ventilation that 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.920
 you can overclock ea thanks to the box 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.590
 spare this is powered by a 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.160
 source of cooler master la power plus de 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.430
 600 with 80plus certification that the 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.500
 true in this store so there was no 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.019
 almost all sources were all cooler 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.880
 master and this was where the least 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.410
 oversized so to speak was 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.290
 since the others 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.600
 general 800 and such and also very expensive 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.860
 therefore start and it will be enough and 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.069
 it will be quite good for this pc 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.930
 then we will have the hd of which the 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.800
 classics are gay from unter to there is no more 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.199
 comments 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:45.759
 this budget is adrià for 19 thousand 860 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.949
 pesos in Argentines but of course in this 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.960
 budget is missing something and still exceeds 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.479
 which will give you much more fluid in the 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.340
 desk but it did not go in and we had 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.930
 to download for example on the motherboard but 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.430
 as I tell you with the little stock that there was 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.480
 we have to go down already the low-end 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.490
 197 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.200
 will also try to lower the processor 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.090
 but as I say in the can because 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.580
 we go down at 5 and it's not worth that 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.120
 loss of performance by a single ssd 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.330
 so if you can not shoot you buy 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.360
 the one of 19 thousand pesos and if you can throw 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.090
 a little buy that has the ssd for 22 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.610
 one thousand pesos short 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.220
 as much as I tell you this computer to 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.380
 Despite the store as I tell you, 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.880
 very little stock but this store in all 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.580
 Argentina's 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.139
 this will perfectly serve to play a 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.139
 greeting and chau chau
