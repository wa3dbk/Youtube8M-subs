symphonic library mere software what Mia

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.100 
symphonic library mere software what Mia
does<00:00:18.820> is<00:00:19.150> it<00:00:19.359> gives<00:00:19.510> us<00:00:19.720> a<00:00:19.960> reverb<00:00:20.970> environment

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
does is it gives us a reverb environment

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.779 
does is it gives us a reverb environment
unlike<00:00:23.110> other<00:00:23.470> reverbs<00:00:24.070> that<00:00:24.310> we<00:00:24.400> use<00:00:24.580> on<00:00:24.730> a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
unlike other reverbs that we use on a

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.250 
unlike other reverbs that we use on a
daily<00:00:24.820> basis<00:00:25.570> in<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:25.750> studio<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:27.310> have<00:00:27.550> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
daily basis in the studio we have the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.720 
daily basis in the studio we have the
opportunity<00:00:29.260> here<00:00:29.500> to<00:00:29.680> place<00:00:29.920> instruments

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
opportunity here to place instruments

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.880 
opportunity here to place instruments
within<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.539> soundstage<00:00:32.140> so<00:00:32.529> instead<00:00:32.829> of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
within the soundstage so instead of

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.920 
within the soundstage so instead of
having<00:00:33.250> separate<00:00:34.000> reverbs<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.539> separate

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
having separate reverbs and separate

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.950 
having separate reverbs and separate
instruments<00:00:35.559> we<00:00:36.070> can<00:00:36.280> actually<00:00:36.430> put<00:00:37.269> multiple

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
instruments we can actually put multiple

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.759 
instruments we can actually put multiple
instruments<00:00:38.469> onto<00:00:39.039> the<00:00:39.670> stage<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.390> all<00:00:41.289> of

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
instruments onto the stage and all of

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.040 
instruments onto the stage and all of
them<00:00:41.920> interact<00:00:42.550> with<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:42.969> perfect<00:00:43.510> convolution

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
them interact with a perfect convolution

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.919 
them interact with a perfect convolution
reverb<00:00:44.199> of<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:45.809> environments<00:00:46.809> these

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
reverb of the environments these

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.540 
reverb of the environments these
classical<00:00:47.379> environments<00:00:47.920> this<00:00:48.069> one<00:00:48.219> happens

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
classical environments this one happens

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.849 
classical environments this one happens
to<00:00:48.640> be<00:00:48.729> Mozart's<00:00:49.659> Concert<00:00:50.050> Hall<00:00:50.079> in<00:00:50.499> Vienna

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
to be Mozart's Concert Hall in Vienna

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.629 
to be Mozart's Concert Hall in Vienna
and<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.809> conclusion<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:54.249> it<00:00:54.399> just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:54.639 
and the the conclusion is that it just

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:57.329 
and the the conclusion is that it just
sounds<00:00:54.850> incredible<00:00:55.479> it<00:00:56.469> really<00:00:56.859> does<00:00:57.039> give

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
sounds incredible it really does give

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.209 
sounds incredible it really does give
not<00:00:58.179> only<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.479> focus<00:00:58.899> to<00:00:58.929> the<00:00:59.139> sound<00:00:59.469> but<00:01:00.069> it's

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
not only a focus to the sound but it's

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.860 
not only a focus to the sound but it's
also<00:01:00.429> really<00:01:00.729> helpful<00:01:00.940> when<00:01:01.329> you're<00:01:01.479> working

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
also really helpful when you're working

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.119 
also really helpful when you're working
when<00:01:01.989> you're<00:01:02.079> writing<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.679> you<00:01:02.739> can<00:01:02.859> see<00:01:03.010> the

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
when you're writing and you can see the

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.560 
when you're writing and you can see the
limitations<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:03.909> instruments<00:01:04.420> which

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
limitations of the instruments which

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.719 
limitations of the instruments which
instruments<00:01:05.110> are<00:01:05.199> needed<00:01:05.590> where<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.280> spaces

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
instruments are needed where the spaces

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.080 
instruments are needed where the spaces
are<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.150> stage<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:08.610> found<00:01:09.610> it<00:01:09.759> really

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
are in the stage I found it really

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.940 
are in the stage I found it really
really<00:01:10.240> helpful<00:01:10.719> working<00:01:11.680> with<00:01:11.799> this

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
really helpful working with this

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.800 
really helpful working with this
graphical<00:01:12.399> interface<00:01:12.850> as<00:01:13.090> opposed<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.600> just

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
graphical interface as opposed to just

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.139 
graphical interface as opposed to just
working<00:01:14.170> coldly<00:01:14.829> with<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.100> MIDI<00:01:15.280> notes<00:01:15.340> so

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
working coldly with the MIDI notes so

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.370 
working coldly with the MIDI notes so
once<00:01:16.360> we<00:01:16.509> put<00:01:16.689> an<00:01:16.780> instrument<00:01:17.229> on<00:01:17.320> the

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
once we put an instrument on the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.880 
once we put an instrument on the
soundstage<00:01:17.890> we<00:01:18.579> then<00:01:18.820> get<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.719> ton<00:01:20.289> of<00:01:20.320> options

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
soundstage we then get a ton of options

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.719 
soundstage we then get a ton of options
of<00:01:21.219> how<00:01:21.729> then<00:01:22.000> we<00:01:22.270> can<00:01:22.479> control<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:24.070> sound<00:01:24.430> in

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
of how then we can control this sound in

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.149 
of how then we can control this sound in
this<00:01:24.969> space<00:01:25.299> and<00:01:25.630> they<00:01:26.079> range<00:01:26.380> from<00:01:26.500> different

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
this space and they range from different

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.880 
this space and they range from different
polarity<00:01:27.670> microphones<00:01:28.390> there's<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.469> series<00:01:29.859> of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
polarity microphones there's a series of

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.459 
polarity microphones there's a series of
presets<00:01:30.460> for<00:01:30.759> four<00:01:31.539> different<00:01:31.840> instruments

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
presets for four different instruments

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.440 
presets for four different instruments
that<00:01:32.619> you<00:01:33.009> can<00:01:33.159> call<00:01:33.399> on<00:01:33.579> this<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.000> width<00:01:34.270> of

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
that you can call on this the width of

that you can call on this the width of
the<00:01:34.600> sound<00:01:34.899> there's<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:36.070> wet<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.429> dry

further back we've actually switched on

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.289 
further back we've actually switched on
a<00:01:56.799> secondary<00:01:57.280> microphone<00:01:57.549> which<00:01:57.969> is<00:01:57.999> in<00:01:58.210> the
