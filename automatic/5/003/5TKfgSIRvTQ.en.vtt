you<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> ipad<00:01:45.540> 3<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> ipad<00:01:46.500> 4<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you have the ipad 3 or the ipad 4 and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.710 
you have the ipad 3 or the ipad 4 and
you<00:01:47.310> switch<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.850> ipad<00:01:48.119> mini<00:01:48.149> you're<00:01:48.570> not

going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.049> notice<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.590> much<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.920> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
going to really notice that much of a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
going to really notice that much of a
difference<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> screen<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:51.600> least<00:01:51.750> i

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
difference in the screen or at least i

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.719 
difference in the screen or at least i
didn't<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.740> course<00:01:52.950> you'll<00:01:53.130> also<00:01:53.250> notice<00:01:53.610> that

which is supposed to be two times faster
than<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.840> a5<00:03:16.260> chip<00:03:16.560> as<00:03:16.769> far<00:03:17.010> as<00:03:17.100> CPU<00:03:17.459> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
than the a5 chip as far as CPU and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.300 
than the a5 chip as far as CPU and
graphics<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.420> then<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> ipad<00:03:19.170> 4<00:03:19.440> has<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.100> new

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
graphics and then the ipad 4 has the new

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.550 
graphics and then the ipad 4 has the new
a<00:03:20.340> 6x<00:03:21.090> ship<00:03:21.450> which<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.989> supposed<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.410> two

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
a 6x ship which is supposed to be two

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.770 
a 6x ship which is supposed to be two
times<00:03:22.769> faster<00:03:23.190> than<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.459> a6<00:03:24.030> chip<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.480> far<00:03:24.690> as

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
times faster than the a6 chip is far as

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.290 
times faster than the a6 chip is far as
CPU<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.500> graphics<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.760> basically<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.209> you

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
CPU and graphics so basically if you

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.090 
CPU and graphics so basically if you
compare<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> ipad<00:03:27.959> mini<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.470> a5<00:03:28.800> chip

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
compare the ipad mini with the a5 chip

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.580 
compare the ipad mini with the a5 chip
to<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> new<00:03:29.489> ipad<00:03:29.880> 4<00:03:30.180> with<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.450> a6x<00:03:31.080> chip<00:03:31.200> it's

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
to the new ipad 4 with the a6x chip it's

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.740 
to the new ipad 4 with the a6x chip it's
supposed<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.010> four<00:03:32.400> times<00:03:32.730> faster<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.540> don't

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
supposed to be four times faster I don't

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.240 
supposed to be four times faster I don't
have<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:33.989> new<00:03:34.110> iPad<00:03:34.410> 4<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:34.860> can't<00:03:35.130> do<00:03:35.220> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
have the new iPad 4 so I can't do a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.430 
have the new iPad 4 so I can't do a
speed<00:03:35.640> comparison<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> ipad<00:03:36.660> mini<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.410> i

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
speed comparison to the ipad mini but i

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.290 
speed comparison to the ipad mini but i
do<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:37.709> an<00:03:37.860> ipad<00:03:38.160> 3<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.640> i've<00:03:38.730> seen<00:03:38.940> all<00:03:39.150> this

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
do have an ipad 3 and i've seen all this

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.080 
do have an ipad 3 and i've seen all this
v<00:03:39.480> test<00:03:39.720> as<00:03:39.840> ipad<00:03:40.170> for<00:03:40.410> online<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.489> i<00:03:41.670> will<00:03:41.880> say

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
v test as ipad for online and i will say

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.550 
v test as ipad for online and i will say
that<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> little<00:03:42.870> bit<00:03:42.989> faster<00:03:43.170> if<00:03:43.470> you

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
that it is a little bit faster if you

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.259 
that it is a little bit faster if you
put<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.800> ipad<00:03:44.100> mini<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.400> ipad<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:45.090> right

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
put the ipad mini and ipad for right

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.670 
put the ipad mini and ipad for right
beside<00:03:45.540> each<00:03:45.570> other<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.080> will<00:03:46.260> notice<00:03:46.500> a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
beside each other you will notice a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.290 
beside each other you will notice a
little<00:03:46.890> bit<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> difference<00:03:47.580> when<00:03:48.180> you're

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
little bit of a difference when you're

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.880 
little bit of a difference when you're
opening<00:03:48.570> games<00:03:48.840> apps<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.590> stuff<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.830> that

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
opening games apps and stuff like that

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.460 
opening games apps and stuff like that
just<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.459> low<00:03:50.640> time<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.120> them<00:03:51.300> also<00:03:51.840> obviously

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
just the low time of them also obviously

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.600 
just the low time of them also obviously
the<00:03:52.620> graphics<00:03:53.040> are<00:03:53.160> going<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.340> be<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.459> lot

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
the graphics are going to be a lot

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.790 
the graphics are going to be a lot
better<00:03:53.670> on<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.150> ipad<00:03:54.540> 3<00:03:54.810> or<00:03:54.989> 4<00:03:55.350> because<00:03:55.650> it's

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
better on the ipad 3 or 4 because it's

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.680 
better on the ipad 3 or 4 because it's
got<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.070> retina<00:03:56.340> display<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:57.360> you'll<00:03:57.480> notice

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
got the retina display and you'll notice

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.780 
got the retina display and you'll notice
a<00:03:57.930> little<00:03:58.140> bit<00:03:58.350> better<00:03:58.920> overall<00:03:59.340> performance

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
a little bit better overall performance

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.370 
a little bit better overall performance
just<00:04:00.150> because<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.510> has<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> better<00:04:01.049> more

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
just because it has a better more

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.170 
just because it has a better more
powerful<00:04:01.799> chip<00:04:02.040> but<00:04:02.519> if<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.730> think<00:04:02.760> about<00:04:03.030> it

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
powerful chip but if you think about it

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.570 
powerful chip but if you think about it
the<00:04:03.570> ipad<00:04:03.840> mini<00:04:03.900> isn't<00:04:04.440> powering<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.280> Retina

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
the ipad mini isn't powering a Retina

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.890 
the ipad mini isn't powering a Retina
display<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.090> even<00:04:06.360> though<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.690> lower

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
display so even though it's a lower

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.259 
display so even though it's a lower
powered<00:04:07.350> slower<00:04:07.739> chip<00:04:08.100> it's<00:04:08.700> not<00:04:08.880> having<00:04:09.239> a

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
powered slower chip it's not having a

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.000 
powered slower chip it's not having a
power<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.600> render<00:04:09.870> display<00:04:09.989> whereas<00:04:10.440> ipad<00:04:10.830> 3

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
power that render display whereas ipad 3

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.580 
power that render display whereas ipad 3
or<00:04:11.160> 4<00:04:11.370> has<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:11.850> more<00:04:12.180> powerful<00:04:12.330> chip<00:04:12.720> but<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.380> has

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
or 4 has a more powerful chip but it has

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.199 
or 4 has a more powerful chip but it has
to<00:04:13.800> power<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.220> right<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.459> way<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:14.850> basically

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
to power the right this way so basically

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.699 
to power the right this way so basically
yes<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.780> little<00:04:15.990> faster<00:04:16.380> is

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
yes it is a little faster is

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.349 
yes it is a little faster is
change<00:04:17.069> your<00:04:17.220> life<00:04:17.400> drastically<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.120> it

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
change your life drastically that it

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.809 
change your life drastically that it
took<00:04:18.509> half<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.900> second<00:04:19.229> left<00:04:19.410> open<00:04:19.769> an<00:04:19.889> app<00:04:20.069> no

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:20.819 
took half a second left open an app no

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.460 
took half a second left open an app no
now<00:04:21.299> let's<00:04:21.449> talk<00:04:21.569> about<00:04:21.630> pricing<00:04:22.259> because<00:04:22.350> I

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
now let's talk about pricing because I

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.809 
now let's talk about pricing because I
think<00:04:22.620> this<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:22.919> going<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.310> be<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.580> main

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 
think this is going to be the main

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.820 
think this is going to be the main
factor<00:04:24.060> on<00:04:24.600> people's<00:04:25.139> decision<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.680> whether

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
factor on people's decision of whether

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.650 
factor on people's decision of whether
they<00:04:26.099> should<00:04:26.130> get<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.520> iPad<00:04:26.880> Mini<00:04:27.120> or<00:04:27.360> the

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
they should get the iPad Mini or the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.960 
they should get the iPad Mini or the
ipad<00:04:28.080> 4<00:04:28.380> so<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.830> ipad<00:04:29.099> mini<00:04:29.130> starts<00:04:29.699> out<00:04:29.819> at

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
ipad 4 so the ipad mini starts out at

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.670 
ipad 4 so the ipad mini starts out at
three<00:04:30.120> hundred<00:04:30.300> thirty<00:04:30.630> bucks<00:04:30.900> for<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.259> 16

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
three hundred thirty bucks for the 16

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.159 
three hundred thirty bucks for the 16
gigabyte<00:04:32.099> Wi-Fi<00:04:32.550> model<00:04:32.940> our<00:04:33.300> wars<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.630> ipad<00:04:33.930> 4

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
gigabyte Wi-Fi model our wars the ipad 4

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.290 
gigabyte Wi-Fi model our wars the ipad 4
for<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.470> 16<00:04:34.800> gigabyte<00:04:35.160> Wi-Fi<00:04:35.490> model<00:04:35.880> starts

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
for the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi model starts

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.089 
for the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi model starts
out<00:04:36.479> at<00:04:36.599> five<00:04:36.810> hundred<00:04:37.020> bucks<00:04:37.199> so<00:04:37.979> the

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
out at five hundred bucks so the

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.070 
out at five hundred bucks so the
difference<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.490> price<00:04:38.669> is<00:04:38.940> 170<00:04:39.599> bucks<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.020> if
