obviously it's much bulkier than the
original<00:00:44.180> ps3<00:00:44.629> controller<00:00:46.660> which<00:00:47.660> is<00:00:47.690> right

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
original ps3 controller which is right

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.549

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
your hand and to me I personally I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.040 
your hand and to me I personally I
thought<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:08.150> controller<00:01:08.540> was<00:01:08.720> pretty

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
thought that this controller was pretty

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.680 
thought that this controller was pretty
small<00:01:09.260> for<00:01:09.410> my<00:01:09.530> hands<00:01:09.860> if<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.160> can<00:01:10.310> see<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.730> have

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
small for my hands if you can see I have

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.210 
small for my hands if you can see I have
to<00:01:11.810> like<00:01:11.930> adjust<00:01:12.050> it<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.530> lot<00:01:12.680> during<00:01:12.860> gameplay

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
to like adjust it a lot during gameplay

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.940 
to like adjust it a lot during gameplay
and<00:01:13.490> everything<00:01:13.790> but<00:01:14.360> for<00:01:15.290> some<00:01:15.530> reason<00:01:15.860> I

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
and everything but for some reason I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.070 
and everything but for some reason I
didn't<00:01:16.190> like<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:16.490> very<00:01:17.030> much<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.510> very<00:01:17.750> big

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
didn't like this very much it's very big

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.080 
didn't like this very much it's very big
but<00:01:18.380> one<00:01:19.010> thing<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.580> really<00:01:20.320> really<00:01:21.970> kind<00:01:22.970> of

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
but one thing that really really kind of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.450 
but one thing that really really kind of
made<00:01:24.050> me<00:01:24.200> not<00:01:24.560> like<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:24.860> controller<00:01:25.280> was

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
made me not like this controller was

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.420 
made me not like this controller was
because<00:01:25.790> if<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.180> look<00:01:26.620> me<00:01:27.620> naturally<00:01:28.100> old<00:01:28.280> and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430

pretty<00:02:08.840> good<00:02:09.110> compared<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.679> like<00:02:09.879> the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.109 
pretty good compared to like the

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.059 
pretty good compared to like the
original<00:02:12.109> ones<00:02:12.290> they<00:02:12.560> still<00:02:12.829> feel<00:02:12.980> cheap

original ones they still feel cheap

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.270 
original ones they still feel cheap
but<00:02:14.879> not<00:02:15.150> as<00:02:15.390> chief<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.989> there<00:02:16.590> seem<00:02:16.799> durable

but not as chief and there seem durable
enough<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:18.599> one<00:02:18.840> bad<00:02:19.049> thing<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.590> d-pad

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
enough the one bad thing is the d-pad

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.949 
enough the one bad thing is the d-pad
very<00:02:20.879> clicky<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:26.150> compared<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.450> original

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
very clicky and compared to the original

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.250 
very clicky and compared to the original
one<00:02:28.549> which<00:02:29.549> is<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.969> you<00:02:30.569> know<00:02:30.689> very<00:02:31.049> nice

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
one which is just you know very nice

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
one which is just you know very nice
feeling<00:02:31.769> but<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.519> really<00:02:32.760> liked<00:02:33.000> about<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.299> be<00:02:33.389> a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
feeling but I really liked about to be a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.149 
feeling but I really liked about to be a
signature<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.870> love<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.379> d-pad<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:35.519> one<00:02:36.530> yeah

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.319 

so<00:02:41.159> yeah<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> size<00:02:41.609> different<00:02:42.060> stuff<00:02:42.239> he

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
so yeah the size different stuff he

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.259 
so yeah the size different stuff he
makes<00:02:42.560> definitely<00:02:43.669> changes<00:02:44.669> the<00:02:44.700> controller

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
makes definitely changes the controller

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.709 
makes definitely changes the controller
up<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.569> lot<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:47.099> if<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.969> the<00:02:48.329> Xbox

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
up a lot and if you like the Xbox

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.449 
up a lot and if you like the Xbox
controller<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.200> lot<00:02:49.439> and<00:02:49.680> you're<00:02:49.769> very<00:02:50.010> used<00:02:50.340> to

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
controller a lot and you're very used to

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.670 
controller a lot and you're very used to
it<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.180> might<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:51.989> but<00:02:52.349> like<00:02:52.469> I<00:02:52.620> said

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
it you might like this but like I said

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.110 
it you might like this but like I said
before<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.129> problem<00:02:53.669> with<00:02:53.819> your<00:02:53.939> hands

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
before that problem with your hands

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.159 
before that problem with your hands
naturally<00:02:54.629> they've<00:02:54.750> gone<00:02:54.840> through<00:02:54.900> these

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
naturally they've gone through these

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.429 
naturally they've gone through these
buttons<00:02:55.409> so<00:02:55.769> that's<00:02:56.400> why<00:02:56.699> it's<00:02:57.599> good<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:57.870> Xbox

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
buttons so that's why it's good for Xbox

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.110 
buttons so that's why it's good for Xbox
like<00:02:58.709> if<00:02:58.829> this<00:02:58.949> controllers<00:02:59.400> for<00:02:59.519> Xbox<00:02:59.969> it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
like if this controllers for Xbox it

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.929 
like if this controllers for Xbox it
would<00:03:00.209> be<00:03:00.299> fine<00:03:00.650> because<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:02.370> actually<00:03:02.609> want

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
would be fine because you actually want

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.409 
would be fine because you actually want
to<00:03:02.969> go<00:03:03.090> for<00:03:03.269> these<00:03:03.389> but<00:03:04.139> for<00:03:04.500> ps3<00:03:05.269> going<00:03:06.269> for

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
to go for these but for ps3 going for

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.399 
to go for these but for ps3 going for
these<00:03:06.510> isn't<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.930> great<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.199> an<00:03:07.290> idea

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
these isn't that great of an idea

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.759 
these isn't that great of an idea
because<00:03:07.889> you<00:03:08.129> need<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.459> shoot<00:03:08.639> this<00:03:09.769> to

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
because you need to shoot this to

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.649 
because you need to shoot this to
connect<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.159> controller<00:03:11.489> I'm<00:03:12.269> not<00:03:12.449> sure

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
connect the controller I'm not sure

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.479 
connect the controller I'm not sure
about<00:03:12.780> other<00:03:13.019> third-party<00:03:13.530> brands<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:14.250> this

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
about other third-party brands but this

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.839 
about other third-party brands but this
uses<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.419> same<00:03:15.599> technology<00:03:16.139> that<00:03:16.169> the

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
uses like the same technology that the

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.520 
uses like the same technology that the
ps3<00:03:17.849> controller<00:03:17.879> use<00:03:18.389> uses<00:03:19.259> which<00:03:19.500> is

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
ps3 controller use uses which is

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.920 
ps3 controller use uses which is

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
is uh they call this a slow speed but I

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.590 
is uh they call this a slow speed but I
consider<00:04:27.000> it

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
consider it

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.500

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
what really bothers me it's that since

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.490 
what really bothers me it's that since
this<00:05:31.920> is<00:05:32.070> my<00:05:32.190> bulkier<00:05:32.760> they're<00:05:33.540> very<00:05:33.870> they're

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
this is my bulkier they're very they're

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.610 
this is my bulkier they're very they're
very<00:05:34.530> high<00:05:35.160> up<00:05:35.460> compared<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.380> ps3<00:05:37.380> the

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
very high up compared to the ps3 the

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.890 
very high up compared to the ps3 the
original<00:05:38.010> ps3<00:05:38.400> ones<00:05:38.580> so<00:05:38.790> instead<00:05:39.510> of<00:05:39.570> playing

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
original ps3 ones so instead of playing

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.800 
original ps3 ones so instead of playing
like<00:05:40.280> down<00:05:41.280> here<00:05:41.310> I<00:05:41.910> have<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.420> move<00:05:42.570> my<00:05:42.750> fingers

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
like down here I have to move my fingers

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.010 
like down here I have to move my fingers
up<00:05:43.290> which<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:44.430> know<00:05:44.550> it's<00:05:45.240> fine<00:05:45.600> if<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:45.840> get

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
up which you know it's fine if you get

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.930 
up which you know it's fine if you get
used<00:05:46.230> to<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.530> but<00:05:46.650> for<00:05:46.710> when<00:05:47.640> you're<00:05:47.790> first

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
used to it but for when you're first

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.060 
used to it but for when you're first
getting<00:05:48.090> into<00:05:48.570> it<00:05:48.720> doesn't<00:05:49.620> feel<00:05:49.710> that<00:05:49.890> great

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
getting into it doesn't feel that great

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.560 
getting into it doesn't feel that great
and<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.580> probably<00:05:50.790> takes<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.210> little<00:05:51.330> bit<00:05:51.510> to

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
and it probably takes a little bit to

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.040 
and it probably takes a little bit to
get<00:05:51.690> used<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:53.600> it<00:05:54.600> kind<00:05:54.810> of<00:05:54.840> makes<00:05:55.020> you

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
get used to and it kind of makes you

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.120 
get used to and it kind of makes you
feel<00:05:55.140> like<00:05:55.320> you're<00:05:55.530> playing<00:05:55.710> on<00:05:55.890> a<00:05:55.920> higher

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
feel like you're playing on a higher

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.800 
feel like you're playing on a higher
sensitivity<00:05:56.520> when<00:05:57.000> you<00:05:57.090> when<00:05:57.330> you<00:05:57.420> play<00:05:57.630> like

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
sensitivity when you when you play like

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.810 
sensitivity when you when you play like
this<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:58.200> don't<00:05:58.290> know<00:05:58.410> why<00:05:58.560> that's<00:05:59.400> just<00:05:59.550> when<00:05:59.760> I

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
this I don't know why that's just when I

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.570 
this I don't know why that's just when I
got<00:06:00.060> out<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.240> it<00:06:00.860> yeah<00:06:01.860> everything<00:06:02.100> works<00:06:02.490> fine

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
got out of it yeah everything works fine

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.030 
got out of it yeah everything works fine

went<00:06:52.190> and<00:06:52.400> got<00:06:52.490> this<00:06:52.730> because<00:06:52.940> it<00:06:53.030> was<00:06:53.120> cheaper

not for the turbo mod ooh though that is
