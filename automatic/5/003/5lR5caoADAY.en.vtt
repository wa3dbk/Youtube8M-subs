00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:11.349
 hello to continue I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.160
 something that would be modeled a bit 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.559
 more advanced 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.850
 what we are going to do is use some 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.850
 of the tools that we already know 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.320
 let's make a representation of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.600
 this car of this car 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.000
 in a very fast way a little bit 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.059
 fat but it is for you to have 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.370
 an idea of how they could do things 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.070
 I'm going to be a little bit quick but 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.980
 if you wanted, you could do it with 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.000
 all the detail they need 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.830
 and what we are going to do is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.830
 trace this drawing 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.239
 now I can erase 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.830
 something important is that all the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.210
 goods that we made for the outline be 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.210
 one line 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.460
 let's try to tell it 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.960
 and good 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.000
 let's review 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.000
 what measures does it have to be a line 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.390
 good is the term 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.290
 with this in fact we review again the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.290
 distance 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.790
 I am to be or not of this 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.960
 Now I'm going to make a line in the middle 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.010
 being here 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.350
 just like I said in the other 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.350
 I'm going to make a line 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.830
 and we are going to move 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.310
 I hope you are giving them level in what 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.310
 What do you see 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.340
 what would happen if we excluded this be here 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.340
 towards here and this to the sides 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.969
 but we have the taste 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.920
 the height then approximately should 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.410
 of being the same does not coincide because it does not 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.090
 We did it completely in detail 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.090
 but approximately it would be the same 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.510
 what are we going to do now is 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:06.190
 they were 60 92 52 we're going to leave it as if 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.320
 they were 6 and 25 entity version and it 's here 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.830
 we know that it is 2.5 then 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.240
 we can give 1.25 soldier 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.240
 with the command 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.160
 let's do the same 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.690
 two 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.110
 I'm going to go in the bottom 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.440
 now we know that throughout it has 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.720
 total 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.720
 6 then it will be 3 towards here 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.660
 again selecting 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.150
 let's review now if with this with the 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.500
 tool one of the last 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.920
 tools that we were reviewing that 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.470
 was the interference we selected me 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.160
 I'm going to switch to wire view to 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:41.430
 be able to select good interference 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:46.310
 this and this first set enter with 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.310
 this and this second set 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.160
 we do not check 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.440
 by default remember that interference 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.990
 gives us the option to delete the 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.820
 objects that we have in our case not 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.100
 we want to do that then we had 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.350
 delete and we give in zeros 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.380
 we go back to x-rays and it looks like 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.780
 nothing happened but we can erase 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.950
 this part of here 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.950
 this game 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.420
 and this is 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.190
 that looks more like 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.110
 what we wanted to obtain if we 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.800
 we change with the conceptual airplane 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.800
 for example 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.719
 we change him 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.610
 red that gives us by default the view 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.569
 let's see it in another realistic view by 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.569
 example 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.780
 check that the imperfections that we 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.780
 gave 2 were 4 totally 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.900
 It was made up of two parts and 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.400
 intersect two others good rather 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.100
 It consisted of two parts that are 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.110
 intersect then obviously if we do not 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.080
 generate these four parts if we had 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.630
 done first the front part the 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.030
 we exclude the back the ends 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.760
 and the sides 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.670
 obviously we generate in more detail 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.530
 this figure 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:26.520
 we could already do it for people 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:29.850
 separately we could make the axis of the 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.680
 join tires etc then I hope that 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.390
 this is very useful to be able to 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.000
 do 

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.000
 still more complex models 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.800
 and we continue this part of here what 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.120
 The only thing I can do is join it to 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.120
 have a complete sound 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.290
 that are not so many anymore
