00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
so if they keep it pretty simple for us

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.790 
so if they keep it pretty simple for us
guys<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:54.280> it's<00:00:54.460> pink<00:00:54.969> and<00:00:55.359> blue<00:00:56.079> cables<00:00:56.589> now

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
guys so it's pink and blue cables now

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.680 
guys so it's pink and blue cables now
what<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.129> all<00:00:57.309> would<00:00:57.429> need<00:00:57.609> to<00:00:57.789> without

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
what you all would need to without

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.419 
what you all would need to without
really<00:00:58.870> taking<00:00:59.109> it<00:00:59.350> off<00:00:59.499> it's<00:00:59.739> not<00:00:59.949> evident

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
really taking it off it's not evident

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.660 
really taking it off it's not evident
design<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.510> way<00:01:01.600> plastic<00:01:02.050> tied<00:01:02.670> then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
design and the way plastic tied then

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.450 
design and the way plastic tied then
will<00:01:04.120> grow<00:01:05.019> all<00:01:05.350> these<00:01:05.530> wires<00:01:05.830> together<00:01:06.130> for

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
will grow all these wires together for

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.710 
will grow all these wires together for
good<00:01:06.550> reason<00:01:06.940> because<00:01:07.000> they<00:01:07.180> need<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.360> be<00:01:07.570> more

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
good reason because they need to be more

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.100 
good reason because they need to be more
connected<00:01:07.960> together<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.980> get<00:01:09.070> facing<00:01:09.610> back<00:01:09.790> on

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
connected together to get facing back on

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.960 
connected together to get facing back on
this<00:01:11.110> keeps<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.530> nice<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:11.890> tidy<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:12.820> we're

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
this keeps it nice and tidy so we're

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.000 
this keeps it nice and tidy so we're
going<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.180> do<00:01:13.300> is<00:01:13.570> remove<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:14.560> spendable

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
going to do is remove and you spendable

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.340 
going to do is remove and you spendable
where<00:01:15.130> they<00:01:15.250> go<00:01:15.400> and<00:01:15.670> blue<00:01:16.000> wire<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:17.290> goes

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
where they go and blue wire that goes

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.980 
where they go and blue wire that goes
let's<00:01:18.280> feel<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:18.640> towards<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.450> or<00:01:19.780> further

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
let's feel it towards you or further

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.770 
let's feel it towards you or further
away<00:01:20.170> from<00:01:20.290> me<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.980> pink<00:01:21.250> wire<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:22.570> is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
away from me and the pink wire that is

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.270 
away from me and the pink wire that is
the<00:01:22.930> one<00:01:23.080> closest<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:23.710> me<00:01:24.070> okay<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:25.390> just<00:01:25.720> mine

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the one closest to me okay so just mine

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.970 
the one closest to me okay so just mine
yes<00:01:27.280> we've<00:01:27.460> got<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.610> blue<00:01:27.790> one<00:01:27.820> coming<00:01:28.300> up<00:01:28.980> it's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
yes we've got a blue one coming up it's

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.710 
yes we've got a blue one coming up it's
one<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:32.110> then<00:01:32.980> the<00:01:33.130> pink<00:01:33.340> one<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:34.270> that's<00:01:34.480> two

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
one and then the pink one and that's two

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.840 
one and then the pink one and that's two
because<00:01:35.470> we've<00:01:35.650> done<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:35.980> before<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.580> wires

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
because we've done this before the wires

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.750 
because we've done this before the wires
you<00:01:37.480> know<00:01:37.600> they're<00:01:37.930> just<00:01:38.290> really<00:01:38.530> yeah<00:01:39.160> I<00:01:39.580> can

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
you know they're just really yeah I can

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.070 
you know they're just really yeah I can
take<00:01:39.970> them<00:01:40.090> straight<00:01:40.270> off<00:01:40.360> normally<00:01:40.900> they

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
take them straight off normally they

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.220 
take them straight off normally they
actually<00:01:41.440> touch<00:01:41.740> in<00:01:42.400> an<00:01:42.640> under<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:44.020> might

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
actually touch in an under and you might

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.470 
actually touch in an under and you might
find<00:01:44.500> cut<00:01:44.770> otherwise<00:01:45.190> sort<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.700> impeding<00:01:46.240> your

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
find cut otherwise sort of impeding your

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.330 
find cut otherwise sort of impeding your
ability<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.050> get<00:01:47.260> them<00:01:47.410> out<00:01:47.530> easily<00:01:47.740> but<00:01:48.160> just

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
ability to get them out easily but just

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.370 
ability to get them out easily but just
be<00:01:48.490> patient<00:01:48.700> they're<00:01:49.120> not<00:01:49.380> intertwined

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
be patient they're not intertwined

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.780 
be patient they're not intertwined
normally<00:01:50.680> or<00:01:50.770> anything<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.310> shouldn't<00:01:51.610> have

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
normally or anything so shouldn't have

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.580 
normally or anything so shouldn't have
to<00:01:51.940> be<00:01:52.150> cutting<00:01:52.420> wires<00:01:52.780> or<00:01:53.050> do<00:01:53.140> anything<00:01:53.350> else

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
to be cutting wires or do anything else

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.230 
to be cutting wires or do anything else
for<00:01:53.650> them<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:54.430> should<00:01:54.760> just<00:01:54.910> pop<00:01:55.090> out

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
for them so that should just pop out

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.790 
for them so that should just pop out
nicely<00:01:55.540> like<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:58.560> come<00:01:59.560> to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
nicely like that and then come to

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.820 
nicely like that and then come to
replacement<00:02:03.450> okay<00:02:04.450> as<00:02:04.720> far<00:02:04.990> as<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.260> see<00:02:05.650> it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
replacement okay as far as I can see it

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.590 
replacement okay as far as I can see it
doesn't<00:02:06.250> really<00:02:06.370> matter<00:02:06.610> which<00:02:06.880> way<00:02:07.120> it<00:02:07.420> goes

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
doesn't really matter which way it goes

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.040 
doesn't really matter which way it goes
around

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
around

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.710 
around
but<00:02:09.320> we<00:02:09.410> think<00:02:09.590> quite<00:02:09.740> closest<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.210> just

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
but we think quite closest to it I just

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.020 
but we think quite closest to it I just
goes<00:02:11.930> into<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.260> shorter<00:02:12.770> squat<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.460> tend<00:02:13.850> to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
goes into a shorter squat and tend to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
goes into a shorter squat and tend to
tends<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.960> have<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.680> have<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.070> furthest<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.900> go

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
tends to have to have the furthest to go

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.380 
tends to have to have the furthest to go
around<00:02:18.500> yeah<00:02:19.070> where<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.670> your<00:02:19.850> father's

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
around yeah where is your father's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.160 
around yeah where is your father's
little<00:02:20.570> bit<00:02:21.050> longer<00:02:21.230> across<00:02:21.620> there<00:02:22.600> okay<00:02:23.600> so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
little bit longer across there okay so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.890 
little bit longer across there okay so
blue<00:02:27.170> white<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.770> like<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:30.290> then<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.770> pink

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
blue white and like so and then the pink

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.700 
blue white and like so and then the pink
that<00:02:32.900> goes<00:02:33.170> like<00:02:33.200> that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
that goes like that

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:52.110 
that goes like that
nice<00:02:34.310> Liam<00:02:34.700> toughest<00:02:35.690> crease<00:02:36.050> then<00:02:38.380> back<00:02:39.380> in

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.280 

it's<00:02:53.120> been<00:02:53.240> have<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.480> nice<00:02:53.660> bit<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:53.960> surface

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
it's been have a nice bit of surface

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.800 
it's been have a nice bit of surface
with<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.800> because<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.240> can<00:02:56.390> apply<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.570> little

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
with it because you can apply a little

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.600 
with it because you can apply a little
bit<00:02:56.960> of<00:02:57.110> pressure<00:02:57.470> into<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.860> screws<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.520> that

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
bit of pressure into the screws and that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.420 
bit of pressure into the screws and that
just<00:02:58.850> really<00:02:58.970> cuts<00:02:59.930> down<00:03:00.050> there<00:03:00.740> chanceless

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
just really cuts down there chanceless

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.790 
just really cuts down there chanceless
bearing<00:03:01.940> them<00:03:02.090> yeah<00:03:02.990> also<00:03:03.500> when<00:03:03.650> you're

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
bearing them yeah also when you're

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.080 
bearing them yeah also when you're
practicing<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.340> maybe<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.640> should<00:03:04.820> taking

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
practicing this maybe I should taking

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.630 
practicing this maybe I should taking
them<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.270> around<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.570> few<00:03:05.720> times<00:03:05.980> maybe<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.460> is

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
them in around a few times maybe this is

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.210 
them in around a few times maybe this is
a<00:03:07.670> one-off<00:03:08.560> maintenance<00:03:09.560> trip<00:03:09.800> for<00:03:10.100> your

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
a one-off maintenance trip for your

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.190 
a one-off maintenance trip for your
career

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.630 

great<00:03:15.200> coffee<00:03:15.560> once<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.190> fixed<00:03:17.770> okay<00:03:18.770> so

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
great coffee once it's fixed okay so

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.280 
great coffee once it's fixed okay so
that's<00:03:19.910> all<00:03:20.090> securing<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.720> what<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.020> need<00:03:21.140> to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
that's all securing it what you need to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.110 
that's all securing it what you need to
do<00:03:21.470> now<00:03:21.800> let's<00:03:22.100> just<00:03:22.250> get<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.520> black<00:03:22.760> casing

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
do now let's just get the black casing

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.560 
do now let's just get the black casing
back<00:03:23.600> on<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.350> it's<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.430> little<00:03:25.700> tricky<00:03:26.090> that

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
back on and it's a little tricky that

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.760 
back on and it's a little tricky that
goes<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:26.870> why<00:03:27.050> is<00:03:27.110> they<00:03:27.380> just<00:03:27.440> gonna<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.740> a

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
goes so why is they just gonna be a

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.440 
goes so why is they just gonna be a
little<00:03:27.860> bit<00:03:28.070> careful<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:28.520> them<00:03:28.670> make<00:03:29.420> sure

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
little bit careful with them make sure

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.080 
little bit careful with them make sure
that<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.780> get<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.959> little<00:03:30.080> pinched<00:03:30.560> but<00:03:31.370> this

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
that I get a little pinched but this

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.030 
that I get a little pinched but this
you'll<00:03:32.690> notice<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.550> little<00:03:35.920> entrances<00:03:36.920> and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
you'll notice the little entrances and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.120 
you'll notice the little entrances and
things<00:03:37.220> otherwise<00:03:37.550> they're<00:03:38.000> going<00:03:38.180> through

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
things otherwise they're going through

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.590 
things otherwise they're going through
I'm<00:03:40.130> gonna<00:03:40.250> kick<00:03:40.580> with<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.150> it's<00:03:41.240> really

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
I'm gonna kick with it and it's really

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.070 
I'm gonna kick with it and it's really
tricky<00:03:42.080> let's<00:03:42.980> make<00:03:43.160> sure<00:03:43.190> okay<00:03:43.940> they<00:03:44.540> all<00:03:44.570> get

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
tricky let's make sure okay they all get

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.520 
tricky let's make sure okay they all get
sort<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.709> Clinton<00:03:46.310> New<00:03:46.490> York<00:03:47.140> if<00:03:48.140> it's<00:03:48.350> not

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
sort of Clinton New York if it's not

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.520 
sort of Clinton New York if it's not
sitting<00:03:48.950> down<00:03:49.100> nicely<00:03:50.110> you<00:03:51.110> know<00:03:51.140> you're

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
sitting down nicely you know you're

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.530 
sitting down nicely you know you're
pinching<00:03:51.950> wires<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.610> things<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.420> you

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
pinching wires and things so just you

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.170 
pinching wires and things so just you
know<00:03:53.660> be<00:03:53.870> gentle<00:03:54.350> with<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.610> yeah<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.940> might

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
know be gentle with that yeah it might

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.820 
know be gentle with that yeah it might
need<00:03:56.330> a<00:03:56.390> few<00:03:56.660> attempts<00:03:57.080> we've<00:03:57.230> had<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.410> few<00:03:57.650> guys

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
need a few attempts we've had a few guys

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.010 
need a few attempts we've had a few guys
with<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.459> has<00:03:58.520> gone<00:03:58.850> pretty<00:03:59.030> well<00:03:59.180> so

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
with that so it has gone pretty well so

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.720 
with that so it has gone pretty well so
this<00:04:00.140> should<00:04:00.380> just<00:04:00.410> sit<00:04:00.709> them<00:04:00.890> nicely<00:04:01.190> like

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
this should just sit them nicely like

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.730 
this should just sit them nicely like
that<00:04:02.000> we<00:04:02.240> don't<00:04:02.450> want<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.660> wash<00:04:02.959> them<00:04:03.170> water

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
that we don't want to wash them water

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.100 
that we don't want to wash them water
getting<00:04:03.980> in<00:04:04.190> there<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:05.480> let's<00:04:05.660> put<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.959> little

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
getting in there so let's put the little

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.540 
getting in there so let's put the little
screws<00:04:06.470> back<00:04:06.650> in<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> first<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:09.500> when<00:04:10.459> you

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
screws back in the first and when you

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.460 
screws back in the first and when you
know<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.760> do<00:04:10.940> have<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.239> right<00:04:11.390> -<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.230> it

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
know you do have it right - is that it

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.240 
know you do have it right - is that it
should<00:04:13.010> this<00:04:13.640> one<00:04:13.820> doesn't<00:04:14.030> quite

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
should this one doesn't quite

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.759 
should this one doesn't quite
that's<00:04:15.370> better<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.480> should<00:04:16.810> then<00:04:16.989> sit<00:04:17.380> flush

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
that's better it should then sit flush

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.250 
that's better it should then sit flush
so<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.850> particular<00:04:19.239> believer<00:04:19.630> arm<00:04:19.959> and

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
so that the particular believer arm and

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.800 
so that the particular believer arm and
a<00:04:20.320> plastic<00:04:20.560> arm<00:04:20.950> will<00:04:21.609> sit<00:04:21.880> across<00:04:22.090> ignition

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
a plastic arm will sit across ignition

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.960 
a plastic arm will sit across ignition
could<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:22.990> screw<00:04:23.320> into<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:23.860> but<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.640> tend<00:04:24.940> to

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
could a screw into that but I tend to

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.790 
could a screw into that but I tend to
find<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.420> works<00:04:25.630> best<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:26.110> put<00:04:26.380> these<00:04:26.530> ones

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
find that works best is put these ones

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.290 
find that works best is put these ones
in<00:04:27.040> just<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:27.430> case<00:04:27.610> you've<00:04:27.760> got<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:27.910> feeling

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
in just in case you've got a feeling

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.920 
in just in case you've got a feeling
angles<00:04:28.570> out

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
angles out

a lot better prick them anyone's gotta
sit<00:05:49.780> in<00:05:49.900> there<00:05:50.140> and<00:05:50.380> get<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.680> screwdriver

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.929 

they're<00:05:55.180> better<00:05:55.360> person

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.179 

again<00:05:59.939> cutting<00:06:00.539> into<00:06:00.779> it<00:06:01.110> so<00:06:01.349> just<00:06:01.829> you<00:06:02.069> know

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
again cutting into it so just you know

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.259 
again cutting into it so just you know
just<00:06:02.459> place<00:06:04.759> that's<00:06:05.759> it

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:06.269 
just place that's it

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:08.629 
just place that's it
see<00:06:06.689> how<00:06:06.779> mine<00:06:07.019> -<00:06:07.379> it's<00:06:07.619> like<00:06:08.069> a<00:06:08.219> little<00:06:08.369> bit<00:06:08.549> of

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
see how mine - it's like a little bit of

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.149 
see how mine - it's like a little bit of
cracking<00:06:09.149> and<00:06:09.269> then<00:06:09.360> that's<00:06:09.569> produce<00:06:09.929> from

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:10.159 
cracking and then that's produce from

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.859 
cracking and then that's produce from
practice<00:06:11.159> so<00:06:11.369> be<00:06:11.939> careful<00:06:12.299> not<00:06:12.389> doing<00:06:12.629> that<00:06:12.719> up

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:12.869 
practice so be careful not doing that up

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:14.179 
practice so be careful not doing that up
too<00:06:13.110> tightly<00:06:13.409> it's<00:06:13.679> probably<00:06:13.979> a<00:06:14.039> good

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:14.189 
too tightly it's probably a good

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:19.669 
too tightly it's probably a good
Australian<00:06:14.759> gangster<00:06:15.379> and<00:06:17.360> bug<00:06:18.559> now<00:06:19.559> I'm

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:19.679 
Australian gangster and bug now I'm

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.289 
Australian gangster and bug now I'm
going<00:06:19.919> to<00:06:19.979> reconnect<00:06:20.369> it<00:06:20.519> all<00:06:20.639> back<00:06:20.849> up<00:06:21.059> and

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:21.299 
going to reconnect it all back up and

00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:22.549 
going to reconnect it all back up and
realize<00:06:21.569> that<00:06:21.599> everything's<00:06:22.139> so<00:06:22.259> not<00:06:22.409> going

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:22.559 
realize that everything's so not going

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:24.889 
realize that everything's so not going
to<00:06:22.649> do<00:06:22.739> that<00:06:22.889> now<00:06:23.099> but<00:06:23.759> that's<00:06:24.029> how<00:06:24.360> you<00:06:24.389> do<00:06:24.869> the

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:24.899 
to do that now but that's how you do the

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:27.259 
to do that now but that's how you do the
transformer<00:06:25.679> unit<00:06:25.979> it's<00:06:26.669> pretty<00:06:26.999> straight

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:27.269 
transformer unit it's pretty straight

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:28.999 
transformer unit it's pretty straight
for<00:06:27.569> one<00:06:27.749> of<00:06:27.839> that<00:06:27.959> time<00:06:28.199> not<00:06:28.529> even<00:06:28.589> ten

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
for one of that time not even ten

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.249 
for one of that time not even ten
minutes<00:06:29.039> and<00:06:31.249> hopefully<00:06:32.249> then<00:06:32.459> you're<00:06:33.049> we<00:06:34.049> did

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
minutes and hopefully then you're we did

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.429 
minutes and hopefully then you're we did
this<00:06:34.610> with<00:06:35.610> replacement<00:06:36.089> and<00:06:36.539> turned<00:06:37.289> it<00:06:37.379> on

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:37.439 
this with replacement and turned it on

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.249 
this with replacement and turned it on
first<00:06:37.739> time<00:06:37.979> presto<00:06:38.939> went<00:06:39.269> well<00:06:39.509> be<00:06:39.959> really

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
first time presto went well be really

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.989 
first time presto went well be really
careful<00:06:40.439> though<00:06:40.769> we<00:06:40.919> try<00:06:41.159> to<00:06:41.219> walk<00:06:41.399> without<00:06:41.759> or

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:41.999 
careful though we try to walk without or

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.729 
careful though we try to walk without or
the<00:06:42.149> case<00:06:42.389> anything<00:06:42.899> probably<00:06:43.169> not<00:06:43.409> really

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:43.739 
the case anything probably not really

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:45.350 
the case anything probably not really
recommended<00:06:44.399> but<00:06:44.610> we<00:06:44.699> thought<00:06:44.849> well<00:06:45.059> if<00:06:45.179> it's

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
recommended but we thought well if it's

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.269 
recommended but we thought well if it's
not<00:06:45.509> transforming<00:06:46.229> you<00:06:46.319> know<00:06:46.439> don't<00:06:47.069> want<00:06:47.189> to

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:47.279 
not transforming you know don't want to

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.829 
not transforming you know don't want to
them<00:06:47.399> take<00:06:47.579> over<00:06:47.729> casing<00:06:48.239> back<00:06:48.419> up<00:06:48.569> again<00:06:48.809> so

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:48.839 
them take over casing back up again so

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.589 
them take over casing back up again so
dude<00:06:49.199> be<00:06:49.319> careful<00:06:49.529> with<00:06:49.829> that<00:06:50.360> if<00:06:51.360> you've<00:06:51.479> got

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 
dude be careful with that if you've got
