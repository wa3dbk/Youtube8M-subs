00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.859 
as you can see the back design I'm
actually<00:01:47.490> quite<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> lot<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
actually quite a lot I like a lot and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
actually quite a lot I like a lot and
the<00:01:49.470> red<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:49.950> slit<00:01:50.369> without<00:01:50.610> them

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the red one I think slit without them

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
the red one I think slit without them
blue<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.439> probably<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
blue one and I would probably have to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.289 
blue one and I would probably have to
review<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> blue<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.670> next<00:01:53.880> week<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.119> then

deck<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.470> believe<00:02:38.470> there's<00:02:39.220> not<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.239> much

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
deck I and believe there's not that much

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.979 
deck I and believe there's not that much
you<00:02:40.959> can't<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.770> really<00:02:42.190> it's<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.910> very

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
you can't do this really it's a very

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.220 
you can't do this really it's a very
very<00:02:43.989> nice<00:02:44.350> deck<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.130> mean<00:02:45.400> extremely<00:02:46.300> but

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
very nice deck and I mean extremely but

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.330 
very nice deck and I mean extremely but
you're<00:02:47.380> not<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.830> probably<00:02:48.040> get<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
you're not going to probably get a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.449 
you're not going to probably get a
better<00:02:48.550> deck<00:02:48.910> then<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:50.459> anymore

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
better deck then and this anymore

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.540 
better deck then and this anymore
