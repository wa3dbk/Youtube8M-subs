00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
really hard to win first down on

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.789 
really hard to win first down on
synthetic<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.049> thought<00:01:32.200> he<00:01:32.350> might<00:01:32.380> need<00:01:32.649> an

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
synthetic and I thought he might need an

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.599 
synthetic and I thought he might need an
out<00:01:32.950> but<00:01:33.420> he<00:01:34.420> broke<00:01:34.659> well<00:01:34.929> he<00:01:35.469> was<00:01:36.189> sitting<00:01:36.549> off

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
out but he broke well he was sitting off

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.969 
out but he broke well he was sitting off
the<00:01:36.759> pace<00:01:36.999> he<00:01:37.270> came<00:01:37.479> up<00:01:37.719> he<00:01:38.259> engaged<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.740> horse

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
the pace he came up he engaged a horse

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.059 
the pace he came up he engaged a horse
that<00:01:39.579> had<00:01:39.700> already<00:01:39.850> run<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.899> nice<00:01:41.380> horse<00:01:41.709> and<00:01:42.009> I

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
that had already run a nice horse and I

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.020 
that had already run a nice horse and I
thought<00:01:42.219> well<00:01:42.369> he's<00:01:42.490> gonna<00:01:42.579> get<00:01:42.759> tired

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
thought well he's gonna get tired

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.760 
thought well he's gonna get tired
probably<00:01:43.479> run<00:01:43.630> second<00:01:44.049> if<00:01:44.350> they<00:01:44.439> have<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.590> good

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
probably run second if they have a good

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.309 
probably run second if they have a good
out<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.639> all<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:45.939> a<00:01:45.999> sudden<00:01:46.060> when<00:01:46.389> he<00:01:46.450> went<00:01:46.630> I

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
out and all of a sudden when he went I

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.590 
out and all of a sudden when he went I

I've had some really good him but none

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.650 
I've had some really good him but none
which<00:05:12.400> had<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.700> pedigree<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.150> this<00:05:13.450> horse
