00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
country braids out there these days can

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.500 
country braids out there these days can
often<00:00:10.100> get<00:00:10.190> a<00:00:10.250> bit<00:00:10.400> confusing<00:00:10.850> as<00:00:11.150> to<00:00:11.300> what's

what so we're gonna take a look at
Christ<00:00:13.700> in<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.420> original<00:00:14.990> company<00:00:15.320> to

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
Christ in the original company to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.560 
Christ in the original company to
produce<00:00:15.680> coated<00:00:16.250> braids<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.119> let's<00:00:17.300> have<00:00:17.510> a

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
produce coated braids so let's have a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.870 
produce coated braids so let's have a
little<00:00:17.720> look<00:00:17.930> at<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.110> history<00:00:18.470> of<00:00:18.500> them<00:00:18.880> the

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
little look at the history of them the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.880 
little look at the history of them the
first<00:00:20.090> one<00:00:20.270> they<00:00:20.390> produced<00:00:20.720> was<00:00:20.990> snakeskin

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
first one they produced was snakeskin

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.200 
first one they produced was snakeskin
and<00:00:22.130> it<00:00:22.400> was<00:00:22.489> a<00:00:22.550> completely<00:00:23.060> revolutionary

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
and it was a completely revolutionary

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.269 
and it was a completely revolutionary
product<00:00:23.960> at<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.200> time<00:00:24.230> in<00:00:24.650> fact<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.070> there

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
product at the time in fact it's there

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.830 
product at the time in fact it's there
is<00:00:25.400> because<00:00:25.790> there's<00:00:26.270> no<00:00:26.360> one<00:00:26.570> else<00:00:26.750> that

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
is because there's no one else that

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.630 
is because there's no one else that
produces<00:00:27.230> anything<00:00:27.560> like<00:00:27.710> it<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:28.520> is

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
produces anything like it and that is

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.479 
produces anything like it and that is
basically<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:29.180> coated<00:00:29.840> multi<00:00:30.380> strand<00:00:30.710> multi

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
basically a coated multi strand multi

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.030 
basically a coated multi strand multi
strand<00:00:31.759> is<00:00:31.970> as<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:32.480> says<00:00:32.660> on<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:32.899> tin<00:00:33.079> lots<00:00:33.890> of

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
strand is as it says on the tin lots of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.690 
strand is as it says on the tin lots of
different<00:00:34.570> strands<00:00:35.570> of<00:00:36.050> very<00:00:36.290> fine<00:00:36.559> fibers<00:00:37.130> it

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
different strands of very fine fibers it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.580 
different strands of very fine fibers it
was<00:00:37.880> something<00:00:38.240> that<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.750> lot<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:39.140> anglers<00:00:39.350> used

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
was something that a lot of anglers used

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.830 
was something that a lot of anglers used
to<00:00:39.710> use<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.130> past<00:00:40.310> but<00:00:41.300> before<00:00:41.630> the

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
to use in the past but before the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.240 
to use in the past but before the
coatings<00:00:42.200> came<00:00:42.380> about<00:00:42.560> so<00:00:42.770> they'd<00:00:42.920> make<00:00:43.070> up

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
coatings came about so they'd make up

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.590 
coatings came about so they'd make up
their<00:00:43.430> own<00:00:43.460> sort<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:43.910> multi<00:00:44.180> strand<00:00:44.450> hook

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
their own sort of multi strand hook

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.340 
their own sort of multi strand hook
minks<00:00:45.020> various<00:00:45.800> different<00:00:46.220> fine<00:00:46.730> manos<00:00:47.350> the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
minks various different fine manos the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.200 
minks various different fine manos the
trouble<00:00:48.650> of<00:00:48.710> them<00:00:48.830> is<00:00:48.980> attended<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.790> tangle

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
trouble of them is attended the tangle

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.180 
trouble of them is attended the tangle
like<00:00:50.390> mad<00:00:50.630> so<00:00:50.660> this<00:00:51.410> completely<00:00:51.800> got<00:00:52.010> over

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
like mad so this completely got over

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.250 
like mad so this completely got over
that<00:00:52.310> problem<00:00:52.550> what<00:00:53.480> you<00:00:53.570> find<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:53.930> that<00:00:53.960> these

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
that problem what you find is that these

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.980 
that problem what you find is that these
fibers<00:00:54.850> separate<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.150> because<00:00:56.630> they're<00:00:56.810> so

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
fibers separate and because they're so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.350 
fibers separate and because they're so
thin<00:00:57.260> they<00:00:58.040> just<00:00:58.280> pretty<00:00:58.460> much<00:00:58.640> disappear<00:00:59.180> and

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
thin they just pretty much disappear and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.670 
thin they just pretty much disappear and
the<00:00:59.660> other<00:00:59.750> thing<00:00:59.960> is<00:01:00.110> because<00:01:00.350> they're<00:01:00.530> so

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
the other thing is because they're so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.330 
the other thing is because they're so
soft

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
soft

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.149 
soft
you<00:01:01.850> can<00:01:01.970> hardly<00:01:02.180> feel<00:01:02.390> them<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.810> so<00:01:03.159> excellent

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
you can hardly feel them to so excellent

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.340 
you can hardly feel them to so excellent
product<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.729> it's<00:01:05.630> called<00:01:05.869> numerous

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
product that it's called numerous

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.780 
product that it's called numerous
amounts<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.770> fish<00:01:06.890> over<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.280> years<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:07.670> like

woven braid this one is really really

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.039 
woven braid this one is really really
robust<00:01:30.729> on<00:01:31.729> TV<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:32.090> they<00:01:32.299> all<00:01:32.420> are<00:01:32.630> though<00:01:32.810> I

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
robust on TV but they all are though I

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.719 
robust on TV but they all are though I
mean<00:01:33.200> one<00:01:33.409> thing<00:01:33.619> that<00:01:33.679> Christ<00:01:34.429> didn't<00:01:34.639> have

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
mean one thing that Christ didn't have

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.330 
mean one thing that Christ didn't have
looked<00:01:34.909> into<00:01:35.119> was<00:01:35.600> these<00:01:35.719> coatings<00:01:36.340> they

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
looked into was these coatings they

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.529 
looked into was these coatings they
found<00:01:37.579> that<00:01:37.819> you<00:01:37.880> know<00:01:37.969> if<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:38.209> put<00:01:38.359> one

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
found that you know if you put one

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.709 
found that you know if you put one
coating<00:01:38.959> on<00:01:39.109> there<00:01:39.350> chances<00:01:40.009> are<00:01:40.569> you<00:01:41.569> have<00:01:41.659> a

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
coating on there chances are you have a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.809 
coating on there chances are you have a
fish<00:01:41.959> it<00:01:42.170> tightens<00:01:42.530> up<00:01:42.679> and<00:01:42.859> it<00:01:43.159> splits<00:01:43.520> on<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
fish it tightens up and it splits on the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.550 
fish it tightens up and it splits on the
knot<00:01:43.999> and<00:01:44.240> then<00:01:44.359> obviously<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.049> owl<00:01:45.139> reason

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
knot and then obviously the owl reason

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.469 
knot and then obviously the owl reason
for<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.799> coated<00:01:46.609> opening<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.179> you've<00:01:47.299> got

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
for a coated opening is that you've got

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.109 
for a coated opening is that you've got
a<00:01:48.009> stiffer<00:01:49.009> section<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:49.609> then<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.789> supple

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
a stiffer section and then a supple

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.879 
a stiffer section and then a supple
section<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.630> if<00:01:50.719> you've<00:01:50.869> you're<00:01:51.439> not<00:01:51.560> split

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
section so if you've you're not split

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.190 
section so if you've you're not split
here<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:52.789> creating<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> hinge<00:01:53.659> section

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
here and it's creating a hinge section

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.620 
here and it's creating a hinge section
then<00:01:54.679> you<00:01:55.100> know<00:01:55.579> it's<00:01:55.700> completely<00:01:55.789> defeating

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
then you know it's completely defeating

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.629 
then you know it's completely defeating
the<00:01:56.719> object<00:01:57.079> of<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.590> what<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.159> found<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.609> that

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
the object of it so what I found is that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.669 
the object of it so what I found is that
if<00:01:58.909> I<00:01:58.999> kept<00:01:59.209> to<00:01:59.329> apply<00:01:59.509> more<00:01:59.810> layers<00:02:00.020> over<00:02:00.619> a

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
if I kept to apply more layers over a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.249 
if I kept to apply more layers over a
real<00:02:00.829> slow<00:02:01.100> process<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.999> made<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.479> much<00:02:02.929> tougher

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
real slow process it made a much tougher

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.440 
real slow process it made a much tougher
coating<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:04.700> know<00:02:04.789> and<00:02:04.880> people<00:02:05.029> say<00:02:05.299> oh<00:02:05.329> it's

you<00:02:06.229> know<00:02:06.349> it's<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.529> little<00:02:06.649> bit<00:02:06.859> tricky<00:02:07.399> to

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
you know it's a little bit tricky to

you know it's a little bit tricky to
remove<00:02:07.849> we<00:02:08.509> want<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.020> be<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.259> whole<00:02:09.380> idea

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
remove we want it to be the whole idea

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
know the color Derek link obviously

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.990 
know the color Derek link obviously
because<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.160> is<00:03:50.280> designed<00:03:50.639> for<00:03:50.849> more

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
because it is designed for more

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.900 
because it is designed for more
demanding<00:03:51.449> situations<00:03:51.919> it's<00:03:52.919> been<00:03:53.250> developed

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
demanding situations it's been developed

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.030 
demanding situations it's been developed
in<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.120> much<00:03:54.359> higher<00:03:54.629> breaking<00:03:55.199> strain<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.919> it

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
in a much higher breaking strain so it

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.640 
in a much higher breaking strain so it
starts<00:03:56.370> off<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.549> 25-pound<00:03:57.359> then<00:03:58.079> up<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.410> thirty

same color as the outer braid and as I

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.600 
same color as the outer braid and as I
say<00:04:56.090> is<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.360> lot<00:04:56.720> finer<00:04:57.160> really<00:04:58.160> nice<00:04:58.370> and

supple<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:59.120> can<00:04:59.240> obviously<00:04:59.540> see<00:04:59.810> the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
supple you can obviously see the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.330 
supple you can obviously see the
difference<00:05:00.320> there<00:05:00.530> this<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:01.040> stiffer

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
difference there this is the stiffer

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.030 
difference there this is the stiffer
section<00:05:01.730> that's<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.090> supple<00:05:02.450> section<00:05:02.840> and

section that's the supple section and

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
section that's the supple section and
obviously<00:05:04.040> that's<00:05:04.220> exactly<00:05:04.610> what<00:05:04.760> you

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
obviously that's exactly what you

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.260 
obviously that's exactly what you
generally<00:05:05.240> want<00:05:05.630> out<00:05:05.930> of<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:06.260> co-ed<00:05:06.980> hook<00:05:07.130> me

generally want out of a co-ed hook me

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.120 
generally want out of a co-ed hook me
okay<00:05:08.270> so<00:05:08.540> once<00:05:09.020> again<00:05:09.350> they've<00:05:09.740> produced<00:05:09.980> a

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
okay so once again they've produced a

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.100 
okay so once again they've produced a
jackal<00:05:10.520> in<00:05:10.790> a<00:05:10.910> range<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.210> colors<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.690> suit<00:05:11.870> all
