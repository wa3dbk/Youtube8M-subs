to<00:00:18.630> tell<00:00:18.779> people's<00:00:19.140> stories<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.070> write

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
to tell people's stories really I write

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820 
to tell people's stories really I write
because<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.820> therapeutic<00:00:21.439> it's<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.650> it's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
because it's therapeutic it's like it's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.429 
because it's therapeutic it's like it's
good<00:00:23.070> for<00:00:23.339> my<00:00:23.550> head<00:00:23.759> it's<00:00:24.029> healing<00:00:24.419> so<00:00:25.079> I<00:00:25.109> think

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
good for my head it's healing so I think

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.319 
good for my head it's healing so I think
most<00:00:25.679> artists<00:00:26.279> write<00:00:26.490> because<00:00:26.759> it<00:00:27.029> makes<00:00:27.179> them

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
most artists write because it makes them

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.019 
most artists write because it makes them
feel<00:00:27.359> better<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.929> then<00:00:28.710> when<00:00:29.249> you've<00:00:29.369> written

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
feel better and then when you've written

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.990 
feel better and then when you've written
a<00:00:30.150> lot<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> nice<00:00:30.509> songs<00:00:30.810> then<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.769> nice<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.160> to

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
how it goes you know we all get together

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.900 
how it goes you know we all get together
this<00:01:07.610> year<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:09.070> we<00:01:10.070> realized<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.580> we<00:01:10.670> kind

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
this year and we realized that we kind

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.130 
this year and we realized that we kind
of<00:01:10.970> missed<00:01:11.150> each<00:01:11.270> other<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.660> we<00:01:11.750> going<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:11.960> do

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
of missed each other and we going to do

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.590 
of missed each other and we going to do
a<00:01:12.170> reunion<00:01:12.640> when<00:01:13.640> we're<00:01:13.820> still<00:01:14.030> fairly<00:01:14.390> young

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
a reunion when we're still fairly young

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.410 
a reunion when we're still fairly young
you<00:01:14.900> know<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:15.650> I<00:01:15.680> hadn't<00:01:15.979> seen<00:01:16.220> them<00:01:16.430> since

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
you know so I hadn't seen them since

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.600 
you know so I hadn't seen them since
2003<00:01:18.110> Dalton<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:18.830> year<00:01:19.009> it's<00:01:19.130> my<00:01:19.250> first<00:01:19.460> time

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
2003 Dalton this year it's my first time

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.430 
2003 Dalton this year it's my first time
seeing<00:01:19.820> them<00:01:20.050> because<00:01:21.050> it<00:01:21.170> became

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
seeing them because it became

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.770 
seeing them because it became
predictable<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.460> we<00:01:22.850> were<00:01:22.970> writing<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.570> same

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
predictable and we were writing the same

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.440 
predictable and we were writing the same
stuff<00:01:24.080> over<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.380> over<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:25.670> suppose<00:01:26.030> like<00:01:26.270> a

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
stuff over and over and I suppose like a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.120 
stuff over and over and I suppose like a
lot<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:26.720> relationships<00:01:27.259> sometimes<00:01:27.530> space<00:01:27.920> is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
lot of relationships sometimes space is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.460 
lot of relationships sometimes space is
good<00:01:28.450> because<00:01:29.450> when<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:29.899> have<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.050> break<00:01:30.320> you

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
good because when you have a break you

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.240 
good because when you have a break you
miss<00:01:30.649> people<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.820> know<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.890> maybe<00:01:33.890> it's<00:01:34.190> a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
miss people you know and maybe it's a

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.490 
miss people you know and maybe it's a
hunger<00:01:34.580> again<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:36.020> know<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.170> lose<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
hunger again you know you lose the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.460 
hunger again you know you lose the
hunger<00:01:36.800> so<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:38.690> take<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.869> break<00:01:39.080> for<00:01:39.289> it<00:01:39.380> you

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
hunger so you take a break for it you

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.230 
hunger so you take a break for it you
might<00:01:39.619> get<00:01:39.770> hungry<00:01:39.890> again<00:01:40.190> do<00:01:40.789> all<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.090> air

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
might get hungry again do all the air

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.600 
might get hungry again do all the air
