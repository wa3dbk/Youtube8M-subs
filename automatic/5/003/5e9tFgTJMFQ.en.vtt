00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.460
 not with the mentality of winning 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.820
 and on the contrary this week I did not see 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 criticism in the specialized press at 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.610
 otherwise I saw that they talked about an improvement 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.559
 of the team and that we all agree 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.230
 reviews can come in quotes 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.700
 because we have not achieved the triumph 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.760
 we have achieved draws 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.980
 and beyond that the team improved the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.050
 production was good we made the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.430
 merits but as the foundation not 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.050
 you win the matches and you do not have to 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.079
 concretize it and let's wait this end of 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.210
 week to be able 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:00.190
 develop a match superior to that 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.200
 we did the previous weekend 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.199
 improving it 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.030
 yes I think we had the need to how 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.240
 things were for the expulsion of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.070
 rain and then gonzalez selected in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.440
 that unfortunate play of the week and 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.920
 Prieto had the opportunity to play I think 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.080
 that he did it well so I was talking 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.510
 with the three archers in private with 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.090
 they telling him what the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.460
 Juarez decision with complete and 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.979
 knowing that now also comes with 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.060
 bachir and championship and there we go we are going to 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.580
 watch 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.850
 there's going to be a rotation so that 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.440
 better see you will keep playing because the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.159
 archer's position is different than the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.180
 field player usually 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.980
 one 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.780
 to change the goalkeeper they have to 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.150
 happen things and difficult was a 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.620
 difficult situation because he got it 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.560
 leave for an expulsion 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.470
 brito also entered and I think my understanding 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.650
 that he did well then he in that 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.080
 moment to leave it out also the truth 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.600
 that I had to mature in the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.940
 elapse of the week because I had 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.039
 I doubt I did not want to be unfair to anyone and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.740
 in the end after I decided on Christ and 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.680
 of sometimes that one wrong the way 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.290
 and able not to pause or be 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.110
 that's why the exercises in 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.170
 the week they help you as for the day of the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.510
 party can run so in that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.280
 look if the front strikers 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.260
 when it does not convert everything they have anxiety 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.630
 also then in that aspect when 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.550
 some games happen and it's not the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.070
 possibility hopefully it will start later 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.470
 to open the bow and I reiterate again if 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.220
 the team generates surely they are going to 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.530
 start converting all 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.380
 as a possible replacement but chooses today 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.840
 he found himself better with some 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.670
 lumbar pain so more than anything what 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.740
 We take care as a precaution so you can 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.090
 getting well was doing work 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.730
 differentiated but if there is no 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.430
 inconvenient 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.920
 and the time to win I think it came from 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.750
 first day that I arrived here that is the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.629
 mentality that we have for different 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.510
 circumstances that I have already explained has 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.250
 reiterated several times we went 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.900
 accommodating the work and that what 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.200
 we say we see the rise we see the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.069
 work win we want to win all this way 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.650
 that winning strengthens you the soul 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:26.060
 trust, wanting to keep insisting 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.340
 not winning sometimes creates you same doubts 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.890
 the player to the coach to conform 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.780
 the party to conform the team I say 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.829
 so in that aspect it would be very 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.870
 important tomorrow to win for her what 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.660
 we are improving in day to day and what 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.569
 that we see reflected in the field of play 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.760
 on weekends improvements are seen 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.159
 in different sectors of the field already 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.859
 Sometimes I hope that moment 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.329
 be more prolonged and accompanies us not 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.939
 have no difficulty or with 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.249
 expulsions nor with the possibility that 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.870
 we have to be able to convert to as for 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:02.499
 can add to three that is the goal 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.499
 that we all have
