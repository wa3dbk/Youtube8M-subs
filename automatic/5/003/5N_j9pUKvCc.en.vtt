00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 I 'm going to show you 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.770
 not to our agreement but their agreement to 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.120
 know this is this one 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.610
 you will be able to use it for 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 catch all the fish optima gina 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.859
 with all the sections of file 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 imaginable it's from the smallest to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.930
 the biggest place to prevent the dandy 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:28.260
 and amber because in us just the soaps 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 little wonder in the south so the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.570
 base includes the press one comes to ask 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.309
 here at the index level 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.750
 agree is rotated and made 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.559
 slightly crossed like that a few 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.379
 way towers here it's tight must 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.399
 not that it slips then we do the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 same thing around the thumb 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.699
 okay so it went well in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 below here so that's it slips a little 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.780
 I repeat a few laps to know that the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.390
 part that also above the index 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 to go lost but we will need after 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.140
 to finalize the then I coldmont 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140
 carbon flower 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.110
 it was the flow euros then the flow 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.970
 euros carbon I come the past here to 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:22.210
 the interior below the braid this 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.539
 which is important is that here this 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.170
 part there always be tense gold be 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.420
 you are not sleeves 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.220
 you get to the soft water like that 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.630
 with for a hand be wanted you 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.979
 put in a corner like this and you 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.600
 to block us so as to its sauce 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:40.929
 always tense so we go in from his 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.880
 concert shows a good length here that 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.950
 does not age the block there you see at 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 less bloom it is blocked here 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.770
 now I'm going to alternate below to 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.729
 right I take the length and in 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.990
 below left and every time I 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.849
 good trend that likes so much what is 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.810
 really important here is that 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:08.289
 the espira back cleanly below 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.910
 below left do you grow my 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.150
 son is of course at the base you have 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.359
 always know how to be tender in the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.359
 already the term 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.890
 I tend 6 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.159
 this goal 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.600
 9 after rather section is fat more you 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.540
 strikes okay let's go on a 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.960
 base of 20 rounds on small 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.740
 sections 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:53.080
 but after that so big option is going to pass 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.880
 right away at 35 40 laps but by 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.200
 against it must think to give more 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.520
 more length here because every 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:19.980
 once we take the material so has it to 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:22.980
 every time it will reduce 9 10 16 fact 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.980
 goal 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:40.660
 9 here I am blocking myself and I already have to 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.410
 the base of nights so here you are that 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.760
 makes you a good centimeter what minimum 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.310
 then there I have my line body so 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.450
 it's worth a reel I still have a little 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.330
 euro carbon girl tip that is the 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.550
 plus my little bit of tracy if the jav 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.170
 around an axis now I'm going 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.790
 imprisoned these two strands here so my 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.610
 carbon future and mistresses with this 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.860
 little bit of 13 for that I'm just doing 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.610
 loop I just stuck here between the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.580
 thumb and forefinger 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:21.459
 I go back inside here like that and 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:22.420
 so I block that three times one of good 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.140
 I do it with the teeth we can 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.110
 to do without the teeth but it is that they 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.750
 are a practice three times so the 2 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.610
 final is where you should not miss 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.790
 same principle always the half-key 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.680
 so the loop we pass or spend a 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.590
 common faith of mithly one will spend six 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.150
 time on two the big section you go 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.220
 you can pass 15 points if you want 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.100
 see there we could have big section in 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.470
 115 120 hundredths we could have put 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.419
 everything about 60 or 80 pounds we could 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.570
 do 40 laps for example who sees 41 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.840
 60 rounds and then do 5-2 myths the 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.040
 plus 10 rounds here so I spent six 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:08.440
 ovens indoors one two three four 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:10.450
 five six like that and here what is 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.950
 important here it is this loop but 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.030
 in the mud we're going to overthrow her 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.250
 so that the turns they 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.990
 there we go back here that the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.850
 two of the winged brens retouches 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.770
 what is important is that the loop 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.660
 crowd lured outside of 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.000
 way that what turns ben eh 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.440
 it goes back well here there you see it 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.919
 sees goes back the one two three four 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.320
 five 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.530
 I made six laps so here I'm six 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.530
 towers 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.619
 and there you see how you you wet 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.689
 blocks here the way is that when 

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:45.399
 I will now shoot at my address 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.819
 that turns do not come 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:52.419
 to ride and that it has derailed 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:59.110
 loop here you it does not lock 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:00.789
 it's a little pie to his bosses no 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.520
 you can go here is the knot and the 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.620
 most facts then had some 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:11.439
 surpluses that is to say, takes you away 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:13.389
 overflow of pop 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:16.539
 I did the same thing with kuduro 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:20.469
 carbon except that we'll let we go 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:24.069
 leave a small millimeter you wet 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:26.110
 well the address and for this to be really 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:34.289
 very clean the flick of lighter that 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:34.289
 is fine and just their perfect agreement 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.909
 the whole thing is to have a small 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.699
 gestural way to get there but that 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.289
 is doing very well and we did it in 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:56.249
 full wind or what retirees 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:56.249
 arrive at a lucky luke hates it's
