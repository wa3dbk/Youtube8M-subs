flat so that's a nice feature all
together<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:50.280> terms<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:50.730> sound<00:03:50.970> quality<00:03:51.270> I

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
together and in terms of sound quality I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.770 
together and in terms of sound quality I
would<00:03:52.560> say<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:53.070> these<00:03:53.310> do<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.730> decent<00:03:54.300> job<00:03:54.750> in

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
would say that these do a decent job in

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.150 
would say that these do a decent job in
sound<00:03:55.140> quality<00:03:55.290> they're<00:03:56.040> not<00:03:57.440> great<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.980> they

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
sound quality they're not great but they

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.800 
sound quality they're not great but they
are<00:03:59.340> good<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.090> there's<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.330> very<00:04:00.540> hard<00:04:00.690> to

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
are good so there's a very hard to

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.900 
are good so there's a very hard to
quantify<00:04:00.900> or<00:04:01.860> any<00:04:02.040> reasons<00:04:02.430> why<00:04:02.490> is<00:04:02.640> because

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
quantify or any reasons why is because

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.120 
quantify or any reasons why is because
when<00:04:03.270> it<00:04:03.420> gets<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.990> especially<00:04:04.620> when<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:04.920> have

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
when it gets to especially when you have

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.010 
when it gets to especially when you have
the<00:04:05.340> Bluetooth<00:04:05.580> volume<00:04:06.090> cranked<00:04:06.660> up<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
the Bluetooth volume cranked up to the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.350 
the Bluetooth volume cranked up to the
highest<00:04:07.230> when<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.190> get<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.520> higher<00:04:08.880> volumes

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
highest when you get to higher volumes

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.449 
highest when you get to higher volumes
it<00:04:09.660> tends<00:04:10.020> to<00:04:10.080> crack<00:04:10.620> all<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:10.920> sound<00:04:11.250> tests

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
it tends to crack all the sound tests

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.160 
it tends to crack all the sound tests
crack<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.790> little<00:04:12.030> bit<00:04:12.270> so<00:04:12.780> that's<00:04:12.959> something

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
crack a little bit so that's something

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.220 
crack a little bit so that's something
of<00:04:13.500> course<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:14.880> don't<00:04:15.180> find<00:04:15.480> with<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.750> s4

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
of course you don't find with the s4

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.320 
of course you don't find with the s4
hundreds<00:04:16.650> which<00:04:16.890> were<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:17.520> pristine<00:04:18.060> all

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
hundreds which were just pristine all

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.810 
hundreds which were just pristine all
together<00:04:18.540> so<00:04:18.900> these<00:04:19.080> crackle<00:04:19.799> at<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.250> higher

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
together so these crackle at a higher

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.330 
together so these crackle at a higher
fresh<00:04:21.209> sound<00:04:21.420> finishes<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.109> they<00:04:22.590> do<00:04:22.650> handle

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
fresh sound finishes but they do handle

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.100 
fresh sound finishes but they do handle
the<00:04:23.460> mids<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:23.940> lows<00:04:24.030> well<00:04:24.510> enough<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.380> also

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
the mids and lows well enough and also

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.020 
the mids and lows well enough and also
the<00:04:27.229> box<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:27.770> bomb<00:04:27.979> is<00:04:28.159> of<00:04:28.310> course<00:04:28.550> when<00:04:28.789> you

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
the box like bomb is of course when you

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.540 
the box like bomb is of course when you
lose<00:04:29.419> power<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:30.169> your<00:04:30.319> device<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.099> you<00:04:31.400> use

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
lose power on your device and you use

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.730 
lose power on your device and you use
just<00:04:31.849> the<00:04:32.120> lining<00:04:32.689> cable<00:04:32.990> on<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.139> headset

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
just the lining cable on the headset

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.129 
just the lining cable on the headset
you<00:04:34.129> basically<00:04:34.310> have<00:04:35.030> slightly<00:04:35.689> reduce

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
you basically have slightly reduce

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.809 
you basically have slightly reduce
falling<00:04:36.590> not<00:04:36.800> as<00:04:36.949> much<00:04:37.129> but<00:04:37.310> which<00:04:37.400> is<00:04:37.550> fine

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
falling not as much but which is fine

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:38.830 
falling not as much but which is fine
though<00:04:38.000> because<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.419> actually<00:04:38.689> doesn't

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
though because it actually doesn't

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.929 
though because it actually doesn't
crackle<00:04:39.379> when<00:04:39.949> you<00:04:40.069> have<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.370> wired<00:04:40.639> I'll

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
crackle when you have it wired I'll

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.909 
crackle when you have it wired I'll
connect<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.419> that<00:04:41.629> way<00:04:41.840> now<00:04:42.349> the<00:04:42.409> battery<00:04:42.770> life

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
connect it that way now the battery life

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.850 
connect it that way now the battery life
is<00:04:43.099> great<00:04:43.189> it's<00:04:43.639> about<00:04:44.259> 18<00:04:45.259> hours<00:04:45.409> battery

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
is great it's about 18 hours battery

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
just because of that some of the sound

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.800 
just because of that some of the sound
quality's<00:05:25.849> there<00:05:26.060> but<00:05:26.300> it's<00:05:26.479> something<00:05:26.659> that

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
quality's there but it's something that
