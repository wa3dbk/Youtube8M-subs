00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
wire set up most people a lot of like a

500-pound barrel or something but for

500-pound barrel or something but for
what<00:01:36.440> we<00:01:36.620> do<00:01:36.800> in-house<00:01:37.190> here<00:01:37.580> we<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:38.360> use<00:01:38.510> the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
what we do in-house here we just use the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.570 
what we do in-house here we just use the
44<00:01:39.140> pounds<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:42.380> position<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.979> also<00:01:43.400> pretty

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
44 pounds this position is also pretty

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.030 
44 pounds this position is also pretty
unique<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.570> fact<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.110> only<00:01:45.380> has<00:01:45.710> one

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
unique is the fact that it only has one

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.370 
unique is the fact that it only has one
motor<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.850> control<00:01:47.240> three<00:01:47.540> different<00:01:47.990> axes<00:01:48.350> of

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
motor to control three different axes of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.270 
motor to control three different axes of
rotation<00:01:50.229> that's<00:01:51.229> very<00:01:51.350> beneficial<00:01:51.770> because

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
rotation that's very beneficial because

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.969 
rotation that's very beneficial because
it<00:01:52.490> keeps<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.850> cost<00:01:53.119> down<00:01:53.360> significantly<00:01:53.979> by

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
it keeps you cost down significantly by

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.400 
it keeps you cost down significantly by
reducing<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.940> servo<00:01:56.330> motors<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:57.050> servo

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
reducing to servo motors to servo

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.860 
reducing to servo motors to servo
amplifiers

amplifiers

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.540

and<00:02:00.020> then<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.350> way<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.650> works<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.340> motor

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
and then the way it works is the motor

where<00:03:13.460> you<00:03:13.610> do<00:03:13.790> all<00:03:13.820> your<00:03:14.110> programming<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:17.660> put

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
where you do all your programming to put

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.450 
where you do all your programming to put
it<00:03:18.020> in<00:03:18.110> your<00:03:18.230> well<00:03:18.410> points<00:03:18.920> changing<00:03:19.340> your

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
it in your well points changing your

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.850 
it in your well points changing your
speeds<00:03:19.900> basically<00:03:20.900> just<00:03:21.380> move<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.740> robot

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
speeds basically just move the robot

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.830 
speeds basically just move the robot
where<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.370> want<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.670> hit<00:03:22.910> store<00:03:23.240> it<00:03:23.420> stores<00:03:23.720> a

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
where you want it hit store it stores a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.470 
where you want it hit store it stores a
point<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.410> then<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.250> tell<00:03:25.520> it<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:26.090> know<00:03:26.240> I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
point and then you tell it you know I

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.320 
point and then you tell it you know I
want<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.320> well<00:03:27.770> from<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.250> point<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:28.910> then

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
want a well from that point on and then

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.960 
want a well from that point on and then
went<00:03:29.570> not<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:29.990> well<00:03:30.200> things<00:03:30.740> like<00:03:30.830> that<00:03:31.160> the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
went not so well things like that the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.550 
went not so well things like that the
other<00:03:32.150> thing<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.390> pretty<00:03:32.720> unique<00:03:32.930> about<00:03:33.350> this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
other thing is pretty unique about this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.620 
other thing is pretty unique about this
system<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.130> used<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.520> control<00:03:34.790> cabinets<00:03:35.480> are

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
system is used to control cabinets are

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.100 
system is used to control cabinets are
tied<00:03:35.840> together<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:38.180> makes<00:03:38.420> advice<00:03:38.840> because

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
tied together that makes advice because

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.410 
tied together that makes advice because
you<00:03:39.320> control<00:03:39.530> both<00:03:39.800> robots<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
you control both robots and the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.780 
you control both robots and the
positioner<00:03:42.050> all<00:03:42.560> from<00:03:42.920> one<00:03:43.070> pendant<00:03:43.610> you

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
positioner all from one pendant you

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.660 
positioner all from one pendant you
don't<00:03:43.970> have<00:03:44.210> a<00:03:44.240> separate<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:46.250> know<00:03:46.430> to

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
don't have a separate you know to

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.820 
don't have a separate you know to
separate<00:03:47.090> each<00:03:47.240> pendants<00:03:47.810> go<00:03:48.110> back<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.650> forth

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
separate each pendants go back and forth

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.600 
separate each pendants go back and forth
between<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.430> program<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.000> heart
