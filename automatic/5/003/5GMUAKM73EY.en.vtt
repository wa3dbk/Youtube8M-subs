00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.370
 Hello, you are welcome 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.500
 When all the recipes are available, of course 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.450
 continue with light recipes 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.570
 In between , I had you sometimes too 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.450
 other things but mainly light 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.180
 recipes that also taste good and vegan 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.690
 or vegetarian today I want you 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 show a recipe with green asparagus 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.250
 I do not know how her green asparagus 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.920
 If you do that, I'll do one 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.340
 Salad from it or asparagus catch today 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.030
 I have you first the recipe asparagus 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.790
 flag and then comes asparagus salad with 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.950
 Pasta and arugula also taste right 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.989
 The green asparagus is delicious 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.030
 that's not how it is 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.430
 the white one i really like the green one 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.860
 would rather eat the white vinegar too much 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.379
 very happy but the green because I like 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.059
 I spared it from making the pan 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.940
 you can not do that with the white ones 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.579
 I find that very fibrous to cook 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.830
 with sauce hollandaise and cooked 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.350
 Potatoes I find the delicious the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.030
 white but the green we do now 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.190
 drive sparklers then I'll show you 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.399
 first what we need for this 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.600
 I have one and green asparagus one 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:24.819
 big potato two big onions too 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.450
 a few states a techno blue salt 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:30.459
 and white pepper 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.709
 I will first asparagus and 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.520
 potatoes into small pieces 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.069
 to cut 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.050
 So the potatoes have to be right for him 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.440
 quite clearly not cut pieces 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.440
 become 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.740
 I have the figure with the garlic 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.420
 fried and here just the stairs 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.820
 lures with pure asparagus does not need 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.260
 long behind cdu I will go as 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.260
 attacking potatoes 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:33.830
 the potatoes seared now I go 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:36.550
 just fun but not anymore 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.550
 have to do 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.130
 tastes that now only temporarily 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.130
 postponed 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.990
 I hope that this recipe 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.780
 has noticed as said that minister 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.120
 recipe will then be asparagus salad with 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.690
 noodles, I completely only to 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.640
 took 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.830
 By the way, clearly that I already 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.050
 I want you now 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.460
 do not say how much I lost 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.770
 because I have not reached my goal yet 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.410
 but I have a bit already 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.360
 you can see that would be taken off 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.670
 Of course, I am also interested 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.790
 then I wish you much fun now 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.890
