I know exactly what you're thinking in

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.200 
I know exactly what you're thinking in
this<00:00:04.319> case<00:00:04.589> you're<00:00:04.890> thinking<00:00:04.920> hey<00:00:05.730> what<00:00:06.180> the

this case you're thinking hey what the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.190 
this case you're thinking hey what the
heck<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:07.160> well<00:00:08.160> what<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.330> heck<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.750> it

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
heck is this well what the heck is it

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.580 
heck is this well what the heck is it
here's<00:00:10.800> blood<00:00:11.809> here's<00:00:12.809> something<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.440> has<00:00:13.559> a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
here's blood here's something that has a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.640 
here's blood here's something that has a
lot<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.920> blood<00:00:14.130> vessels<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.910> oh<00:00:15.379> my<00:00:16.379> God

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
lot of blood vessels in it oh my God

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.240 
lot of blood vessels in it oh my God
look<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> little<00:00:17.730> edge<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.350> a<00:00:19.350> squamous

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
look we have a little edge of a squamous

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.080 
look we have a little edge of a squamous
mucosa<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.590> so<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.039> could<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.340> skin<00:00:23.820> or

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
mucosa here so this could be skin or

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.109 
mucosa here so this could be skin or
because<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:25.050> see<00:00:25.260> any<00:00:25.500> hair<00:00:26.119> follicles

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
because I don't see any hair follicles

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.490 
because I don't see any hair follicles
or<00:00:27.300> sweat<00:00:27.570> glands<00:00:27.840> maybe<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.380> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
or sweat glands maybe it's a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.800 
or sweat glands maybe it's a
non-keratinized<00:00:29.220> squamous<00:00:30.060> mucosa<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
non-keratinized squamous mucosa like a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.000 
non-keratinized squamous mucosa like a
mouth<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.590> indeed<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.739> probably<00:00:34.739> from

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
mouth and indeed this was probably from

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.930 
mouth and indeed this was probably from
the<00:00:35.160> oral<00:00:35.750> mucosa<00:00:37.309> which<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.520> where<00:00:38.730> these

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the oral mucosa which is where these

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.440 
the oral mucosa which is where these
tumors<00:00:39.450> arise<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
tumors arise and you know this is the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.389 
tumors arise and you know this is the
tumor<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.399> you<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> tumor<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
tumor and you know this is the tumor and

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
tumor and you know this is the tumor and
you<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> tumor<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.930> all

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you know this is the tumor and it all

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.810 
you know this is the tumor and it all
look<00:00:49.230> similar<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.010> doesn't<00:00:50.309> matter<00:00:50.520> what

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
look similar so it doesn't matter what

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.360 
look similar so it doesn't matter what
we<00:00:50.969> go<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.320> now<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> first<00:00:52.770> thing<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.219> you're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
we go to now the first thing that you're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.139 
we go to now the first thing that you're
thinking<00:00:53.610> now<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.410> hey<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:56.489> doesn't<00:00:56.820> look

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
thinking now is hey this doesn't look

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.720 
thinking now is hey this doesn't look
like<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.420> tumor<00:00:57.930> at<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:59.250> looks<00:00:59.550> like

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
like a tumor at all this looks like

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.170 
like a tumor at all this looks like
normal<00:01:00.420> granulation<00:01:01.410> tissue<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:02.820> could<00:01:03.000> see

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
normal granulation tissue you could see

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.329 
normal granulation tissue you could see
a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.480> these<00:01:03.690> foamy<00:01:04.260> histiocytes<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
a lot of these foamy histiocytes you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.969 
a lot of these foamy histiocytes you
could<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:05.850> abundant<00:01:06.799> prominence<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
could see these abundant prominence of

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.000 
could see these abundant prominence of
budding<00:01:08.250> blood<00:01:08.760> vessels<00:01:09.500> why<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.770> dr.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
budding blood vessels why would dr.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.000 
budding blood vessels why would dr.
minar<00:01:11.580> cick<00:01:11.880> show<00:01:12.630> us<00:01:12.900> something<00:01:13.860> he's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
minar cick show us something he's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.870 
minar cick show us something he's
calling<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.430> tumor<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.659> looks<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.020> normal

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
calling a tumor if it looks like normal

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.679 
calling a tumor if it looks like normal
granulation<00:01:17.880> tissue<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.659> part<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> normal

granulation tissue as part of the normal

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.749 
granulation tissue as part of the normal
organizing<00:01:21.689> inflammatory<00:01:22.590> process<00:01:23.280> well

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
organizing inflammatory process well

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
organizing inflammatory process well
that's<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.780> tumor<00:01:25.259> called

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that's because this tumor called

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.490 
that's because this tumor called
pyogenic<00:01:26.549> granuloma<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:28.110> really<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
pyogenic granuloma it's not really a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830 
pyogenic granuloma it's not really a
granuloma<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.909> not<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> tumor

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
granuloma and it's not really a tumor

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.679 
granuloma and it's not really a tumor
it's<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.790> granulation<00:01:32.790> tissue<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.630> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it's really granulation tissue but it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.469 
it's really granulation tissue but it
could<00:01:33.930> appear<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> tumor<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.210> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
could appear like a tumor in that it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.039 
could appear like a tumor in that it
could<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.590> polyploid<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.049> you'll

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
could be very very polyploid and you'll

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.130 
could be very very polyploid and you'll
notice<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.860> cells<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.579> are<00:01:41.790> still

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
notice a lot of cells in here are still

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.190 
notice a lot of cells in here are still
neutrophils<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.659> prominent<00:01:45.659> amount

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
neutrophils there is a prominent amount

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.380 
neutrophils there is a prominent amount
of<00:01:46.470> these<00:01:46.649> foamy<00:01:47.009> histiocytes<00:01:47.939> however

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
of these foamy histiocytes however

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
of these foamy histiocytes however
causing<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.170> cells<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.710> clear<00:01:50.009> spaces

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
causing these cells with clear spaces

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.999 
causing these cells with clear spaces
but<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> most<00:01:52.170> prominent<00:01:52.649> feature

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
but one of the most prominent feature

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.880 
but one of the most prominent feature
are<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.090> these<00:01:54.270> budding<00:01:54.890> endothelial

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
are all of these budding endothelial

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.520 
are all of these budding endothelial
cells<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:57.060> showing<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.509> large<00:01:57.810> growth<00:01:58.290> of

cells just showing a large growth of
blood<00:01:58.829> vessels<00:01:59.310> into<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> that's<00:02:00.060> why

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
blood vessels into this and that's why

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.510 
blood vessels into this and that's why
it's<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.509> very<00:02:00.619> hemorrhagic<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.219> very

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's a very hemorrhagic and very

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.730 
it's a very hemorrhagic and very
vascular<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.689> would<00:02:03.810> spike<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.380> bleed

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
vascular and that would spike and bleed

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.819 
vascular and that would spike and bleed
like<00:02:05.040> crazy<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
like crazy as well and this is a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.589 
like crazy as well and this is a
pyogenic<00:02:08.759> granuloma<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:11.390> oral<00:02:12.390> cavity

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
pyogenic granuloma of the oral cavity

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.640 
pyogenic granuloma of the oral cavity
perhaps<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
perhaps the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.080 
perhaps the
perhaps<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.519> mouth<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.500> virtually

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
perhaps the mouth and it is virtually

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.289
