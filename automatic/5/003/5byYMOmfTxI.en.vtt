00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.779
 good morning dear viewers 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.150
 today's topic is currants but not easy 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.400
 white currant pink and red 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.430
 how do they differ from blackcurrant 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.070
 to all technology and agricultural technology 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.810
 growing slightly different if black 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.440
 currant fructification occurs on 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 branches 2 3 and further orders here and there 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.910
 will be the main crop then it should be 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.039
 trim all the time remember yes open cheeses 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.590
 q do first in August and then in spring 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.170
 and so on but here are red whites and 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.020
 pink currants so you can not do 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.100
 don't cut anything at all you don't even 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.079
 form a bush 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.920
 he will shape you look what 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.910
 handsome they are easy to distinguish because on 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.640
 currant sprigs 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.120
 pink white red usually she 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.129
 studded slightly prickly and the first thing 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.180
 appears if the bush bears fruit 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.040
 namely berries and this is clearly not seen it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.469
 He managed to produce leaves and how to 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.469
 berries are already formed in black currant 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.890
 first leaves then berries means if 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:10.830
 suddenly for some reason red trunks 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.260
 white or pink currant covered 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.780
 pillow prominent white matter it and 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.119
 I like to be lazy and this thing is very 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.990
 bad is a fungal virus 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.350
 the disease therefore take working off 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.960
 car oil for matches to find 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.990
 discs are not fleece disc course 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.110
 rag and wipe the trunks of this 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.659
 currants right here are very carefully 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.610
 just don't carry bundles but if 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.619
 the disease has covered the whole bush and you 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.170
 You see that you do not have to cope 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.860
 remove this bush and on this place of the year 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.430
 three four 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.799
 nobody's planting gooseberries like 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.079
 black currants are grown for the same 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.329
 agricultural technology is also trimmed also 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.520
 formed the more side branches 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.979
 the more berries will be on your bushes 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.020
 gooseberry some say you know 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.780
 planted a bush he is some kind of crooked curve 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.600
 I can show here he is crooked humpback but 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.209
 and that only because he is second year 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.930
 it will take another year and it will turn into 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.329
 this happens with all bushes 1 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.719
 also the first year he is no second year he 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:22.590
 curve and here is the third year it's already handsome 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:26.030
 I wish you the most creative success in 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.030
 our hard work
