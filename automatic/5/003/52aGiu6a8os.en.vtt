00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.740 
pretty damn good I think I stand to his
ball<00:01:05.129> control<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:05.850> does<00:01:06.060> occasionally<00:01:06.420> let

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
ball control which does occasionally let

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.359 
ball control which does occasionally let
him<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:06.960> he's<00:01:07.409> won<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.680> players<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
him down he's won on players that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.679 
him down he's won on players that
sometimes<00:01:08.760> she<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.030> dribbling<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.540> him

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
sometimes she can be dribbling with him

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.149 
sometimes she can be dribbling with him
and<00:01:09.900> he'll<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.229> leave<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> ball<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.010> run

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and he'll just leave the ball and run

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.649 
and he'll just leave the ball and run
past<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> bit<00:01:11.880> frustrating<00:01:12.330> but

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
past it which is a bit frustrating but

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.300 
past it which is a bit frustrating but
still<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.380> he's<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> ball<00:01:13.860> inside<00:01:14.189> the

still when he's on the ball inside the
box<00:01:14.490> i<00:01:14.610> would<00:01:14.729> say<00:01:14.850> he<00:01:14.970> makes<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.509> is
