flip<00:01:20.229> them<00:01:20.380> over<00:01:20.530> now<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.369> have<00:01:21.640> the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
flip them over now you have the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.950 
flip them over now you have the
traditional<00:01:21.970> lid<00:01:23.610> back<00:01:24.610> on<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.700> that

traditional lid back on and that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.350 
traditional lid back on and that
as<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.860> two<00:01:31.130> pins<00:01:31.370> in<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.790> front<00:01:32.090> for<00:01:32.330> the

as the two pins in the front for the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.830 
as the two pins in the front for the
tray<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:33.380> can<00:01:33.770> fold<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.220> tray<00:01:34.460> down<00:01:34.840> to

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
tray so you can fold the tray down to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.130 
tray so you can fold the tray down to
paint<00:01:36.110> off<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.710> campus<00:01:37.840> each<00:01:38.840> other<00:01:39.110> I

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
paint off of the campus each other I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.210 
paint off of the campus each other I
think<00:01:39.290> there's<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.680> really<00:01:39.890> big<00:01:40.220> feature<00:01:42.220> then

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
think there's a really big feature then

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.780 
think there's a really big feature then
you<00:01:43.520> have<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.930> clip<00:01:45.740> here<00:01:45.770> which<00:01:46.100> actually

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
you have a clip here which actually

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.790 
you have a clip here which actually
locks<00:01:47.120> this<00:01:47.540> carriage<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.530> other

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
locks this carriage to this other

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.180 
locks this carriage to this other
characters<00:01:49.460> two<00:01:49.670> aluminum<00:01:50.180> clips<00:01:50.619> this<00:01:51.619> is<00:01:52.160> a

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
characters two aluminum clips this is a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.730 
characters two aluminum clips this is a
lot<00:01:52.490> more<00:01:52.729> stability<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.930> two<00:01:54.140> characters

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
lot more stability so the two characters

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.340 
lot more stability so the two characters
aren't<00:01:54.920> flapping<00:01:55.520> together<00:01:55.930> let's<00:01:56.930> say<00:01:57.170> we

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
aren't flapping together let's say we

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.500 
aren't flapping together let's say we
want<00:01:57.650> to<00:01:57.830> do<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.280> taller<00:01:58.640> campus<00:01:59.119> right<00:01:59.300> now<00:01:59.330> I

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
want to do a taller campus right now I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.900

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
could lock in about a 48 inch canvas on

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.520 
could lock in about a 48 inch canvas on

degrees and the way the counterbalance

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.980 
degrees and the way the counterbalance
system<00:04:46.440> works<00:04:46.970> depending<00:04:47.970> on<00:04:48.150> what<00:04:48.360> size<00:04:48.570> King

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
system works depending on what size King

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.170 
system works depending on what size King
you<00:04:49.230> put<00:04:49.440> on<00:04:49.560> here<00:04:49.770> whether<00:04:49.950> it's<00:04:50.220> heavier<00:04:51.090> of

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
you put on here whether it's heavier of

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.880 
you put on here whether it's heavier of
its<00:04:51.360> light<00:04:51.600> its<00:04:51.780> heavy<00:04:52.080> when<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.470> put<00:04:52.800> the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
its light its heavy when you put the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.530 
its light its heavy when you put the
paint<00:04:53.100> on<00:04:53.310> there<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.640> is<00:04:53.790> going<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.060> float<00:04:54.300> to

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
paint on there this is going to float to

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.320 
paint on there this is going to float to
the<00:04:54.570> bottom<00:04:55.050> because<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.040> weight<00:04:56.330> there's

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
the bottom because of the weight there's

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.110 
the bottom because of the weight there's
a<00:04:57.360> lifted<00:04:57.840> it'll<00:04:58.080> come<00:04:58.260> back<00:04:58.470> down<00:04:58.800> so<00:04:59.700> we

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
a lifted it'll come back down so we

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.480 
a lifted it'll come back down so we
supply<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.600> with<00:05:01.250> counterbalance<00:05:02.250> weights

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
supply you with counterbalance weights

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.340 
supply you with counterbalance weights
there's<00:05:02.910> two<00:05:03.090> different<00:05:03.210> lengths<00:05:03.690> there's<00:05:04.110> a

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
there's two different lengths there's a

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.250 
there's two different lengths there's a
10-inch<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:05.190> there's<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.760> six-inch<00:05:06.260> these

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
10-inch and there's the six-inch these

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.190 
10-inch and there's the six-inch these
are<00:05:07.710> very<00:05:07.950> easily<00:05:08.390> put<00:05:09.390> on<00:05:09.570> here<00:05:12.200> which

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
are very easily put on here which

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.140 
are very easily put on here which
counterbalance<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.340> pain<00:05:14.520> now<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:14.880> can

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
counterbalance is the pain now you can

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.520 
counterbalance is the pain now you can
see<00:05:15.300> with<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.540> a<00:05:15.690> little<00:05:15.960> weight<00:05:16.110> on<00:05:16.140> there

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
see with that a little weight on there

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.830 
see with that a little weight on there
this<00:05:17.100> thing<00:05:17.310> just<00:05:17.550> goes<00:05:17.790> up<00:05:17.820> by<00:05:18.270> itself

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
this thing just goes up by itself

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.540 
this thing just goes up by itself
but<00:05:19.200> if<00:05:19.320> we<00:05:19.410> had<00:05:19.530> a<00:05:19.560> painting<00:05:19.890> out<00:05:20.160> here<00:05:20.370> that

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
but if we had a painting out here that

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:29.380 
but if we had a painting out here that
we<00:05:20.730> can<00:05:21.480> pounce<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:22.680> would<00:05:22.890> move<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.250> all

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.510 

you<00:05:30.110> can<00:05:30.230> see<00:05:30.440> in<00:05:30.560> this<00:05:30.740> model<00:05:31.010> it<00:05:31.280> really

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
you can see in this model it really

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.940 
you can see in this model it really
covers<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.090> lot<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.390> bases<00:05:32.540> not<00:05:33.530> only<00:05:33.710> can<00:05:33.890> you

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
covers a lot of bases not only can you

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.920 
covers a lot of bases not only can you
do<00:05:34.070> tall<00:05:34.400> stuff<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:35.030> can<00:05:35.210> bring<00:05:35.390> these<00:05:35.570> flips

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
do tall stuff you can bring these flips

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.170 
do tall stuff you can bring these flips
all<00:05:36.140> the<00:05:36.260> way<00:05:36.380> down<00:05:36.620> you<00:05:37.490> can<00:05:37.550> actually<00:05:37.790> do<00:05:38.150> a

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
all the way down you can actually do a

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.240 
all the way down you can actually do a
6-inch<00:05:38.990> tall<00:05:39.200> painting<00:05:39.680> even<00:05:39.800> here<00:05:40.070> if<00:05:40.160> you

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
6-inch tall painting even here if you

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.120 
6-inch tall painting even here if you
wanted<00:05:41.080> some<00:05:42.080> things<00:05:42.320> that<00:05:42.500> some<00:05:42.650> people<00:05:42.710> do

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
wanted some things that some people do

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.970 
wanted some things that some people do
also<00:05:43.400> is<00:05:43.730> they'll<00:05:43.940> take<00:05:44.260> maybe<00:05:45.260> have<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.590> small

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
also is they'll take maybe have a small

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.430 
also is they'll take maybe have a small
painting<00:05:46.310> here<00:05:47.500> let's<00:05:48.500> raise<00:05:49.840> take<00:05:50.840> this<00:05:51.140> one

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
painting here let's raise take this one

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.230 
painting here let's raise take this one
and<00:05:51.770> actually<00:05:52.190> take<00:05:52.430> it<00:05:52.610> off<00:05:54.940> bring<00:05:55.940> it<00:05:56.060> over

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
and actually take it off bring it over

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.790 
and actually take it off bring it over
here<00:05:56.390> on<00:05:56.420> this<00:05:56.720> side<00:05:58.990> sometimes<00:05:59.990> people<00:06:00.680> will

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
here on this side sometimes people will

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.160 
here on this side sometimes people will
put<00:06:01.010> a<00:06:01.040> small<00:06:01.340> painting<00:06:01.760> in<00:06:01.910> here<00:06:02.300> and<00:06:02.930> take

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
put a small painting in here and take

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.380 
put a small painting in here and take
another<00:06:03.320> small<00:06:03.770> painting<00:06:04.340> they'll<00:06:04.940> put<00:06:05.180> it<00:06:05.270> in

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
another small painting they'll put it in

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.660 
another small painting they'll put it in
here<00:06:05.690> this<00:06:06.500> allows<00:06:06.830> them<00:06:07.040> to<00:06:07.160> work<00:06:07.190> on<00:06:07.490> this

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
here this allows them to work on this

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.970 
here this allows them to work on this
painting<00:06:07.970> from<00:06:08.870> now<00:06:09.230> to<00:06:09.290> work<00:06:09.620> on<00:06:09.770> this

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
painting from now to work on this

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.910 
painting from now to work on this
painting<00:06:10.450> it<00:06:11.450> just<00:06:11.690> it<00:06:12.050> really<00:06:12.350> covers<00:06:12.560> a<00:06:12.740> lot

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
painting it just it really covers a lot

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.120 
painting it just it really covers a lot
more<00:06:13.130> bases<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.960> some<00:06:15.620> of<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.770> other<00:06:15.890> models

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
more bases and some of the other models

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.290 
more bases and some of the other models
too<00:06:16.660> so<00:06:17.660> again<00:06:18.620> now<00:06:18.830> this<00:06:19.010> is<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:19.310> model<00:06:19.640> 4000

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
too so again now this is the model 4000

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.920 
too so again now this is the model 4000
and<00:06:20.480> I<00:06:21.320> think<00:06:22.130> it's<00:06:22.310> uh<00:06:22.520> it's<00:06:23.150> got<00:06:23.390> a<00:06:23.450> lot<00:06:23.690> every

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
and I think it's uh it's got a lot every

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.130 
and I think it's uh it's got a lot every
feature<00:06:24.170> that<00:06:24.440> you'd<00:06:24.560> ever<00:06:24.680> need<00:06:24.920> up
