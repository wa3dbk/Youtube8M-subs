to kind of do everything he's done very
very<00:03:22.690> well<00:03:22.960> with<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.530> but<00:03:23.710> there<00:03:23.920> are<00:03:24.040> some

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
very well with it but there are some

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.370 
very well with it but there are some
things<00:03:24.520> that<00:03:24.670> took<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.420> little<00:03:25.570> time<00:03:25.840> simple

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
things that took a little time simple

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.320 
things that took a little time simple
things<00:03:26.620> like<00:03:26.740> pulling<00:03:27.340> up<00:03:27.490> your<00:03:27.520> pants<00:03:27.880> or

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
things like pulling up your pants or

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.750 
things like pulling up your pants or
buttoning<00:03:29.110> your<00:03:29.170> shirt<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:30.100> actually<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.550> lot

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
buttoning your shirt is actually a lot

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.580 
buttoning your shirt is actually a lot
more<00:03:31.150> difficult<00:03:31.600> when<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:32.170> only<00:03:32.290> have<00:03:32.560> one

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
more difficult when you only have one

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.310 
more difficult when you only have one
yeah<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:34.150> he's<00:03:34.300> managed<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.780> make<00:03:34.960> it<00:03:35.110> through

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
yeah but he's managed to make it through

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.170 
yeah but he's managed to make it through
but<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.620> will<00:03:35.830> make<00:03:35.980> things<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.910> little

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
but this will make things just a little

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.450 
but this will make things just a little
bit<00:03:37.300> easier
