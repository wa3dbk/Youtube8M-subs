caused that much pain then why would we

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.990 
caused that much pain then why would we
do<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> procedure<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> first<00:01:53.490> place<00:01:53.729> why

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.900 
and you got to look at them
sometimes<00:04:28.259> you<00:04:28.680> can<00:04:28.860> see<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.430> narrative

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
sometimes you can see in the narrative

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.240 
sometimes you can see in the narrative
notes<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.660> maybe<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.710> patient's<00:04:32.100> been

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
notes that maybe the patient's been

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.490 
notes that maybe the patient's been
complaining<00:04:32.699> of<00:04:32.910> pain<00:04:33.150> for<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.570> past<00:04:33.720> 24

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
complaining of pain for the past 24

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.499 
complaining of pain for the past 24
hours<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.669> gives<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> good<00:04:36.300> indication

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
hours so it gives you a good indication

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.779 
hours so it gives you a good indication
they're<00:04:37.110> probably<00:04:37.500> still<00:04:38.100> complaining<00:04:38.610> of

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
they're probably still complaining of

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.560 
they're probably still complaining of
pain<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:40.560> can<00:04:40.830> think<00:04:41.610> about<00:04:41.759> that<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.419> say

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
pain you can think about that and say

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.240 
pain you can think about that and say
okay<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:43.080> want<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.410> keep<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.770> in<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.009> back<00:04:44.100> of

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
okay I want to keep this in the back of

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.930 
okay I want to keep this in the back of
my<00:04:44.460> head

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
my head

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.180 
my head
so<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:45.389> when<00:04:45.539> I<00:04:45.570> get<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.139> room<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.680> want<00:04:47.130> to

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
so that when I get in the room I want to

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.390 
so that when I get in the room I want to
look<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.669> see<00:04:48.120> if<00:04:48.360> they're<00:04:48.810> having<00:04:49.259> pain<00:04:49.710> if

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
look and see if they're having pain if

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.700 
look and see if they're having pain if
they<00:04:50.639> are<00:04:50.850> then<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.330> know<00:04:51.389> that<00:04:51.600> that's<00:04:52.139> my<00:04:52.440> as

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
they are then I know that that's my as

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.270 
they are then I know that that's my as
evidence<00:04:53.220> by<00:04:53.960> where<00:04:54.960> I'm<00:04:55.259> seeing<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.800> problem

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280

is the as evidence by is the signs and

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.620 
is the as evidence by is the signs and

make sense let me give you another
example<00:05:48.199> ineffective<00:05:49.199> tissue<00:05:49.440> perfusion<00:05:49.849> you

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
example ineffective tissue perfusion you

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.790 
example ineffective tissue perfusion you
have<00:05:51.000> to<00:05:51.180> specify<00:05:51.750> which<00:05:51.810> one<00:05:52.320> you're<00:05:52.560> using

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
have to specify which one you're using

renal<00:05:56.820> things<00:05:57.120> like<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:57.570> so<00:05:57.870> let's<00:05:58.080> focus<00:05:58.229> on

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
renal things like that so let's focus on

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.899 
renal things like that so let's focus on

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
okay how about decreased capillary

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.960 
okay how about decreased capillary
refill<00:06:18.979> cool<00:06:19.979> extremities

that<00:06:26.789> would<00:06:26.909> be<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.120> appropriate<00:06:27.210> word

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
that would be the appropriate word
