00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.210
 is to keep standing up he fell discovered 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.900
 that skating was not as easy as 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.900
 I imagined 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.349
 [Music] 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.680
 take until you get the hang of it

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.789
 very proud of you for trying 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.549
 try it again I was sick of 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.280
 fall again and again but I felt like 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.870
 to go back to try his dad 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.470
 he wants to turn accompanying 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.680
