win ratio is a point seven seven so we

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.220 
win ratio is a point seven seven so we

hours straight with a full lobby of mgc
members<00:03:52.199> and<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.560> was<00:03:52.680> pretty<00:03:52.889> awesome<00:03:53.180> um

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
members and that was pretty awesome um

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.059 
members and that was pretty awesome um
yeah<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.169> can't<00:03:55.410> wait<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.769> next<00:03:55.889> one

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
yeah so I can't wait for the next one

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.349 
yeah so I can't wait for the next one
hopefully<00:03:56.250> we<00:03:56.519> can<00:03:56.609> get<00:03:56.669> some<00:03:56.730> big<00:03:57.030> unlocks

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
hopefully we can get some big unlocks

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.550 
hopefully we can get some big unlocks
it's<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.079> get<00:03:58.139> a<00:03:58.199> little<00:03:58.379> bit<00:03:58.470> more

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
it's going to get a little bit more

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.129 
it's going to get a little bit more
difficult<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:59.250> think<00:03:59.280> simply<00:03:59.879> because<00:04:00.239> we're

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
difficult I think simply because we're

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.839 
difficult I think simply because we're
going<00:04:01.349> we<00:04:01.500> went<00:04:01.680> right<00:04:02.069> up<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.400> division

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
going we went right up in the division

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.240 
going we went right up in the division
so<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:04.019> next<00:04:04.199> clan<00:04:04.440> wars<00:04:04.680> might<00:04:04.889> be<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> little

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
so the next clan wars might be a little

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.770 
so the next clan wars might be a little
bit<00:04:05.430> more<00:04:05.549> difficult<00:04:05.699> than<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.209> because

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
bit more difficult than this because

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.710 
bit more difficult than this because
bronze<00:04:07.440> was<00:04:07.709> actually<00:04:08.040> really<00:04:08.250> easy<00:04:08.340> um<00:04:08.910> but

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
bronze was actually really easy um but

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.449 
bronze was actually really easy um but
yeah<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.109> is<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.530> clan<00:04:10.980> members<00:04:11.310> we're

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
yeah this is the clan members we're

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.280 
yeah this is the clan members we're
about<00:04:11.549> halfway<00:04:11.790> through<00:04:12.180> them<00:04:12.359> so<00:04:12.900> shout<00:04:13.169> out
