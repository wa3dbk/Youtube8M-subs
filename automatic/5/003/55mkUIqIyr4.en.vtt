composition that's been working really
well<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.370> me<00:01:02.489> lately<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.909> base

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
well for me lately and this base

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
well for me lately and this base
actually<00:01:06.479> has<00:01:06.689> some<00:01:07.260> pretty<00:01:07.439> good<00:01:07.650> defenses

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
actually has some pretty good defenses

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.390 
actually has some pretty good defenses
the<00:01:08.820> cannons<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.390> level<00:01:09.720> seven<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:11.280> air

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the cannons are all level seven the air

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.429 
the cannons are all level seven the air
defense<00:01:11.760> was<00:01:12.030> outside<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> walls<00:01:12.810> which<00:01:13.080> was

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
defense was outside the walls which was

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.090 
defense was outside the walls which was
stupid<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.420> thing<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.040> should<00:01:17.040> be

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
stupid it's the one thing that should be

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
stupid it's the one thing that should be
in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> walls<00:01:18.140> especially<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> healer

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
in the walls especially with a healer

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.050 
in the walls especially with a healer
attack<00:01:19.860> coming<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
attack coming at you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.120 
attack coming at you
but<00:01:21.600> his<00:01:21.720> mortars<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.290> pretty<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:22.650> upgraded

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
but his mortars are pretty well upgraded

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.060 
but his mortars are pretty well upgraded
to<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> believe<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.850> those<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.409> three<00:01:25.409> level

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to I believe that those are three level

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580 
to I believe that those are three level
three<00:01:26.100> maybe<00:01:26.460> level<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:27.000> his<00:01:27.930> Archer<00:01:28.229> towers

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
three maybe level for his Archer towers

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.569 
three maybe level for his Archer towers
are<00:01:28.860> level<00:01:29.700> seven<00:01:31.009> because<00:01:32.009> wizard<00:01:32.280> towers

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
are level seven because wizard towers

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.520 
are level seven because wizard towers
aren't<00:01:32.810> upgraded<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> well<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.350> those

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
aren't upgraded to well I think those

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.160 
aren't upgraded to well I think those
might<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.829> only<00:01:34.950> level<00:01:35.220> two<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:36.960> any<00:01:37.079> rate

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
might be only level two but at any rate

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.679 
might be only level two but at any rate
so<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> dropped<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.340> wall<00:01:38.880> breakers<00:01:39.180> down<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
so I dropped my wall breakers down and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230 
so I dropped my wall breakers down and
my<00:01:40.500> giant<00:01:40.740> split<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.850> okay<00:01:42.060> because

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
my giant split up but it's okay because

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.730 
my giant split up but it's okay because
both<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> healers<00:01:43.049> stayed<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> bigger

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
both the healers stayed with the bigger

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100 
both the healers stayed with the bigger
pack<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> they're<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.570> working<00:01:45.810> their<00:01:45.960> way

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
pack so they're just working their way

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.069 
pack so they're just working their way
around<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:46.649> now<00:01:47.540> dropping<00:01:48.540> some<00:01:48.780> archers

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
around right now dropping some archers

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.889 
around right now dropping some archers
around<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.850> barriers<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.180> pick<00:01:51.479> off<00:01:51.630> some<00:01:51.869> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
around the barriers to pick off some of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.830 
around the barriers to pick off some of
the<00:01:52.110> other<00:01:52.290> small<00:01:52.680> buildings<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.540> my<00:01:54.540> darts

the other small buildings and my darts

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.120 
the other small buildings and my darts

right now
I<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:07.459> researched<00:02:08.459> my<00:02:08.759> Giants<00:02:09.209> up

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.559 
I actually just researched my Giants up
to<00:02:09.629> level<00:02:09.929> 4<00:02:10.229> after<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.400> attack<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
to level 4 after this attack so

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.000 
to level 4 after this attack so
I'm<00:02:12.629> gonna<00:02:12.810> post<00:02:13.109> another<00:02:13.290> video<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.799> that

I'm gonna post another video of that

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.599 
I'm gonna post another video of that
later<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.760> them<00:02:14.909> at<00:02:15.030> level<00:02:15.299> 4<00:02:16.249> but<00:02:17.249> at<00:02:17.400> any

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
later on with them at level 4 but at any

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.520 
later on with them at level 4 but at any
rate<00:02:17.670> all<00:02:17.999> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.420> defenses<00:02:18.989> are<00:02:19.109> down<00:02:19.260> with

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
rate all of the defenses are down with

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.789 
rate all of the defenses are down with
40<00:02:19.829> seconds<00:02:20.219> left<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.579> go<00:02:20.609> and<00:02:21.379> drop<00:02:22.379> down<00:02:22.530> all

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
40 seconds left to go and drop down all

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.699 
40 seconds left to go and drop down all

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
of my Cobbins they're taking off they're

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.530 
of my Cobbins they're taking off they're
taking<00:02:26.129> everything<00:02:26.340> out<00:02:26.609> outside<00:02:27.359> of<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
taking everything out outside of the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.300 
taking everything out outside of the
walls<00:02:27.719> and<00:02:27.930> then<00:02:28.109> these<00:02:28.560> guys<00:02:28.739> are<00:02:28.920> working<00:02:29.189> on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
walls and then these guys are working on

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.750 
walls and then these guys are working on
it<00:02:29.430> up<00:02:29.549> here<00:02:29.760> once<00:02:30.030> they<00:02:30.209> break<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.659> then

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
it up here once they break in then

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.629 
it up here once they break in then
they'll<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:32.879> going<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:34.349> only<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.709> 25

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
they'll get going but we only have 25

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.610 
they'll get going but we only have 25
seconds<00:02:36.060> left<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.659> break<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.109> and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
seconds left but they break in and

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.890 
seconds left but they break in and
everything's<00:02:38.400> gonna<00:02:38.609> be<00:02:38.790> gone<00:02:38.969> with<00:02:39.299> how

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
everything's gonna be gone with how

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.819 
everything's gonna be gone with how
quickly<00:02:40.230> they<00:02:40.530> destroy<00:02:42.409> resource<00:02:43.409> buildings

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
quickly they destroy resource buildings

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.530 
quickly they destroy resource buildings
so<00:02:44.639> yeah

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
so yeah

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.089 
so yeah
let's<00:02:45.900> fast<00:02:46.139> forward<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.439> little<00:02:46.500> bit<00:02:46.709> through

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
let's fast forward a little bit through

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.949 
let's fast forward a little bit through
the<00:02:47.280> end<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.239> there<00:02:48.629> they<00:02:48.719> go

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
the end of this and there they go

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.479 
the end of this and there they go
and<00:02:50.629> that's<00:02:51.629> 100<00:02:51.959> percent<00:02:52.199> so<00:02:52.829> that's<00:02:52.980> another

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
and that's 100 percent so that's another

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.979 
and that's 100 percent so that's another
successful<00:02:54.590> attack<00:02:55.590> with<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.359> mass<00:02:57.359> giant

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
successful attack with the mass giant

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.589 
successful attack with the mass giant
and<00:02:58.199> healer<00:02:58.879> it's<00:02:59.879> working<00:03:00.150> really<00:03:00.329> well<00:03:00.449> for

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
and healer it's working really well for

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.080 
and healer it's working really well for
me<00:03:00.930> no<00:03:01.769> reason<00:03:02.159> to<00:03:02.340> change<00:03:02.639> it<00:03:02.849> if<00:03:02.969> it's

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
me no reason to change it if it's

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.809 
me no reason to change it if it's
working<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:03.659> yeah<00:03:04.069> let's<00:03:05.069> go<00:03:05.219> into<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.609> other

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
attack it's almost the same composition

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.289

let's<00:03:23.819> watch<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:24.449> real<00:03:24.629> quick<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:26.400> this

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
let's watch this one real quick so this

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.399 
let's watch this one real quick so this
is<00:03:26.819> another<00:03:27.030> one<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.389> those<00:03:27.449> bases<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.109> works

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
is another one of those bases it works

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.360 
is another one of those bases it works
really<00:03:28.739> well<00:03:28.889> with<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:30.889> with<00:03:31.889> this<00:03:32.040> army

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
really well with this with this army

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.800 
really well with this with this army
composition<00:03:32.669> because<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.269> only<00:03:33.359> has<00:03:33.599> two

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
composition because it only has two

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.839 
composition because it only has two
compartments<00:03:34.229> once<00:03:35.159> you<00:03:35.280> break<00:03:35.459> into<00:03:35.669> these

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
compartments once you break into these

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.520 
compartments once you break into these
initial<00:03:36.269> walls<00:03:36.479> you've<00:03:36.750> nothing<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.259> worry

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
initial walls you've nothing to worry

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.809 
initial walls you've nothing to worry
about<00:03:37.650> your<00:03:37.919> Giants<00:03:38.250> are<00:03:38.340> just<00:03:38.459> gonna<00:03:38.609> make<00:03:38.759> a

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
about your Giants are just gonna make a

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.830 
about your Giants are just gonna make a
lap<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:41.609> mean<00:03:41.819> if<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.180> find<00:03:42.449> a<00:03:42.509> base<00:03:42.629> like

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
lap and I mean if you find a base like

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.569 
lap and I mean if you find a base like
this<00:03:42.870> with<00:03:43.169> this<00:03:43.259> composition<00:03:43.590> attack<00:03:44.400> it

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
this with this composition attack it

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.689 
this with this composition attack it
because<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.150> works<00:03:45.329> really<00:03:45.569> well<00:03:46.430> I'll<00:03:47.430> fast

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
because it works really well I'll fast

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.659 
because it works really well I'll fast
forward<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:49.439> can<00:03:49.470> see<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.040> some<00:03:50.549> of<00:03:50.609> my

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
forward and you can see that some of my

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.280 
forward and you can see that some of my
Giants<00:03:51.000> break<00:03:51.180> into<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.479> middle<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.930> then

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
Giants break into the middle and then

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.229 
Giants break into the middle and then
all<00:03:52.919> of<00:03:52.979> them<00:03:53.250> come<00:03:53.489> back<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.849> go<00:03:53.939> into<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
all of them come back and go into the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.390 
all of them come back and go into the
middle<00:03:54.509> and<00:03:57.229> yeah<00:03:58.229> so<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.709> isn't<00:03:58.949> really<00:03:59.129> too

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
middle and yeah so that isn't really too

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.979 
middle and yeah so that isn't really too
big<00:03:59.609> of<00:03:59.729> a<00:03:59.790> problem<00:04:00.209> because<00:04:00.359> it's<00:04:00.629> taking<00:04:00.870> out

minute left

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.350

there<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.830> go<00:04:40.040> and<00:04:40.460> then<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:40.940> dropped<00:04:41.210> my

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
there to go and then I dropped my

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.180 
there to go and then I dropped my
goblins<00:04:41.990> they<00:04:42.230> break<00:04:42.470> in<00:04:42.680> down<00:04:42.830> here<00:04:42.980> in<00:04:43.130> the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
goblins they break in down here in the

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.760 
goblins they break in down here in the
corner<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:44.510> they<00:04:44.990> just<00:04:45.170> start<00:04:45.380> working<00:04:45.650> their

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
corner and they just start working their

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.460 
corner and they just start working their
way<00:04:45.800> around<00:04:46.630> almost<00:04:47.630> all<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.990> defenses<00:04:48.440> are

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
way around almost all the defenses are

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.590 
way around almost all the defenses are
down<00:04:48.680> except<00:04:49.160> for<00:04:49.370> this<00:04:49.730> Archer<00:04:50.150> tower<00:04:50.330> over

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
down except for this Archer tower over

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.090 
down except for this Archer tower over
here<00:04:50.720> in<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.900> top<00:04:51.080> corner<00:04:51.110> which<00:04:51.710> as<00:04:51.920> you<00:04:52.040> can

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
here in the top corner which as you can

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.410 
here in the top corner which as you can
see<00:04:52.310> both<00:04:52.550> sets<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.940> Giants<00:04:53.300> are<00:04:53.390> coming

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
see both sets the Giants are coming

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.290 
see both sets the Giants are coming
before<00:04:53.720> he's<00:04:54.440> gonna<00:04:54.680> be<00:04:54.830> down<00:04:54.980> in<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.220> second

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
before he's gonna be down in a second

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.500 
before he's gonna be down in a second
so<00:04:56.780> we<00:04:56.870> got<00:04:56.990> 30<00:04:57.170> seconds<00:04:57.590> left<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.480> only<00:04:59.480> a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
so we got 30 seconds left and only a

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.050 
so we got 30 seconds left and only a
couple<00:04:59.750> more<00:04:59.930> resources<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.650> deal<00:05:00.800> with<00:05:01.060> and

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
couple more resources to deal with and

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.840 
couple more resources to deal with and
I'm<00:05:02.360> not<00:05:02.510> sure<00:05:02.660> if<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:02.870> remember<00:05:02.960> getting<00:05:03.850> three

they<00:05:06.860> get<00:05:06.980> through

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
they get through

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.860

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.870 

let's<00:05:15.560> go<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.890> do<00:05:15.980> the<00:05:16.070> attack<00:05:16.340> log<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.730> check

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
let's go and do the attack log and check

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.240 
let's go and do the attack log and check
on<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.360> see<00:05:17.600> if<00:05:17.810> we<00:05:18.380> got<00:05:18.530> three<00:05:18.770> stars<00:05:18.980> or

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
on that and see if we got three stars or

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.200 
on that and see if we got three stars or
not<00:05:21.160> so<00:05:22.160> yeah<00:05:22.310> we<00:05:22.430> three<00:05:22.640> start<00:05:22.880> at<00:05:23.000> both<00:05:23.180> of

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
not so yeah we three start at both of

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.260 
not so yeah we three start at both of
those<00:05:23.450> for<00:05:23.720> two<00:05:23.900> really<00:05:24.680> good<00:05:24.800> attacks<00:05:25.270> with
