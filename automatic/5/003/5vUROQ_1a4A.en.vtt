00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
don't go past that line that we drew so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.840 
don't go past that line that we drew so
you<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> clean<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.350> polished<00:00:43.980> book

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.610 

now<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.180> line<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.690> paper<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.230> press

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
now you can line up your paper and press

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
now you can line up your paper and press
it<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.579> also<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.000> flatten<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it on and then I also just flatten it

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630 
it on and then I also just flatten it
out<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> ruler<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.800> rid<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.160> any<00:00:53.370> air

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
out with a ruler to get rid of any air

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.560 
out with a ruler to get rid of any air
bubbles<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.760> shouldn't<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.120> long<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
bubbles so this shouldn't take long to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
bubbles so this shouldn't take long to
dry<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:57.960> while<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.350> drying<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.550> plan

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
dry but while it's drying you can plan

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.369 
dry but while it's drying you can plan
out<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> letter<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.260> on

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
out the letter that you want to go on

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
out the letter that you want to go on
the<00:01:01.500> front<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.250> trace<00:01:02.489> around<00:01:02.520> your<00:01:02.940> book

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the front so just trace around your book

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.179 
the front so just trace around your book
on<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> scrap<00:01:03.750> piece<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> paper<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:04.979> draw

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
on a scrap piece of paper and then draw

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:19.200 
on a scrap piece of paper and then draw
in<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.430> letter<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.880> cut<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> out

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.370 

now<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.270> can<00:01:20.480> make<00:01:20.630> sure<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.960> fits<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.320> looks

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
now you can make sure it fits and looks

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.350 
now you can make sure it fits and looks
exactly<00:01:22.040> how<00:01:22.190> you<00:01:22.250> want<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.760> and<00:01:22.910> then<00:01:22.970> trace

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
exactly how you want it and then trace

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.469 
exactly how you want it and then trace
around<00:01:23.510> it<00:01:23.780> with<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.080> pencil

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.640 

now<00:01:32.479> comes<00:01:32.690> accounting<00:01:33.020> parts<00:01:33.260> all<00:01:33.409> you<00:01:33.560> have

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
now comes accounting parts all you have

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.350 
now comes accounting parts all you have
to<00:01:33.770> do<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.040> just<00:01:34.220> go<00:01:34.370> along<00:01:34.670> view<00:01:34.909> lines<00:01:35.120> that

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
to do is just go along view lines that

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.240 
to do is just go along view lines that
you<00:01:35.450> drew<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:36.260> they're<00:01:36.409> exactly<00:01:36.560> nice<00:01:36.979> and

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
you drew so if they're exactly nice and

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.890 
you drew so if they're exactly nice and
that<00:01:37.610> is<00:01:37.970> pretty<00:01:38.210> much<00:01:38.420> it

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
that is pretty much it

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.300 
that is pretty much it
you<00:01:39.080> will<00:01:39.200> need<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.440> go<00:01:39.560> over<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.920> few<00:01:40.100> times

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
you will need to go over it a few times

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.370 
you will need to go over it a few times
for<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.820> fully<00:01:41.000> break<00:01:41.360> through<00:01:41.690> but

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
for it to fully break through but

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.660 
for it to fully break through but
another<00:01:42.680> thing<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.070> found<00:01:43.400> is<00:01:43.550> that

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
another thing that I found is that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.250 
another thing that I found is that
scissors<00:01:44.119> actually<00:01:44.510> worked<00:01:44.659> pretty<00:01:44.840> well<00:01:45.050> for

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
scissors actually worked pretty well for

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.380 
scissors actually worked pretty well for
this<00:01:45.410> too<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:46.009> just<00:01:46.250> try<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.820> out<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.150> see<00:01:47.300> what

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
this too so just try it out and see what

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.440 
this too so just try it out and see what
works<00:01:47.600> best<00:01:47.690> for<00:01:47.900> you<00:01:49.000> once<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.119> get<00:01:50.240> through

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
works best for you once you get through

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.090
