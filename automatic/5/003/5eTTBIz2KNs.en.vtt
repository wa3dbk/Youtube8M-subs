00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.610 
plans to expand we want to expand the
airport<00:04:30.449> because<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:31.020> airport's<00:04:31.320> going<00:04:31.530> to

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620

grow<00:04:31.830> from<00:04:32.160> around<00:04:32.699> 15<00:04:33.060> million<00:04:33.330> passengers

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
grow from around 15 million passengers

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.010 
grow from around 15 million passengers
today<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.800> around<00:04:35.580> 30<00:04:35.910> million<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:36.510> 10<00:04:36.840> years

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.629 
today to around 30 million in 10 years
time<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:37.530> we<00:04:37.620> want<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.860> double<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.190> size<00:04:38.460> of

time so we want to double the size of

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.610 
time so we want to double the size of
our<00:04:38.729> business<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.720> handle<00:04:40.169> at<00:04:40.260> increased

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620

our business and to handle at increased
traffic<00:04:40.860> we<00:04:41.190> want<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.430> develop<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.820> second

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
traffic we want to develop a second

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.060 
traffic we want to develop a second
runway<00:04:42.389> and<00:04:42.990> obviously<00:04:43.380> our<00:04:43.530> neighbors<00:04:43.889> are

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070

runway and obviously our neighbors are
concerned<00:04:44.490> about<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:45.090> impact<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:45.510> runway

will have in terms of noise and no
flying<00:04:48.180> paths<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:49.530> we<00:04:49.889> have<00:04:50.160> developed<00:04:50.639> a

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850
