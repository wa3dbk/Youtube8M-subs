00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
and a 2 liter first step is going to be

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.570 
and a 2 liter first step is going to be
to<00:00:12.900> take<00:00:13.080> off<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.380> splash<00:00:13.650> shield<00:00:13.950> which<00:00:14.250> goes

to take off the splash shield which goes

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.010 
to take off the splash shield which goes
here<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:14.969> ought<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.089> remove<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.839> save

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
here we ought to remove this one to save

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.330 
here we ought to remove this one to save
a<00:00:16.080> little<00:00:16.260> bit<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.440> time<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.160> bunch

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
a little bit of time it's just a bunch

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
off then you get our aluminum one it has

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.499 
off then you get our aluminum one it has
a<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:25.350> key<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> pulley<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
a little key way here on the pulley just

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
a little key way here on the pulley just
match<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.280> your<00:01:29.280> crank
