00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.380
 we will do our battery of tests 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.869
 test them all we will put them 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.429
 in the head we're going to make a swell 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.599
 and they have interest in making the flame 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.500
 otherwise they go to fire 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.099
 all this beautiful little hardware store 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.719
 and light fire 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.719
 it left my Kiki 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.270
 but gentlemen drum roll 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.970
 drumbeats for Mr. beer 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.070
 grill bear and pierstone grill good then 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.900
 we are really in the tool there 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 see that the guy he leaned on 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.360
 he thought about his mess and told us 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.940
 pulled out something really is not bad of the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.590
 everything but we have a tool 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.720
 commercial that must be quickly released 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.290
 and as always I like 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.420
 to customize here there is little risk 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.690
 nice little scraper I would have done well 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.229
 a little small the image if you see this 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.660
 that I mean 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.979
 and I would have church and that part there 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.649
 to make me a little knife side and 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.570
 a small side scraper for the fire we have 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.680
 a boat is still a lot more 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.890
 small than average 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.770
 there we are the same diameter but when 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.500
 we look at the length we are really 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.330
 smaller if you take my pet 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.149
 we are really on a diameter more 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.640
 small but it's the same on the on the 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.649
 scraper one is much shorter 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.490
 but we are on a tool 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.979
 versatile we have a whistle here so 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.729
 here we can be good help 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.979
 has it as you see the signals there 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.229
 we have walrus 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.479
 everyone remembers well three 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.570
 small strokes three long necks three 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.080
 little sos shots so we're on a 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.390
 well thought out tool that eventually 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.790
 for the urban can serve us as cube 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:15.320
 as much as I tried to get to the 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:17.970
 get in and that to knock 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.910
 someone was hitting the temple 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.780
 on the front it can be good for 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.100
 help him clear him 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.600
 you have it in your hand it will not go 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.100
 it serves there it misses a little bit 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.310
 but that each of customization it 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.570
 will put his little touch the rope is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.810
 long enough it can be adjusted 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.019
 I like it or not bad but we could have 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.400
 put a little compass here the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.430
 compass wool found in 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.880
 bcb there we could have put it there was 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.980
 not bad 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.030
 or so inside finally I do not know 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.390
 but we could have managed to 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.910
 to have something nice 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.190
 we have a little a little trick that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.319
 is not bad at all so which consists of 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.910
 limay here to make a small side 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.410
 sharp 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.300
 I like it because it can help 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.260
 to carve small branches one can 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.330
 cut rope 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.800
 finally on something a tool a 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.110
 tool is a tool not bad me that 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.540
 I like it is not bad good go 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.830
 truce of tramp blabla of comedy blabla 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.420
 dany boon does not remove oxidation and 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.130
 gives a little cotton holds rare with a 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.220
 old cotton what that gives because 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.310
 that's what's important too 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.390
 the flins side send there too we have 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.980
 still a good rope 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.080
 we have a nice dimension of strings for 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.019
 go there like that if there are followers 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.100
 1.2 fire starter so I 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.800
 find that like that I 'm a big 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:44.530
 lazy so we put it on we scratch it 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.190

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.880
 Bravo I have nothing else to say 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:58.420

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.950
 pressure beautiful little rope should not be 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.519
 to miss it must fit them well in 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.260
