00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.390
 Talk to me, beauty, I decided to do this. 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.090
 small video here to demonstrate 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.940
 You some impressions that I found 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.009
 now from the pop blog as you have realized 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.630
 I did the president this morning and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.240
 I posted it for guys 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 and then anyone who has doubts just go there 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.359
 site of your buoy download room polonaise 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 install this video I'm recording 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.220
 with that programinha that what he me 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.790
 wake up and do not have to have a lot of people 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.059
 natively records even with sound with 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:43.520
 Can you understand the audio? 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.520
 come on then the current version here is 501 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.690
 no ibope 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.100
 my will is the Polish people 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.850
 Speak that you can not do more 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.140
 Personal obvious route because it was not 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 released by brazil 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.379
 We have to go there on this site. 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:06.090
 mobile download a kit from poland 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.570
 if I'm not mistaken, ló x ass ee aí 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 You'll be able to upgrade after 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.740
 download the route check the manual update 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.490
 there on the same tone device in the package comes 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.909
 in configuration check here and there you 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 They will receive notification that 50 is 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.280
 available, just download it here 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.479
 nothing will appear that I have already updated 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.130
 so it's already running at 50 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.770
 I found the cobain interface way 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.049
 It looks good, baby. 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.670
 these effects of the window here and according to 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.659
 The color of the boy was also good. 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.540
 way to view here for days 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.329
 also it is just drag the finger that does not 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.260
 need to click here over edson 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.640
 poison 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.860
 just drag if you can walk there 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.260
 by cellular functions 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.960
 I do not like this one much more than not 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.350
 I prefer to see it on the list, I think it's much more 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.350
 next 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.550
 the way in which all logs 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.730
 the interface is then until the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.530
 owns samsung with best with 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.040
 this appearance and took that part 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.300
 It's good that you realize that 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.340
 still has the remnants of the old x date 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.220
 in these those mysterious and 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.670
 half-grassi here changes 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:44.730
 It seems to even prevent the Android 2.3 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:50.340
 is in the same thing but internally if 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.200
 you will notice enough difference is the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.440
 mini keyboard also from Samsung was well 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:01.140
 cool I found this really cool part 5 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.950
 It was clearer she was not in Nisa anymore. 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.990
 the screen becomes more pleasant 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.430
 - ours has not changed at all because actually 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:15.600
 already had a menu already with already pulling a 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:20.790
 tokyo by 48 votes since the owner of 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.720
 facebook qat ram consumption 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.750
 I did not see difference is very high initial 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.019
 has open but if you start the phone 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.019
 only that will stay at least with 1.6 gdi 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.830
 use and so the program is running on 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.850
 second plan 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:43.320
 going back to memory, it does not 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:46.370
 none I saw in the abce forum here 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.040
 also a timbu on the calculator 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.459
 I really did not see any magné know 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.459
 right 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.370
 all the screens are pulling there pro 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.950
 that part is not right 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:09.040
 the good is really cool until the aquino scheme 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.780
 in the shine it will not give you see more 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.400
 when I pull that the brightness shows a 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.770
 screen preview 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.769
 As you can see the Indians do not 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.290
 screen itself reflects the image on the screen 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.270
 but the difference but then they do the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.520
 test when you do so you can 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.610
 visualize that before it goes 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.930
 I used the screen here in the automatic 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.419
 that in the middle 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.860
 just that I'm not with the lollipop 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.240
 brightness but is much more intense 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.070
 so I even decrease because it gets too 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:46.930
 strong I am using negative with two or 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:50.010
 one even with less money gets more 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:55.020
 nice as well as helping is also because 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:57.310
 the battery consumes less here there are 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.160
 I do not think anything has changed 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.590
 It's all the same, it 's bigger. 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.710
 because not a kit wants that minor was 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.710
 smaller and more 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.240
 everything pulling by the method is pretty cool 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.689
 besides music it was also very cool 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:31.599
 did see that the menu he died accordingly 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:36.279
 with the screen and find themselves changed in a 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:39.159
 new anyone who wants to update does not 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:43.090
 I wanted to wait for brazilian street to arrive is only 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:44.949

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.749

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.900

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.710
 released by samsung 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.169
 this tank 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.870
 the poll does not have the last one's 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.240
 Argentina 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:05.290
 it is the value of the paper yesterday 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.260

 1 Poland here Poland 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:18.250
 I spent more than the operator between 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.410
 relatives but only look for 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.500
 Poland but nothing at all or else look 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.540
 internet will even lower the day 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.910
 over the same street as 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.860
 otherwise you will lose no data and have no 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.290
 warranty problems or anything because 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:36.540
 it's not official 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:39.070
 and then back and forth on your phone in the 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:42.090
 application to check update 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:45.700
 and there you will receive the version message 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.320
 to download almost 1 GB of download and 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.600
 update your mobile 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.590

 dinho guys see that it is pop 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:59.200

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:01.930
 and in the group that was sucanagem para pla mas 

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.980
 it is a lot of slapstick people native to 

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:07.380
 beside this 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.380
 So it's a hug of peace.
