00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.699 
believe they revealed the heart edition
for<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.729> also<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:41.349> came<00:01:41.500> with<00:01:41.619> the

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
for it also and that came with the

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:43.830 
for it also and that came with the
wristband<00:01:42.130> season<00:01:42.729> pass<00:01:42.940> you<00:01:43.300> know<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.690> whole

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
wristband season pass you know the whole

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.490 
wristband season pass you know the whole
nine<00:01:44.080> yards<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.270> what<00:01:47.229> does<00:01:47.319> this<00:01:47.440> mean

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
nine yards and so what does this mean

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.830 
nine yards and so what does this mean
for<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.860> call<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.220> advanced<00:01:48.520> warfare<00:01:48.970> well<00:01:49.390> I

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
for a call to advanced warfare well I

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.600 
for a call to advanced warfare well I
would<00:01:50.590> predict<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.039> call<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.369> advanced

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
would predict that call to advanced

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.650 
would predict that call to advanced
warfare<00:01:52.060> would<00:01:52.209> actually<00:01:52.539> have<00:01:52.630> a

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
warfare would actually have a

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.540 
warfare would actually have a
multiplayer<00:01:53.289> reveal<00:01:53.440> just<00:01:53.860> as<00:01:54.069> ghosts<00:01:54.369> i

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
multiplayer reveal just as ghosts i

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
abilities for the exoskeleton suits like

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.699 
abilities for the exoskeleton suits like
there's<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.810> bunch<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.049> different<00:02:32.140> things<00:02:32.500> with

warfare what will it come with well i

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.119 
warfare what will it come with well i
would<00:02:49.959> say<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.349> maybe<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.739> prestige

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
would say that maybe the prestige

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.599 
would say that maybe the prestige
edition<00:02:51.159> could<00:02:51.849> come<00:02:52.060> with<00:02:52.889> possibly<00:02:53.889> the

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
edition could come with possibly the

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.009 
edition could come with possibly the
game<00:02:54.819> obviously<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.569> steelbook<00:02:55.959> case

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
game obviously in the steelbook case

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.679 
game obviously in the steelbook case
right<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.980> season<00:02:57.430> pass<00:02:57.609> you<00:02:58.030> know<00:02:58.150> fifty

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
right the season pass you know fifty

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.420 
right the season pass you know fifty
dollars<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:59.200> get<00:02:59.290> all<00:02:59.439> four<00:02:59.680> map<00:02:59.889> packs<00:03:00.159> or

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
dollars you get all four map packs or

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.280 
dollars you get all four map packs or
maybe<00:03:00.760> if<00:03:00.939> they<00:03:01.090> have<00:03:01.239> more<00:03:01.480> map<00:03:01.720> packs<00:03:02.019> this

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
maybe if they have more map packs this

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.500 
maybe if they have more map packs this
game<00:03:02.500> we<00:03:02.709> don't<00:03:02.859> know<00:03:03.010> yet<00:03:03.189> maybe<00:03:04.180> like<00:03:04.480> a

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
game we don't know yet maybe like a

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.039 
game we don't know yet maybe like a
special<00:03:05.079> map<00:03:05.349> or<00:03:05.620> something<00:03:05.769> like<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:07.049> you'd

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
as you guys knew that on the technical

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.909 
as you guys knew that on the technical
camera<00:03:13.450> with<00:03:13.569> call<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.780> duty<00:03:14.049> ghosts<00:03:14.439> that

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
camera with call of duty ghosts that

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.589 
camera with call of duty ghosts that

that boosted up the price like two

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.059 
that boosted up the price like two
hundred<00:03:18.790> dollars<00:03:19.329> maybe<00:03:19.989> we<00:03:20.650> could<00:03:20.829> get<00:03:20.919> an

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
hundred dollars maybe we could get an

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.459 
hundred dollars maybe we could get an
actual<00:03:21.329> kind<00:03:22.329> of<00:03:22.419> like<00:03:22.540> glove<00:03:22.959> not<00:03:23.139> an<00:03:23.290> actual

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
soup but a glove of the exoskeleton that

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.659 
soup but a glove of the exoskeleton that
would<00:03:26.439> have<00:03:26.560> liked<00:03:26.739> all<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:26.919> abilities<00:03:27.519> and

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
would have liked all the abilities and

would have liked all the abilities and
stuff<00:03:27.879> like<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.450> then<00:03:29.079> we<00:03:29.260> could

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
stuff like that and then we could

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.180 
stuff like that and then we could
actually<00:03:30.060> have<00:03:31.060> like<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.359> replica<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.199> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
actually have like a replica of the

actually have like a replica of the
glove<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.849> exoskeleton<00:03:34.629> on<00:03:34.750> our<00:03:34.900> hands<00:03:35.199> so

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
glove of the exoskeleton on our hands so

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.289 
glove of the exoskeleton on our hands so
we<00:03:35.440> would<00:03:35.680> actually<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:36.190> know<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.549> could<00:03:36.760> have

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
we would actually you know we could have

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.020 
we would actually you know we could have
like<00:03:37.510> all<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.139> UM<00:03:38.349> like<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.159> clamps<00:03:39.549> on<00:03:39.729> it<00:03:39.879> we

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
like all the UM like the clamps on it we

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.399 
like all the UM like the clamps on it we
can<00:03:40.060> have<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.389> same<00:03:40.659> like<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.109> would<00:03:41.199> be<00:03:41.229> the

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
can have the same like it would be the

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.099 
can have the same like it would be the
exact<00:03:41.769> design<00:03:41.979> of<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:43.090> exoskeleton<00:03:43.840> suits

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
exact design of the exoskeleton suits

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.780 
exact design of the exoskeleton suits
actually<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.799> physical<00:03:45.189> form<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.760> you

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
actually in a physical form that you

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.369 
actually in a physical form that you
could<00:03:46.060> have<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.419> or<00:03:46.510> maybe<00:03:46.629> come<00:03:46.989> with<00:03:47.109> one<00:03:47.260> or
