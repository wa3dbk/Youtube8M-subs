00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
I was you know a bit more tired than the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.340 
I was you know a bit more tired than the
second<00:01:20.490> set<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> third<00:01:21.180> set<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:22.200> of

second set and the third set and that of

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.010 
second set and the third set and that of
course<00:01:22.380> made<00:01:22.890> me<00:01:23.400> make<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.210> unforced<00:01:24.659> errors

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so yeah I think pretty much it deep down

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
so yeah I think pretty much it deep down
after<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.100> lost<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.520> heartbreaking<00:01:29.970> fiber

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
after you lost that heartbreaking fiber

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
after you lost that heartbreaking fiber
you<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.960> feeling<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.380> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.680> joke<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you have a feeling it's kind of joke a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.710 
you have a feeling it's kind of joke a
vision<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.509> was

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
vision that was it but that really was

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
vision that was it but that really was
that<00:01:33.750> ballgame<00:01:34.200> right<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.560> they're<00:01:34.950> not

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that ballgame right there they're not

that ballgame right there they're not
really<00:01:35.970> no<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.960> tiebreak

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
really no I don't think the tiebreak

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.260 
really no I don't think the tiebreak
would<00:01:37.590> change<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> match<00:01:38.280> even<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.970> wanted

wednesday that time did you think at any

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.670 
wednesday that time did you think at any
point<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.299> this<00:03:13.450> could<00:03:14.230> have<00:03:14.320> been<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.500> one

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
point that this could have been the one

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.460 
point that this could have been the one
where<00:03:14.859> he<00:03:14.920> pulled<00:03:15.160> out<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.549> take<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.120> sadly

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
where he pulled out and take that sadly

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.199

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
just wore me out and physical so I could

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.979
