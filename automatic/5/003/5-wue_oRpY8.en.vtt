00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.639
 Earthsea tales are based on a cycle 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.500
 books and I unfortunately read them but 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.480
 considering most of what i've been in a century 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 this movie I would have it 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.630
 starts with the ship and a handful of people 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.970
 staring dragons 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.769
 ok strong start but when news 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 reach the king he claims that 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.880
 the dragon they fight and it's a terrible thing 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.230
 he talks about how much weird 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 shit happens now for example 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.309
 wizards lose their balance power and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 hurls something back and forth 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.360
 bad something terrible and just before 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.100
 how to start thinking about what 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 make a king that looks very 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.629
 cool and interesting character I'm dying 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 thought he would be the main character he 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.260
 it looks so powerful and important but no 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 the child who killed him 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.000
 this is the main character and above all this 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 boyfriend his son he steals a sword runs away from 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.550
 the palace and the opening credits begin 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.129
 Holy shit, you need to start like this 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.079
 history millions of questions arise in 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.090
 my head is what we have for the main character 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.979
 why did he kill his father because his father 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.840
 looked pretty cool why 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.130
 dragons fight why it's bad and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.229
 what place do they occupy this world 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.610
 why is his son suddenly so 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.920
 calm yourself video about the same looks 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
 so afraid of wolves very much that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
 he is for everyone who killed his father a couple 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 seconds ago rhombus era de just 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.360
 burst my head every think that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 big fantasy you need to start 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.920
 grand battle of explosions and everything 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.500
 other things but really all great 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.180
 Penza starts with little stories they 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.040
 so do to tie us mainly 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.990
 the hero of which is usually the one who is weak and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.720
 afraid of much but still ready through 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.450
 a lot go through exactly what this one does 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.369
 the movie we find out that the main character is prince 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.470
 who runs away from justice meets 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 wizard timothy played dalton us 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.490
 I am convinced that he would be monotonous 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 like liam neeson if the character were not 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.939
 would be interesting just based on his 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.430
 the game I am ready to follow him where 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.590
 it pleases him strongly and rigorously and absolutely 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.450
 convinced about what he says he doesn't 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.329
 sounds like a man trying to sound 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.149
 cool he definitely sounds cool later 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.619
 they find a girl with a burn on her face she 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.180
 beyond social norms and 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.129
 naturally the prince does not want to leave 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.780
 her one but it also turns out that she 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.789
 adopted woman which is a friend 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.129
 wizard or 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.840
 magician if the dividers don't know yet let 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.310
 because the magician is slowly but surely not 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.599
 begin to unfold us and of course 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.790
 they find a lot in common 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.560
 start each other relationships but 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.840
 troubles begin when spiteful 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400
 magician by the name of a cop voiced by ulefone one 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.950
 of the few magicians who have not lost their 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.959
 magic wanted to use imbalance 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.530
 the universe to somehow become 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.900
 immortal and the magician tries to learn how by 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.180
 ways we learn secrets and magical powers 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.030
 and the truth about what our soul is like 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.980
 physical shells are capable 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.650
 the first two thirds of this film I was 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.450
 absolutely delighted many people 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.819
 they say that everything is as usual but I 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.650
 felt drawn into it i 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.829
 delayed because it is small 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.959
 the story preceding the great battle they 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.010
 can talk about how something big 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.439
 is coming 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.720
 big changes are coming and how all 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.970
 will die out just like in the game of thrones when 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.569
 you will learn how many big battles 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.489
 inside 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.620
 but they are all growing and 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.650
 character fortifications are not the same here 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.379
 a lot of strategy just here a lot 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.319
 waiting for the inevitable rock clap for example 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.659
 one of the most terrifying villains is willem 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.510
 defo in his game did nothing but 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.319
 like whispering your cues and it's just 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.870
 disturbing 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.349
 his voice seemed to creep into your ear 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.389
 this is so unpleasant when he says so 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.519
 and understand it very difficult in the sense of yes 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.680
 he is a bad guy but his face is always 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.959
 have a friendly smile you know which ones 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.340
 horrors he can do but he is so courteous and 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.349
 moves so softly 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.090
 you have no idea what he has 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.440
 head but he always has everything under 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.720
 control and this is one of the most 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.699
 frightening things in this villains nobody 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.440
 leave no matter how frightened I am 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.569
 and spoke while viewing the picture I was 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.030
 stoned for what it all goes 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.459
 the picture will be at the end what reward or 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.680
 prey heroes will get but when we 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.169
 reach the third act i was serious 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.720
 disappointed instead of a big battle or 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.909
 a pair of answers to questions or gathering army 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.250
 and speech really major here 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.319
 we get just a fight in little castles 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.599
 where is the hero with his sword and a couple 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.340
 spell cast just a battle 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.180
 with a big evil monster trying 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.150
 save the damsel in distress 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.070
 Well, a man well Th for joke when the film 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.110
 the battle of dragons was opening up big 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.690
 danger people shouted about the great 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.090
 imbalance pro gigantic advancing evil 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.610
 and that was gigantic evil coming 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.580
 I even had the impression that this 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.229
 only the first part of the story for example what 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.570
 this part is like a fraternity ring and we 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.250
 will come to something cool later but even in 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.259
 brotherhood ring they did great 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.090
 event at the junction having done so 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.160
 viewed by us is great 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.600
 value is ironic but my problem is with 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
 the brotherhood was that I didn't 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.259
 saw the simplicity of the inner 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.810
 the normal life of the heroes should have been 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.509
 stop but everything was in brotherhood 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.070
 a big weighty even a party at this 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.229
 same film exactly the opposite problem 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.449
 just so there is and it is very 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.729
 well done and here there is a foundation on 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.530
 where you can build a lot of things 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.199
 but in this film we have nothing 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.759
 line up the 3 ending look so 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.160
 she made and let down 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.410
 by the way mentioning and and i absolutely not 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.509
 understand the ending and giving us enough 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.599
 details here are interactions with 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:24.180
 dragon or something like him i just 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.580
 I do not understand this, she knows and does not look 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.800
 abstract and needing reasoning 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.020
 she looks like you should know 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.610
 something you here you just had to 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.190
 understand what happened and why it happened 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.680
 the film is not directed by hayao miodzaki 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.960
 by his son goro and for the first pictures this 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.820
 pretty impressive as i said i 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.860
 just adore the first two thirds of it 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.210
 the film probably played what I wanted 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.340
 see where this fantasy movie 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.229
 moving I thought it would be something 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.030
 like on the army where everything is simple and 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.770
 usually and then everything merges into one 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.080
 great cool picture 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.810
 instead everything feels like the last 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.370
 the level of the game Zelda know even the voice 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.870
 willema dafoe rolling down something 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.180
 resembling a green goblin 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.490
 spider-man but should i still not 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.409
 love the whole movie because of this i'm not so 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.389
 I think I still love most 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.370
 film if they make a remake or 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.840
 I probably will look at the sequel and hope 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.240
 there it will all end is really something 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.949
 great as i said i didn't read books 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.900
 and I don't know how close it is or 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.300
 far but if i look like that 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.860
 enjoyed this adventure and i just 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.380
 I didn’t enjoy what I ended up with 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.599
 the man who loves this type 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.689
 stories where it all starts small and 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.269
 gradually on 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:33.489
 and it is worth growing and growing for example I 

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:35.769
 one of the few people that loves 1 

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:36.669
 hobbit i feel i never understood 

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:38.949
 The Fellowship of the Ring 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.869
 so I don't think it's fantasy 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.819
 will devour any devil much 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:44.619
 will say it's just ok at best 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.349
 case but for me personally i can 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:48.909
 get lost in this world in his surroundings 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.709
 watching the characters all day yes 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.419
 I know that almost the entire review is a bit 

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:54.399
 subjective but i hope i gave you 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.509
 thoughts get interested in this give it 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:07:00.909
 chance and see what happens next 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.719
 mountain or hayal what's the difference miyazaki 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:03.550
 there are miyazaki 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:05.199
 God forgive me for these words shorter 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.209
