walk<00:02:38.140> into<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.920> while<00:02:39.459> you're<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.150> air

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
walk into it and while you're in the air

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.949 
walk into it and while you're in the air
fire<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.590> same<00:02:41.830> colored<00:02:42.160> portal<00:02:42.549> orange<00:02:43.299> to

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
fire the same colored portal orange to

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.350 
fire the same colored portal orange to
the<00:02:43.989> ground<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.850> takes<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.120> while<00:02:49.239> to

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
the ground like so it takes a while to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.940 
the ground like so it takes a while to
get<00:02:49.450> used<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.930> but<00:02:50.260> it's<00:02:50.590> not<00:02:50.830> very

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
get used to it but it's not very

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.000 
get used to it but it's not very
difficult<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:52.000> here<00:02:52.239> we<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.420> another<00:02:53.010> energy

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
difficult so here we have another energy

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.509

over<00:03:22.959> there<00:03:23.530> now<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.489> ng<00:03:25.030> ball<00:03:25.180> will<00:03:25.390> go

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
over there now the ng ball will go

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.560 
over there now the ng ball will go
through<00:03:25.930> these<00:03:26.109> portals<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:27.269> into<00:03:28.269> the

you can aim at the ground as you're
going<00:03:47.980> now<00:03:48.850> what<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.500> platforms<00:03:50.500> are

portals put one portal over there and

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.379 
portals put one portal over there and
one<00:04:00.970> here<00:04:01.329> works<00:04:01.569> where<00:04:02.079> it's<00:04:02.290> accessible

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
one here works where it's accessible

one here works where it's accessible
wait<00:04:04.389> for<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.660> platform<00:04:05.230> to

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
wait for a platform to

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.520 
wait for a platform to
combined<00:04:07.800> portal<00:04:09.180> walk<00:04:10.180> into<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.600> for<00:04:11.260> another

combined portal walk into it for another
portal<00:04:12.370> over<00:04:12.550> there<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:12.970> since<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:14.200> a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
portal over there and since this is a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.979 
portal over there and since this is a
beginner's<00:04:14.860> guide<00:04:14.890> will<00:04:15.370> do<00:04:15.520> it<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:16.450> slow<00:04:16.720> way

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
beginner's guide will do it the slow way

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.050 
beginner's guide will do it the slow way
and<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.910> easy<00:04:19.150> way<00:04:19.980> waits<00:04:20.980> for<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.519> platform

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
and the easy way waits for the platform

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.250 
and the easy way waits for the platform
to<00:04:22.630> come<00:04:22.840> back<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.860> beginning<00:04:24.660> walk<00:04:25.660> away

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
to come back to the beginning walk away

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.140 
to come back to the beginning walk away
from<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.860> again<00:04:27.400> wait<00:04:27.730> for<00:04:27.940> another

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
from it and again wait for another

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.560 
from it and again wait for another
platform<00:04:28.450> to<00:04:28.810> come<00:04:29.260> by<00:04:29.730> now<00:04:30.730> over<00:04:31.270> there<00:04:31.390> you

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
platform to come by now over there you

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.560 
platform to come by now over there you
see<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:32.050> ending<00:04:32.590> room<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.880> we'll<00:04:34.120> just<00:04:34.360> wait

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
see the ending room so we'll just wait

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.950 
see the ending room so we'll just wait
for<00:04:34.900> another<00:04:35.500> platform<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:36.100> come<00:04:36.340> by<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:39.960> here

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
for another platform to come by and here

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.980 
for another platform to come by and here
we<00:04:41.200> go<00:04:41.410> fire<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.400> portal<00:04:42.850> into<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.390> ending<00:04:43.840> room

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
we go fire a portal into the ending room

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.330 
we go fire a portal into the ending room
right<00:04:44.740> there<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.600> now<00:04:46.600> we'll<00:04:47.350> just<00:04:47.380> wait<00:04:48.010> to

right there and now we'll just wait to

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.030 
right there and now we'll just wait to
come<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.970> beginning<00:04:49.630> again<00:04:49.750> or<00:04:50.500> if<00:04:50.770> you're

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
come to the beginning again or if you're

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.130 
come to the beginning again or if you're
a<00:04:51.070> bit<00:04:51.280> impatient<00:04:51.610> just<00:04:52.090> put<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.720> pole<00:04:52.930> over

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
a bit impatient just put a pole over

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.909 
a bit impatient just put a pole over
there<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:54.570> walk<00:04:55.570> straight<00:04:56.020> into<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.500> ending

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
there and walk straight into the ending

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.390 
there and walk straight into the ending
room<00:04:58.980> now<00:04:59.980> then<00:05:00.220> this<00:05:01.150> is<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:02.100> corridor<00:05:03.100> from
