00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 You always wanted to know 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.250
 how to cast these spells in minecraft 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.870
 enchantment table can translate 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.370
 then stay tuned for that 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.370
 intro I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.770
 hello dear minecraft and sincerely 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.540
 welcome here too sad because the 07 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.400
 today to the magic spells in the 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.950
 relaxed table yes everyone knows them 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.960
 spells and those strange ones 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.120
 sign and these all come from one 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.970
 alphabet and the standard galactic 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.290
 alphabet finds a link to a picture 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.180
 her also in the video description 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.650
 and there you can find this alphabet 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.960
 partially translate 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.519
 word for word, eg I am you 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.379
 image are simply to talk 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.730
 sign here with the weird bend 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.340
 the straight line and then this one 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.750
 turn left to a , and so on 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.090
 and as you see, that's a whole 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.190
 alphabet and that's just this standard 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.870
 genetics alphabet this originally for 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.719
 the computer game commander keen 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.190
 developed and written and now for 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.710
 the relaxed table becomes one 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.289
 random arrangement of three to five 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.270
 used words and those words 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.060
 this predetermined and, first of all 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.880
 at elder scrolls for example or club 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.830
 consultant nico so that's all 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.330
 very hard to pronounce and see here 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.399
 her another list of all this 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.260
 Fed marked are the words from the 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.939
 now in a random arrangement 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.740
 always which ones are chosen and the us 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.900
 to be displayed in the relaxed table 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.390
 you already see a random arrangement 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.520
 So you can get out of this translation 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.799
 no conclusions on which draw 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.140
 enchantment at the end the item management 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.490
 lever has the minecraft version 1.8 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.020
 But then there is a change 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.119
 and you will always be the first 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.799
 Enchantment enchantment lever displayed 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.299
 So you can do it a bit 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.650
 sure what he gets now for 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.049
 an enchantment on that but swords 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.340
 That works through this translation 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.350
 as I said unfortunately not there is one 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.759
 random selection of actually almost 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.170
 meaningless words 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.689
 Nevertheless, I want you in this video 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.880
 we show these characters directly 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.979
 in unintelligible strings 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.020
 could translate and all that easy 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.700
 with a simple technical trick and 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.200
 it is indeed easy time windows key 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.340
 and rather on your keyboard then one 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.700
 you get into the field 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.650
 fill out and here you give percent from 1 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.930
 now you are in terms of minecraft and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.519
 now in the primeval forests folder here 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.280
 you all ever find minecraft 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.110
 through downloaded versions and 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.549
 now just look at which 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.650
 you want to do the whole thing in 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.500
 In that case, let me just choose 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.970
 times the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.680
 17.4 version and then we go there 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.190
 once inside and here we find now 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.019
 a 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.519
 We can open these for example 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.720
 with winrar or other free 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.580
 archiving program like 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.230
 for example siemens it and if we 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.230
 the open then sees the whole 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.470
 so go and now we go that's it 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.780
 folder in minecraft in texas and now 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.670
 easy in front because here we find 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.250
 now quite relevant files and indeed 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.010
 husky energy and ascii 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.420
 underlined it gap decided the us 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.040
 ski decided we can just 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.599
 let's open this is an image file we 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.360
 see nothing in it that's just that 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.700
 same as the sgs gap decided 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.280
 But now it's all in here 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.739
 fonts or all strings 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.170
 Once saved are the ascii png 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.349
 these are the writings we read 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.090
 and strings and the huskies kpmg 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.849
 these are these in the internet lever 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.989
 displayed files and now it should 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.549
 one or the other of you already 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.730
 to be clear what we have to do 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.560
 we just choose this the ascii 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.810
 png and just take them off 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.819
 the archive and call that quite simply 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.950
 Rename the top right click and 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.889
 then we hang on to it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.980
 and then it goes as well as the whole 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.510
 also listed here in the minecraft 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.310
 that is, and then we have the whole thing 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.600
 renamed is a new png image and 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.160
 Here we just delete in the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.760
 year with a simple click on the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.680
 remove button this png file and the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.340
 is gone now and now we push 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.489
 just this asti pmg with sg at the end 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.290
 over there in the minecraft there or just in 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.060
 Click this directory of minecraft 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.950
 ok and we have it here now 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.410
 again both files with the small one 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.079
 differed that there is virtually no us gsk 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.940
 file gives more but this all in 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.109
 this normal ascii file changed 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.519
 were seen when you decorate one 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.229
 shifts that are the little ones 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.370
 normal characters we now 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.650
 here and not anymore 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.060
 illegible from the domestic menu table 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.740
 now we close the whole and 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.419
 Just start minecraft while doing it 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.030
 of course you have to be careful that you 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.740
 now the version 1.7 point 4 or 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.510
 just choose the profile or the version 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.070
 chooses the whole one for each one 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.849
 Otherwise, the whole thing will not work 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.440
 function 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.289
 I just want to come here 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.379
 abbott advantage the release 1.7 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.119
 four out of clicks per case and on play 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.949
 and now I'm in one here 

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:46.839
 minecraft world with exactly this profile 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.460
 which video synonymous wanted to use 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.379
 and if I now just here 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.029
 stone stone then we would be the same 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.619
 experience mysterious things 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.089
 but before that the tip makes it 

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:56.889
 whole in any case in detail texture 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:58.539
 pack for the simple reason that we 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.979
 everything we put in this assets folder 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.599
 change this minecraft year 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.039
 even for stylish pack take over 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.719
 that would mean that in the texture pack 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.490
 whole does not work and now 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.469
 he comes to mysterious moments we lay down 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.300
 that makes it difficult and we see 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.889
 suddenly translations 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.479
 we see values â€‹â€‹here for us 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.879
 but no one is understandable 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.430
 to give true meaning to water inside 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.379
 There are quite a lot of sales awards here 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.209
 strange combination 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.949
 Nevertheless, we just do not know what 

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:25.809
 that means and we have too 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.339
 before that helps in this picture what 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.749
 I have just shown you translate 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:31.089
 but of course that's one way around 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:33.069
 some simpler variant the only one 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.360
 possibility is so for example a mod too 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.680
 we'll just use that here 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.539
 with the two levels and now we would have 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.069
 but I did not get any at breaking 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.229
 it's just not known yet 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.939
 just what we want here 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.409
 In any case, I hope that anyway 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:45.699
 Even if it did not please you 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.069
 is possible here now on the 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.469
 enchantment to draw conclusions though 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.699
 Nevertheless, have fun with these nice ones 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.409
 small function in any case 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.999
 should test and then I thank you 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.349
 me for spectators right berlin gives 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.699
 there are two other videos that 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.529
 are definitely interesting for you too 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.089
 Looks over there in any case 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:02.769
 otherwise there is always more information 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:04.659
 on twitter facebook google + instagram 

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:06.189
 differences of our website around 107 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:08.019
 points then I thank you 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:10.229
 final for watching bye and up 

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:10.229
 then
