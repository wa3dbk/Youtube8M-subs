distinctive style of playing and the
other<00:01:42.780> thing<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.649> three-part<00:01:44.549> harmonies

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
Graham Nash much like Neil Young's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160 
Graham Nash much like Neil Young's
guitar<00:01:49.979> playing<00:01:50.280> when<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.840> sing<00:01:51.840> together

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
guitar playing when they sing together

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.569 
guitar playing when they sing together
that<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:52.979> tell<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.310> they're

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that you can really tell that they're

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.550 
that you can really tell that they're
that's<00:01:53.939> them<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.439> else

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that's them and really no one else

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
that's them and really no one else
sounds<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.670> pretty<00:01:56.880> amazing

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
sounds like that it's pretty amazing

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.700 
sounds like that it's pretty amazing
when<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.450> realize<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.899> they<00:01:58.200> recorded<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
when you realize that they recorded that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.039 
when you realize that they recorded that
without<00:01:59.219> much<00:01:59.549> modulation<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> voice<00:02:00.750> or

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
without much modulation to the voice or

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.510 
without much modulation to the voice or
anything<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.159> pretty<00:02:02.399> much

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
anything like that it was pretty much

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.330 
anything like that it was pretty much
recorded<00:02:03.210> live<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.530> without<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.130> use<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
recorded live and without the use of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190 
recorded live and without the use of
auto-tune<00:02:05.850> or<00:02:06.240> anything<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.869> simply

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
auto-tune or anything like that simply

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.199 
auto-tune or anything like that simply
because<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.770> didn't<00:02:08.069> exist<00:02:08.369> at<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> time<00:02:08.759> I

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
