00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.919 

okay<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:02.389> finished<00:00:03.389> motor

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay this is the finished motor

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.430 
okay this is the finished motor
prototype<00:00:05.690> still<00:00:06.690> not<00:00:06.930> happy<00:00:07.200> with<00:00:07.290> that

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
prototype still not happy with that

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.990 
prototype still not happy with that
housing<00:00:07.859> I'll<00:00:07.980> probably<00:00:08.160> work<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> new<00:00:08.849> one

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
housing I'll probably work on a new one

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.120 
housing I'll probably work on a new one
it's<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.300> little<00:00:10.050> bit<00:00:10.200> larger<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.769> want<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.980> try

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
it's a little bit larger I want to try

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.709 
it's a little bit larger I want to try
and<00:00:11.280> shrink<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.670> down<00:00:11.730> by<00:00:12.059> probably<00:00:12.389> taking

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
and shrink that down by probably taking

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.110 
and shrink that down by probably taking
out<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> gearbox<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> drill<00:00:14.250> but<00:00:14.910> when<00:00:15.089> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
out the gearbox of the drill but when I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540 
out the gearbox of the drill but when I
get<00:00:15.210> there<00:00:15.630> basically<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.920> should<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> lots

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
get there basically it should be a lots

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.840 
get there basically it should be a lots
more

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
more

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
more
and<00:00:18.740> look<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:20.570> less<00:00:21.570> visually<00:00:22.140> impaired<00:00:22.410> so

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and look what less visually impaired so

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
and look what less visually impaired so
to<00:00:22.859> speak<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.939> know<00:00:23.970> mounting<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
to speak you know mounting it

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.370 
to speak you know mounting it
I've<00:00:25.320> actually<00:00:25.529> mounted<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.840> what<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:28.080> my

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
I've actually mounted it to what was my

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.820 
I've actually mounted it to what was my
homemade<00:00:29.099> rudder<00:00:29.460> set<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:29.970> near<00:00:30.560> no<00:00:31.560> time

there as well you know all that'll come

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290 
there as well you know all that'll come
out<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.200> right<00:00:43.350> amount<00:00:43.379> back<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
out the right amount back on and that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.619 
out the right amount back on and that
core<00:00:46.340> link<00:00:47.340> back<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.030> rudder<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
core link back up to my rudder and the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.830 
core link back up to my rudder and the
steering<00:00:49.440> cord<00:00:49.800> still

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
steering cord still

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.100 
steering cord still
and<00:00:51.140> I've<00:00:51.230> got<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.530> extend<00:00:51.860> these<00:00:52.010> out<00:00:52.250> up<00:00:52.730> here

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
and I've got to extend these out up here

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.260 
and I've got to extend these out up here
and<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.500> will<00:00:55.280> be<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.610> turning<00:00:55.820> from<00:00:56.120> a

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
and that will be the turning from a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.350 
and that will be the turning from a
motor<00:00:56.510> which<00:00:57.140> returns<00:00:57.590> quite<00:00:58.160> nicely<00:00:58.430> also

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
motor which returns quite nicely also

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.280 
motor which returns quite nicely also
that's<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.620> rudder<00:01:01.390> actual<00:01:02.390> tilt<00:01:02.690> cord<00:01:02.930> and

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
that's the rudder actual tilt cord and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.310 
that's the rudder actual tilt cord and
if<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.190> pull<00:01:04.460> on<00:01:04.580> that<00:01:04.990> it<00:01:05.990> will<00:01:06.200> actually

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
if you pull on that it will actually

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.289 
if you pull on that it will actually
tilt<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.340> motor<00:01:07.520> up<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:07.850> down<00:01:08.030> as<00:01:08.210> well

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
tilt the motor up and down as well

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.590 
tilt the motor up and down as well
once<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:11.079> get<00:01:11.259> that<00:01:11.320> all<00:01:11.829> set<00:01:12.430> up<00:01:12.579> it's<00:01:13.149> ready<00:01:13.509> to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
once I get that all set up it's ready to

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.780 
once I get that all set up it's ready to
go

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.700 

I've<00:01:16.090> actually<00:01:16.330> hooked<00:01:16.900> it<00:01:17.050> up<00:01:17.140> Meowth

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
I've actually hooked it up Meowth

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.440 
I've actually hooked it up Meowth
um

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
um

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.930 
um
waiting<00:01:21.140> for<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.380> water<00:01:21.620> run<00:01:21.890> on<00:01:22.010> it<00:01:22.159> and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
waiting for a water run on it and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.420 
waiting for a water run on it and
basically<00:01:23.500> from<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.740> cockpit<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.190> can

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
basically from the cockpit I can

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.640 
basically from the cockpit I can
actually<00:01:25.700> control<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:27.200> got<00:01:27.350> 12

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
actually control it and it's got 12

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.760 
actually control it and it's got 12
volts<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.010> it<00:01:28.190> now<00:01:28.370> that's<00:01:29.330> Shroud<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:30.110> made

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
volts to it now that's Shroud of made

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.859 
volts to it now that's Shroud of made
out<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.700> just<00:01:31.909> bits<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.240> pieces<00:01:32.479> laying

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
out of just bits and pieces laying

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.890 
out of just bits and pieces laying
around<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.830> pretty<00:01:34.310> sure<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:34.940> could<00:01:35.090> do<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.300> lot

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
around and pretty sure it could do a lot

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.450 
around and pretty sure it could do a lot
better<00:01:36.050> job<00:01:36.200> than<00:01:36.560> that<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:36.920> unfortunately

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
better job than that but unfortunately

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.490 
better job than that but unfortunately
what<00:01:37.700> I've<00:01:37.820> got<00:01:37.970> at<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.180> moment<00:01:38.570> that's<00:01:39.229> all<00:01:39.470> I

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
what I've got at the moment that's all I

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.120 
what I've got at the moment that's all I
really<00:01:39.740> had<00:01:40.070> now<00:01:40.369> that<00:01:40.640> silver<00:01:41.180> legacy<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:41.810> top

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
really had now that silver legacy on top

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.940 
really had now that silver legacy on top
that<00:01:43.130> allows<00:01:43.400> is<00:01:43.670> still<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.210> flop<00:01:44.450> onto<00:01:44.720> me<00:01:44.960> but

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
that allows is still to flop onto me but

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.620 
that allows is still to flop onto me but
there's<00:01:46.190> an<00:01:46.310> elevation<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.030> there<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.390> stops

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
there's an elevation in there that stops

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.499 
there's an elevation in there that stops
any<00:01:47.750> water<00:01:48.080> from<00:01:48.229> going<00:01:48.500> in<00:01:48.680> there<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:49.729> still

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
any water from going in there but still

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.800 
any water from going in there but still
live<00:01:50.690> here<00:01:50.750> for<00:01:51.290> yeah<00:01:52.250> as<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.270> can<00:01:53.420> see

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
involve motor in there and at the moment

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.270 
involve motor in there and at the moment
or<00:02:11.880> money<00:02:12.030> running<00:02:12.330> twelve<00:02:12.690> box<00:02:13.280> you'll

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
or money running twelve box you'll

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.130 
or money running twelve box you'll
actually<00:02:14.459> see<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> big<00:02:15.510> difference<00:02:15.959> between

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
actually see a big difference between

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.400 
actually see a big difference between
twelve<00:02:16.850> eighteen<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.120> even<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.080> wanted<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
twelve eighteen and even if I wanted to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.570 
twelve eighteen and even if I wanted to
open<00:02:19.590> up<00:02:19.680> 24<00:02:20.310> volt<00:02:20.580> 24<00:02:21.300> volt<00:02:21.569> actually<00:02:22.580> testing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
open up 24 volt 24 volt actually testing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.580 
open up 24 volt 24 volt actually testing
along<00:02:23.819> but<00:02:24.060> I'm<00:02:24.630> sure<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.140> battery<00:02:25.440> life

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
along but I'm sure the battery life

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.520 
along but I'm sure the battery life
won't<00:02:25.860> be<00:02:26.040> quite<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:27.030> expected<00:02:27.980> now

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
won't be quite as expected now

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.640 
won't be quite as expected now
got<00:02:30.010> reversed

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.670 

and<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.219> bought<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> flick<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:36.000> switch

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
and then just bought a flick of a switch

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.000 
and then just bought a flick of a switch
where<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.799> going<00:02:38.010> forward

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.130 

now<00:02:43.010> wipe<00:02:43.610> using<00:02:44.090> drawbacks<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.690> obvious<00:02:45.020> is

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
now wipe using drawbacks is obvious is

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.020 
now wipe using drawbacks is obvious is
apparently<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:45.890> don't<00:02:46.130> have<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.460> lecture<00:02:46.670> at

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
apparently so don't have to lecture at

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.270 
apparently so don't have to lecture at
the<00:02:47.090> moment<00:02:47.450> I've<00:02:47.510> got<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.980> 12-volt<00:02:48.980> sealed

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
the moment I've got a 12-volt sealed

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.050 
the moment I've got a 12-volt sealed
lead-acid<00:02:49.580> battery<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:51.580> basically<00:02:52.580> what

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
lead-acid battery and basically what

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.380 
lead-acid battery and basically what
I'll<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:53.300> looking<00:02:53.420> at<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:54.520> either<00:02:55.520> seriesin<00:02:56.240> up

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
I'll be looking at is either seriesin up

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.290 
I'll be looking at is either seriesin up
three<00:02:56.690> sets<00:02:56.990> of<00:02:57.170> six<00:02:57.740> volts<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.640> give<00:02:58.790> me<00:02:58.940> 18

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
three sets of six volts to give me 18

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.410 
three sets of six volts to give me 18
volt<00:02:59.570> or<00:02:59.920> run<00:03:00.920> individual<00:03:01.490> 12<00:03:01.730> volts<00:03:02.120> just

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
volt or run individual 12 volts just

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.390 
volt or run individual 12 volts just
give<00:03:02.660> me<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> prolong<00:03:03.290> life<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.890> make<00:03:04.160> sure

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
give me the prolong life and make sure

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.060 
give me the prolong life and make sure
that<00:03:04.550> I've<00:03:04.670> got<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.410> ability<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.680> get<00:03:06.890> out

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
that I've got the ability to get out

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.720 
that I've got the ability to get out
there<00:03:07.600> with<00:03:08.600> 24<00:03:09.110> volts<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.770> runs<00:03:10.160> twice<00:03:10.550> as

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
there with 24 volts it runs twice as

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.280 
there with 24 volts it runs twice as
quick<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.090> what<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.270> dozen<00:03:11.660> were<00:03:11.750> twelve<00:03:12.020> you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
quick as what a dozen were twelve you

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.440 
quick as what a dozen were twelve you
know<00:03:12.320> these<00:03:12.709> batteries<00:03:13.100> actually<00:03:13.450> drained

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
know these batteries actually drained

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.060 
know these batteries actually drained
down<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.810> 50<00:03:15.140> percent<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.620> I've<00:03:15.709> had<00:03:15.890> this

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
down to 50 percent and I've had this

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.760 
down to 50 percent and I've had this
running<00:03:16.430> for<00:03:16.930> approximately<00:03:17.930> eight<00:03:18.170> hours

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
running for approximately eight hours

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.520 
running for approximately eight hours
straight<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.820> pocket<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.480> it's<00:03:21.350> only

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
straight in the pocket and it's only

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.430 
straight in the pocket and it's only
lost<00:03:21.800> 50%<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.489> its<00:03:22.670> charge<00:03:22.940> at<00:03:23.209> 12<00:03:23.480> volts<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.140> I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
lost 50% of its charge at 12 volts so I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.070 
lost 50% of its charge at 12 volts so I
think<00:03:24.950> that's<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.430> pretty<00:03:25.880> good<00:03:26.060> run<00:03:26.450> for<00:03:26.480> such

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
think that's a pretty good run for such

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.620 
think that's a pretty good run for such
a<00:03:27.110> small<00:03:27.640> 40mp<00:03:28.640> are<00:03:28.730> sealed<00:03:29.390> lead-acid

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
a small 40mp are sealed lead-acid

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.080 
a small 40mp are sealed lead-acid
battery<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:31.070> can<00:03:31.130> see<00:03:31.489> how<00:03:31.580> much<00:03:31.760> power

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
battery and you can see how much power

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.390 
battery and you can see how much power
this<00:03:32.270> scene<00:03:32.540> still<00:03:32.780> has

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.070 

that's<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.239> part<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:41.599> thought<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:43.310> obviously

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
that's the part I thought and obviously

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.150 
that's the part I thought and obviously
when<00:03:45.080> I<00:03:45.110> get<00:03:45.319> it<00:03:45.410> out

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
when I get it out

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.020 
when I get it out
out<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.550> bucket<00:03:48.620> does

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
out of the bucket does

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.200 
out of the bucket does
yep<00:03:51.210> Tyrion's<00:03:53.420> just<00:03:54.420> slide<00:03:54.750> up<00:03:55.580> just<00:03:56.580> like<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
yep Tyrion's just slide up just like a

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.470 
yep Tyrion's just slide up just like a
car<00:03:57.600> run<00:03:57.930> Tom<00:03:58.920> finish<00:03:59.400> with<00:03:59.580> it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
car run Tom finish with it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.330 
car run Tom finish with it
I<00:04:00.599> don't<00:04:01.080> rip<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.349> prop<00:04:01.560> shaft<00:04:01.590> off<00:04:02.069> when<00:04:02.280> I

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
I don't rip the prop shaft off when I

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.160 
I don't rip the prop shaft off when I
come<00:04:02.550> into<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.819> ramp<00:04:03.150> or<00:04:03.420> rocks<00:04:03.810> or<00:04:03.989> anything

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
come into a ramp or rocks or anything

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.910 
come into a ramp or rocks or anything
like<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:06.180> lower<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.780> basically<00:04:07.440> just

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
like that and to lower is basically just

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.910 
like that and to lower is basically just
hooked<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.700> bit<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:08.970> our<00:04:09.260> bungee<00:04:10.260> cord<00:04:10.709> that's

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
hooked a bit of our bungee cord that's

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.000 
hooked a bit of our bungee cord that's
actually<00:04:11.250> tied<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.519> there<00:04:11.970> and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
actually tied to there and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.860 
actually tied to there and
that<00:04:13.519> puts<00:04:13.760> enough<00:04:13.970> pressure<00:04:14.209> on<00:04:14.360> it<00:04:14.599> for

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
that puts enough pressure on it for

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.780 
that puts enough pressure on it for
flowers<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.980> give<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.340> little<00:04:16.370> bit<00:04:16.699> of

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
flowers and I give it a little bit of

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.159 
flowers and I give it a little bit of
slack<00:04:17.000> off<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.739> lifting<00:04:18.739> one<00:04:18.949> and<00:04:19.609> that's

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
slack off the lifting one and that's

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.610 
slack off the lifting one and that's
pretty<00:04:21.169> much<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.650> concert<00:04:22.100> boy<00:04:22.250> little<00:04:23.620> of

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
pretty much the concert boy little of

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.110 
pretty much the concert boy little of
course

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
course

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.570 
course
hopefully<00:04:26.990> we'll<00:04:27.500> do<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.710> water<00:04:28.010> test<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.490> that

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
hopefully we'll do a water test on that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.070 
hopefully we'll do a water test on that
this<00:04:28.729> weekend<00:04:29.210> given<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.570> weather<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.960> any
