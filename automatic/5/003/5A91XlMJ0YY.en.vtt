00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hi to all and steve i hope you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.430
 go well today we will start 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.290
 a new series devoted to the round 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.980
 point where I should rather say to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.910
 gyratory 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.150
 but you will understand why 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.259
 just after then this series will be head 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.330
 five videos 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.039
 today is the next one that will be 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.810
 devoted to investments the one after 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.699
 which will be devoted to the control and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.150
 flashing the one after that will be 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.789
 devoted to how to manage his 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 roundabout roundabout approach by 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.330
 london and the last one will be a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.270
 live demonstration of more than we will have 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.469
 from in the previous four videos 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.730
 good so what am I getting ready for you 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.890
 say today is not going to change 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.520
 radically your life but it's good 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 to know it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.640
 so it's commonly called 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.950
 roundabout in everyday life 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 is actually a roundabout you 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 exactly a roundabout with a roundabout 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.200
 you have certainly 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.230
 heard this word during your lessons 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.149
 glue so I do not mean that the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.149
 roundabouts does not exist far from there 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.070
 but they are much rarer ok 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.629
 it's good it's not all that but then 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.120
 what is the difference between the two 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.559
 is the difference is done by the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.010
 priority rule 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.010
 look 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.080
 this is the first thing to know is 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.299
 that in a roundabout where in a 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.159
 roundabout the direction of circulation to 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.150
 in the opposite direction of the 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.950
 Clockwise 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.690
 what makes that when you arrive in 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.890
 their skin in the roundabout where he wants 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.140
 pay attention to the people who arrive 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.509
 on your left 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.780
 so for the roundabout these are the ones that 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.110
 the border that will yield the passage 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.720
 those who are already inside the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.700
 roundabout have priority 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.930
 whereas in the roundabout this is the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.710
 otherwise it is those who are 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.350
 interior 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.539
 hard to the point that they do not have the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.869
 priority and therefore have to yield the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.369
 priority to their right to what happens 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.220
 in the roundabout 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.289
 then there is a famous example in paris 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.970
 of a mega roundabout called the 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.310
 round point of the star I do not know if 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.479
 you've heard about it but hey 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.920
 for those who are not used it is 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.840
 a little brothel especially he is 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.640
 super the huge what then to conclude 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.590
 this first part I would tell you 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.390
 just that nine times out of ten it's 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.000
 a roundabout they are scared to the point that 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.810
 you are going to approach but in reality we 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.850
 do not care a bit 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.320
 no matter what name counts 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.720
 really it's the way to approach it 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.130
 according to the priority rule 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.200
 Besides, I'm often mistaken 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.310
 will say dots instead of roundabouts it 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.769
 is asked is not so in the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.610
 next videos I make this mistake 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.230
 So here I am giving you an appointment 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.299
 in the next part where we go 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.049
 study the investments in the roundabout 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.049
 See you
