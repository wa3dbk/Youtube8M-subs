 lake a complete kit in beauty ex pet 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.520
 ease everything you need to 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.000
 riding your side is here and it's more 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.560
 simple than you think 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.430
 Let's learn how to ride your first 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.260
 lake 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.390
 know the kit to start let's open and 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 know the elements that make up the kit 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 my first lake manta and pdm to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.310
 waterproofing with geotextile blanket 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.370
 for the protection of the biological filter 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.549
 pumps for filtration and circulation 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.549
 hose for ov filter connection 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.950
 underwater lighting in coal led 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.789
 activated and products for treatment of 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.359
 Water 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:19.270
 Ready, there's everything you need. 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.210
 decoration items like stones plants and 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.170
 fish does not come with the kit but can be 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 purchased separately 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.350
 The first step is to choose the location for 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.539
 excavation scribble a piece of paper 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.670
 how do you want lake son 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.700
 this way it will be easier to 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.130
 view it before you start stripping the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.139
 available space to 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.209
 sure that the hole will agree 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:49.060
 with the project that according to the 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:52.030
 material available for assembly 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.520
 Now you can start the work. 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.280
 choose a flat location without trees 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.219
 close and make the demarcation of the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.779
 format that your side will have remove plants 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.620
 and stones that may disturb the 

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:11.500
 escalation 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:14.380
 and I saw the hole demarcated after the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.210
 excavation part and a solo and left 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.340
 a small hill of land in an agreement 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.500
 to prevent rainwater from flowing 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.690
 from outside into the lake 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.510
 there one of the bands from the section on the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.420
 soil it will help protect the blanket and 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.730
 pdm of possible pebbles or roots that 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.030
 They remained in the bottom side of the hole 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.340
 right on top of the geotextile blanket 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.040
 would be blanket and p &amp; d always taking 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.920
 care to be well- rested 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.030
 in the bottom and walls avoiding leaving it 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.310
 stressed 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.010
 do not worry about possible leaks in the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.890
 blanket because they will not appear after 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.900
 lake mounted above the pm 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.360
 install the other test blanket 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.550
 way to protect the stone pdm 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.520
 The heart I saw is possible. 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:04.360
 special touch is the finish you can 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.790
 use stones and sand on the bottom of your side 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.600
 I will use special cubes and 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.340
 sides 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.560
 do the heart with your legs 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.760
 pipes or tubes, of a kind used in 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.580
 your preference 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.770
 mix some smaller stones like 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.480
 shafts of varying sizes for 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.150
 fill the spaces between the stones 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.959
 large and to keep the side and 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.989
 balance 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.570
 we plan to install the equipment is 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.970
 in the cube jet bomb 4 mil with the side 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.820
 the opposite of where you want to install the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.880
 cubes filter vases leaves hidden pump 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.860
 between the stones or underneath them in the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.730
 to use artificial stones from 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.220
 culture 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.860
 be careful not to place the pump 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.170
 directly on the sand, avoiding 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.570
 it enters the inside of the pump 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.180
 cut a piece of hose enough 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.730
 to start the pump Pujato in 4000 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.530
 Filter vase always trying 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.989
 hide the hose between rocks 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.540
 the side of the lake and position if I 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.430
 as filter vessel so that the outlet of the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.700
 filter faces into the lake 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.620
 Position another pump as garden 2015 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.510
 on one side of the lake 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.629
 the same way you made a bomb 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.449
 Previous position your filter cubes see 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.609
 on the outside of the lake and use 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.460
 another piece of hose to connect the 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.830
 bomb cubes jet 2500 on your uv filter 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.380
 and another piece of hose to 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.050
 return to filter water see 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.910
 inside the lake does not leave and actor of his 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.130
 Son once loose on grass 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.130
 it must be installed at a distance 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:46.759
 minimum of five centimeters of soil 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:49.310
 position your kit is attached to a 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.889
 bucket of activated carbon cubes that may 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.139
 be installed inside the dengue cross and 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.349
 positioned inside the vacant filter hub 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.389
 or you can put cubes mag 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.669
 activated carbon on top of one of the 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.320
 pumps to give a special touch 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.110
 during the night 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.840
 install your local led spot 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.550
 your preference and may be within or 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.620
 out of the water gave her personal touch that 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.260
 works with the vegetation that the interior 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.940
 and of the surroundings of its lake composing 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.099
 landscaping with vegetables and 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.570
 preference, always observing the 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.570
 need for each one of them 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.800
 In a few, your side is already 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.400
 almost ready 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.129
 now we are going to a fundamental element 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.979
 the water you can start to fill with 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.900
 water and do not worry because your kit 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.729
 accompanies products for treatment 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.330
 of this water 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.550
 use cml of the cube are left prosthetic to 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.870
 remove chlorine fluorine from mine and metals 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.779
 heavy water 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.789
 then use more cml the furious 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.169
 love opened to accelerate training 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.259
 biological 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.749
 South Reapply the cube assigned to cml 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.620
 every seven days until completing four 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:05.620
 applications 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:12.949
 so it's time for the protagonists 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:15.469
 the fish with the lake practically ready 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.419
 you can begin to adapt the 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.749
 fish that will inhabit your new side 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.629
 preferably for small loads of 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:27.110
 20 centimeters to 30 centimeters in one 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:29.389
 maximum quantity of six fish follow the 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.229
 follows the instructions for adapting the 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.229
 fish next to 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.970
 and it's just a dream come true 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.100
 It was not easy, now you can.

 to enjoy with your family and enjoy 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.140
 every moment next to your first 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.420
 lake and much closer to nature 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.370
 refer to the ways of maintaining the 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.630
 equipment and care that will be 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.630
 required from now on
