00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:41.190
 Uniformized temperature distribution at terminals 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:45.820
 In addition , mounting the heat insulating plate inside the main body causes the temperature rise of the input terminal section 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.570
 Heat generation from the power supply is shut off and accurate temperature measurement is performed 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.570
