00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.710 
in a bin to hopefully minimize my mess
which<00:01:46.820> usually<00:01:47.820> gets<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.570> place

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
which usually gets all over the place

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.130 
which usually gets all over the place
anyway<00:01:49.130> but<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.460> will<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:51.060> least<00:01:51.090> contain<00:01:51.720> some

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
anyway but it will at least contain some

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.249 
anyway but it will at least contain some
of<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.799> where<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.659> can<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.079> back

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
of it to where we can then put it back

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.590 
of it to where we can then put it back
in<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.500> container<00:01:55.799> after<00:01:56.960> then<00:01:59.329> what<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.420> like

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
in the container after then what I like

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.109 
in the container after then what I like
to<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.020> tap<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.469> down<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> little<00:02:02.009> bit<00:02:02.250> just

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
to do is tap it down a little bit just

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.120 
to do is tap it down a little bit just
so<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.479> got<00:02:03.689> good<00:02:03.960> contact<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> Mod

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so it's got good contact with the Mod

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.089 
so it's got good contact with the Mod
Podge<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> very<00:02:07.380> forgiving<00:02:07.829> craft

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
Podge and this is a very forgiving craft

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.460 
Podge and this is a very forgiving craft
because<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.360> dries<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.959> there's<00:02:10.229> spots

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
because as it dries that there's spots

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.430 
because as it dries that there's spots
that<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.830> missed<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.819> always<00:02:11.970> go<00:02:12.180> back

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
that you missed you can always go back

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.370 
that you missed you can always go back
can<00:02:12.560> add<00:02:12.710> it<00:02:12.890> over<00:02:13.040> again<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.880> if<00:02:14.750> after<00:02:15.260> you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
can add it over again and if after you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.110 
can add it over again and if after you
wear<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:15.860> lose<00:02:16.100> some<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.820> always

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
wear it you lose some you can always

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.650 
wear it you lose some you can always
again<00:02:17.450> go<00:02:18.110> touch<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.410> up<00:02:19.120> once<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.240> shoes<00:02:20.450> have

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
again go touch it up once the shoes have

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.960 
again go touch it up once the shoes have
dried<00:02:20.960> what<00:02:21.380> I'm<00:02:21.500> doing<00:02:21.770> now<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.190> I'm<00:02:22.340> taking<00:02:22.550> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
dried what I'm doing now is I'm taking a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.320 
dried what I'm doing now is I'm taking a
second<00:02:23.420> layer<00:02:23.570> of<00:02:24.010> Mod<00:02:25.010> Podge<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.700> I'm<00:02:25.790> moving

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
second layer of Mod Podge and I'm moving

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.710 
second layer of Mod Podge and I'm moving
it<00:02:26.420> right<00:02:26.810> over<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.180> gonna<00:02:29.360> seal

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
it right over and this is gonna seal

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.500 
it right over and this is gonna seal
what<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.710> there<00:02:31.010> but<00:02:31.820> then<00:02:32.150> I'm<00:02:32.300> also

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
what I have on there but then I'm also

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.080 
what I have on there but then I'm also
going<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.990> sprinkle<00:02:33.710> another<00:02:34.220> layer<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.730> there

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
going to sprinkle another layer on there

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.080 
going to sprinkle another layer on there
so<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.540> should<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.410> top<00:02:36.680> layer<00:02:36.980> chip<00:02:37.850> off

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
so that should the top layer chip off

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.730 
so that should the top layer chip off
you<00:02:38.360> still<00:02:38.690> have<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.170> layer<00:02:39.350> underneath

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
you still have the layer underneath

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.860 
you still have the layer underneath
that's<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.400> place<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.210> well<00:02:42.080> sealed<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.810> I'm

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
that's in place and well sealed so I'm

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.480 
that's in place and well sealed so I'm
just<00:02:45.050> gonna<00:02:45.140> go<00:02:45.410> around<00:02:45.620> do<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.100> on<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
just gonna go around do that on the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.720 
just gonna go around do that on the
whole<00:02:46.790> shoe<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.850> should<00:02:51.610> really<00:02:52.610> help

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
whole shoe and that should really help

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.020 
whole shoe and that should really help
protect<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:53.930> seal<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.530> really<00:02:54.800> well<00:02:55.030> okay

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
protect it and seal it really well okay
