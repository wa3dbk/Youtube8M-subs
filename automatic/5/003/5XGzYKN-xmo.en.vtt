00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.559
 for example let's capture our 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.559
 screen 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.890
 if there were to the assumption of any 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.759
 mode 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:27.250
 let's put in this case let's put 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:29.439
 our color red and we close and we're going to 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.099
 just put the time the time it is 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.099
 important 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.739
 and we do in this way until one that 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.739
 is now we can share it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.930
 any of your three applications 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.030
 or even we can even match it 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.949
 our homework 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.260
 Amador to our gallery to our 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.989
 interesting way too for example 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.710
 we are still in these applications we 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.710
 let's talk 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.760
 and there we are right here in Madrid 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.799
 we take a step and we just want to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 this case we are going to celebrate our 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.920
 birthday we are here near the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.920
 retirement party 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.900
 we hear less in this way we are going to 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.080
 put your mind in the retirement park 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.540
 and let's celebrate 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.440
 for example here 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.440
 let's stay 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.940
 and we are going to create wings 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.530
 that is to say 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 we do it this way we can 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 share also with any of your 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.070
 applications we can save it or 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.289
 including also one of our 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.210
 applications and frets senses to see 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.799
 much clearer what we have written and 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.799
 we can also keep working 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.460
 let's go working with our map 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.710
 every time we have already pointed out that a 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.500
 this time at that particular point is where 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.450
 we will be 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.700
 to visual themes some functions of 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.450
 circuit 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.450
 today we have 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.300
 we have saved we can embroider in this 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.300
 if we want 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.140
 in our wikileaks demonstrations 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.430
 let's see black what is like luis 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.989
 It is very interesting because we can 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.030
 work with different applications with 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.150
 different screens at once in this 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.500
 case let's go but before we are 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.810
 working on our main screen 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.659
 that we want to use some 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.590
 other screens with quiz lines how 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.200
 We can work with different 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.819
 screens here well thought out some already 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.769
 predetermined but you can still 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.709
 edit more in this case is not used 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.150
 for example the calculator as you can 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.579
 appreciate we have the screen 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.590
 principal and apart we have another of the 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.209
 three screens to be able to work and 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.909
 to make it easier we have here a 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.790
 sensor that determines the visibility 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.099
 to transparency of our other screen 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.630
 so we can continue working for 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:08.060
 that we have previously 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.790
 how can we check the slide 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.739
 and apart we can go open more screens 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.190
 we have then there we have for example 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.080
 we also want to see let's go for example 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.940
 also the calculator the calendar 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.620
 we can to our calendar and at the same 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.840
 that we are with this open calculator 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.849
 with our calendar in our 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.890
 main screen we can also 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.450
 work simultaneously on them 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.420
 transparent in one way or another 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:37.180
 and access one or the other without any 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.120
 problem in this way the terminals 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.019
 light with different screens 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.230
 simultaneously it is more visual too 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.420
 for example associations with interesting 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.810
 in this case we can do what 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.390
 it would be the five steps a very 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.640
 detailed to capture precisely 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.269
 the details that we want in 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.760
 Here we will see the face of 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.640
 our characters so that 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.989
 we can do the five steps and we can 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.200
 just look at the detail that 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.890
 we want you can appreciate 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.920
 a totally impressive quality 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.570
 In addition we can also capture from 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.510
 our own videos we can do the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.030
 airsoft we can do 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.220
 an image we can take with images and 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.400
 with a photograph in this case they are 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.740
 jumping we are going to press we are going to catch 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.930
 this from the instant clue we make 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.600
 for our cultivate we are going for 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.700
 example let's remember that we have one 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.790
 of our colors we will remember that 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.790
 just Africa to her in this case 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.310
 we put for example his number of 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.310
 phone 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.700
 32 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.650
 in this way we have parity in 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.750
 this image we have of our frame 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.100
 that we have had we have captured the 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.780
 image and we will also be able to work 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.270
 to be able to have with this course where 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.660
 were in this case just many in 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.660
 the memory 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:23.030
 instantly as we explain that 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.800
 labor is like this afterwards for example we can 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.849
 save 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.310
 let's go back to our gallery for example and 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.020
 It shows archibald we have worked 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.360
 the application also that chose the 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.740
 frame that we want and in this way 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.740
 we have it stored 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.639
 you can see how easy it is 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:47.840
 move with all the ferro technology 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.490
 capture or eliminate intermediate layers 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.340
 the internal layers between 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.550
 our glass gorilla glass or what 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.889
 would be the east in this way it seems that 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.050
 is just a lot more sensitivity is 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.900
 much easier to copy is much 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.169
 more manageable 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.380
 those that have for example in the mode of 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.360
 camera 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.760
 there are other peculiarities in this 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.380
 case we would have this is just car 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.170
 shot chis 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.120
 that we when we say cheese 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.260
 directly recognize the command of 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.270
 flight remember that the terminal 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.520
 directly at that time endosÃ¡rsela 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.590
 snapshot photography too 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.410
 we have just the shot the 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.660
 retroactive the shot to the past that 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.460
 we would get an active shot at 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.650
 past would be time for us 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.480
 we press for example the jump of a 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.280
 athlete we have tried 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.890
 adapt to images in the jump more 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.070
 What the terminal itself does is high 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.140
 archive a memory the memory records 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.820
 for two seconds before using 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.700
 are just going to take the 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.530
 snapshot and stores those five 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:57.410
 instances that you previously take from this 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.410
 way it is very easy to say this photo 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.110
 is one of the options of our 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:07.280
 photograph video options also that 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.280
 we can be recording a video 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.790
 we are washing our video 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.110
 and at the same time we can do 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.110
 including our video 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.949
 we are achieving our video 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.060
 interesting also live sol collection 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.639
 while we're recording one of 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.710
 our videos that we can get a 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.169
 snapshot 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.779
 tomÃ¡s 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:35.249
 to see more of our video and we're going to 

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:38.310
 capture the snapshot of the moment of 

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:40.110
 we want at that moment 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.330
 store our photos we want 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.310
 enter we have on our 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.419
 snapshots with the iso the video that 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.960
 we are giving is the precise moment 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:47.960
 world
