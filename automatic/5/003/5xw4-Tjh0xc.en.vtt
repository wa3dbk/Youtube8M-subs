00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.259
 hello I am and benavidez and this is a 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.779
 advice over practical natural cooking 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.150
 this time we are going to make a dressing 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.589
 for salad the ingredients that 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.710
 we need are three branches of celery here 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.380
 I already have finely chopped them 5 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.110
 radishes also minced and washed by 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.930
 supposedly also half onion 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.060
 finally chopped a half bunch of 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.050
 cilantro also chopped washed and 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.960
 disinfected 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.660
 in half a cup of lemon the lemon juice 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.100
 It is very important that you make sure that you do not 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.420
 It looks like it does not have lemon seeds 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.910
 half a cup of vinegar and half a cup of 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.670
 olive oil and broth type seasoning 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.890
 chicken first let's mix the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.840
 liquid ingredients 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.840
 what are the lemon 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.730
 in the oil 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.550
 and the vinegar 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.800
 to this we are going to add the seasoning 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.800
 chicken broth type powder 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.320
 this is to taste 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.320
 and we stir 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.650
 well stirred that no lumps remain 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.729
 because sometimes the seasoning when it 's in 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.100
 dust tends to stick and make balls 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.990
 here we have it well the first thing that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.299
 let's add is the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.299
 the onion so that it unfolds 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.640
 the radishes and goodbye 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.240
 ah 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.240
 and finally the cilantro 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.370
 here 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.009
 and this we have a very original dressing and 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.009
 delicious 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.590
 I am Benavides level and remember that we are 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.590
 what we eat
