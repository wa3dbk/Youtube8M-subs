00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
cast net for me is from three to about

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.410 
cast net for me is from three to about
six<00:00:13.500> feet<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.009> depending<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.000> length<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
method on a bigger net but this is a way

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.560 
method on a bigger net but this is a way
that<00:00:19.680> you'll<00:00:20.160> be<00:00:20.279> able<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.520> open<00:00:21.210> your<00:00:21.240> cast

throw with no practice involved now I'm

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.450 
throw with no practice involved now I'm
not<00:00:27.720> sure<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.170> way<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.470> rigging<00:00:28.800> has<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
not sure if this way of rigging has a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.299 
not sure if this way of rigging has a
specific<00:00:30.090> name<00:00:30.390> um<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.800> throwing<00:00:32.070> my

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
specific name um I was just throwing my

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.490 
specific name um I was just throwing my
casted<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:32.969> yard<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:34.020> was<00:00:34.170> trying<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
casted in my yard and I was trying to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.100 
casted in my yard and I was trying to
figure<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:35.100> new<00:00:35.550> method<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.090> would<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.510> easier

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
figure a new method that would be easier

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.720 
figure a new method that would be easier
so<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.219> goofing<00:00:38.640> around

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
so I was just you know goofing around

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.180 
so I was just you know goofing around
and<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.540> threw<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.020> once<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.739> worked<00:00:40.950> pretty

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and I threw it once and it worked pretty

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.790 
and I threw it once and it worked pretty
good<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.719> didn't<00:00:43.079> open<00:00:43.290> up<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> way

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
good but it didn't open up all the way

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.100 
good but it didn't open up all the way
so<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.040> made<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:44.460> torques<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.360> changed

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so I made some torques on it I changed

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.630 
so I made some torques on it I changed
it<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.010> came<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.520> with

easy way a method method you'll just be

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.969 
easy way a method method you'll just be
able<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:03.629> outside<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.290> try<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.860> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
able to go outside and try this on your

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
able to go outside and try this on your
cast<00:01:05.189> net<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.580> don't<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.600> watching

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
cast net you don't have to be watching

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
cast net you don't have to be watching
the<00:01:07.170> video<00:01:07.409> while<00:01:07.650> trying<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the video while trying it because it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
the video while trying it because it
only<00:01:08.790> has<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.299> few<00:01:09.360> steps<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.619> first<00:01:10.860> step

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
only has a few steps so the first step

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.960 
only has a few steps so the first step
on<00:01:11.400> your<00:01:12.330> cast<00:01:13.080> net<00:01:13.350> hand<00:01:13.650> line<00:01:13.830> uh<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
on your cast net hand line uh make a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
on your cast net hand line uh make a
loop<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.930> cast<00:01:16.200> nets<00:01:16.409> already<00:01:16.680> have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
loop not some cast nets already have

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
loop not some cast nets already have
this<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.369> basically<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.110> get

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
this and basically all you do is you get

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.340 
this and basically all you do is you get
that<00:01:19.490> put<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.790> your<00:01:20.970> wrist<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.540> start

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that put that on your wrist and start

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.429 
that put that on your wrist and start
forming<00:01:22.799> loops<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.729> you're<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.900> similar<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
forming loops and you're it's similar to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.090 
forming loops and you're it's similar to
a<00:01:25.740> garden<00:01:26.580> hose<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.540> start<00:01:27.810> looping<00:01:28.799> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
a garden hose you just start looping it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
a garden hose you just start looping it
like<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.600> hand<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
like this so that in your hand that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.870 
like this so that in your hand that
looks<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
looks like that and you do that all the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
looks like that and you do that all the
way<00:01:33.030> until<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.720> horn<00:01:33.990> comes<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> horn

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
way until the horn comes this is a horn

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.270 
way until the horn comes this is a horn
of<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> cast<00:01:35.790> net<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.299> forgot<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.259> say<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.710> if

show you guys an example of me throwing

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.410 
show you guys an example of me throwing
this<00:02:58.930> method<00:02:59.639> make<00:03:00.639> sure<00:03:00.849> that<00:03:01.000> there's<00:03:01.239> no

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
this method make sure that there's no

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:13.390 
this method make sure that there's no
tangles<00:03:02.109> they<00:03:03.010> go<00:03:03.159> great

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.890 

and<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.550> was<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.700> perfect<00:03:14.910> tank<00:03:15.300> as<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.780> can

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
and that was a perfect tank as you can

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.230 
and that was a perfect tank as you can
see<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.200> bounced<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.980> bit<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.760> even

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
see it bounced a little bit but even

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.130 
see it bounced a little bit but even
with<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.510> bounce<00:03:19.050> on<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.410> grass<00:03:21.140> that's

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
with that bounce on the grass that's

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.070 
with that bounce on the grass that's
about<00:03:22.410> 90<00:03:22.710> percent<00:03:23.040> open<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.760> even<00:03:24.720> with<00:03:24.960> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
about 90 percent open and even with the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.260 
about 90 percent open and even with the
bounce<00:03:25.320> as<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.740> can<00:03:25.860> see<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.520> net<00:03:26.760> pretty

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
bounce as you can see that net pretty

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.900 
bounce as you can see that net pretty
much<00:03:27.480> pancaked<00:03:28.200> um<00:03:30.140> again<00:03:31.140> I'm<00:03:31.320> gonna<00:03:31.410> try<00:03:31.680> to

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:50.570 

Ziggy<00:03:47.570> perfectly<00:03:48.570> painting<00:03:49.160> aside<00:03:50.160> from<00:03:50.430> the

Ziggy perfectly painting aside from the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.620 
Ziggy perfectly painting aside from the
bounce<00:03:51.260> um<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.250> was<00:03:53.670> on<00:03:53.850> water<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.420> would

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630
