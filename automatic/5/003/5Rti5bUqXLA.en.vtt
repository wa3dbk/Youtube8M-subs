what you think
also<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.640> was<00:02:12.760> thinking<00:02:12.819> about<00:02:14.520> changing<00:02:15.520> this

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
also I was thinking about changing this

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.910 
also I was thinking about changing this
getting<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.940> plastic<00:02:18.940> cover<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.270> target

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
getting the plastic cover the target

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.650 
getting the plastic cover the target
cover<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.220> then<00:02:21.340> taking<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:21.850> off<00:02:22.090> give<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.630> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
cover and then taking this off give it a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.720 
cover and then taking this off give it a
little<00:02:22.810> more<00:02:22.959> racy<00:02:23.230> look<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.580> guess

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
little more racy look and then I guess

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.130 
little more racy look and then I guess
eventually<00:02:25.180> I'd<00:02:25.270> have<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.510> change<00:02:25.720> out<00:02:25.989> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
eventually I'd have to change out the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.300 
eventually I'd have to change out the
fender<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.700> uh<00:02:28.800> alright<00:02:29.800> well<00:02:29.950> that's<00:02:30.069> my

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
fender but uh alright well that's my

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.259 
fender but uh alright well that's my
bike<00:02:30.520> again<00:02:32.370> 2007<00:02:33.840> Suzuki<00:02:34.840> sv650<00:02:35.650> s<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.310> think

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
bike again 2007 Suzuki sv650 s I think

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.430 
bike again 2007 Suzuki sv650 s I think
it<00:02:37.450> looks<00:02:37.600> best<00:02:37.959> from<00:02:38.410> like<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.920> angle<00:02:40.440> up

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
it looks best from like this angle up

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.960 
it looks best from like this angle up
