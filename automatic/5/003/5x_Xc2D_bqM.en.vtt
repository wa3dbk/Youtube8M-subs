00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.620
 hour waving like anger over austria 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.840
 and keep the helper 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.730
 especially in the east of the country on trab 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.420

 Floods could be persistent 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.919
 Rainfall was de has more water 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.899
 It's often done like in the last few days 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.350
 the situation has worsened because im 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.450
 area of the valley and especially in the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.760
 Upper Styria days have been led strong 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.019
 and thereby the influence in us 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.030
 Our area of confession 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.370
 the lock remains upright to 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.710
 the level of the ems at the local quay below four 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.329
 The precipitation falls 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.420
 so far focused on the 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.039
 southeastern austria in bavaria for example 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.329
 it has 100 liters on the night 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.739
 square meters of rain 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.710
 for the volunteer fire departments 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.449
 this means continuous use and for in 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.430
 In the early morning we have the flood stage 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.310
 That is enough, that means we have quite a lot 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.770
 Protection from noise then triggered the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.780
 played wildcats and thus have the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.400
 Measures started the vehicles too 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.170
 remove 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.479
 at the moment so that the stock was strong 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.610
 is rising and we are here now 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.490
 is in lectures from the danger area 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.780
 according to forecast, it is so 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.270
 to stop the rainfall throughout the day 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.659

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.490
 Styria and in the area windows and 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.819
 I am amazed then 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.969
 attribution of about 600 meters of 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.770
 shell to be developer and depending on 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.030
 how the lead is to today 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.810
 while accordingly at the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.719
 dealt 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.319
 depending on the water level procedure too 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.689
 put 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.700

 liters per square meter 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.979
 the levels of the rivers especially the

 Currently , about 40 are mainly in action 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.690
 and they, of course, increase the 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.739
