00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.880
 today I am taking you away reminding that he would have bet at the strong lab 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.880
 of an experience you believe do you think 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.109
 this attack and the research will tell scientist 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.810
 for me it was 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.980
 almost decisive because 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.370
 you have to be able to dance your moments of universal versed simple so you have to 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.170
 can go further and it's muddy wave is accompanied by someone 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.579
 who is able to decode a little bit of everything 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.050
 empirical finally cooking empire kinds of things 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 and elements and red me if it works it does not work and give up if he 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.550
 wanted to go further is to first stabilize a recipe 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.990
 it is necessary to be able to 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.180
 not mess around 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.750
 all phenomena can occur 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.470
 in transformations 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.470
 the meeting was canceled 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.000
 I can not remember any more evidence about his closest prosecutor 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.350
 daring because when we left to last 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 this technology 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.220
 lead to something 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 well done 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.150
 but it's also true that it's fast 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 and that's where his Basque backpack 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.460
 without risk taking 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.180
 announced the un 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.580
 and that's what made it anyway 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.600
 finally after taking risks is enough 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.750
 technologically advanced doping products 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.750
 google 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.490
 I'm part of the ingredients 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.490
 and from there I will do 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.670
 and then imagine doing to monitor on the tomato 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 but again I read I have tomato structures - now cost 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.360
 the petaners 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.230
 and we try we try forward surprising images on materials 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.340
 we know very well 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.760
 the impression that we know very well in fact we never really 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
 well kept the infinitely small to look like their daughters 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.069
 it's almost cosmetic 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.840
 and so I had 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.619
 to think that we are just a hyphen between the two 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.329
 and that we are part of a whole 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.519
 and all that is very ephemeral we were very small at the site 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.079
 the product 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.670
 and my major concern product quality circles 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.930
 today the technique allows to mitigate closer to the product three 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.489
 points 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.030
 the great innovation is still being closer to closer to them the 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.929
 consumer 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.839
 if there is no innovation 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:32.639
 things do not change 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.949
 that's what does not change a lot
