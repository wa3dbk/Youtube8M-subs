00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
your name and let you've already done it

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.360 
your name and let you've already done it
obviously<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.980> I'm<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
show you how you find it so first you go

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.340 
show you how you find it so first you go
to<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.610> Macintosh<00:00:48.149> HD<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.200> might<00:00:49.320> be

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to your Macintosh HD or you it might be

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680 
to your Macintosh HD or you it might be
called<00:00:49.559> disc<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.129> I've<00:00:50.190> changed<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.420> type

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
called disc but I've changed it you type

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.709 
called disc but I've changed it you type
in<00:00:51.930> some<00:00:52.230> squiggly<00:00:52.500> line<00:00:52.800> thing<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.390> slash

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
in some squiggly line thing and we slash

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.349 
in some squiggly line thing and we slash
library<00:00:57.260> slash<00:00:58.289> app<00:00:59.270> location<00:01:00.829> support<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
library slash app location support and

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.440 
library slash app location support and
it<00:01:03.359> should<00:01:03.660> bring<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.140> oh<00:01:04.320> wait<00:01:04.650> no<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.450> copy

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it should bring it oh wait no so on copy

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
it should bring it oh wait no so on copy
that<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.350> file<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:09.920> we're<00:01:10.920> not

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that and you go into file and we're not

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
that and you go into file and we're not
file<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:12.350> go<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> folder<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:15.540> c<00:01:15.840> f--

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
file a go and you go to folder or c f--

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.410 
file a go and you go to folder or c f--
GG<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> type<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:18.030> what

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
GG and you type it in here like what

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.950 
GG and you type it in here like what
exactly<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.020> what<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:20.159> hit<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
exactly like what there then hit go and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
exactly like what there then hit go and
it'll<00:01:21.960> bring<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:22.909> your<00:01:23.909> application

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it'll bring you to your your application

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
it'll bring you to your your application
support<00:01:24.869> thing<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.040> don't<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> here

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
support thing and I don't like that here

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.469 
support thing and I don't like that here
you<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.540> place<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.840> support<00:01:28.290> C<00:01:29.479> but

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you go this is my place in support C but

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.770 
you go this is my place in support C but
I<00:01:30.509> showed<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> way<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> unhide<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> want

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I showed a way to unhide it so you want

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.450 
I showed a way to unhide it so you want
to<00:01:33.840> open<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.079> terminal<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.340> really

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to open up terminal if you don't really

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.390 
to open up terminal if you don't really
have<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.439> just<00:01:37.439> grab<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.829> utilities

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
have it then just grab it out utilities

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.010 
have it then just grab it out utilities
and<00:01:39.000> basically<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:40.049> type<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:42.500> CH<00:01:43.500> Flags

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
and basically you want type in CH Flags

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.370 
and basically you want type in CH Flags
space<00:01:46.020> no<00:01:46.710> hidden<00:01:48.320> space<00:01:49.369> looks<00:01:50.369> wiggly

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
space no hidden space looks wiggly

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.999 
space no hidden space looks wiggly
library<00:01:52.820> slash<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:55.229> now<00:01:55.350> we'll<00:01:55.530> unhide<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
library slash and now we'll unhide it

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.749 
library slash and now we'll unhide it
and<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.060> close<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.460> go<00:01:59.579> back

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and you can close that you can go back

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.170 
and you can close that you can go back
in<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> will<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.979> library<00:02:02.579> folder

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
in and it will be in your library folder

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.330 
in and it will be in your library folder
the<00:02:04.110> reason<00:02:04.439> they've<00:02:04.560> done<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.040> because

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the reason they've done that is because

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.300 
the reason they've done that is because
they've<00:02:05.579> changed<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.270> ten<00:02:06.450> point<00:02:06.689> seven

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
they've changed it in ten point seven

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.619 
they've changed it in ten point seven
they've<00:02:08.310> moved<00:02:08.459> all<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> patient<00:02:09.209> support

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
they've moved all that patient support

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.680 
they've moved all that patient support
folders<00:02:10.050> around<00:02:10.140> um<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.819> they

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
folders around um and they

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.780 
folders around um and they
hidden<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> can't<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
hidden it so you can't actually get to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.060 
hidden it so you can't actually get to
it<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.270> apparently<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.440> don't<00:02:16.620> need<00:02:16.830> it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
it because apparently you don't need it

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.010 
it because apparently you don't need it
but<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.490> do<00:02:17.700> or<00:02:18.060> pursue<00:02:18.300> from<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.690> cut<00:02:18.930> off

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
but we do or pursue from one cut off

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.130 
but we do or pursue from one cut off
