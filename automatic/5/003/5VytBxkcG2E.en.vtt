00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.219 
for processing if any of the cancer has

removed<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.890> will<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.280> able<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> under

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
removed I will be able to see it under

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.810 
removed I will be able to see it under
the<00:02:03.149> microscope<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.619> lab<00:02:04.799> skin<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.579> cut

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the microscope in the lab skin is cut

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.639 
the microscope in the lab skin is cut
into<00:02:06.090> several<00:02:06.270> pieces<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.020> each<00:02:07.380> piece<00:02:07.409> is

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
into several pieces and each piece is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.529 
into several pieces and each piece is
marked<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.099> ink<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:08.729> exactly<00:02:09.270> where

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
marked with ink so I know exactly where

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.590 
marked with ink so I know exactly where
the<00:02:09.660> skin<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.080> before<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.560> was<00:02:10.590> removed

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
the skin was before it was removed

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.240 
the skin was before it was removed
this<00:02:12.600> is<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> way<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.050> mapping<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.500> skin<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:14.130> if

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
this is a way of mapping the skin so if

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.070 
this is a way of mapping the skin so if
we<00:02:14.370> find<00:02:14.610> any<00:02:14.910> cancer<00:02:15.360> under<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.660> microscope

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
we find any cancer under the microscope

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.320 
we find any cancer under the microscope
we<00:02:16.680> know<00:02:16.800> exactly<00:02:17.100> where<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.490> find<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.210> remove

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
we know exactly where to find and remove

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.870 
we know exactly where to find and remove
the<00:02:18.630> remaining<00:02:18.900> cancer<00:02:19.230> containing<00:02:19.860> skin<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the remaining cancer containing skin the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.730 
the remaining cancer containing skin the
process<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.420> preparing<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:22.050> skin<00:02:22.170> samples

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
process of preparing the skin samples

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.890 
process of preparing the skin samples
generally<00:02:23.160> takes<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.820> two<00:02:23.850> hours<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
generally takes one to two hours the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.270 
generally takes one to two hours the
skin<00:02:25.170> samples<00:02:25.560> come<00:02:25.740> back<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.040> me<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.220> a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.860 
during the procedure
so<00:05:20.310> most<00:05:20.520> surgery<00:05:20.849> carries<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.330> same<00:05:21.509> risks

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
so most surgery carries the same risks

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.499 
so most surgery carries the same risks
as<00:05:22.020> any<00:05:22.229> skin<00:05:22.590> surgery<00:05:23.099> so<00:05:23.610> anytime<00:05:23.910> we<00:05:24.150> cut

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
as any skin surgery so anytime we cut

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.960 
as any skin surgery so anytime we cut
the<00:05:24.630> skin<00:05:24.979> during<00:05:25.979> surgery<00:05:26.520> there's<00:05:26.699> gonna<00:05:26.820> be

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
the skin during surgery there's gonna be

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.790 
the skin during surgery there's gonna be
a<00:05:27.000> little<00:05:27.180> bit<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.419> bleeding<00:05:27.599> there's<00:05:28.470> a<00:05:28.530> lower

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
a little bit of bleeding there's a lower

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.399 
a little bit of bleeding there's a lower
risk<00:05:28.979> of<00:05:29.190> infection<00:05:29.760> generally<00:05:30.180> one<00:05:31.139> to<00:05:31.169> two

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
risk of infection generally one to two

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.029 
risk of infection generally one to two
percent<00:05:31.620> there's<00:05:32.400> also<00:05:32.550> going<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:32.820> be<00:05:32.940> a<00:05:32.970> scar

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
percent there's also going to be a scar

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.860 
percent there's also going to be a scar
most<00:05:35.039> patients<00:05:35.550> do<00:05:35.669> not<00:05:35.699> realize<00:05:36.180> that<00:05:36.659> during

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
most patients do not realize that during

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.450 
most patients do not realize that during
the<00:05:37.110> procedure<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.590> scar<00:05:38.070> is<00:05:38.220> going<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.400> be

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
the procedure the scar is going to be

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.580 
the procedure the scar is going to be
much<00:05:38.699> larger<00:05:39.240> than<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:39.690> spot<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.080> they<00:05:40.409> came
