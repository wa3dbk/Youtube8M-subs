00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
inches without any screw holes in the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.590 
inches without any screw holes in the
faceplate<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.110> first<00:01:11.100> things<00:01:11.250> first<00:01:11.390> cut<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
faceplate so first things first cut this

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.280 
faceplate so first things first cut this
on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.890> table<00:01:14.340> saw<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> raw<00:01:15.000> sauce<00:01:15.290> all

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
on the table saw to the raw sauce all

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.380 
on the table saw to the raw sauce all
right<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> blank<00:01:17.130> cup<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.790> I've

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
right so that's the blank cup and I've

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.590 
right so that's the blank cup and I've
marked<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> center's<00:01:19.950> both<00:01:20.460> sides<00:01:20.820> it's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
marked up the center's both sides it's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.120 
marked up the center's both sides it's
2.5<00:01:22.280> inches<00:01:23.280> square<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.950> bit

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
2.5 inches square so it's a little bit

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.880 
2.5 inches square so it's a little bit
smaller<00:01:26.460> than<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> maximum<00:01:27.689> size<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.710> be

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
smaller than the maximum size it can be

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.609 
smaller than the maximum size it can be
and<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:30.030> you'll<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.479> you'll<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:30.930> that's

see I'm just going to put the pencil up
to<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:13.689> transition<00:03:14.689> points<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:18.560> we're<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:18.829> new

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
to the transition points so we're a new

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.809 
to the transition points so we're a new
bead<00:03:20.329> or<00:03:20.720> thickness<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.769> material<00:03:21.889> starts

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
bead or thickness of the material starts

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.709 
bead or thickness of the material starts
I'm<00:03:22.939> just<00:03:23.090> putting<00:03:23.329> a<00:03:23.359> little<00:03:23.389> mark<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:28.719> then

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.500 

alright<00:04:05.330> so<00:04:06.550> I've<00:04:07.550> cut<00:04:07.790> out<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:09.170> cup<00:04:09.500> and

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
alright so I've cut out the the cup and

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.220 
alright so I've cut out the the cup and
before<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.960> turn<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.460> stem<00:04:13.880> I<00:04:14.210> want<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.870> turn<00:04:15.020> my

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
before I turn the stem I want to turn my

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.770 
before I turn the stem I want to turn my
attention<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.710> hollowing<00:04:16.280> out<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.760> cup<00:04:17.450> now

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
attention to hollowing out the cup now

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.229 
attention to hollowing out the cup now
because<00:04:18.590> if<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:18.860> turn<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.280> stem<00:04:19.640> and<00:04:19.910> it's

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
because if I turn the stem and it's

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.110 
because if I turn the stem and it's
really<00:04:20.480> thin<00:04:20.840> that's<00:04:21.350> not<00:04:21.620> gonna<00:04:21.770> be<00:04:22.700> strong

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
really thin that's not gonna be strong

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.730 
really thin that's not gonna be strong
enough<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.360> support<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.990> pressure<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.560> me

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
enough to support the pressure of me

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.100 
enough to support the pressure of me
hollowing<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:25.250> out<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:26.330> I'm<00:04:26.660> gonna<00:04:26.810> go<00:04:26.990> ahead

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
hollowing it out so I'm gonna go ahead

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.010 
hollowing it out so I'm gonna go ahead
take<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.800> gouge<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.630> hold<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:30.230> cup<00:04:30.440> out<00:04:30.620> now

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020
