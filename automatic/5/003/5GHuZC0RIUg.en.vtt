00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.820
Here's a look at an example from Line 6's latest and
improved series of digital modelling amps.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.820
This a Spider 4 75.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:01:26.309
[music]

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.640
We've talked about the bulk of the improved
features in the review in this months magazine,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.500
of course we have. But here we'll go through
just some of the highlights. For example there

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.109
are 2 new amp models to play with and the
1st is a class A model, so here's the green

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.109
option that's based on a Divided by 13 9/15.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:02:14.260
[music]

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And the other new model is high gain who's green
option is based on the diezel herbert.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:50.659
[music]

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.019
The effects section has also had some serious
refinements and the number of effects on offer

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.420
has increased to 20 which also includes some
new brand new options. For example here's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.420
an idea of what the smart harmony effect can
sound like and obviously we're in the key of E.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:25.549
[music]

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.700
The second of the new effects is pitch glide
and here we're going to use the pedal on the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.700
optional short board mark 2 to allow the effect
to do its thing.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:59.739
[music]

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.120
Let's have a closer look at the front panel.
The 16 amp models can be selected here and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.659
they gain edited to taste with the drive pot.
The bulk of the effects can be accessed and

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.049
edited via a number of smart effects controls
and the navigation disc and preset knob that

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.840
are located on the right of the amps front
panel. For example to add chorus into your

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.880
tone, use this smart effect pot and rotate
it to the relevant location. You can edit

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.750
the effect speed pot in the usual manner and
notice how the LCD display shows you the increments.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.190
For more acurate and advanced editing, simply
press the preset knob to access the edit menu

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.950
and then scroll through the various options
using the navigation disc. Finally, here's

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.360
how to use and abuse the quick loop function. You can
access it via the quick loop button, but we're

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.970
going to use a short board for simplicity.
So to get into loop mode, we press the function

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.760
2 button on the foot switch, now we can start
or stop the loop using the tap foot switch,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.760
so here we go.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:19.080
[music]

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.080
Now let's play over the top of that using
another sound for added drama.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:39.240
[music]

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.240
And now lets lay another over those 2 tones.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:06:06.900
[music]

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.210
There we go, that's how to use a quick loop
function. We can promise that all loops were

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.760
played live, look there's nothing up my sleeve,
honest. For much more on the Line 6 spider

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.960
4 make sure you read the execellently written
review in this months magazine.
