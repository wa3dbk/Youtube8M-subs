unfortunately because of the color that
I<00:02:12.180> got<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.659> don't<00:02:12.900> think<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.410> really

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
I got I don't think it really

I got I don't think it really
highlighted<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.460> area<00:02:14.760> much<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.600> did<00:02:15.900> go

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
highlighted that area much but I did go

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.860 
highlighted that area much but I did go
ahead<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.319> set<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.830> with

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
ahead and set it with

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.690 
ahead and set it with
-<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.990> see<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.170> contour<00:02:19.650> kit<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.100> used<00:02:20.340> the

- I see a contour kit and I used the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.390 
- I see a contour kit and I used the
banana<00:02:21.150> powder<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.320> did<00:02:22.590> brighten<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.160> that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
banana powder so it did brighten up that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.670 
banana powder so it did brighten up that
color<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.820> little<00:02:24.000> bit<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.570> act<00:02:25.410> for<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.850 
color a little bit and act for the
foundation<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.430> also<00:02:27.240> set<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.690> with<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.170> bronzer

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.740 
foundation I also set it with a bronzer
and<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.550> used<00:02:29.940> my<00:02:30.590> Rimmel<00:02:31.910> bronzer<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.360> add

a<00:02:33.780> little<00:02:34.170> bit<00:02:34.410> more<00:02:34.620> color<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> skin<00:02:35.610> but

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
a little bit more color to the skin but

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.730 
a little bit more color to the skin but
the<00:02:36.360> color<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.870> picked<00:02:37.200> up<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.530> actually

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
skin type and overall I just think these

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.280 
skin type and overall I just think these
products<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.830> amazing<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:45.300> concealer<00:02:45.900> it

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
products are amazing the concealer it

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.800 
products are amazing the concealer it
really<00:02:46.740> doesn't<00:02:47.190> budge<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.850> will<00:02:48.060> stay<00:02:48.480> under

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
really doesn't budge it will stay under

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.500 
really doesn't budge it will stay under
your<00:02:49.140> eyes<00:02:49.350> for<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.010> longest<00:02:50.459> time<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.150> it's

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
your eyes for the longest time and it's

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.990 
your eyes for the longest time and it's
so<00:02:51.750> weird<00:02:51.990> even<00:02:52.470> when<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.709> go<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.950> wash<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.820> off

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
so weird even when you go to wash it off

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.370 
so weird even when you go to wash it off
um

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
um

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.860 
um
it's<00:02:56.370> like<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.700> have<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.150> use<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> makeup

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
it's like you have to use a makeup

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.229 
it's like you have to use a makeup
remover<00:02:58.080> or<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.709> definitely<00:02:59.190> use<00:02:59.430> water<00:02:59.910> and

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
remover or I definitely use water and

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.320 
remover or I definitely use water and
soap<00:03:00.600> because<00:03:01.350> if<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:02.040> put<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.970> water

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
soap because if you put just water

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.050 
soap because if you put just water
there's<00:03:04.320> still<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> layer<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.910> if

there's still a layer of it it's as if

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.270 
there's still a layer of it it's as if
it's<00:03:06.209> kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:06.690> waterproof<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.709> really

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
it's kind of like waterproof so I really
