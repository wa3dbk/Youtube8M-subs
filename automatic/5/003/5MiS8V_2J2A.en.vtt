and<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.910> decided<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.480> quickly<00:02:22.720> check<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> reef

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
and I decided to quickly check the reef

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.839 
and I decided to quickly check the reef
because<00:02:23.739> we<00:02:23.860> know<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.160> reef<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.459> going<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.760> be

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
because we know the reef is going to be

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.180 
because we know the reef is going to be
a<00:02:25.030> playable<00:02:25.450> area<00:02:25.690> when<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.440> house<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:27.040> wolves

expansion<00:02:27.819> launches<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.870> would<00:02:29.019> seem

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
expansion launches and it would seem

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.229 
expansion launches and it would seem
that<00:02:29.290> they<00:02:29.530> have<00:02:29.709> updated<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.519> menu<00:02:30.879> as<00:02:31.030> you

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
that they have updated the menu as you

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.509 
that they have updated the menu as you
can<00:02:31.390> see<00:02:31.690> from<00:02:31.870> here<00:02:31.959> we<00:02:32.440> now<00:02:32.620> have<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.160> huge

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
can see from here we now have this huge

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.460 
can see from here we now have this huge
circle<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.360> middle<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:35.080> have<00:02:35.230> sort<00:02:35.440> of

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.440 
circle in the middle and we have sort of
three<00:02:35.709> circles<00:02:36.160> round<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.060> I'm<00:02:37.269> not

the prison of elders new activity we're
going<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.250> be<00:02:51.310> seeing<00:02:51.519> as<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> other

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
going to be seeing as for what the other

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.660 
going to be seeing as for what the other
ones<00:02:52.780> are<00:02:52.959> I'm<00:02:53.380> not<00:02:53.560> entirely<00:02:53.860> sure<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.640> of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
ones are I'm not entirely sure one of

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.400 
ones are I'm not entirely sure one of
them<00:02:54.849> could<00:02:55.180> possibly<00:02:55.599> be<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.870> trials<00:02:56.380> of

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
them could possibly be the trials of

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.960 
them could possibly be the trials of
Osiris<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.160> don't<00:02:57.340> think<00:02:57.459> that's<00:02:57.610> taking

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
Osiris but I don't think that's taking

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.729 
Osiris but I don't think that's taking
place<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.420> reef<00:02:58.599> so<00:02:58.930> as<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.470> what<00:02:59.650> these

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
place on the reef so as to what these

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.559 
place on the reef so as to what these
