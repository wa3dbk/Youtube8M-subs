00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.740 
guys really liked last week's video
which<00:00:07.980> was<00:00:08.189> actually<00:00:08.700> pretty<00:00:09.059> surprising<00:00:09.510> to

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
which was actually pretty surprising to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.870 
which was actually pretty surprising to
me<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.679> decided<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> note<00:00:11.490> we're<00:00:11.610> gonna<00:00:11.730> go

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
me so I decided to note we're gonna go

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.400 
me so I decided to note we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.120> take<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> look<00:00:12.660> at<00:00:12.840> another<00:00:12.960> glitch

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
ahead and take a look at another glitch

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.470 
ahead and take a look at another glitch
actually<00:00:14.130> decided<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.670> long<00:00:14.880> time<00:00:15.179> ago

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
actually decided this a long time ago

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.420 
actually decided this a long time ago
before<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.960> even<00:00:16.049> made<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.010> last<00:00:17.130> video

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
before I even made that last video

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.800 
before I even made that last video
whatever<00:00:17.940> whatever<00:00:18.420> we're<00:00:18.539> gonna<00:00:18.600> take

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
whatever whatever we're gonna take

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 
whatever whatever we're gonna take
another<00:00:18.900> look<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> glitch<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.460> today<00:00:20.880> we're

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
another look at a glitch and today we're

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.880 
another look at a glitch and today we're
taking<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.510> look<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.869> how<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.350> down<00:00:22.560> into

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
taking a look at how to get down into

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.370 
taking a look at how to get down into
this<00:00:23.189> pit<00:00:23.460> by<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> gold<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.869> actually

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
this pit by all of the gold I actually

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620 
this pit by all of the gold I actually
made<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> video<00:00:26.189> about<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.699> glitch<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.180> long

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
made a video about this glitch a long

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.140 
made a video about this glitch a long
time<00:00:27.990> ago<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.160> method<00:00:29.369> has<00:00:29.640> long<00:00:29.880> since

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
time ago but that method has long since

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.810 
time ago but that method has long since
been<00:00:30.330> patched<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.279> actually<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.399> week<00:00:32.640> in

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
been patched and actually this week in

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.020 
been patched and actually this week in
5.4<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.780> released<00:00:34.110> 5.4<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:35.430> fixed

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
5.4 when they released 5.4 they fixed

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.869 
5.4 when they released 5.4 they fixed
how<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:37.020> mount<00:00:37.710> glitching<00:00:38.399> through<00:00:38.640> walls

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
how the mount glitching through walls

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.700 
how the mount glitching through walls
works<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.690> no<00:00:39.870> longer<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
works you can no longer do that you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.860 
works you can no longer do that you
instantly<00:00:41.100> get<00:00:41.370> dismounted<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.719> just

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
instantly get dismounted and you just

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.420 
instantly get dismounted and you just
cannot<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.590> through<00:00:43.739> walls<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.280> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
cannot get through walls with that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.520 
cannot get through walls with that
method<00:00:44.640> anymore<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> actually<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
method anymore so you actually have to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
method anymore so you actually have to
use<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> disconnect<00:00:47.460> macro<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.390> able<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> get

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
use a disconnect macro to be able to get

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.930 
use a disconnect macro to be able to get
through<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> walls<00:00:49.200> which<00:00:49.469> they'll<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.940> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
through the walls which they'll be you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.100 
through the walls which they'll be you
can<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.090> copy<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.510> paste<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
can just copy and paste it from the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.650 
can just copy and paste it from the
description<00:00:52.440> it'll<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.920> down<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.660> just

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
description it'll be down there and just

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660 
description it'll be down there and just
copy<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:54.989> into<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> macro<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.829> use<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.460> when

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
copy that into a macro and use that when

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
copy that into a macro and use that when
you're<00:00:56.699> doing<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.239> anyways<00:00:57.539> we're<00:00:58.050> gonna

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you're doing this so anyways we're gonna

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.200 
you're doing this so anyways we're gonna
be<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.590> start<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.460> glitches<00:00:59.850> right

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
be going to start this glitches right

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
be going to start this glitches right
over<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.500> ramp<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.309> see

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
over here on this ramp as you can see

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.939 
over here on this ramp as you can see
there's<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:03.350> little<00:01:04.350> area<00:01:04.769> right

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
there's like a little little area right

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
there's like a little little area right
here<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.309> able<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> stand<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
here that you're able to stand on and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.840 
here that you're able to stand on and
get<00:01:06.900> stuck<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.890> once<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.700> in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
get stuck in there so once you get in

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.370 
get stuck in there so once you get in
there<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.200> ahead<00:01:10.260> and

there just like this go ahead and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.289 
there just like this go ahead and
dismount<00:01:10.799> move<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.189> little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:11.820> just

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

anyways so now that you have a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
anyways so now that you have a
disconnect<00:01:19.590> macro<00:01:20.100> you're<00:01:20.490> gonna<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> go

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
disconnect macro you're gonna want to go

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
disconnect macro you're gonna want to go
ahead<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.420> mount<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.140> onto<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.650> flying

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
ahead and mount up onto your flying

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.030 
ahead and mount up onto your flying
mount<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.090> normally<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.740> as

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
mount as you normally would and then as

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.380 
mount as you normally would and then as
you<00:01:26.400> are<00:01:26.520> mounting<00:01:26.820> you're<00:01:26.939> gonna<00:01:27.030> use<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you are mounting you're gonna use the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.999 
you are mounting you're gonna use the
disconnect<00:01:28.020> macro<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.560> gonna<00:01:28.650> make<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
disconnect macro it's gonna make the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
disconnect macro it's gonna make the
screen<00:01:29.250> look<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.729> weird<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> it'll

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
screen look a little weird and it'll

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
screen look a little weird and it'll
probably<00:01:31.049> mess<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> recording<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:33.060> we're

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
probably mess up the recording but we're

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.109 
probably mess up the recording but we're
gonna<00:01:33.270> roll<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.939> yeah

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
gonna roll with it and yeah

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.130 
gonna roll with it and yeah
so<00:01:36.270> let's<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.540> ahead<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> we're

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
so let's go ahead and do this we're

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.539 
so let's go ahead and do this we're
gonna<00:01:37.200> mount<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.799> while<00:01:38.070> we're<00:01:38.250> mounting

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
gonna mount up and while we're mounting

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
gonna mount up and while we're mounting
up<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> disconnect<00:01:39.509> macro<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.500> can

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
up use the disconnect macro as you can

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.399 
up use the disconnect macro as you can
see<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.850> UI<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.930> messing<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
see up here with my UI it is messing it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.569 
see up here with my UI it is messing it
up<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.820> anyways<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.350> suspected<00:01:46.579> my

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
up so anyways just as I suspected my

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.300 
up so anyways just as I suspected my
recording<00:01:48.329> got<00:01:48.479> absolutely<00:01:49.040> obliterated<00:01:50.040> by

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
recording got absolutely obliterated by

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.980 
recording got absolutely obliterated by
getting<00:01:50.670> disconnected<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.509> totally<00:01:51.810> messed

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
getting disconnected it totally messed

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.399 
getting disconnected it totally messed
up<00:01:52.250> fraps<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.399> how<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:53.700> gone<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.750> anyways

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
up fraps and how that's gone so anyways

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
up fraps and how that's gone so anyways
we<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.680> back<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> game<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:56.790> where

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
we are back in the game now right where

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.719 
we are back in the game now right where
we<00:01:57.060> left<00:01:57.210> off<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:59.040> walked<00:01:59.280> back<00:01:59.460> in

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
we left off and we just walked back in

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
we left off and we just walked back in
so<00:02:00.210> once<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> log<00:02:00.659> back<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.530> should<00:02:01.740> be

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
so once you log back in you should be

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.590 
so once you log back in you should be
able<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.159> hit<00:02:02.280> spacebar<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.030> go<00:02:03.240> through

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
able to just hit spacebar and go through

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.810 
able to just hit spacebar and go through
the<00:02:03.750> wall<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.460> think

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the wall just like that I just think

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.459 
the wall just like that I just think
it's<00:02:05.909> pretty<00:02:06.149> simple<00:02:06.869> compared<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.350> other

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
it's pretty simple compared to the other

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.949 
it's pretty simple compared to the other
method<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.099> take<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.520> very<00:02:08.759> long<00:02:08.970> time<00:02:09.450> with

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
method it can take a very long time with

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.809 
method it can take a very long time with
the<00:02:10.080> other<00:02:10.259> method<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.860> mounting<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the other method of mounting up and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.280 
the other method of mounting up and
jumping<00:02:12.030> through<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.209> wall<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.569> because

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
jumping through the wall just because

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.959 
jumping through the wall just because
it<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:14.099> hard<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.430> get<00:02:14.579> that<00:02:14.670> timing

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
it is really hard to get that timing

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.309 
it is really hard to get that timing
down<00:02:15.299> so<00:02:15.510> anyways<00:02:15.750> once<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.019> get<00:02:16.140> through<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
down so anyways once you get through the

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.869 
down so anyways once you get through the
wall<00:02:16.349> just<00:02:16.709> go<00:02:16.799> ahead<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.099> move<00:02:17.189> forward<00:02:17.219> and

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
wall just go ahead and move forward and

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.459 
wall just go ahead and move forward and
you'll<00:02:18.209> see<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.629> cleft<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.989> shadows<00:02:19.290> below

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
you'll see the cleft of shadows below

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.199 
you'll see the cleft of shadows below
you<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:19.799> just<00:02:19.980> keep<00:02:20.159> going<00:02:20.459> down<00:02:20.640> over

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
you but just keep going down over

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.199 
you but just keep going down over
towards<00:02:21.840> here<00:02:22.140> towards<00:02:22.469> this<00:02:22.620> wall<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.969> this

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
towards here towards this wall so this

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.940 
towards here towards this wall so this
is<00:02:24.359> actually<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> hard<00:02:24.989> part<00:02:25.230> probably<00:02:25.769> where

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
is actually the hard part probably where

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.399 
is actually the hard part probably where
you're<00:02:26.040> gonna<00:02:26.129> fail<00:02:26.540> quite<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.569> few<00:02:27.810> times<00:02:28.049> but

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
you're gonna fail quite a few times but

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.849 
you're gonna fail quite a few times but
just<00:02:28.620> keep<00:02:28.799> going<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.879> keep<00:02:29.939> going<00:02:30.209> and

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
just keep going and keep going and

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.309 
just keep going and keep going and
eventually<00:02:31.859> you'll<00:02:32.099> get<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:33.319> definitely

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
eventually you'll get to here definitely

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.020 
eventually you'll get to here definitely
a<00:02:34.349> change<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.829> scenery<00:02:35.069> as<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.519> can<00:02:35.640> tell<00:02:35.819> went

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
a change in scenery as you can tell went

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.899 
a change in scenery as you can tell went
from<00:02:36.120> purple<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:37.200> orange<00:02:37.590> brown<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.670> anyway

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
from purple to orange brown but anyway

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.059 
from purple to orange brown but anyway
just<00:02:38.939> go<00:02:39.780> up<00:02:40.019> in<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.560> air<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.950> then<00:02:41.040> you

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
just go up in the air and then you

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.890 
just go up in the air and then you
should<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.549> able<00:02:41.609> to<00:02:41.730> go<00:02:41.819> forward<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.719> like

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
should be able to go forward just like

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.830 
should be able to go forward just like
this<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.620> then<00:02:44.250> go<00:02:44.519> down<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:45.510> want<00:02:45.659> to<00:02:45.780> go

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
this and then go down you want to go

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.750 
this and then go down you want to go
down<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.439> don't<00:02:46.829> accidentally<00:02:47.459> come

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
down so that you don't accidentally come

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.460 
down so that you don't accidentally come
through<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:48.030> ground<00:02:48.269> once<00:02:48.510> again<00:02:48.810> or<00:02:49.049> go<00:02:49.260> into

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
through the ground once again or go into

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.750 
through the ground once again or go into
a<00:02:49.500> building<00:02:49.769> because<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.549> you're<00:02:50.670> gonna

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
a building because then you're gonna

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.280 
a building because then you're gonna
have<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:50.909> redo<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.359> disconnect<00:02:51.810> glitch<00:02:52.049> all

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
have to redo the disconnect glitch all

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.949 
have to redo the disconnect glitch all
over<00:02:52.590> again<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.790> tends<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.239> be<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.450> pain

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
over again and that tends to be a pain

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.259 
over again and that tends to be a pain
after<00:02:55.349> a<00:02:55.379> while<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:56.430> anyways<00:02:56.700> now<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.030> are

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
after a while but anyways now we are

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.229 
after a while but anyways now we are
underneath<00:02:57.540> Orgrimmar<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.439> is<00:02:58.590> actually

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
underneath Orgrimmar this is actually

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.909 
underneath Orgrimmar this is actually
how<00:03:00.239> you're<00:03:00.389> gonna<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.659> doing<00:03:01.139> a<00:03:01.319> lot<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
how you're gonna be doing a lot of the

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.319 
how you're gonna be doing a lot of the
glitches<00:03:02.159> getting<00:03:02.489> into<00:03:02.639> a<00:03:02.669> lot<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.090> different

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
glitches getting into a lot of different

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.550 
glitches getting into a lot of different
places<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.840> organizer<00:03:04.230> you're<00:03:04.409> obviously

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
places and organizer you're obviously

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.890 
places and organizer you're obviously
not<00:03:04.950> supposed<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.489> into<00:03:05.639> of<00:03:06.269> anyways<00:03:06.750> for

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
not supposed to get into of anyways for

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.030 
not supposed to get into of anyways for
this<00:03:07.049> video<00:03:07.260> we're<00:03:07.349> gonna<00:03:07.409> take<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.680> look<00:03:07.889> how

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
this video we're gonna take a look how

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.240 
this video we're gonna take a look how
to<00:03:08.099> get<00:03:08.340> underneath<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.659> bank<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.590> fly<00:03:10.980> over

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
to get underneath the bank so fly over

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.710 
to get underneath the bank so fly over
to<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> bank<00:03:11.549> as<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.849> can<00:03:11.970> see<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.359> is<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
to the bank as you can see here is the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.770 
to the bank as you can see here is the
bank<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.819> once<00:03:14.819> you're<00:03:15.000> underneath<00:03:15.419> it<00:03:15.599> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
bank and once you're underneath it the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.719 
bank and once you're underneath it the
way<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.930> tell<00:03:16.260> if<00:03:16.409> you're<00:03:16.560> gonna<00:03:16.709> be<00:03:16.919> inside

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
way to tell if you're gonna be inside

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.330 
way to tell if you're gonna be inside
the<00:03:18.389> actual<00:03:18.750> pit<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.139> gold<00:03:19.409> is<00:03:19.919> to<00:03:20.069> kind<00:03:20.250> of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the actual pit of gold is to kind of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280 
the actual pit of gold is to kind of
line<00:03:20.519> yourself<00:03:20.699> up<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.359> this<00:03:21.569> circle<00:03:22.109> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
line yourself up with this circle this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.280 
line yourself up with this circle this
circle<00:03:22.349> is<00:03:22.859> basically<00:03:23.459> where<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.479> pit<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.930> so

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
circle is basically where that pit is so

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.589 
circle is basically where that pit is so
once<00:03:25.590> you're<00:03:25.769> underneath<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:27.090> go<00:03:27.329> up

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
once you're underneath it just go up

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.960 
once you're underneath it just go up
just<00:03:28.139> like<00:03:28.349> slow<00:03:28.709> very<00:03:29.040> slowly<00:03:29.400> because<00:03:29.849> you

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
just like slow very slowly because you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.229 
just like slow very slowly because you
don't<00:03:30.299> want<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.659> go<00:03:30.810> through<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.709> pit<00:03:31.949> and<00:03:32.239> you

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
don't want to go through the pit and you

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.610 
don't want to go through the pit and you
would<00:03:33.389> once<00:03:33.569> again<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.840> up<00:03:34.169> here<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.530> have

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
would once again be up here and you have

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.830 
would once again be up here and you have
to<00:03:34.739> redo<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.190> glitch<00:03:35.459> all<00:03:35.669> over<00:03:35.940> again<00:03:36.180> but

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840

the<00:04:08.400> air<00:04:08.430> like<00:04:08.729> this<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.120> simply

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
the air like this and you just simply

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.140 
the air like this and you just simply
jump<00:04:09.840> again<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.259> get<00:04:10.859> out<00:04:11.099> so<00:04:11.669> you<00:04:11.729> no<00:04:12.120> longer
