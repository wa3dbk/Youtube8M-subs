00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi to all to the room in this video 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.170
 I presented a gameplay between gta 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.000
 5 pc gta5 ps4 at the base i wanted you 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.610
 let guess where were gta 5 pc and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.380
 where were gta5 ps4 given that we 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.089
 not really see the difference in a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.470
 video is especially when you have the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.600
 adequate material that we see the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.039
 difference but there is the mini map that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.930
 appears at the bottom left and the minimap 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.760
 she does not appear on the rock star 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.189
 publishers so that means I was at 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.720
 5 ps4 is on the left and gta 5 pc is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.550
 find on the right since to the right 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.309
 despite not seeing it there is no 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.690
 minimap she does not appear then the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.380
 difference between the two is the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.780
 fluidity 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 so that's for sure we do not see 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.360
 apparent low fluidity between the two 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 but I reassure you on pc there is a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.170
 fluidity who in who is still 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.059
 much more pronounced than I arose at 5 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.399
 ps4 so here I try to make you a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.250
 comparative on a video that is not 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.379
 very representative of the reality being 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.329
 given that the video she's not finally 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.340
 yes she is not in 4k do you want the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.859
 look not necessarily on a 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 screen 4k x terra end brief there is a whole 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.360
 which makes the comparison is especially 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.439
 at the level of what I'm going to tell you and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.540
 not what you see 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.850
 but it's true that at the level of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.830
 difference anyway it's not very 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.950
 huge if not when we have the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.939
 material then it takes on gta 5 pc 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.890
 what you need to know is that I have everything 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.150
 put on the cleat so I even put the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.430
 display distance to the cleat and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.720
 yet there is no difference it is 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.030
 to say that even when we play on a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.610
 screen 4 cases and we have all the material 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.770
 I need to reassure you 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.160
 we see almost the same thing on gta 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.930
 5 ps4 only on gta 5 pc off or after 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.850
 there we are at the sniper what you need to know 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.020
 is that sniper anyway 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.400
 if there was anyone on the beautiful mass 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.740
 that we could not have killed him 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.880
 returns to the same 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.229
 so what I did was that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.910
 I made a difference in the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.260
 gameplay why I did not do at 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.750
 content level simply because 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.420
 only on gta 5 pc apart from the rockstar 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.430
 publishers some music the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.400
 parameters that can be changed late there are 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.420
 nothing grandiose that makes it 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.000
 deserves a comparative content then there 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.710
 now i'm going to do i wanted everything 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.709
 simply make a comparison to big 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.570
 speed because on gta 5 pc i put 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.070
 end display I put everything to the bottom and 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.680
 in the settings is something that 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.730
 is called displaying details 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.070
 finally it seems to me that's it 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.480
 display details in full flight 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.160
 so in switch wings I think it's 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.230
 more stylish than if you were in the plane 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.360
 so we're going to look so that's true 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.360
 at the level of detail is sharper 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.680
 on gta 5 pc despite it being a 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.150
 1080p video 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.209
 we can see that at the level of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.470
 cc stars yes it's clearer we can 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.720
 say 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.160
 after the difference is not huge in 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.320
 plus there is also another thing that I have 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.290
 noticed is that on gta 5 pc that 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.160
 tremble less than on gta 5 ps4 and that to 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.140
 my opinion is due to the fluidity 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.140
 so then by putting all of them back on 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.840
 gta 5 pc when you go to play it's 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.580
 sure you will have a gaming experience 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.590
 which is simply beautiful 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.540
 after if you make videos on it 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.080
 it will be a little less it's all over 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.290
 is normal if you play gta 5 ps4 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.580
 with a morning a good material also this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.100
 will not be ugly either do that will 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.989
 not bad either but there will be when 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.750
 even a difference between the two and 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.540
 it's perfectly normal so here it is 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.860
 we're going to end up tasting a little bit of everything 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.810
 I will surely make other videos 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.969
 on gta 5 pc if you ever want to see 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.620
 something else if there ever is content 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.579
 that you want to see finally brief if you 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.349
 just want to discover 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.359
 other things about easter egg 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.879
 and I'll finish here on gta 5 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.469
 pc the easter egg will not have 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.560
 new indices as the 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.640
 Signs remain unclear whatever happens 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.900
 it's a shame I like it 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.040
 the hysterics I would have liked to discover 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.049
 new things 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.790
 unfortunately it will not be the case 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.230
 what I watched was blurry even 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.670
 on gta 5 pc 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.170
 that's all for this video and I 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.170
 tell you just now ciao
