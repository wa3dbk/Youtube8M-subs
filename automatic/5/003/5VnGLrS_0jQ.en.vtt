00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
why have we got an Autobot sign here

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.030 
why have we got an Autobot sign here
surely<00:00:39.239> idea<00:00:39.690> didn't<00:00:40.020> supply<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.800> an

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
surely idea didn't supply it with an

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
surely idea didn't supply it with an
autobot<00:00:41.670> sticker<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.450> would<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.840> correct

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
autobot sticker that would be correct

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.310 
autobot sticker that would be correct
I've<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> myself<00:00:44.280> from<00:00:44.640> reprolabels

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
I've got that myself from reprolabels

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
I've got that myself from reprolabels
calm<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.920> looks<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.520> lot<00:00:47.670> better<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.390> an

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
calm it just looks a lot better with an

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
color the wheels are exactly the same

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.439 
color the wheels are exactly the same
mold<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.340> classic<00:00:56.820> legends<00:00:57.149> class

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
bumblebee underneath the car we've got

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.290 
bumblebee underneath the car we've got
some<00:01:00.480> axle<00:01:01.109> detail<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.789> some

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
some axle detail here and we have some

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.870 
some axle detail here and we have some
axle<00:01:03.989> detail<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.100> well<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.549> nice

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
axle detail here as well a nice

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.359 
axle detail here as well a nice
representation<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:07.200> glyphs<00:01:07.619> vehicle<00:01:08.130> mode

let's<00:01:08.790> transform<00:01:09.390> her<00:01:09.770> transforms<00:01:10.770> exactly

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
let's transform her transforms exactly

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.429 
let's transform her transforms exactly
the<00:01:11.430> same<00:01:11.640> way<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> classic<00:01:12.600> legend<00:01:12.990> small

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the same way as the classic legend small

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.310 
the same way as the classic legend small
as<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.360> don't<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> base<00:01:16.049> pay

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
as you can see we don't have a base pay

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.649 
as you can see we don't have a base pay
instead<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> yellow<00:01:17.490> base<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.240> inside

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
instead we have a yellow base the inside

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.870 
instead we have a yellow base the inside
of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.960> limbs<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.500> gray<00:01:19.799> legs<00:01:20.430> are<00:01:20.640> gray

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
of the limbs are gray legs are gray

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.310 
of the limbs are gray legs are gray
let's<00:01:21.390> take<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> look<00:01:21.960> around<00:01:24.049> there<00:01:25.049> she<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
let's take a look around there she is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.380 
let's take a look around there she is
from<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> back

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.590 

on<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.660> arms<00:01:30.020> there's<00:01:30.260> not<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:30.590> great<00:01:30.890> deal<00:01:31.040> of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
on the arms there's not a great deal of

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.940 
on the arms there's not a great deal of
articulation<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.870> can<00:01:33.080> kind<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.560> have<00:01:33.770> the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
articulation you can kind of have the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.310 
articulation you can kind of have the
arms<00:01:34.250> like<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.730> because<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.600> chest<00:01:35.900> is<00:01:36.110> so

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
arms like this because the chest is so

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.780 
arms like this because the chest is so
big<00:01:36.650> when<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:36.980> put<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.220> arms<00:01:37.550> forward

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
big when you put the arms forward

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.490 
big when you put the arms forward
doesn't<00:01:38.360> quite<00:01:38.510> look<00:01:38.750> right<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.350> it's

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
doesn't quite look right so it's

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.230 
doesn't quite look right so it's
probably<00:01:39.680> best<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.070> keep<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.460> arms<00:01:40.790> down<00:01:41.000> I

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
probably best to keep the arms down I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.880 
probably best to keep the arms down I
don't<00:01:41.480> think<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.750> chest<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.200> too<00:01:42.410> bad<00:01:42.650> she

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
don't think the chest is too bad she

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.350 
don't think the chest is too bad she
looks<00:01:43.100> quite<00:01:43.340> good<00:01:43.370> in<00:01:43.700> our<00:01:43.790> proportions

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
looks quite good in our proportions

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.420 
looks quite good in our proportions
they're<00:01:44.690> all<00:01:44.900> in<00:01:45.110> all<00:01:45.230> it's<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.590> good<00:01:45.800> mold<00:01:46.100> she

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
they're all in all it's a good mold she

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.370 
they're all in all it's a good mold she
can<00:01:46.580> stand<00:01:46.910> up<00:01:47.120> properly<00:01:47.300> she<00:01:47.900> doesn't<00:01:48.200> fall

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
can stand up properly she doesn't fall

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.620 
can stand up properly she doesn't fall
over<00:01:48.410> she<00:01:49.010> has<00:01:49.220> an<00:01:49.460> extra<00:01:50.000> bit<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.300> plastic

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
over she has an extra bit of plastic

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.080 
over she has an extra bit of plastic
here<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.470> she<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:51.860> balance<00:01:52.190> all<00:01:52.580> right<00:01:52.820> at

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
here so she can balance all right at

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.590 
here so she can balance all right at
