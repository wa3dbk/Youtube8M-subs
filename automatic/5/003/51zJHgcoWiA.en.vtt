00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
right there you so then you're gonna

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.639 
right there you so then you're gonna
select<00:01:41.939> them<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.290> then

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
select them all like that and then

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859 
select them all like that and then
you're<00:01:43.799> gonna<00:01:43.920> press<00:01:44.130> extract<00:01:44.909> all<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.540> here

you're gonna press extract all up here

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.120 
you're gonna press extract all up here
now<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.860> Windows<00:01:47.280> 8<00:01:47.520> taken<00:01:48.149> mind<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:50.070> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
now this is Windows 8 taken mind so I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.639 
now this is Windows 8 taken mind so I
believe<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:50.939> very<00:01:51.240> similar<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.840> Windows<00:01:52.259> 7

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
believe it's very similar for Windows 7

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.600 
believe it's very similar for Windows 7
but<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> may<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.460> exactly<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.740> same<00:01:56.040> but

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
but it may not be exactly the same but

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
but it may not be exactly the same but
there<00:01:57.479> should<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> same<00:01:58.110> buttons<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
there should be the same buttons just a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.469 
there should be the same buttons just a
little<00:01:59.070> maybe<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.250> different<00:01:59.549> spot<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.270> once

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
little maybe a different spot so once

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.450 
little maybe a different spot so once
this<00:02:00.659> comes<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.009> browse

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
this comes up you're going to browse

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.340 
this comes up you're going to browse
your<00:02:03.270> things<00:02:04.250> your<00:02:05.250> files<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.000> then<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.600> think

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
your things your files and then I think

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.080 
your things your files and then I think
this<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.590> pretty<00:02:08.250> standard<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:08.789> everybody

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
this is pretty standard for everybody

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.760 
this is pretty standard for everybody
you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.539> go<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> libraries<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
you can go in the libraries and then it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.770 
you can go in the libraries and then it
should<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.009> think<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.400> music<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.540> if

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
should be think on music and now if
