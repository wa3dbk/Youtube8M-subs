00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.330
 Hello everybody, How are you 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.009
 good this video here a video a boxing 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 bringing to you to show 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.080
 the images here to show the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.140
 coop I bought means my mother 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.820
 bought for me is this a kit of the line 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.029
 Copic sketch is a skin tone kit by 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.920
 this comes only 16 tones here but 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.510
 we come back well because they make 6 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.430
 on a large scale on the boot 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.430
 and test here to show you 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.020
 ready for those who do not know many 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.160
 greed 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.230
 they have two ends this greater tip 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.430
 that if I'm not mistaken it's not tip 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.059
 beveled and it is midafternoon 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.230
 on here 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.170
 therefore it is suitable for larger areas and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.030
 other end to end brush style 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.729
 exactly the potential but it points 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.240
 Much like the tip of the pen blush 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.810
 is it for you to pick up the parts 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.509
 details can be small 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.340
 do it without much trouble and also gives 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.100
 for you to do the great 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.860
 well with the bevelled tip but I think 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.250
 she use I mean she'll use it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.140
 more detailed detail the other tones 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.570
 here rises to a tone but 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.860
 a more normal skin tone than this 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:46.050
 rose here and subsequently gets 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:50.040
 a moreno tone test them all here 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.660
 This is a partidinho more or less. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.000
 one month 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.909
 When you get the coop you 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.550
 first time and use it on paper you 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.640
 It will probably surprise you because 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.190
 when you pass it on the paper she kinda 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.410
 which dampens the paper and is left with a 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.130
 It's strange that after a while 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.400
 that tone is going to settles and will pick up 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.540
 the original the correct pen tone that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.850
 you are wearing 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.880
 I'm going to pick up now and have a drawing. 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.110
 I worry about the time I 'll paint the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.110
 show more or less how it is 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.769
 nobody 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 ae 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.200
 well this is the end result I 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.420
 I could use the coop is not one 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.600
 wonder I just started using 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.470
 copic same but the trend is always 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.750
 improve 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.880
 I'll leave in the video description the 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.860
 link from the site where I bought this kit and 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.470
 from where I also bought my 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.849
 grimaces in the fifth I always use is the site 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.110
 officer of the coop who then is well 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.880
 trustworthy 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.290
 the video is getting personal here 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.450
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.130
 Let me call you for that bitch. 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.770

 comment and I will respond and it is 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.760
