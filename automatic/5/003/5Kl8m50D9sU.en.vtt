different sound voices of it and it

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.840 
different sound voices of it and it
saves<00:00:45.899> me<00:00:46.079> muting<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.559> few<00:00:47.219> audio<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.700> much

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850

UFC<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:05.010> general<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.610> sort<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> clunky<00:01:06.420> in

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
UFC in general is sort of clunky in

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.950 
UFC in general is sort of clunky in
terms<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> his<00:01:06.810> fighting<00:01:07.170> styles<00:01:08.930> gameplay<00:01:09.930> i

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
terms of his fighting styles gameplay i

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.469 
terms of his fighting styles gameplay i
think<00:01:10.170> i<00:01:10.229> could<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.470> used<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:10.979> side<00:01:11.159> lunge

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
think i could get used to one side lunge

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.789 
think i could get used to one side lunge
hold<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> counters<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.290> everything<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
hold the counters and everything and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.649 
hold the counters and everything and
submissions<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.850> seemed<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.119> clunky<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
submissions just seemed a bit clunky to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.380 
submissions just seemed a bit clunky to
get<00:01:15.840> into<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.610> might<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.850> because<00:01:18.060> i

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
get into but that might be because i

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.789 
get into but that might be because i
don't<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.659> how<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.200> properly<00:01:19.350> yet

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
don't know how to do them properly yet

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.210 
don't know how to do them properly yet
and<00:01:20.659> yet<00:01:21.659> when<00:01:21.810> i<00:01:21.840> played<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> demo<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.560> far<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and yet when i played the demo so far it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
and yet when i played the demo so far it
hasn't<00:01:23.460> been<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.880> game<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.390> gone<00:01:24.509> more<00:01:24.810> than

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
hasn't been one game it's gone more than

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
hasn't been one game it's gone more than
two<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.860> first<00:01:26.070> round<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.640> down<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
two the first round this one down the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.140 
two the first round this one down the
last<00:01:27.180> minute<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.500> never<00:01:28.799> more<00:01:29.369> than<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.939> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
last minute but never more than that is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.550 
last minute but never more than that is
a<00:01:30.180> managed<00:01:31.520> superman<00:01:32.520> cuz<00:01:33.170> sometimes<00:01:34.170> off<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
a managed superman cuz sometimes off the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.810 
a managed superman cuz sometimes off the
cage<00:01:34.740> though<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.310> because<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
cage though you get because of the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.649 
cage though you get because of the
physics<00:01:36.150> engine<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.659> place<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:39.299> basically<00:01:40.460> mmm

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
physics engine in place it basically mmm

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.240 
physics engine in place it basically mmm
sort<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.810> doesn't<00:01:43.110> detect<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> opponent's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
sort of doesn't detect if the opponent's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.499 
sort of doesn't detect if the opponent's
kicking<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:44.880> fall<00:01:45.180> off<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
kicking you so you don't fall off the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.149 
kicking you so you don't fall off the
side<00:01:45.960> when<00:01:46.140> you're<00:01:46.229> jumping<00:01:46.560> off<00:01:46.680> Winston's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
side when you're jumping off Winston's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
side when you're jumping off Winston's
so<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.119> sort<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> lacking<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.720> regard<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
so it's sort of lacking that regard and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.590 
so it's sort of lacking that regard and
there's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.710> knockout<00:01:50.310> Superman<00:01:50.970> punch<00:01:51.360> off

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
there's a knockout Superman punch off

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.889 
there's a knockout Superman punch off
the<00:01:51.659> cave<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.740> then<00:01:53.670> he<00:01:54.329> doesn't<00:01:54.659> have

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the cave and then he doesn't have

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.230 
the cave and then he doesn't have
children<00:01:55.079> anymore<00:01:56.750> hat<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.790> quality<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
children anymore hat is the quality of
