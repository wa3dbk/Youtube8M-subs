00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.270 
new explosions in the sky album I had
such<00:01:39.000> such<00:01:39.570> high<00:01:39.840> hopes<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> mean<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
such such high hopes for that I mean I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.440 
such such high hopes for that I mean I
know<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.000> didn't<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:44.100> first<00:01:44.939> song<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
know I didn't like the first song to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.840 
know I didn't like the first song to
drop<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.350> LP<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.280> much<00:01:47.579> but

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
drop from that LP all that much but

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.270 
drop from that LP all that much but
still<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.869> thought<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> other<00:01:49.950> tracks

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
still I thought that the other tracks

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.999 
still I thought that the other tracks
would<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:52.020> bit<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> offer<00:01:52.680> me

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
would have a little bit more to offer me

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.280

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.849 
release I felt were very subpar in
comparison<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.400> previous<00:02:32.909> jesu<00:02:33.859> releases

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
comparison to previous jesu releases

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.369 
comparison to previous jesu releases
next<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.390> not<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.900> one<00:02:37.140> was

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
next you know it's not like this one was

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.710 
next you know it's not like this one was
the<00:02:37.560> worst<00:02:37.970> release<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.299> world<00:02:39.480> I

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
the worst release in the world I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.149 
the worst release in the world I
definitely<00:02:40.170> think<00:02:40.379> this<00:02:40.500> band<00:02:40.709> can<00:02:40.920> bounce

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
definitely think this band can bounce

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.759 
definitely think this band can bounce
back<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.849> make<00:02:42.299> something<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.379> love

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
back and make something that that I love

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.759 
back and make something that that I love
again<00:02:44.430> they<00:02:44.970> still<00:02:45.299> have<00:02:45.780> their<00:02:46.019> style<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.739> just

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
again they still have their style I just

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.379 
again they still have their style I just
feel<00:02:47.129> like<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.549> know<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.090> tunes
