normally<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.000> find<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.540> better<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.870> do<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> like

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
normally I find it better to do it like

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.250 
normally I find it better to do it like
if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.950> have<00:00:23.190> a<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:23.460> good<00:00:23.700> position<00:00:24.140> do<00:00:25.140> it

if you have a very good position do it

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500 
if you have a very good position do it
that<00:00:25.440> same<00:00:25.650> way<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.610> of<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:27.090> variable<00:00:27.450> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that same way because of you variable to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.760 
that same way because of you variable to
get<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> little<00:00:27.810> bit<00:00:27.990> more<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.230> flake<00:00:28.500> without

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
get a little bit more of a flake without

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.370 
get a little bit more of a flake without
too<00:00:28.890> much<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.100> a<00:00:29.160> catch<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.520> your<00:00:29.640> back<00:00:29.760> foot

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
your front foot you're gonna kind of

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
your front foot you're gonna kind of
slide<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.560> or<00:00:38.130> sometimes<00:00:38.700> just

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
slide it out like that or sometimes just

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
slide it out like that or sometimes just
kick<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.120> straight<00:00:39.329> off<00:00:39.690> whichever<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.290> will

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
kick it straight off whichever one will

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.069 
kick it straight off whichever one will
work<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:41.250> find<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.060> easier<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.540> kind<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.900> trick

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
work I find it easier just kind of trick

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.479 
work I find it easier just kind of trick
or<00:00:43.110> treat<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.900> guess<00:00:46.190> maybe<00:00:47.190> someone

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
or treat it like a I guess maybe someone

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.000 
or treat it like a I guess maybe someone
like<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.640> scissor<00:00:47.880> kick<00:00:48.560> it's<00:00:49.560> where<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.890> like

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
like a scissor kick it's where I go like

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.850 
like a scissor kick it's where I go like
this<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:52.110> foot<00:00:52.380> will<00:00:52.500> bring<00:00:52.710> this

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
this and it that foot will bring this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.639 
this and it that foot will bring this
pop<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> way<00:00:53.880> this<00:00:54.690> button<00:00:54.989> flick<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.530> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
pop that way this button flick but it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.830 
pop that way this button flick but it
won't<00:00:55.829> catch<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.280> nose<00:00:56.460> it'll<00:00:56.790> just<00:00:56.840> flick

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
won't catch the nose it'll just flick

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.459 
won't catch the nose it'll just flick
off<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.489> it'll<00:00:59.489> make<00:00:59.700> it<00:00:59.820> flip<00:01:00.120> without

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
off and it'll make it flip without

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.200 
off and it'll make it flip without
canceling<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.559> rotation<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.640> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
canceling this rotation so I do it it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
canceling this rotation so I do it it
goes<00:01:03.360> in<00:01:03.480> between<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.840> legs<00:01:04.019> does<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.829> flip

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
goes in between my legs does the flip

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.620 
goes in between my legs does the flip
and<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.000> catch<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.540> plan<00:01:08.450> sometimes<00:01:09.450> when

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and I catch it and plan sometimes when

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450 
and I catch it and plan sometimes when
you<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:10.020> foot<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.770> I've<00:01:11.130> seen<00:01:11.310> some

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
you have your foot and I've seen some

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.610 
you have your foot and I've seen some
people<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> where<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.080> most<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
people do it where they have most of the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.990 
people do it where they have most of the
foot<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.450> versus<00:01:15.450> having<00:01:15.690> just<00:01:15.930> their<00:01:16.080> heel<00:01:16.290> on

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
foot on versus having just their heel on

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.780 
foot on versus having just their heel on
you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.920> but<00:01:19.920> most<00:01:20.400> of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
you can do it that way but most of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.190 
you can do it that way but most of
caffeic<00:01:21.210> castles<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> rotations<00:01:22.110> because

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
caffeic castles of rotations because

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.390 
caffeic castles of rotations because
when<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.159> pop<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.790> you'll<00:01:24.540> flick<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.400> too

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
when you pop it you'll flick out and too

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.070 
when you pop it you'll flick out and too
much<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:26.760> foots<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.659> time<00:01:27.869> he<00:01:27.930> gets

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
much of your foots on about time he gets

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.570 
much of your foots on about time he gets
here<00:01:28.260> here's<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.619> heel<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:28.979> it'll<00:01:29.310> hit<00:01:29.490> it

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
here here's your heel and it'll hit it

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.240 
here here's your heel and it'll hit it
and<00:01:29.970> I'll<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:31.260> that<00:01:31.470> same<00:01:31.890> going

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and I'll just do it like that same going

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.670 
and I'll just do it like that same going
all<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> way<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
boards kind of bending this way I'm kind

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.219 
boards kind of bending this way I'm kind
of<00:01:46.140> over<00:01:46.410> dramatis<00:01:46.770> izing<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.190> but<00:01:47.870> this<00:01:48.870> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
of over dramatis izing it but this is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.420 
of over dramatis izing it but this is
what<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> should<00:01:49.500> feel<00:01:49.800> like<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.160> shouldn't
