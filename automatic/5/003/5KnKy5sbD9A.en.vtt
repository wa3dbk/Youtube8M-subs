00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.510
 welcome comrades gamers in some way 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.109
 always want to start the review with 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.490
 estimates bioshok infinite 10 out of 10 comrades 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.859
 10 out of 10 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.690
 and if you haven't played it yet 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:33.379
 should do this son bioshock came out 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:35.660
 that words will be sent to the player this time 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.460
 Colombia aerial city main character 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.249
 for debt agreed to pull out 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.260
 Elizabeth had many fears 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.809
 which is a porting of the game from under 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.550
 Water in the sky will be detrimental and in fact 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.829
 this turned out to be the best solution 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.690
 developers first colombia just 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.690
 inhumanly super beautiful and 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.680
 you can just walk around the city to 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.560
 look in different lanes here 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.900
 admire the sky look at people yes 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.240
 there is no next-gen chart but bioshock 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.920
 really surprising and startling after 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.760
 this game you will be all 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.800
 telling wow there was so cool in 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.050
 second such branded utopian 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.420
 the bioshock atmosphere here even turned out 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.869
 better than in past games it is 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.070
 atmosphere when around with posters and 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.080
 loudspeakers are different hucksters and 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.970
 corrupt officials shout that all 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.670
 good what do they care about 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.680
 well-being of the people but only we know 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.430
 that everything is really rotten here 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.880
 through 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.800
 familiar is not it brother-Slavs plus 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.810
 create an atmosphere contribute 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 cut scenes from the first person only 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.009
 so a gamer gets a lot better at 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.710
 image of a hero to really feel 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.410
 events something like this 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.300
 half-life 2 to bioshock really me 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.970
 I can put it in one row and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.800
 no you kintsa Yakuts and by the way 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 know why all console gamers are fat 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.979
 wear healthy lives and 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.179
 but why and where to put 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.340
 bucket of popcorn go to the most 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.680
 interesting backbone of the game is 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.910
 exactly shooter and clearly worked 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.160
 gameplay mechanics 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.740
 there are many opportunities and fight 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.660
 really interesting to start at 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.510
 bioshock and just awesome cool 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.790
 shoot yes just shoot and everything is not 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.740
 I know how anyone but I have never yet in 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.900
 Battle is not in the paint and the third is not so 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.510
 delivered just shoot a shotgun 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.270
 and my favorite guns have become 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.310
 carbine and power revolver last time 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.950
 i'm so fantastic perla only 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.260
 probably in an ideal storm but 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.540
 there are many other different chips 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.120
 for example , such a mechanical hook 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.400
 or something like that firstly it cuts well 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.650
 heads to enemies in melee and secondly 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.650
 allows you to cling to such rails 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.110
 and drive back and forth just but also very 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.370
 fun yes and hand-to-hand combat very often 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.370
 helps out in hot battle 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.520
 don't go anywhere and call it that 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.560
 we are plasmids or energetics it 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.720
 body modifications that allow 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.030
 you can do all sorts of different things 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.280
 raise the crowds for years or there 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.500
 throwing fire grenades or just 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.150
 electric shock can also 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.519
 force tour or or different 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.959
 mechanical dudes fight for you but 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.560
 I personally like best 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.560
 killer crows 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.660
 by the way about the elizabeth the player will have to 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.819
 spend almost the whole game with her and from her 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.010
 also I have a sense in the first place it can 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.290
 open locks secondly she constantly 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.989
 equip the player with cartridges of health 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.910
 money and in a particularly hard fight for example 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.940
 Only during I will throw that first-aid kit 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.890
 can save all the work and even the girl 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.989
 can open gaps into another world and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.940
 deliver from there all sorts of different nishtyaki 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.630
 Like there guns or mechanical 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.790
 patriots 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.459
 by the way with this ability will be associated 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.209
 such turns in the plot well in general 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.700
 see everything 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.250
 have not gone away and vending machines in 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.170
 you can pump energy guns or 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.739
 just refill ammo and 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.049
 first-aid kits 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.120
 separately what I want to note in front of us 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.889
 real mother and you take game this 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.500
 clear gameplay mechanics which 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.810
 wrapped in chic design 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.060
 and a great atmosphere that way and 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.039
 must be made games and the most pleasant 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.169
 what did her real peaks make 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.090
 irrational games developers 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.550
 at one time they released system shock 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.030
 2 freedom force triple with one of 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.700
 parts 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.600
 Matchmaker 4 and all these games were because 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.600
 exclusives 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.110
 hello my name is innocent 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:44.069
 I am a dull console operator and I play shooters with 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.069
 auto aiming 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.080
 thank you all subscribe to the channel 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.770
 thumb who thinks bioshock is a game 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.770
 years bye
