in the way that the hair flows out of

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.510 
in the way that the hair flows out of
the<00:02:28.379> head<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.890> affects<00:02:29.790> your<00:02:30.000> design

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.970 

this<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.730> our<00:02:36.910> layered<00:02:37.239> Bob<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.590> variation

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
this is our layered Bob it's a variation

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.130 
this is our layered Bob it's a variation
of<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.610> original<00:02:39.700> Bob<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.569> showed<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.840> in

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
of the original Bob that I showed you in

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.160 
of the original Bob that I showed you in
our<00:02:41.260> first<00:02:41.500> demonstration<00:02:42.430> as<00:02:42.879> you<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:43.959> see

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
our first demonstration as you can see

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.750 
our first demonstration as you can see
there<00:02:44.349> is<00:02:44.440> movement<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:44.980> direction<00:02:45.099> in<00:02:45.610> this

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
there is movement and direction in this

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.270 
there is movement and direction in this
design<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.510> first<00:02:47.470> thing<00:02:47.709> we<00:02:47.800> want<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.069> ask

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
design the first thing we want to ask

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.850 
design the first thing we want to ask
again<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:49.060> where<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.660> weight<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.110> what<00:02:50.739> is

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
again is where is the weight and what is

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.550 
again is where is the weight and what is
the<00:02:51.010> direction<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:52.450> weight<00:02:52.660> remains<00:02:52.900> again

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
the direction the weight remains again

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.259 
the direction the weight remains again
all<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.069> way<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.550> bottom<00:02:54.730> at<00:02:55.060> zero

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
all the way on the bottom at zero

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.540 
all the way on the bottom at zero
elevation<00:02:55.989> but<00:02:56.739> we<00:02:56.860> see<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:57.310> want

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
elevation but we see that we want

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.309 
elevation but we see that we want
Direction<00:02:58.090> flowing<00:02:58.390> from<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.750> top<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:59.170> the

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
Direction flowing from the top of the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.180 
Direction flowing from the top of the
head<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.810> longest<00:03:02.200> point<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.650> our<00:03:02.799> design

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
head to the longest point in our design

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.089 
head to the longest point in our design
in<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.580> front<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.930> gives<00:03:05.230> us<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.620> vertical

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
in the front this gives us a vertical

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.199 
in the front this gives us a vertical
line<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:07.239> our<00:03:07.480> arrow<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:08.019> showing<00:03:08.440> us<00:03:09.209> where

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
line that our arrow is showing us where

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.839 
line that our arrow is showing us where
we<00:03:10.480> begin<00:03:11.019> our<00:03:11.080> design<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.920> always<00:03:12.310> completely

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
we begin our design is always completely

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.699 
we begin our design is always completely
the<00:03:13.090> opposite<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.930> direction<00:03:14.110> we<00:03:14.590> want

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
the opposite of the direction we want

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.190 
the opposite of the direction we want
the<00:03:14.920> hair<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.099> flow<00:03:15.579> this<00:03:16.480> is<00:03:16.660> going<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.049> be

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
the hair to flow this is going to be

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.460 
the hair to flow this is going to be
where<00:03:17.380> our<00:03:17.410> guideline<00:03:18.130> begins<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.989> design

very little product but to show you how

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.610 
very little product but to show you how
simple<00:03:24.819> this<00:03:25.450> style<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.019> maintain<00:03:26.410> for

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
simple this style is to maintain for
