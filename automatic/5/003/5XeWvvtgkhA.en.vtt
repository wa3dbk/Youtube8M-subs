00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.260
 hello friends black market summer already 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.420
 started and the brands are put in a row 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.880
 we have a special report on the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.380
 outdoor advertising and we go south in 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 look for the most creative panel 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.130
 it's a surprise for nobody to tell you 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.960
 investment in advertising has 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.500
 increased considerably in these 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.200
 years on television the radio in the 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.540
 notices and even online 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.640
 figures show an increase but also 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.190
 better sales distribution 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.290
 on the other hand in outdoor advertising 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.960
 now we see that they go beyond the 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.660
 classic panels with great photos or 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.079
 notices embedded in the streets now 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.340
 technology and the use of better ideas 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.340
 they provide a unique experience 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.619
 for example in this summer season 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.960
 on our way to the beach see you 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 wrapped by the marks that surround the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.610
 road and especially effective 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.340
 advertising posters achieving that the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.350
 sometimes tedious journey becomes 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.080
 an experience of brands and good 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.800
 creativity since 2008 investment 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.039
 advertising well in constant increase 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.440
 in this year the investment figure was of 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.590
 413 million dollars and in the year 2012 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.450
 reached 650 million dollars 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.609
 one of the items that increased in the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.890
 last years has been the heading of 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.780
 outdoor advertising who despite a 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.600
 10 percent participation in the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.900
 advertising cake becomes more notorious 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.060
 in times of summer and on festivities 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.370
 for his part billy shut me up or the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.530
 advertising on public roads is included in the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.890
 88 percent of what is invested in 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.550
 this means in 2012 increased in 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.500
 16 percent compared to 2011 is 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.350
 highlighted consumer products 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.070
 and the big chain stores 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.070
 cars and trucks 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.080
 after explaining in figures this 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.970
 growth we return to our trip 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.760
 towards the south where we have been able 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.760
 find approximately 400 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.590
 panels in total the first notices that 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.290
 we were surprised were those 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.470
 sequential as those of telephone in 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.360
 a string of three consecutive panels 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.660
 also those of plzen and fanta who were 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.489
 made in 3d technique just like 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.280
 the meticulous work of the dakar panel 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.110
 that with his realism he captivated more than one 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.860
 driver 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.560
 s &amp; p guaraná san mateo and obviously 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.570
 cocacola that is always a reference in 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.660
 the tracks to the south are also not 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.060
 they were left behind from afar the huge 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.600
 pieces attract attention with their shapes 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.580
 and impact this summer this year the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.100
 constant was the realism at the time of 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.020
 present the alders this is the case of 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.360
 walk that used the slope of a 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.820
 small hill intervening the as if 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.830
 it was a wave with a giant umbrella 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.810
 which covers a cart of the same size 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.400
 with the phrase we are where you are 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.440
 besides seeing many colorful works 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.550
 there is one in particular that stands out 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.890
 a considerable reason is ecofriendly is 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.590
 say friendly with the environment 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.870
 this is the case of the utec with its panel 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.459
 functional and with social projection that 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.560
 it works by absorbing water from the 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.959
 humidity of the air with tensing the a 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.510
 through an electronic mechanism that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.360
 accumulates 96 liters of water in benefit 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.010
 of the inhabitants of the area this poster 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.700
 won the contest we did in 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.790
 our black market fanpage with 694 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.459

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.319
 behind all these works there are 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.239
 companies that are dedicated to find the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.269
 best conditioning position the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.209
 Business clients such as clear chanel 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.609

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.069
 Latin America in author accentuated their 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.500
 good jobs on the Colorado highway 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.480
 towards the beaches the grief mind not only 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.539
 is successful because of the number of people who 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.759
 sees then put into uncertain what 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.850
 we try to do and we work from 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:26.599
 suddenly sometimes together with the 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.120
 media agencies is one that is what 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.919
 requires the client and two of us that 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.710
 we place locations outside of 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.199
 requirement they thought is where there 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.669
 a lot of traffic of people that we 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.789
 We recommend our brands to 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:44.810
 our customers merge the messages 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:47.040
 advertising with the altruistic theme the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.520
 subject of care with 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.910
 the rules with the laws with the rules 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.660
 for example with clear we had a 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:01.449
 series of elements at road level no 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.090
 where the message went hand in hand with 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:08.020
 if you take not drive respect the law of 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.599
 transit were not so distracting anymore 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.659
 well they were a reinforcement of the branding where 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.279
 the brand was what predominated not so much 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:18.729
 what is styled many times in the 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:20.540
 little chair among several, not on the other hand 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.700

 the new signage dependencies of 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.120
 the stores are a more striking way 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.880
