00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
don't know why I created above me like

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.149 
don't know why I created above me like
that<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.229> looks<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.680> did<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.950> each

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that but it looks like it did that each

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.490 
that but it looks like it did that each
time<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.939> maybe<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.600> don't<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.260> that's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
time so maybe if I I don't know that's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.960 
time so maybe if I I don't know that's
weird<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.070> doesn't<00:01:14.369> seem<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.729> did<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
weird it doesn't seem like it did that

can see it kind of looks like a

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.140 
can see it kind of looks like a
multi-tool<00:02:34.560> kind<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.920> thing<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
multi-tool kind of thing and it is a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.800 
multi-tool kind of thing and it is a
multi-tool<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.870> mines<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:38.130> chops<00:02:39.060> wood<00:02:39.300> does

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
multi-tool it mines it chops wood does

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.050 
multi-tool it mines it chops wood does
everything<00:02:40.080> really<00:02:40.290> quickly<00:02:40.760> not<00:02:41.760> mines

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
everything really quickly not mines

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.330 
everything really quickly not mines
would<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.780> guys<00:02:43.170> know<00:02:43.319> what<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:43.470> mean<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.220> it

will go to is the tree element there's

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.020 
will go to is the tree element there's
not<00:02:52.830> too<00:02:53.010> much<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.340> right<00:02:53.580> now<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:53.850> not<00:02:53.880> sure

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.940 
current moment by the time you're
watching<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.610> might<00:02:59.849> be<00:03:00.030> fixed<00:03:00.769> but<00:03:01.769> what

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
watching this it might be fixed but what

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.650 
watching this it might be fixed but what
he<00:03:02.040> did<00:03:02.280> actually<00:03:02.849> as<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.030> think<00:03:03.360> he<00:03:03.450> might<00:03:03.630> have

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
he did actually as I think he might have

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.600 
he did actually as I think he might have
just<00:03:03.870> made<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> little<00:03:04.530> mistake<00:03:04.709> because<00:03:05.340> once

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
just made a little mistake because once

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.979 
just made a little mistake because once
you<00:03:05.700> place<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.150> here<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.510> don't<00:03:06.720> get<00:03:06.900> your

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
you place this here you don't get your

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.360 
you place this here you don't get your
actual<00:03:07.380> tree<00:03:07.680> element<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.130> that's<00:03:08.250> what

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
actual tree element and that's what

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.240 
actual tree element and that's what
happens<00:03:08.610> when<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.819> mine<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.650> but<00:03:10.650> what<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.130> do

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
happens when you mine it but what you do

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.039 
happens when you mine it but what you do
when<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:12.000> kind<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.269> fail<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.870> put

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
when it's kind of a fail but you put

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.210 
when it's kind of a fail but you put
your<00:03:13.170> tree<00:03:13.349> element<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.739> there<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.130> you'll

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
your tree element in there and you'll

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.640 
your tree element in there and you'll
get<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.880> tree<00:03:15.360> back<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:15.930> basically<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.530> can

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
get a a tree back so basically you can

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.140 
get a a tree back so basically you can
waste<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.190> fire<00:03:17.340> element<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.850> way<00:03:17.940> if<00:03:18.060> you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
waste a fire element that way if you

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.410 
waste a fire element that way if you
want<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.680> it's<00:03:19.680> kind<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:19.920> stupid<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:21.209> yeah<00:03:21.359> you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
want to it's kind of stupid so yeah you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.610 
want to it's kind of stupid so yeah you
can<00:03:21.630> do<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.630> yeah<00:03:24.780> basically<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.350> tree

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
can do that so yeah basically a tree

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.650 
can do that so yeah basically a tree
element<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.609> only<00:03:26.820> thing<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.060> found<00:03:27.269> for<00:03:27.540> it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
element the only thing I found for it

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.940 
element the only thing I found for it
i'm<00:03:27.750> not<00:03:27.780> sure<00:03:28.049> if<00:03:28.109> there's<00:03:28.290> any<00:03:28.410> other<00:03:28.440> uses

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
i'm not sure if there's any other uses

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.160 
i'm not sure if there's any other uses
but<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:29.790> i<00:03:29.850> can<00:03:29.970> find<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.720> once

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
but this is all i can find is on once

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.110 
but this is all i can find is on once
you<00:03:31.290> plant<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.920> get<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> tree<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:32.880> think

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
you plant that you get a tree so I think

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.490 
you plant that you get a tree so I think
it<00:03:33.480> probably<00:03:33.720> should<00:03:33.840> be<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.989> little<00:03:34.200> bit<00:03:34.380> more

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it probably should be a little bit more

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.470 
it probably should be a little bit more
uses<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.130> maybe<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:35.549> maybe<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.239> can<00:03:36.359> get

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
uses to this maybe if maybe you can get

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.930 
uses to this maybe if maybe you can get
like<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.720> tree<00:03:37.109> that<00:03:37.140> doesn't<00:03:37.560> even<00:03:37.650> spawn<00:03:38.069> that

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
like a tree that doesn't even spawn that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.640 
like a tree that doesn't even spawn that
would<00:03:39.030> be<00:03:39.120> something<00:03:39.359> cool<00:03:39.630> left<00:03:39.810> add<00:03:40.019> in<00:03:40.200> true

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
would be something cool left add in true

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.740 
would be something cool left add in true
that<00:03:40.799> doesn't<00:03:41.010> even<00:03:41.069> spawn<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.790> grow

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
that doesn't even spawn but you can grow

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.559 
that doesn't even spawn but you can grow
it<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:42.989> way<00:03:43.170> that'd<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.590> really<00:03:43.799> cool<00:03:44.569> yeah

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
it this way that'd be really cool yeah

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.879 
it this way that'd be really cool yeah
so<00:03:45.900> that's<00:03:46.049> pretty<00:03:46.230> much<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.440> for<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.680> tree

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
so that's pretty much it for the tree

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.590 
so that's pretty much it for the tree
element<00:03:47.160> that's<00:03:47.250> all<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.459> really<00:03:47.940> found<00:03:48.359> on

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
element that's all I really found on

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.330 
element that's all I really found on
that<00:03:48.750> also<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.859> say<00:03:50.010> one<00:03:50.190> more

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
that also I just like to say one more

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.000 
that also I just like to say one more
thing<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.760> found<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.329> little<00:03:52.290> bug<00:03:52.560> as<00:03:52.769> well

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
thing I found this little bug as well

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.770 
thing I found this little bug as well
not<00:03:53.280> sure<00:03:53.340> if<00:03:53.519> this<00:03:53.609> was<00:03:53.790> purposely<00:03:54.389> added<00:03:54.510> in

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
not sure if this was purposely added in

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.870 
not sure if this was purposely added in
that's<00:03:55.530> weird<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.889> ice<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.190> getting<00:03:56.310> oh<00:03:56.639> yes

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
that's weird the ice is getting oh yes

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.470 
that's weird the ice is getting oh yes
because<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:58.019> okay<00:03:58.500> nevermind<00:03:58.950> don't<00:03:59.100> know<00:03:59.250> why

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
because of okay nevermind don't know why

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.390 
because of okay nevermind don't know why
anyways<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.720> found<00:04:01.200> if<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.799> put<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.190> dirt

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
anyways I found if you put the dirt

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.840 
anyways I found if you put the dirt
block<00:04:02.819> in<00:04:03.060> now<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.569> hit<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.049> tree<00:04:04.590> element<00:04:04.950> 64

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
block in now you hit a tree element 64

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.699 
block in now you hit a tree element 64
tree<00:04:06.090> elements<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.930> I'm<00:04:07.260> not<00:04:07.410> sure<00:04:07.470> if<00:04:07.590> that's

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
tree elements so I'm not sure if that's

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.220 
tree elements so I'm not sure if that's
a<00:04:07.950> glitch<00:04:08.220> or<00:04:08.340> something<00:04:08.690> probably<00:04:09.690> i<00:04:09.900> guess

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
a glitch or something probably i guess

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.960 
a glitch or something probably i guess
it<00:04:10.319> was<00:04:10.380> may<00:04:10.799> be<00:04:10.859> done<00:04:11.100> on<00:04:11.250> purpose<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:11.760> not

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
it was may be done on purpose but not

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.120 
it was may be done on purpose but not
meant<00:04:12.359> to<00:04:12.450> be<00:04:12.480> found<00:04:12.810> or<00:04:13.019> something<00:04:13.290> but

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
meant to be found or something but

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.770 
meant to be found or something but
anyways<00:04:14.400> let's<00:04:14.639> move<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.510> heart

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
anyways let's move on to the heart

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.759 
anyways let's move on to the heart
element<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:17.690> yeah<00:04:18.690> basically<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.560> hard

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
element and yeah basically the hard

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.379 
element and yeah basically the hard
element<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.280> 1<00:04:20.489> mind<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.910> get<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.150> actual

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
element is 1 mind you get the actual

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.870 
element is 1 mind you get the actual
heart<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.080> if<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.070> don't<00:04:23.370> get<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.610> actual

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
heart and if you don't get the actual

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.540 
heart and if you don't get the actual
heart<00:04:24.270> then<00:04:24.539> you're<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> cheating<00:04:25.200> bastard

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
heart then you're a cheating bastard

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.500 
heart then you're a cheating bastard
that's<00:04:26.550> just<00:04:26.760> what<00:04:26.909> the<00:04:27.000> mod<00:04:27.120> says

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
that's just what the mod says

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.390 
that's just what the mod says
not<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.380> know<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:28.770> guys<00:04:28.890> don't<00:04:29.040> understand

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
not I know if you guys don't understand

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.710 
not I know if you guys don't understand
you<00:04:29.490> guys<00:04:29.670> might<00:04:30.000> not<00:04:30.150> understand<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:30.510> but

create it all I'm going to say is it you
have<00:05:38.760> to<00:05:38.910> use<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.210> heart<00:05:39.420> element<00:05:39.810> and

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990
