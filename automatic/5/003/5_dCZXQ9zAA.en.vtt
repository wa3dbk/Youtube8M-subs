with no tension rub that on creating a

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.680 
with no tension rub that on creating a
little<00:03:37.199> friction<00:03:37.500> okay<00:03:38.459> heat<00:03:39.389> from<00:03:39.569> the

little friction okay heat from the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.449 
little friction okay heat from the
friction<00:03:39.810> does<00:03:40.260> help<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.799> tape<00:03:41.010> adhere

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
friction does help the tape adhere

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.629 
friction does help the tape adhere
better<00:03:42.590> like<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.739> get<00:03:43.859> down<00:03:44.040> by<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.250> ankle

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
better like to get down by the ankle

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.369 
better like to get down by the ankle
really<00:03:45.000> good<00:03:45.299> just<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.780> make<00:03:45.930> sure<00:03:45.959> that's

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
really good just to make sure that's

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.280 
really good just to make sure that's
that's<00:03:46.859> kind<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.430> very<00:03:47.699> flexible<00:03:48.690> point

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that's kind of a very flexible point

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.879 
that's kind of a very flexible point
that<00:03:49.669> needs<00:03:50.669> extra<00:03:50.970> adherence<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.889> that's

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
that needs extra adherence and that's

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.740 
that needs extra adherence and that's
the<00:03:53.069> application<00:03:53.190> for<00:03:53.909> posterior<00:03:54.480> shin

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
the application for posterior shin
