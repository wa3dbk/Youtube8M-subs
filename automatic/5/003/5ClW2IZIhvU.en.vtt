00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 plus 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.480
 well here you have the unpacking of 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.910
 a packard bell 2 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.610
 the packard bell netbook basically 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.880
 it's a do to spy one but 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.689
 with a rebranding of packard bell that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.070
 also belongs to the group is going to be 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.860
 well have they given another 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.410
 another aspect but basically it is the 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.700
 same machine 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.870
 and well let's see what it brings inside 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.220
 i 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.150
 The first thing we can find is 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.150
 a foundry 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.050
 that we will see everything more carefully 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.300
 the netbook 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.300
 and it comes pretty well protected 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 today it comes in a finish 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.040
 but if the bright really nice 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.540
 it comes without the battery obviously 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.500
 you can check 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.500
 the connections 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.030
 connections for the battery 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.049
 on the other side 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.860
 good 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.730
 let's see if we can open it with a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.560
 hand is difficult here 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.560
 a keyboard that also comes protected 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.200
 well let's see what it shows in the box 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.030
 these are the manuals 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.380
 and I imagine that a cedÃ© of 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.810
 recovery or similar and if it will not come 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.330
 a 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.599
 one participates a partition on the disk 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.599
 hard 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.040
 to dump it on a usb to be able to 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.069
 reload the operating system if it is 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.230
 necessary 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.230
 the three cell battery 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.550
 identical to doing 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.510
 in fact as I understand they are 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.510
 compatible with each other 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.670
 Y 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.840
 in the charger 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.440
 let's check if the battery 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.069
 if the battery has a little charge and 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.069
 we can turn on the device
