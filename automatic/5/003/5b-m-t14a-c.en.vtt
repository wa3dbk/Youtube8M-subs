00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.829 
actually haven't been to for years and
years<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.410> years<00:00:13.710> um<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.700> know<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> was<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.360> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
years and years um you know I was in I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.810 
years and years um you know I was in I
was<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.680> town<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.250> I'm<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.640> never

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
was in the town and I'm really never

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.460 
was in the town and I'm really never
there<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> just<00:00:18.810> stopped<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.080> real<00:00:19.260> quick

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
there so I just stopped in real quick

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.320 
there so I just stopped in real quick
and<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:20.310> what<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.699> find<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.150> love

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
and just see what I can find I love

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.790 
and just see what I can find I love
going<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.689> different<00:00:21.810> Goodwill's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
going to different Goodwill's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
going to different Goodwill's
so<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.640> guess<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.060> could<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> quick<00:00:24.689> tip

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
so I guess this could be a quick tip

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.740 
so I guess this could be a quick tip
your<00:00:25.560> quick<00:00:25.830> tip<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> goodwill

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
your quick tip is to go to the goodwill

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
your quick tip is to go to the goodwill
frequently<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> different

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
frequently and go to different

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.060 
frequently and go to different
Goodwill's<00:00:30.359> because<00:00:30.689> they<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:30.960> kind<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> have

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
Goodwill's because they all kind of have

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.190 
Goodwill's because they all kind of have
their<00:00:32.219> own<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:33.210> know<00:00:33.270> selection<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.020> things

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
their own you know selection of things

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.110 
their own you know selection of things
to<00:00:34.440> find<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.280> guess<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> quick

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
to find so I guess it's kind of a quick

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.510 
to find so I guess it's kind of a quick
tip<00:00:36.390> slash<00:00:36.719> hull<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> found

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
tip slash hull so this is what I found

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.600 
tip slash hull so this is what I found
today<00:00:39.469> I'm<00:00:40.469> serious<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.129> three<00:00:41.399> things
