00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.270
 aloud at 360 degrees today we are 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.020
 in the new audi werk and in the new audi 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.210
 logistics center here in Heilbronn 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.890
 The Böllinger Höfe will be there now 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.349
 the festivities worked properly 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.329
 which one was a few weeks ago and it became 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.550
 the whole operation show something here 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:29.900
 above so runs off for example 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:33.829
 every day when you have 160 trucks here at the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.440
 load 4500 of these complete boxes 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.340
 , and if you own more here 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 times these dimensions look 325 meters 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.840
 long is this building for comparison 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.660
 high is the Eiffel Tower in Paris and 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.760
 altogether there are another 30 gates 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.810
 which are equipped there so completely 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.120
 exciting and that is what we want today 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.390
 take a look inside or he is 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.170
 arrived again 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.690
 Production site here in Heilbronn 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.900
 which also a few impressions of the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.759
 r8 production in the inside than after 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.220
 many many decades will be too 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.030
 again vehicles in half and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.560
 produce that he has the audi 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.260
 works council chairman at the opening 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.350
 the moody remark causes that 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.850
 long march of audi from the audi 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.340
 employees from the cash register 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.940
 Heilbronn finds that here, so to speak 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.530
 a finale a happy finale 1975 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.070
 was the year when the audi-works 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.240
 yes for the preservation of your work 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.820
 have demonstrated and so are you now 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.470
 arrived back in Heilbronn not as 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.690
 Conquerors, as some people think 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.190
 but just as the one here 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.990
 ensures that even in the largest 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.970
 city ​​in the region again 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.280
 motor vehicles are produced and the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.220
 is also an exciting momentum where 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.340
 so many relocations worldwide 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.040
 occur 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.869
 often synonymous production relocation that 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.190
 you can do it in Heilbronn 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.100
 is possible again and that you give us 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.210
 now take a closer look 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.260
 here in the interior are the dimensions 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.830
 then, of course, very clearly 45,000 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.020
 square meters covers the area of ​​this 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.850
 logistics center that is six 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.399
 football fields and the height of twelve 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.069
 Of course, that's already there 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.349
 huge and 4 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.790
 Of course some undefeated the 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.069
 all day and that can of course 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.010
 also technically coordinated 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.170
 since march 2014 we started here 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 working the startup and since september 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.849
 the whole thing is in full swing so that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.920
 is an example of such a production 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.079
 and why a building project is optimal 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.129
 is implemented completely negative example in 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.010
 The region now has two 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.510
 had a container terminal for 17 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.650
 million of which was built by 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.659
 taxpayers' money 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.249
 the now in the Sleeping Beauty sleep 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.590
 changed and then it is still 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:45.419
 railway tracks industrial area yes too 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.519
 have been renewed for millions on those 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.709
 No trains were there you will be in the 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.379
 have to look much closer to the future 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.669
 what is really necessary there and 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.829
 not always in Wahlkampfreden 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.810
 any infrastructure measures 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.669
 Demand then nobody needs in the end 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.010
 it would be almost like you often already 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:05.150
 has experienced when you bridge builds 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.469
 roads that exist somewhere 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.260
 The showpiece of the settlement is natural 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.969
 here the factory where the r8 produces 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.099
 we will also have some aerial photographs 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.349
 because these dimensions see where you are 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.879
 then also the glass front looks far away 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.650
 Visible 10 r8 will be here per day 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.079
 manufactured and on the first august was the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.060
 last made in neckarsulm so too 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.000
 say and then on the 25th 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.530
 August already here in Heilbronn and that 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.359
 Richtfest for this new building that was in 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.340
 september 2013 you can see how 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.409
 Everything has worked out quickly 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.470
 were really in this case the city 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.209
 but very very cooperative what 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.290
 the whole construction measures are like 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.449
 Overall, the relationship between 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.040
 neckarsulm and heilbronn glorious 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.900
 is relaxed in comparison to earlier 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.939
 or there is no more acidity 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.090
 but that is of course in the sense 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.370
 a regional orientation that one there 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.419
 can work together because at the same time 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.819
 Of course, the now also on 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.829
 location neckarsulm has grown again 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.689
 new areas gained apropos 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.819
 also make a dispute in such matters 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.819
 agriculture everyone always wants 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.319
 have very local local products 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.030
 but then there are settlements 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.039
 from agricultural or 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.139
 extension is always the same 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:18.060
 protest loud the demonstrations will be 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.159
 accordingly prepared farmer president 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.409
 rukwied once pointed out that 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:24.389
 you just do not get so ideologized 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.949
 it is allowed to debate today 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.050
 agricultural companies where it 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.870
 no odor nuisance or no 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.419
 Other problems are there, you have to 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.219
 just say who regionality on the 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.810
 He does not always like everything 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.330
 reject what is here in the region 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.879
 A confession to the. is produced 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.860
 Region is the new building always 400 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.680
 Employees are busy here 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.439
 quattro gmbh shelter up here and 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.330
 below is also the caféteria area 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:54.509
 currently synonymous again a few shots 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.520
 from inside like this r8 is produced 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:00.060
 here in Heilbronn a true 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.069
 trinket and with this car with 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.060
 Heilbronn is like this vehicle 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.680
 addressed again to an automobile 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.319
 production standard has become here 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.569
 You can do that very quickly 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.310
 not so fast will approvals 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.139
 implemented for major events last 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.810
 we advise again this current 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.339
 For example, everything is being regulated via 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.589
 So slowly you mean everyone 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.639
 spectators at an event 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.259
 sports event or 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.270
 cultural event has almost become one 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.800
 Paramedics can come then also everything 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.120
 it is important to exaggerate 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.500
 signal to set 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.839
 otherwise you already have to go to one 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.589
 flea market a mobile operations center 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.779
 build up 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.550
 In terms of overregulation we are 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:40.199
 we can be the world champion 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.069
 definitely give up what for this week 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.069
 until the next one
