 we collect in one tight tail it and 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.039

 please see one invisibility 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.810
 hair stretch gum and so 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.780
 we start to just wrap wrapped 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.630
 when we run out of rezinochka we 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.280
 wind up stealth and our tail is ready 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.070
 look and wok pan 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.129
 this is our basis for our future 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.999
 hairstyles 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:09.819
 this is something like pineapple folder yes bye yes 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:13.599
 now we have our wonderful tail 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:15.399
 combing forward to 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.909
 he did not interfere yet 

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:21.219
 pin any clip or hairpin and 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:23.349
 here we need a roller 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:26.619
 because the length of hair is small to 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.509
 create for as is the light of life that any 

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:30.219
 roller can be used which 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.819
 Fits the color I would use 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:35.860
 Blonde is eternally so that the forms are not with 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:38.229
 huge tee it can take it 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.639
 and stab at us like this 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.610
 little such lining we her 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.229
 patty such a wonderful patty 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.569
 laid on top here and so on the tail and 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:52.629
 now the most important thing is to fix when 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.219
 help can be studs invisible 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.289
 The main thing that this hairstyle kept 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:59.229
 because when working with rollers two 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:02.229
 Highlights are strength and shape and 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.999
 What shape will our roller have? 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.099
 will be our wonderful hairstyle and 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:08.349
 now remains the simplest only 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:12.849
 close our wonderful hair roller 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:16.929
 and so we need a brush we take our 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:20.129
 tail and make this one 

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:22.809
 expanding on honestly honestly honestly chose and 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:25.929
 stack define across across 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:28.899
 the length of the roller is also interesting to close 

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:32.079
 But in the Soviet era roller was difficult 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:34.689
 get and except for old and stockings put 

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:38.469
 then a tin can of wonderful 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:40.029
 poems about this girl with a pile 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:43.419
 on the back of the head 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:46.019
 studs inside the bank from under 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.019
 sprat 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.030
 when all our hair is distributed to us 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.940
 it only remains to fix with 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.720
 hairpin or stealth all this 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:03.800
 we pinch the construction of the lowest 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.090
 hair here 1 2 well and you will say what 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.090
 this hairstyle can be fixed 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.450
 because here the shape is big here we are 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.840
 We did it and we finished it here 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.560
 such a heavy construction i suggest 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.930
 fix as follows 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:24.700
 look we process varnish 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:28.060
 turn on the hair dryer and a little dry 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:31.550
 great thank you very much 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.550
 wonderful work you say is harmful 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.930
 whether to do bouffant for hair you know we 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.840
 right now shown 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.670
 bouffant is only near the root therefore the most 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.770
 question how to comb hair after 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.390
 hairstyles and when there is not to hurt 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.550
 hair does not need him strong 

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.650
 comb I suggest always start 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.200
 flush out ie if you did big 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.840
 bouffant shampoo conditioner just wash 

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.510
 hair they have smooth shiny 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:00.260
