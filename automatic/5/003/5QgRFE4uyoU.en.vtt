00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.329
 it was not a sacrifice of any madman 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.899
 it was not a sacrifice of a man 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.449
 was simply a hero 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.029
 the sacrifice 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.129
 Jesus offers plans 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.429
 the eternal 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.570
 for that reason that by its waters like the curators 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.640
 because 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.789
 He died of love. 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.640
 from loving so much 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.779
 I was born to live 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.099
 in the areas of jesus 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.960
 out of them 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.769
 I am simply 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.580
 a being with no concept of life 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.580
 I rejoice over things that pass the next day. 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 in the areas of tupi and turkey 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.850
 in leisure areas 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.270
 my ability to love 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.730
 veteran 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.490
 but his chance 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.920
 I feel 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.120
 valued as a human being 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 it was out of love that he did all this for me and gave himself up 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.580
 in the last moments of life 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.580
 He gave himself up for me, said his mother. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.860
 in thy hands I commend my spirit 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.850
 tonight 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.150
 he surrenders for us 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.200
 for we have the true life epidemic abundance 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.350
 the world has created situations 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.190
 for we do not have life in abundance 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.760
 we are not anyone 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.010
 We were born to eternity. 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.530
 and we have the mark of the eternal 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.810
 we will penetrate the world 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.400
 I grate if death was for me. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.820
 see what I live 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.450
 for the good things 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.960
 for the bad things 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.670
 for all that I am 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.390
 for my weaknesses 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.560
 they surrender and love 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.450
 He loves me every day. 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 with a whole love 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.690
 What he always gets me 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.840
 and in no time will he love me anymore 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.410
 than at this moment 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.520
 we take this love 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 to restore life 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.930
 exists in us 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.500
 the true life 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.850
 it was for me 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.120
 it was for love 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.120
 was himself 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.739
 I meet a good match 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.739
 one of the house owners 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.319
 no o xingu
