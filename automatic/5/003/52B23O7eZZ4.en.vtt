here is the goal for what we will be
integrated<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.239> there's<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.750> no<00:00:45.960> easier

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
integrated and there's really no easier

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.880 
integrated and there's really no easier
way<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.520> than<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.149> simply<00:00:48.480> copy<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
way to do this than to simply copy this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.520 
way to do this than to simply copy this
code<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> paste<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.480> within<00:00:51.870> our<00:00:52.050> document<00:00:54.530> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
code and paste it within our document so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.330 
code and paste it within our document so
we<00:00:55.860> need<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> give<00:00:56.250> our<00:00:56.280> body<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.000> class<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
we need to give our body a class of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.780 
we need to give our body a class of
container

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.430 

since<00:01:04.480> we<00:01:04.600> want<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.870> make<00:01:05.050> sure<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.320> and
