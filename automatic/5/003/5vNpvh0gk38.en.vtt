we<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.899> coconut<00:00:37.380> pulp<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:38.700> it

we have coconut pulp as you can see it

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.639 
we have coconut pulp as you can see it
doesn't<00:00:39.180> rise<00:00:39.510> since<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.140> more<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.469> pie

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
doesn't rise since it's more of a pie

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
doesn't rise since it's more of a pie
and<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> Kate<00:00:42.360> even<00:00:42.660> though<00:00:42.930> it's

and it is not a Kate even though it's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.150 
and it is not a Kate even though it's
called<00:00:43.260> cassava<00:00:43.800> cake<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
called cassava cake so if you can see it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.479 
called cassava cake so if you can see it
there's<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.870> crust<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:49.950> darker

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
there's a crust it's a little bit darker

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.639 
there's a crust it's a little bit darker
but<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> crust<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.570> around<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.350> sides

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
but the crust is just around the sides

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.220 
but the crust is just around the sides
it's<00:00:53.100> not<00:00:53.370> underneath<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.719> that's<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it's not underneath you know that's a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.569 
it's not underneath you know that's a
little<00:00:55.350> bit<00:00:55.500> different<00:00:55.739> cuz<00:00:56.010> normally<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
little bit different cuz normally you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
little bit different cuz normally you
know<00:00:56.670> when<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> think<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.210> pie<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.020> crust

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
know when you think of a pie the crust

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.660 
know when you think of a pie the crust
is<00:00:58.890> kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.510> the<00:01:00.510> bulk<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> base<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.100> this

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
is kind of the bulk of the base but this

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.590 
is kind of the bulk of the base but this
doesn't<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
doesn't really have that I'm going to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.520 
doesn't really have that I'm going to
take<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.750> fork<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> little<00:01:08.250> piece

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
take my fork in there a little piece

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.219 
take my fork in there a little piece
that<00:01:10.530> I've<00:01:10.680> died<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.040> battle

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.980 

so<00:01:19.609> the<00:01:20.609> coconut<00:01:21.479> pulp<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.810> bit

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
so the coconut pulp is a little bit

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.789 
so the coconut pulp is a little bit
tough<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.679> it's<00:01:25.829> almost<00:01:26.009> caramelized<00:01:27.799> thank

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
tough like it's almost caramelized thank

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.599 
tough like it's almost caramelized thank
you<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> went<00:01:29.490> totally<00:01:29.729> transparent

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
you that it went totally transparent

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.410 
you that it went totally transparent
when<00:01:32.609> it<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:32.789> bathed<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:34.310> like<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.579> sweetness

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
when it was bathed I like the sweetness

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.539 
when it was bathed I like the sweetness
that<00:01:36.599> you<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.869> from<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> coconut<00:01:37.909> now<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.119> for

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
that you get from the coconut now as for

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.370 
that you get from the coconut now as for
the<00:01:41.549> main<00:01:41.759> part<00:01:42.209> is<00:01:42.619> kind<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> chewy

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
the main part is kind of like a chewy

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
the main part is kind of like a chewy
custard<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.129> little<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.549> dense<00:01:48.379> and<00:01:49.909> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
custard it's a little more dense and it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.529 
custard it's a little more dense and it
has<00:01:51.119> sort<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.509> an<00:01:51.689> earthy<00:01:52.520> flavors<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
has sort of an earthy flavors from the

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.219 
has sort of an earthy flavors from the
root<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.709> it's<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.129> too<00:01:56.819> sweet<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.929> you<00:01:58.079> got

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
root and it's not too sweet now you got

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.859 
root and it's not too sweet now you got
most<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> sweetness<00:01:59.099> from<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.780> from<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
most of the sweetness from the from the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.749 
most of the sweetness from the from the
coconut<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.439> top<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.489> creaminess

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
coconut on the top I like the creaminess

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.520 
coconut on the top I like the creaminess
and<00:02:03.239> that's<00:02:03.360> probably<00:02:03.539> from<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.959> three<00:02:04.200> milks

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and that's probably from the three milks

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.889 
and that's probably from the three milks
that<00:02:04.739> are<00:02:04.890> used<00:02:05.239> I'm<00:02:06.239> gonna<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.629> a<00:02:06.659> little

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that are used I'm gonna take a little

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.369 
that are used I'm gonna take a little
bit<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.109> the<00:02:07.590> cross-strait<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:09.229> see<00:02:10.229> how

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
bit of the cross-strait here see how

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.500 
bit of the cross-strait here see how
that<00:02:10.730> contrasts

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.440 

so<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.629> crust<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.319> has<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> same<00:02:18.829> consistency

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
so the crust it has the same consistency

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.869 
so the crust it has the same consistency
it's<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:20.810> like<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.890> taste<00:02:22.250> maybe<00:02:22.609> a<00:02:22.640> little

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
it's just like a taste maybe a little

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.539 
it's just like a taste maybe a little
darker<00:02:23.599> if<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.530> makes<00:02:24.739> sense<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.129> a<00:02:25.219> darker

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
darker if that makes sense like a darker

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.729 
darker if that makes sense like a darker
