this<00:01:36.360> gun<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.470> why<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:38.369> um

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
this gun and I don't know why but um

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
this gun and I don't know why but um
it's<00:01:41.070> got<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> two-stage<00:01:41.759> adjustable<00:01:42.420> trigger

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
it's got a two-stage adjustable trigger

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.069 
it's got a two-stage adjustable trigger
and<00:01:44.060> certain<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> video<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.600> flipped

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and certain if that video just flipped

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.120 
and certain if that video just flipped
there<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> second

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
there for a second

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.819 
there for a second
as<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.290> craftsman

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
as you can see there the craftsman

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.210 
as you can see there the craftsman
trigger<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:51.450> not<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> best<00:01:52.220> because

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
trigger is it's not the best because

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
trigger is it's not the best because
sometimes<00:01:53.729> it'll<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:55.079> long

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
sometimes it'll be a really long

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.780 
sometimes it'll be a really long
two-stage<00:01:56.159> where<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.750> pull<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.140> back<00:01:58.790> see

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
two-stage where I can pull it back see

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.240 
two-stage where I can pull it back see
if<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.000> can't<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.920> where<00:02:01.920> you'll<00:02:02.040> pull

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
if I can't get it now where you'll pull

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.459 
if I can't get it now where you'll pull
back<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.479> I'll<00:02:03.630> finally<00:02:04.110> engage

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
back to here then I'll finally engage

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.700 
back to here then I'll finally engage
and<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.390> make<00:02:06.390> your<00:02:06.540> shot<00:02:06.840> but

and then you can make your shot but

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.350 
and then you can make your shot but
other<00:02:07.890> times<00:02:08.250> it'll<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.970> move<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.239> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
other times it'll be you just move it to

other times it'll be you just move it to
there<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.869> shoot<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.560> that's<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
there and it's just shoot so that's a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.390 
there and it's just shoot so that's a
downfall<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> gun

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400

the<00:02:22.099> scope<00:02:22.370> came<00:02:22.670> with<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.739> they<00:02:24.739> called<00:02:25.010> it

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
the scope came with a they called it

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.119 
the scope came with a they called it
like<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> recoil<00:02:25.790> pen<00:02:26.150> inside<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.349> scope<00:02:27.800> ring

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
like a recoil pen inside the scope ring

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.720 
like a recoil pen inside the scope ring
and<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:30.290> drop<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:31.010> there's<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.280> hole<00:02:31.519> back

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
and you drop it in there's a hole back

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.910 
and you drop it in there's a hole back
here<00:02:31.760> as<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.450> see<00:02:32.750> right<00:02:32.930> there<00:02:33.260> but<00:02:33.739> I

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
here as you can see right there but I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
don't like that I like my scope further

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.210 
don't like that I like my scope further
back<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.049> think<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.349> looks<00:02:36.530> better<00:02:36.709> on<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.040> gun

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
back I think it looks better on the gun

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.589 
back I think it looks better on the gun
and<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.660> gets<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.080> better<00:02:40.030> hey<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.060> get<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.450> better

fuel for the scope picture I don't have

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.160 
fuel for the scope picture I don't have
to<00:02:43.280> be<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.580> far<00:02:43.849> forward<00:02:44.390> on<00:02:45.349> top<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.099> as

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
to be so far forward on top of that as

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.229 
to be so far forward on top of that as
the<00:02:48.170> scope<00:02:48.470> pin<00:02:48.799> was<00:02:49.069> there<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.730> scope<00:02:50.030> would

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
the scope pin was there the scope would

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.819 
the scope pin was there the scope would
be<00:02:50.500> way<00:02:51.500> off

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
be way off

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.000 
be way off
it<00:02:52.340> was<00:02:52.519> cantered<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.360> left<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.930> bunch<00:02:54.349> so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
it was cantered to the left a bunch so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.770 
it was cantered to the left a bunch so
be<00:02:55.220> pointing<00:02:55.640> way<00:02:55.819> out<00:02:55.970> there<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.239> had<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
be pointing way out there I had the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.350 
be pointing way out there I had the
scope<00:02:57.049> dialed<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.500> as<00:02:57.620> far<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> right<00:02:59.000> as<00:02:59.209> I

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
scope dialed in as far to the right as I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.850 
scope dialed in as far to the right as I
could<00:02:59.569> go<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.870> they're<00:02:59.989> still<00:03:00.260> shooting<00:03:00.440> left

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
could go and they're still shooting left

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.150 
could go and they're still shooting left
so<00:03:05.349> let's<00:03:06.349> see<00:03:06.620> here

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
so let's see here

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.759 
so let's see here
so<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.760> got<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.060> scope<00:03:08.360> view<00:03:08.599> right<00:03:08.870> there<00:03:09.170> as

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
so you got the scope view right there as

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.449 
so you got the scope view right there as
you<00:03:09.890> can<00:03:09.980> see<00:03:11.530> give<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.620> one<00:03:12.769> more<00:03:12.950> shot<00:03:13.010> it's

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
you can see give you one more shot it's

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.240 
you can see give you one more shot it's
just<00:03:13.640> basic<00:03:14.060> crosshairs<00:03:14.629> not<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.709> best<00:03:15.920> scope

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
just basic crosshairs not the best scope

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.770 
just basic crosshairs not the best scope
in<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.519> world<00:03:16.700> but<00:03:16.970> it's<00:03:17.150> pretty<00:03:17.329> good<00:03:17.540> once

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
in the world but it's pretty good once

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.530 
in the world but it's pretty good once
you<00:03:17.900> got<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:18.170> sighted<00:03:18.530> in

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.990 

looks<00:03:23.540> like<00:03:23.690> my<00:03:23.870> scope<00:03:24.200> knocked<00:03:24.829> off<00:03:25.130> no<00:03:25.819> it

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
looks like my scope knocked off no it

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.910 
looks like my scope knocked off no it
didn't<00:03:26.359> alright<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.780> thought<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.319> did<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:27.769> it's

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920

not<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.329> way<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.510> looked<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.840> there<00:03:30.049> as

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290
