00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
in the past two weeks

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.890

row that I haven't exercised at all my
weight<00:03:55.120> has<00:03:55.269> still<00:03:55.570> stayed<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.959> same

weight has still stayed the same

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.190 
weight has still stayed the same
um<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:58.450> that's<00:03:58.570> exciting

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
um so that's exciting

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.370

my<00:04:00.130> mom<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.519> stabilizing<00:04:01.000> well<00:04:01.330> too<00:04:01.660> she<00:04:02.140> is

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
my mom is stabilizing well too she is

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.620 
my mom is stabilizing well too she is
has<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.070> few<00:04:03.400> more<00:04:03.550> fluctuations<00:04:03.790> than<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.570> do

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
has a few more fluctuations than I do

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.140 
has a few more fluctuations than I do
due<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.350> some<00:04:05.560> salty<00:04:05.980> meals<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.400> think<00:04:06.670> at<00:04:06.850> times

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
due to some salty meals I think at times

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.960 
due to some salty meals I think at times
but<00:04:08.140> um<00:04:08.440> her<00:04:08.709> weight<00:04:08.920> does<00:04:09.130> go<00:04:09.280> back<00:04:09.459> down<00:04:09.700> when

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
but um her weight does go back down when

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.030 
but um her weight does go back down when
she<00:04:10.120> eats<00:04:10.300> her<00:04:10.420> normal<00:04:10.900> her<00:04:11.200> normal<00:04:11.530> food<00:04:11.800> and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
she eats her normal her normal food and

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.759 
she eats her normal her normal food and
salt<00:04:12.220> intake<00:04:12.580> so<00:04:12.940> um<00:04:13.269> so<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.140> think<00:04:14.260> that's<00:04:14.530> good

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
salt intake so um so I think that's good

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.940 
salt intake so um so I think that's good
too<00:04:15.010> um<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.570> also<00:04:16.600> noticed<00:04:17.169> that<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.709> seems

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
too um and I also noticed that it seems

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.180 
too um and I also noticed that it seems
