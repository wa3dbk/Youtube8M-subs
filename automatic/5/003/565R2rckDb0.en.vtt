we've created stopping the fraud that

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.370

military-industrial complex between the
two<00:02:34.410> parties<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:35.010> don't<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> lot<00:02:35.550> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
two parties I don't see a lot of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.610 
two parties I don't see a lot of
difference<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.960> think<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.350> needs<00:02:37.530> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
difference and and I think it needs to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.950 
difference and and I think it needs to
be<00:02:37.710> talked<00:02:37.980> about<00:02:38.280> more<00:02:38.520> because<00:02:39.000> i<00:02:39.270> don't

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
be talked about more because i don't

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.200 
be talked about more because i don't
think<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.350> pretending<00:02:41.100> these<00:02:41.250> two<00:02:41.640> parties

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
think that pretending these two parties

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.460 
think that pretending these two parties
are<00:02:42.540> polar<00:02:42.930> opposites<00:02:43.080> uh<00:02:44.040> does<00:02:44.880> us<00:02:45.720> justice

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
are polar opposites uh does us justice

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.370 
are polar opposites uh does us justice
in<00:02:46.890> uh<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.790> larger<00:02:48.300> scope<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.750> things<00:02:48.870> okay

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
in uh in the larger scope of things okay

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.630 
in uh in the larger scope of things okay
i<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.530> understand<00:02:50.070> what<00:02:50.190> you're<00:02:50.310> saying<00:02:50.580> but

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.170 
can go from that and and i'm curious
which<00:02:55.050> when<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> fit<00:02:55.440> into<00:02:55.560> one<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.100> let's<00:02:56.880> get

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
which when you fit into one is let's get

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.170 
which when you fit into one is let's get
obama<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.410> put<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.770> romney<00:02:59.310> because<00:02:59.520> then

obama out and put in romney because then

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.450 
obama out and put in romney because then
it'll<00:03:00.570> maybe<00:03:01.020> open<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> door<00:03:01.830> for<00:03:02.130> some<00:03:02.310> kind

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
it'll maybe open the door for some kind

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.790 
it'll maybe open the door for some kind
of<00:03:02.610> more<00:03:02.850> significant<00:03:03.560> progressive<00:03:04.560> move

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
of more significant progressive move

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.980 
of more significant progressive move
after<00:03:05.160> Romney<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:06.480> there's<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> people

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
after Romney and then there's the people

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.270 
after Romney and then there's the people
who<00:03:07.110> say<00:03:07.260> wait<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> second<00:03:07.770> we<00:03:07.830> kind<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.100> already

eight years and the last three and a
half<00:03:12.300> president<00:03:13.080> obama<00:03:13.470> has<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:14.010> been

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
half president obama has just been

so there's not really anything to this

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.650 
so there's not really anything to this
idea<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.860> let's<00:03:20.070> go<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.489> right<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:21.239> then<00:03:21.420> go

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660

well<00:03:54.360> he's<00:03:54.570> better<00:03:54.810> than<00:03:54.959> Romney<00:03:55.200> all<00:03:55.530> right

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
well he's better than Romney all right

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.910 
well he's better than Romney all right
to<00:03:55.950> vote<00:03:56.070> for<00:03:56.130> Obama<00:03:56.580> or<00:03:56.910> some<00:03:57.750> third<00:03:58.380> party<00:03:58.410> or

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
to vote for Obama or some third party or

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.830 
to vote for Obama or some third party or
something<00:03:59.220> but<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.910> think<00:04:00.390> there's<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.600> lot<00:04:00.780> that

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
something but I think there's a lot that

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.920 
something but I think there's a lot that
can<00:04:01.080> be<00:04:01.140> done<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.850> mean<00:04:02.850> a<00:04:02.880> lot<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.270> be<00:04:03.480> done<00:04:03.630> for

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
can be done I mean a lot to be done for

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.870 
can be done I mean a lot to be done for
third-party<00:04:04.410> candidates<00:04:05.160> whether<00:04:05.400> they<00:04:05.640> win

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
third-party candidates whether they win

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.850 
third-party candidates whether they win
or<00:04:05.910> not<00:04:06.060> at<00:04:06.480> least<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.930> entering<00:04:07.770> the

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
or not at least just entering the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.860 
or not at least just entering the
discussion<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.730> also<00:04:09.150> think<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.660> lot<00:04:09.810> of

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
discussion I also think that a lot of

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.240 
discussion I also think that a lot of
things<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.320> are<00:04:10.410> outside<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:11.100> political

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
things that are outside the political

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.430 
things that are outside the political
spectrum<00:04:11.580> are<00:04:12.000> very<00:04:12.209> important<00:04:12.690> like<00:04:12.840> occupy

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
spectrum are very important like occupy

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.300 
spectrum are very important like occupy
and<00:04:13.680> I've<00:04:13.739> tried<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.010> be<00:04:14.100> very<00:04:14.900> connected<00:04:15.900> to

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
it may be a sad thing but people seem to

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.780 
it may be a sad thing but people seem to
be<00:04:31.020> turning<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.470> comedy<00:04:31.860> for<00:04:32.040> their<00:04:32.160> news<00:04:32.400> so<00:04:32.760> I

be turning to comedy for their news so I

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.070 
be turning to comedy for their news so I
guess<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.060> gives<00:04:33.390> us<00:04:33.570> an<00:04:33.690> even<00:04:33.780> greater

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
guess that gives us an even greater

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.470 
guess that gives us an even greater
obligation<00:04:34.520> yeah<00:04:35.520> what<00:04:35.940> did<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.150> think<00:04:36.330> of

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
obligation yeah what did you think of

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.710 
obligation yeah what did you think of
the<00:04:36.600> Occupy<00:04:37.170> uh<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:38.240> delegation<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.330> guess<00:04:39.510> that

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
the Occupy uh I delegation I guess that

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.240 
the Occupy uh I delegation I guess that
was<00:04:39.810> at<00:04:40.020> Netroots<00:04:40.260> nation<00:04:40.530> when<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.130> were

know that kind of thing yeah it can look

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.440 
know that kind of thing yeah it can look
kind<00:05:25.230> of<00:05:25.320> weak<00:05:25.500> but<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.950> just<00:05:26.910> think<00:05:27.000> it's<00:05:27.240> gotta

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
kind of weak but I just think it's gotta

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.270 
kind of weak but I just think it's gotta
be<00:05:27.660> it's<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:27.900> long-term<00:05:28.140> battle<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:28.980> I<00:05:29.070> think

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
be it's a long-term battle and I think

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.590 
be it's a long-term battle and I think
that<00:05:29.400> people<00:05:29.640> don't<00:05:29.700> give<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:29.970> enough<00:05:30.210> credit

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
that people don't give it enough credit

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.320 
that people don't give it enough credit
for<00:05:30.630> what<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.680> achieved<00:05:32.160> in<00:05:32.550> only<00:05:32.760> two<00:05:33.180> to

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
think there will be some benefit to that

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.639 
think there will be some benefit to that
do<00:06:32.729> I<00:06:32.789> think<00:06:33.210> of<00:06:33.330> benefits<00:06:34.080> of<00:06:34.229> some<00:06:34.409> sort<00:06:34.619> of

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:34.649 
do I think of benefits of some sort of

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:38.089 
do I think of benefits of some sort of
leadership<00:06:34.979> um<00:06:35.520> I<00:06:35.939> I<00:06:36.930> don't<00:06:37.469> really<00:06:37.649> see<00:06:37.800> it

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
leadership um I I don't really see it

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.700 
leadership um I I don't really see it
happening<00:06:38.759> I<00:06:38.939> think<00:06:39.539> that<00:06:39.719> most<00:06:39.930> people<00:06:40.379> that

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
happening I think that most people that

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.059 
happening I think that most people that
that<00:06:41.249> are<00:06:41.749> involved<00:06:42.749> in<00:06:43.139> the<00:06:43.259> decision<00:06:43.680> shake

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
that are involved in the decision shake

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.369 
that are involved in the decision shake
in<00:06:44.339> making<00:06:44.849> in<00:06:45.449> occupy<00:06:45.960> meaning<00:06:46.289> the

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:46.379 
in making in occupy meaning the

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.839 
in making in occupy meaning the
committee's<00:06:46.800> in<00:06:46.979> the<00:06:47.039> voting<00:06:47.249> and<00:06:47.460> stuff<00:06:47.669> are

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
committee's in the voting and stuff are

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.019 
committee's in the voting and stuff are
very<00:06:48.089> opposed<00:06:48.479> to<00:06:48.779> any<00:06:49.050> top-down<00:06:49.619> leadership

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:50.029 
very opposed to any top-down leadership

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.049 
very opposed to any top-down leadership
um<00:06:51.029> that<00:06:51.990> you<00:06:52.349> know<00:06:52.499> and<00:06:52.800> and<00:06:53.610> I<00:06:53.699> think<00:06:53.909> there

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:54.059 
um that you know and and I think there

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:56.179 
um that you know and and I think there
are<00:06:54.270> a<00:06:54.330> lot<00:06:54.539> of<00:06:54.569> benefits<00:06:55.080> to<00:06:55.169> it<00:06:55.409> as<00:06:55.559> well<00:06:55.619> I'm

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:56.189 
are a lot of benefits to it as well I'm

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:58.279 
are a lot of benefits to it as well I'm
not<00:06:56.399> saying<00:06:56.879> that<00:06:56.999> it<00:06:57.270> needs<00:06:57.599> to<00:06:57.779> remain<00:06:58.050> that

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
not saying that it needs to remain that

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:00.109 
not saying that it needs to remain that
way<00:06:58.319> forever<00:06:58.619> but<00:06:59.129> I<00:06:59.339> think<00:06:59.669> there's<00:06:59.849> a<00:06:59.939> lot<00:07:00.089> of

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:00.119 
way forever but I think there's a lot of

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.820 
way forever but I think there's a lot of
benefits<00:07:00.569> like<00:07:00.719> it<00:07:00.930> can't<00:07:01.199> just<00:07:01.289> you<00:07:01.800> can't

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:03.689 
just knock the legs out from under will

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.679 
just knock the legs out from under will
occupy<00:07:04.020> by<00:07:04.349> taking<00:07:04.709> down<00:07:04.889> one<00:07:05.219> man<00:07:05.520> like<00:07:06.389> you

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:24.769 
nobody there's nobody at the top to
destroy<00:07:22.740> so<00:07:23.009> I<00:07:23.039> think<00:07:23.159> it's<00:07:23.490> actually<00:07:23.699> I<00:07:24.209> think

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:24.779 
destroy so I think it's actually I think

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:26.480 
destroy so I think it's actually I think

00:07:28.609 --> 00:07:28.619 
right now it's actually survived longer

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:31.219 
right now it's actually survived longer
without<00:07:29.309> that<00:07:29.580> leadership<00:07:29.909> all<00:07:30.839> right<00:07:31.080> the
