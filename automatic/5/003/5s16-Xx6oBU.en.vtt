00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
step forward with the thrust but this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.979

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
time instead of going straight forward

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:54.910 
time instead of going straight forward
if<00:00:54.109> we're<00:00:54.260> just<00:00:54.440> going<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.710> throw<00:00:54.739> this

twist give bring slider a slight curve

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.130 
twist give bring slider a slight curve
to<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.830> globe<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:29.180> sounds<00:01:29.660> almost<00:01:29.810> like

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
to the globe so it sounds almost like

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.190 
to the globe so it sounds almost like
natural<00:01:30.970> but<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.150> gotta<00:01:32.330> remember<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:33.020> lock

natural but you gotta remember to lock
your<00:01:33.229> wrists<00:01:33.820> so<00:01:34.820> what<00:01:35.090> I<00:01:35.120> recommend<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.840> this

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
your wrists so what I recommend is this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.030 
your wrists so what I recommend is this
way<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:37.190> if<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.460> naturally<00:01:38.060> turns<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:39.710> can<00:01:39.890> do

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
way but if it naturally turns you can do

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.899 
way but if it naturally turns you can do
that<00:01:40.220> too<00:01:42.340> la

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
that too la

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
that too la
where<00:01:44.479> thou

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
where thou

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.820
