00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.950
 hello to you barnaul tuning toyota 22 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.930
 and once again I want to tell you about our 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.059
 a maximum of 33 body 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.389
 such were made with them improvements 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.789
 with her and about the work you've done 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.800
 haven't seen we start with luggage 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:22.630
 the office was made an interesting thing 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.970
 side pockets have been extended i.e. 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.060
 because something must always be put 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.060
 small but always not enough space 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.969
 easy manipulations mode grinders were 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.699
 cut out never needed parts here 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.949
 everything was glued primed smeared 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.329
 we have turned out wonderful magpies 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:50.100
 pockets where you can put a fire extinguisher 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.100
 first aid kit we are all different small things 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.129
 This car was driven from St. Petersburg 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.079
 was all full of holes well, roughly a piece 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.920
 metal 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.350
 look at the bottom of the car bottom 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.720
 the car was all in holes absolutely 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.170
 all holes are now here new 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.360
 metal 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 everything is hard nothing breaks not 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.299
 bend everything handled 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:26.520
 ribs and also loudly struck the thing this 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.829
 everything is done by hand with a hammer and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.990
 nails and such mother things to mother 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.369
 Now let's see the engine compartment 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.520
 engine compartment with a separate story 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.290
 another story it all just was not 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.990

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.740

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.030

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.850
