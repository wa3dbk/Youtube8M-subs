so<00:00:32.699> what<00:00:32.910> we're<00:00:33.059> doing<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.629> flattening

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so what we're doing here is flattening

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
so what we're doing here is flattening
down<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:35.129> old<00:00:35.550> blackberries<00:00:36.269> that<00:00:36.510> are

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
down the old blackberries that are

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.360 
down the old blackberries that are
growing<00:00:36.899> over<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.199> mine<00:00:37.530> waste<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.129> mullah

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
growing over the mine waste the mullah

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.790 
growing over the mine waste the mullah
keeps<00:00:38.699> are<00:00:39.030> left<00:00:39.420> behind<00:00:39.750> by<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.199> gold<00:00:40.500> era

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
keeps are left behind by the gold era

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.420 
keeps are left behind by the gold era
and<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> does<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.739> compact<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and what that does is compact down the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
and what that does is compact down the
living<00:00:44.879> black<00:00:45.329> berries<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.140> growing

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
living black berries that are growing

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.840 
living black berries that are growing
over<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> top<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:49.159> create<00:00:50.159> a<00:00:50.190> humid

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
over the top and create a humid

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.639 
over the top and create a humid
environment<00:00:51.000> especially<00:00:51.720> over<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.320> next

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
environment especially over the next

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.460 
environment especially over the next
summer<00:00:52.920> we're<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:54.030> old<00:00:54.180> r<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.600> canes<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
summer we're all the old r I canes the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.359 
summer we're all the old r I canes the
runny<00:00:55.979> start<00:00:56.820> rapidly<00:00:57.390> decomposing<00:00:58.369> what

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
runny start rapidly decomposing what

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:01.070 
runny start rapidly decomposing what
that<00:00:59.519> means<00:00:59.729> is<00:00:59.939> we<00:01:00.150> turn<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> blackberry

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
that means is we turn the blackberry

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.770 
that means is we turn the blackberry
from<00:01:01.470> being<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.549> serious<00:01:02.820> fire<00:01:03.239> hazard

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
from being a really serious fire hazard

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.410 
from being a really serious fire hazard
to<00:01:04.439> actually<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.040> living<00:01:05.460> mulch<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> ground

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to actually a living mulch on the ground

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.039 
to actually a living mulch on the ground
which<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.790> not<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> fire<00:01:09.060> hazard<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
which is not a fire hazard at all and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.020 
which is not a fire hazard at all and
it's<00:01:10.259> accelerating<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.310> soil<00:01:11.580> building

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's accelerating the soil building

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.719 
it's accelerating the soil building
process<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.049> way<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.130> developed<00:01:14.610> this

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
process but the way we developed this

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.399 
process but the way we developed this
technique<00:01:15.180> cut<00:01:15.450> more<00:01:16.020> than<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:17.520> decade<00:01:18.210> ago<00:01:18.600> was

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
technique cut more than a decade ago was

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.469 
technique cut more than a decade ago was
we<00:01:19.590> found<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.100> tried<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.610> cut<00:01:20.939> holes<00:01:21.150> in

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
we found when we tried to cut holes in

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.410 
we found when we tried to cut holes in
the<00:01:21.570> blackberry<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.290> plant<00:01:22.560> trees<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:24.030> huge

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the blackberry and plant trees in a huge

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
the blackberry and plant trees in a huge
pile<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> blackberries<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.340> summer<00:01:26.579> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
pile of blackberries in the summer the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.080 
pile of blackberries in the summer the
blackberries<00:01:27.240> would<00:01:27.390> grow<00:01:27.600> over<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> top<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
blackberries would grow over the top and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.029 
blackberries would grow over the top and
smother<00:01:30.090> your<00:01:30.539> tree<00:01:30.869> whereas<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> got<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
smother your tree whereas if you got the

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.359 
smother your tree whereas if you got the
same<00:01:32.249> blackberries<00:01:32.850> down<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> ground<00:01:33.929> as

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
same blackberries down to the ground as

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.450 
same blackberries down to the ground as
this<00:01:35.390> living<00:01:36.390> mattress<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.280> could

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
this living mattress then you could

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.160 
this living mattress then you could
plant<00:01:38.789> in<00:01:39.030> amongst<00:01:39.359> the<00:01:39.420> blackberries<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
plant in amongst the blackberries and

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.779 
plant in amongst the blackberries and
just<00:01:40.380> come<00:01:40.530> back<00:01:40.770> once<00:01:41.009> or<00:01:41.219> twice<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
just come back once or twice in the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.260 
just come back once or twice in the
summer<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.240> walk<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.200> blackberries<00:01:43.740> down

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
summer and walk the blackberries down

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.709 
summer and walk the blackberries down
the<00:01:45.270> advantage<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.499> compared<00:01:47.340> with

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
the advantage of this compared with

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.029 
the advantage of this compared with
cutting<00:01:48.719> all<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> blackberries<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.740> there's

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
cutting all the blackberries off there's

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.609 
cutting all the blackberries off there's
a<00:01:50.069> huge<00:01:50.520> amount<00:01:50.609> less<00:01:51.090> work<00:01:51.359> it's<00:01:52.139> much<00:01:52.380> more

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
a huge amount less work it's much more

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.770 
a huge amount less work it's much more

just a little whip sticking up through

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.460 
just a little whip sticking up through
the<00:05:51.740> blackberries<00:05:52.720> fifteen<00:05:53.720> years<00:05:53.900> ago<00:05:54.050> and

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
the blackberries fifteen years ago and

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.469 
the blackberries fifteen years ago and
we<00:05:54.530> just<00:05:54.710> got<00:05:54.890> in<00:05:55.039> and<00:05:55.310> cut<00:05:55.789> the<00:05:56.000> black<00:05:56.180> buoys

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
we just got in and cut the black buoys

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.600 
we just got in and cut the black buoys
off<00:05:56.660> and<00:05:56.930> that<00:05:57.320> was<00:05:57.470> enough<00:05:57.740> for<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:58.100> canopy

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
off and that was enough for the canopy

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.630 
off and that was enough for the canopy
er<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:58.850> Apple<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.510> get<00:06:00.380> away<00:06:00.650> and<00:06:01.010> shade<00:06:01.400> out

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
er the Apple to get away and shade out

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.060 
er the Apple to get away and shade out
the<00:06:02.570> blackberries<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:03.169> that<00:06:03.289> produces<00:06:03.800> very

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
the blackberries and that produces very

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.900 
the blackberries and that produces very
nice<00:06:04.600> apples<00:06:05.919> so<00:06:06.919> that's<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.490> basic

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
nice apples so that's the basic

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.640 
nice apples so that's the basic
technique<00:06:08.660> and<00:06:08.900> of<00:06:08.990> course<00:06:09.020> all<00:06:09.380> of<00:06:09.410> these

technique and of course all of these

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.630 
technique and of course all of these
this<00:06:10.490> method<00:06:10.760> is<00:06:11.210> an<00:06:11.479> alternative<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.640> noisy
