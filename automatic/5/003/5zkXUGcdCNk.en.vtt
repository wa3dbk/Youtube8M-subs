00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.769
 materials and tools 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.320
 needed 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.320
 we will demonstrate the foliage with blades 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.320
 plastic to start 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.480
 measure the part to be coated and note the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.660
 measure to follow 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.239
 measure and mark with pencil the plastic blade 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.760
 be cut by leaving an inch of 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:40.400
 each side as a margin on top of each 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.620
 one of the lines lay the ruler and make the 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.379
 cut with a blade cutter if 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.969
 necessary to pass more than once until 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.969
 blade is cut off 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:56.629
 the next step is to prepare for the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.449
 bonding surfaces slightly trash and 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.530
 to improve adhesion using sandpaper 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.339
 graham 80 then pass the glue 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.890
 contact 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.110
 first on the blade which is the surface in 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.990
 that drying takes a little longer 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.179
 use the spatula to distribute 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.939
 a thin layer of adhesive all over the 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:20.810
 surface leaving no portion 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.390
 find the same way pass the glue 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.930
 of the wood to be coated well 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.930
 homogeneous 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.930
 then left adhesive to check if the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.320
 time is hot circus will be ready 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.570
 in 15 to 20 minutes for wet weather and 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.210
 cold 30 40 minutes 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.329
 pre-drying can be perceived 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.729
 visually and by touch the adhesive is not 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:51.020
 most seen and at the touch of 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.850
 after pre-drying can be 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.369
 the union of the parties 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.399
 place 2 wooden rollers over the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.490
 surface to be coated on them 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.380
 When placing the blade, the rollers 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.219
 contact between the faces to be 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.369
 acquired 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.140
 if there was contact, there would be 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.850
 which would make it very difficult to position 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.670
 correct blade 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.010
 remove the first roll and join 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.120
 from the central part of the blade to the edge 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.489
 of the part 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.070
 then take the second colette 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.970
 pressing again with your hands 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.760
 from the middle out 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.980
 is that the air be expelled repeat this 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.980
 movement until you realize that adhesion 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.250
 finally use the sander coated with 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.990
 a cork instead of sandpaper 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.050
 over the entire surface of the blade 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.470
 lengthwise several times so that 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.020
 all the air present is removed from the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.440
 presence of air between the faces 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:58.620
 the adhesion immediate adhesion not having 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.020
 need for additional drying to 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.410
 finish the job finish 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.990
 from the sides by removing the pods use 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.090
 for this portable atrophy with coldness 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.090
 suitable for finishing on 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.700
 plastic insert the side to be 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.560
 the edges of the workbench and use 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.070
 the tupy and firmly pulling out 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.070
 margins 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.850
 finished finishing we notice the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.519
 importance of this operation with atrophy 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.330
 which cuts rent to wood in a way 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.330
 very accurate
