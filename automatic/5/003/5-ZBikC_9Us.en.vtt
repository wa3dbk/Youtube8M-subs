what<00:05:35.400> we<00:05:35.520> seem<00:05:35.789> to<00:05:35.820> find<00:05:36.060> on<00:05:36.270> this<00:05:36.450> tire<00:05:36.690> is

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
what we seem to find on this tire is

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.680 
what we seem to find on this tire is
that<00:05:37.139> it<00:05:37.289> grips<00:05:37.909> unbelievably<00:05:38.909> well<00:05:39.090> on<00:05:39.300> the

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
that it grips unbelievably well on the

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.690 
that it grips unbelievably well on the
paved<00:05:39.990> sections<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:41.010> if<00:05:41.159> you<00:05:41.250> tend<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.520> be<00:05:41.610> a

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
paved sections so if you tend to be a

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.010 
paved sections so if you tend to be a
little<00:05:41.909> bit<00:05:42.150> more<00:05:42.300> aggressive<00:05:42.779> on<00:05:42.870> your

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
little bit more aggressive on your

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.200 
little bit more aggressive on your
suzuki<00:05:43.409> v-strom<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:44.099> like<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.370> drag<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:45.000> peg

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
suzuki v-strom you like to drag the peg

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.600 
suzuki v-strom you like to drag the peg
fee<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.389> lot<00:05:45.599> of<00:05:45.659> time<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.440> you<00:05:46.469> do<00:05:46.680> I<00:05:47.010> would<00:05:47.430> say

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
fee a lot of time and you do I would say

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.510 
fee a lot of time and you do I would say
probably<00:05:48.120> close<00:05:48.210> to<00:05:48.419> 90<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.289> 95<00:05:49.830> percent<00:05:49.860> roll

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520

probably close to 90 to 95 percent roll
use<00:05:50.760> this<00:05:51.240> tighter<00:05:51.570> should<00:05:51.840> work<00:05:52.020> very<00:05:52.050> very

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
use this tighter should work very very

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.129 
use this tighter should work very very
well<00:05:52.919> for<00:05:53.190> you<00:05:53.340> it<00:05:53.550> does<00:05:54.120> work<00:05:54.360> well<00:05:54.570> in<00:05:54.810> all
