these you know seals if you go down here

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.710 
these you know seals if you go down here
you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.670> these<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.879> two<00:02:09.270> inch<00:02:09.509> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you can see these are the two inch you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
you can see these are the two inch you
know<00:02:09.899> seals<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.580> from<00:02:12.480> US<00:02:12.750> plastics

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
or from aussie globe.com and then it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.080 
or from aussie globe.com and then it
just<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.100> happens<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.760> two-inch

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
just so happens that the two-inch

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.150 
just so happens that the two-inch
uniseal<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.720> exactly<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> right<00:02:19.470> size<00:02:19.830> for

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
uniseal is exactly the right size for

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.240 
uniseal is exactly the right size for
the<00:02:20.580> vacuum<00:02:21.540> tubes<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.500> shove<00:02:22.740> them<00:02:22.950> until

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
the vacuum tubes and we shove them until

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.550 
the vacuum tubes and we shove them until
they<00:02:23.310> come<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.880> above<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.780> top<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
they come just above the top of the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.320 
they come just above the top of the
rubber<00:02:25.770> in<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> uniseal<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.730> we're<00:02:27.030> able<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
rubber in the uniseal and we're able to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.100 
rubber in the uniseal and we're able to
fit<00:02:27.510> all<00:02:27.660> ten<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:29.190> standard<00:02:29.910> fence<00:02:30.510> post<00:02:30.840> so

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
fit all ten in a standard fence post so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.960 
fit all ten in a standard fence post so
it's<00:02:31.260> almost<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:32.040> was<00:02:32.280> designed<00:02:32.760> for

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
it's almost as if it was designed for

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
it's almost as if it was designed for
that<00:02:33.180> now<00:02:33.840> what<00:02:34.290> we're<00:02:34.470> doing<00:02:34.740> here

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that now what we're doing here

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.210 
that now what we're doing here
we<00:02:35.820> put<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.270> cold<00:02:36.570> water<00:02:36.900> inlet<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.710> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
we put the cold water inlet on the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.300 
we put the cold water inlet on the
bottom<00:02:38.670> angle<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:40.170> side<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.100> what

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
bottom angle of the one side and what

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.530 
bottom angle of the one side and what
that<00:02:41.430> happens<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.970> band<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.240> can<00:02:42.300> hook<00:02:42.420> your

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that happens to band you can hook your

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.000 
that happens to band you can hook your
garden<00:02:42.900> hose<00:02:43.080> here<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.650> they've<00:02:43.740> got<00:02:43.890> your

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
garden hose here and they've got your

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.820 
garden hose here and they've got your
valve<00:02:44.250> here<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.390> could<00:02:45.510> open<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.530> and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
valve here so you could open it up and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.820 
valve here so you could open it up and
that<00:02:47.640> would<00:02:47.820> let<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.150> cold<00:02:48.420> water<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.960> low<00:02:49.470> if

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
that would let the cold water in low if

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.710 
that would let the cold water in low if
we<00:02:49.950> back<00:02:50.130> up<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.490> little<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.820> here<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.450> cold

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
we back up a little bit here the cold

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.870 
we back up a little bit here the cold
water<00:02:52.050> will<00:02:52.170> then<00:02:52.320> flow<00:02:52.890> through<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.550> bottom

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
water will then flow through the bottom

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.390 
water will then flow through the bottom
part<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.450> drop<00:02:55.140> down<00:02:55.440> into<00:02:55.740> these<00:02:55.980> tubes

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
part and drop down into these tubes

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.850 
part and drop down into these tubes
these<00:02:56.790> are<00:02:56.970> hollow<00:02:57.330> vacuum<00:02:57.810> tubes<00:02:58.110> until<00:02:58.410> it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
these are hollow vacuum tubes until it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.400 
these are hollow vacuum tubes until it
fills<00:02:59.220> them<00:02:59.490> up<00:02:59.640> with<00:02:59.790> water<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.660> fill<00:03:00.990> this<00:03:01.170> up

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
fills them up with water to fill this up

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.110 
fills them up with water to fill this up
and<00:03:01.650> continue<00:03:02.100> filling<00:03:02.430> until<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.940> whole

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and continue filling until the whole

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.420 
and continue filling until the whole
thing<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:03.570> filled<00:03:03.840> with<00:03:03.900> cold<00:03:04.230> water<00:03:04.440> having

this<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.780> Sun<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.260> we'll<00:03:25.350> build<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.620> stand

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
this in the Sun and we'll build a stand

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.390 
this in the Sun and we'll build a stand
for<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
for it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.370 
for it
so<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.180> sun's<00:03:27.510> light<00:03:27.840> which<00:03:28.080> we<00:03:28.200> just

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
so that the sun's light which we just

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.290 
so that the sun's light which we just
proved<00:03:28.560> today<00:03:28.860> didn't<00:03:29.070> we<00:03:29.100> even<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.060> really

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
will begin to rise pulling more cold

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.420 
will begin to rise pulling more cold
water<00:03:46.110> down<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.590> back<00:03:46.800> you'll<00:03:47.160> get<00:03:47.250> this

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
water down the back you'll get this

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.000 
water down the back you'll get this
