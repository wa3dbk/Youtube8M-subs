00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.639
 we accept what would the last one expect on Monday sticks 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.540
 not a labor 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.210
 once we have not downloaded 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.670
 we opened it installed us the next spiritual is very easy 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.190
 a good program of this nation 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.190
 and once we are in power 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.030
 you are right 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.240

 apple has a name 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.360
 again 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 then I told myself that we could believe what we wanted 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.410
 and when we do 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.130

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.640
 for that percent would be the movies section 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.250
 the one above 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.909

 you have to go to the one above file 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.629
 and we go down until he puts me 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.709
 anyone to the house 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.729

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.089
 the 90 where we can look for our idiot 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.169
 what before the fear of a desk 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.069
 which we want to put there 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.809

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.209
 hamilton on paper 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.089
 we must open 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.499
 and like this 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.779
 we were just pascal lamy inside 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.169
 alaya had committed a series of those scheduled to fire them for 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.899
 we have to pass it inside our iphone 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.059
 then we will give the tab tab 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.039
 from here 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.119
 where is our iphone 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.319
 once 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.899
 we do not get to this movie high because we want to put a movie 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.619
 and here we did not see all the films that we put in the stands 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:23.789
 if we do not have to look for the one that was morally we extracted link 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.039
 I told him 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.039
 we mark it 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:31.840
 now 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.290
 can we simply have to give it its imprint 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.209
 so that they do not wait with hearth slezack 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.979
 for beacon eyelash 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.349
 pathetic 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.769
 looking in the movies for the progrÃ©s del pib music and the bulls that 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.299
 tennis currently shows phone 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.299
 and I the area that films 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.999
 and like that I do not have a right now 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.489
 writes 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.489
 then to give it to him 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.299
 well increase because I took 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.730
 marked this one of stimulus because with the iss we marked it 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.589
 and we got here to apply 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.279
 then now against us 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.279
 panels is synchronized 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.770
 it takes a few seconds for his psoe silhouette because he makes a copy of everything 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.550
 it is totally possible in case one day 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.550
 the text to the phone headers well with eta 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.559
 it is made of mushrooms a copy of everything on the agenda of everything that has been achieved 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:43.129
 it's time for the expo for that reason in this phone restaurant 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.539
 is to erase everything and do it all over again 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.409
 and in which the last copy that 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.300
 sears what have you done 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.419
 then they do not want in exploration contracts and will be dominated by that 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.020
 saves everything in grandstands 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.020
 The operation is going very well 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.729
 then when I finish copying 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.270
 everything that 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.250
 We have made it expensive 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.110
 because he was wearing 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.050
 a video 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.050
 but you can also put pretexts away from music 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.489
 Senate all songs that you have committed in the same way that everything in the 

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.749
 video spain will go library 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:24.499

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:29.900

 and I'll kiss it synchronize down and so that goes inside the phone 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.349
 with photos happened in them 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.020
 time here 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.139

 the folder one of the photos that recreate the phone 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.460
 the eighties style brand this decision but it is not only a thermometer of 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.810
 control this prize is a setback 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.380

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.009
 how it was and 2 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.080
 it includes what I had before 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.520
 and that's how a 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.129
 very quickly 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:13.279
 Well, I explained how
