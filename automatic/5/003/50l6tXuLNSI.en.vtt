00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.599
 with the very good ones, how are you doing? 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.760
 it's good this is the first video of 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.820
 channel in which I will explain which 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:43.120
 would be the lisandra and how good 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.640
 explain the purpose skills would be 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.170
 the daughter page of the ice after a 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 pronouncement of life 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.500
 and hitting is a person with the passive 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.830
 the cooling that the passive has and 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.540
 so we will have it way more quickly 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.460
 solidarity is a fragment of ice and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.710
 Sandra is related true that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.479
 break the part of the first enemy to be 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.250
 one that inflicted his year and a half 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.350
 speed increasing for a brief 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.340
 period of time the enemies that are 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.979
 killing the target they also receive dale 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.740
 well basically more or less like the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.890
 javelin levels and part of new and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.859
 pupa makes the third skill is the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.100
 ring stepping to catch closer and 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:43.130
 immobilizing a period of time you 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.689
 you can talk about your enemy in the room 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.549
 Frost ring and data 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.659
 immobilized these serve very well for 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.939
 escape for when they do that not something 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.860
 the plant in flooded would be way 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.289
 to step in front of a straight line of 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.060
 lagarde duel slow and the reporter 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.340
 that even give our enemies that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.649
 always on its way to active governance in a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.709
 path of grace and save yourself transport 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.750
 of orientation of the extra claw for me 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.180
 the units that I love the most though 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.980
 have much hidden but one of the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.250
 plus one of the skills that most 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.459
 love the song is to stretch the hand 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.110
 it is sweeping drag its way all the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.810
 world in fall 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.810
 and when the marked point arrives 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.630
 we can escape from enemies with 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:44.180
 they can buy for it also and 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.180
 the last one would be the launches 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.290
 becomes invulnerable 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.330
 and the nearby 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.330
 this purchase more 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.440
 it does not make you 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.660
 one 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:35.959
 we take and this ice area is that of the 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.230
 girl says burial 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.230
 with the day 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.700
 for the life that has those of the grave and 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.390
 this is a clan a great harm we can 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.299
 do with lisandra good life and 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.230
 would be the next one first we 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.359
 we will remove in a few we will begin with that 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.730
 how do you want to start with the transit of 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.670
 crystal versions of human life 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.930
 as you want to see almost three portions or 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.930
 as you want but 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.199
 the definitive one would be the boots of 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.199
 magician 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.329
 from my 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.360
 we do not do 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.230
 villains 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:53.679
 a moment of the day and a life like 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.679
 you want 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:13.360
 in the afternoon and it is very fast 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.250
 this is more or less points 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.220
 and the way of lysander's abilities 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.220
 the doubts the new ones would advise to enter 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.220
 federality 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:36.070
 with the mana generation ability 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.440
 basically a little bit of penetration 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.890
 magical and already all that 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.890
 you go more campaign 2 and the masterships are 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.150
 those that will be on screen more or less 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.400
 always the one that uses the preparation the 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.710
 they need a lot of speed a lot of damage 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.810
 and they are only recommended 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.810
 they like pretty good 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.900
 different 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.970
 in being married 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.100
 never stopped I will also try to do 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.240
 parties other suppliers and that so that 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.660
 We invite the everything in your life 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.660
 alcalÃ¡ 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:40.460
 they have also begun to subscribe 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.530

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:50.099
 OK, good bye
