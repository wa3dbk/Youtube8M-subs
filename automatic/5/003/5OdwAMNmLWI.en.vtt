00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
it actually is very taxing on the

it actually is very taxing on the
hosting<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> lot<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.189 
hosting it's going to do a lot of
pulling<00:00:28.410> from<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.820> MySQL<00:00:29.820> database<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.660> as

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
more and more and more and it can

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170

do<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.090> these<00:00:51.239> queries<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> all<00:00:51.899> these

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
do all these queries and all these

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
do all these queries and all these
different<00:00:52.260> databases<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.160> order<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.059> pull

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
different databases in order to pull

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
different databases in order to pull
that<00:00:54.480> information<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.230> compile<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> page<00:00:56.010> so

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that information to compile the page so

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.860 
that information to compile the page so
and<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.730> doing<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> fly<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and it's doing it all on the fly and it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.410 
and it's doing it all on the fly and it
has<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> within<00:00:58.590> seconds<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.210> first

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
has to do it within seconds so the first

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
has to do it within seconds so the first
suggestion<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.140> would<00:01:01.320> make<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.070> in

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
suggestion that I would make just to in

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.450 
suggestion that I would make just to in
order<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.609> speed<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.870> website<00:01:04.260> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
definitely try to get rid of all the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.630 
definitely try to get rid of all the
plugins<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.680> absolutely<00:01:08.490> not

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
plugins that are absolutely not

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
plugins that are absolutely not
necessary<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.799> they

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
necessary because all they do is they

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
necessary because all they do is they
cause<00:01:11.250> problems<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.900> slow

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
much loaded up but it's just going to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.319 
much loaded up but it's just going to
pull<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.350> real<00:01:28.560> quick<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.299> way

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
pull it up real quick so this is one way

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.230 
pull it up real quick so this is one way
that<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.079> found<00:01:31.890> by<00:01:32.220> using<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.729> plug-in<00:01:32.970> it's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that I found by using this plug-in it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
that I found by using this plug-in it's
really<00:01:33.659> made<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> big<00:01:33.930> difference<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.979> how

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
really made a big difference with how

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.249 
really made a big difference with how
fast<00:01:35.460> my<00:01:35.640> website<00:01:36.150> has<00:01:36.329> been<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
fast my website has been going and it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
fast my website has been going and it
probably<00:01:37.650> doubled<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:38.579> even<00:01:38.610> triple<00:01:38.970> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
quick access which is basically turning

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.110 
quick access which is basically turning
caching<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.340> would<00:02:47.760> recommend

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
caching on you know I would recommend

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.350

turning<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.890> know<00:02:50.010> compress<00:02:50.430> pages<00:02:50.940> so

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
turning on you know compress pages so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.819

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
recommended as well and the other is

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.190 
recommended as well and the other is
cash<00:03:02.310> rebuild<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.569> will<00:03:03.750> actually<00:03:03.870> go

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
cash rebuild so this will actually go

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.500 
cash rebuild so this will actually go
through<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.530> generate<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> new<00:03:05.790> file<00:03:06.150> every

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
through and generate a new file every

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.220 
through and generate a new file every
once<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.930> while<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.290> rebuild<00:03:07.709> your<00:03:07.859> cash<00:03:08.099> so

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
once in a while to rebuild your cash so

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.900 
once in a while to rebuild your cash so
basically<00:03:10.230> what<00:03:10.379> happens<00:03:10.799> is<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.700> make<00:03:11.879> it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
basically what happens is if you make it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.319 
basically what happens is if you make it
update<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.599> your<00:03:12.840> site<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.790> not<00:03:15.030> showing

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
update on your site and it's not showing

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.089 
update on your site and it's not showing
right<00:03:15.569> away<00:03:15.780> it's<00:03:15.989> because<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:16.739> super

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
right away it's because of the super

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.580 
right away it's because of the super
cache<00:03:17.310> setting<00:03:17.700> has<00:03:17.790> been<00:03:18.030> turned<00:03:18.269> on<00:03:18.419> and<00:03:18.690> you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
cache setting has been turned on and you

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.220 
cache setting has been turned on and you
want<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:19.889> actually<00:03:20.099> rebuild<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.359> one

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
want it to actually rebuild so one

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.539 
want it to actually rebuild so one
suggestion<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.069> when<00:03:23.280> you're<00:03:23.400> working

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
suggestion is that when you're working

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.120 
suggestion is that when you're working
on<00:03:23.819> your<00:03:23.849> site<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:25.380> turn<00:03:25.590> off<00:03:25.739> super

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
on your site is the turn off super

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.849 
on your site is the turn off super
caching<00:03:26.609> because<00:03:27.359> otherwise<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:28.440> won't<00:03:28.590> see

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
caching because otherwise you won't see

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.530 
caching because otherwise you won't see
all<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.099> your<00:03:29.190> updates<00:03:29.549> right<00:03:29.760> away<00:03:30.030> okay

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
all of your updates right away okay

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.000 
all of your updates right away okay
there's<00:03:31.260> other<00:03:31.410> things<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.799> are<00:03:31.889> more

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
there's other things that are more

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.670 
there's other things that are more
