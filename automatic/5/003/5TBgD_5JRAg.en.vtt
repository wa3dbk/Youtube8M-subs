00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.740
 dear skyrim friends my name serious 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.130
 and today there is a video on the subject 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.599
 beautiful armor in heaven's edge and me 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.519
 I recently announced that I 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.170
 something like a top ten of mine 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.449
 wanted to make personal armor and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.199
 now it is only one for today 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.119
 top 3 in july 2013 so that became 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.920
 are 3 armor I currently use 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.900
 maybe the last one 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.529
 videos were seen and after which 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.239
 simply many people have asked yes 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.430
 follow the armor here which is found 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.320
 currently still on the scale exons 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.660
 front side that was with me ever 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.800
 also to see screenshots before that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 all a bit more known 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.410
 is and this is the noris girl armor 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.309
 this is a ump variant and viruses the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.350
 can see pretty well 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.469
 that's a kind of chain shirt with that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.379
 a few details enriched and decorated 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 is relative 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.059
 how can I say she is now 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.829
 nothing went 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.379
 yes, she does not show much skin 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 but she is very very physical 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.350
 but somehow it still feels good to me 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.060
 fallen because it is a whole 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 I've got an independent look here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.020
 a bit in line with the problem that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.270
 my character is just following the hair 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.750
 wears in front and that through it 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.310
 this fur collar she goes through what's mine 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.310
 personally then not very good 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.869
 So it is more suitable for one 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.400
 character of the hair backwards 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.180
 We can wear here once 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.119
 see you pretty well 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.009
 that consists of rose top part this 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.320
 Fur collar gloves and so on and on 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.030
 so on that can be everything 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 individually forge so when I give her the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.430
 fur collar take away 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.079
 then that fits with the hair too 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.170
 better and I have her as an example 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.509
 small detail then the witch 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.700
 umulett umgehÃ¤ngt what also very much 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.799
 the effect is also good 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.390
 back is very tight 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.090
 I thought I'll give you that 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.399
 such a picture and overall a very 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 nice armor because it somehow 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.600
 very harmonious, I think yes then 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.490
 I opted for today's video for 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.950
 a completely different version decided 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.659
 which in turn shows a lot of skin 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.100
 and that's an armor too 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.700
 a bit longer on the market, the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.990
 is the vig poor legs and they exist 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.650
 for cb and ump so 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.690
 You will find the company I think 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.950
 the whole also has a very own 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.040
 look that's why I have that too 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.650
 chosen because it is so yes 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.420
 colorful it has so these metal plates 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.240
 with the turn then at the new emb 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.400
 extremely reflect and it is somehow that way 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.070
 a very nice mix between 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.900
 somehow yes no idea newfangled 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.910
 armor that is no armor, though 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.390
 then somehow very well again 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.280
 the third armor comes to validity 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.660
 I will address today 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.630
 after that, most of them have it 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.830
 people asked and that is the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.800
 Funnily, it has a pretty German 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.680
 Names this is the iron plate armor 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.230
 ump and cbi can do it both times 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.970
 and they are relatively many 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.770
 Variants here we see them once in 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.150
 black and white and then there's that 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.620
 Whole always so I say now 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.050
 to give a girl a script 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.970
 or with such sides plates and 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.290
 of course there are boots 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.540
 gloves and so on and so forth 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.740
 if you have the variant here with the skate 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.320
 you can see 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.420
 the good line is here from above now 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.910
 down to a very slim as well 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.040
 Light armor packed with the very 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.140
 many ornaments is simply decorated 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.810
 yes at the forge here we can completely 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.690
 beautiful the individual elements of the iron 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.640
 see armor and in which details is 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.740
 that just gives up here with this scared 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.390
 variants light variations with these 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.860
 side plates and so on and so forth 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.900
 you can do it easily 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.580
 forge as well as most armor 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.780
 which you have to download via mod 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.240
 Of course, just pay attention if now 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.550
 For example, a Danish armor load 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.250
 this also in your forge skill 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.710
 You are so far, so far, that you are like that too 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.100
 could forge so now i have her 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.770
 the something so easily dressed 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.610
 Variant dressed and chamomile or 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.080
 camel the camel 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.060
 although that might also fit 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.850
 I will now this one here 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.340
 miss all armor because she has the 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.570
 yes in the last two videos to her 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.510
 own person actually such a 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.440
 little 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.879
 who made the wrong now famous 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.310
 word they have been around longer us has 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.169
 also many thumbs up already 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.270
 also get the scales nexus page 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.550
 but that's how most of them came 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.280
 ask me for something lately 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.720
 I'm using it for armor 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.190
 Of course you can partially 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.930
 still quite combine with 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.580
 the one or the other sword or already 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.490
 sometimes with a cape or sometimes with 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.680
 a trailer or what I know 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.630
 Overall, I find armor yes 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.840
 maybe not 50 percent to one 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.690
 but at least 30 years old 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.020
 up to 40 percent like such a character 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.850
 he is thinking about making armor 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.520
 out and that is here now 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.289
 Variant the whole thing as one piece 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.070
 far into such a final fantasy corner 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.440
 maybe move 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.780
 yes, they are just like that 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.520
 standard skyrim armor of this 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.560
 north look and so deviate 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.930
 but you should also do that in this case 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.010
 because I want to completely with these videos 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.780
 just a little something 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.970
 show others or what is feasible what 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.130
 it is possible that is also on the 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.370
 one or the other screenshot right 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.169
 really good if you are so up 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.330
 original rough armor stands then 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.270
 Of course, there are enough for 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.260
 on skyrim nexus or other websites 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.060
 to find 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.440
 yes, I just think about it again 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.000
 a little bit about what I mean with the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.560
 armor will make in the near future time 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.840
 maybe I'll just show you too 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.220
 Let's have a video on skyrim nexus 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.050
 maybe find a nice armor 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.479
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.160
 I'll definitely say that at this point 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.620
 with the last ten quite hearty 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.880
 Thanks for watching until next time 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.880
 and skin in
