this<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.480> teeth<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.960> it

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this is just my teeth on it

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.929 
this is just my teeth on it
it<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.560> literally<00:00:25.859> done<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> few<00:00:26.550> minutes<00:00:26.880> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
it was literally done in a few minutes I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
it was literally done in a few minutes I
didn't<00:00:27.180> really<00:00:27.359> spend<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> time

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
didn't really spend a lot of time

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.080 
didn't really spend a lot of time
perfecting<00:00:28.859> different<00:00:29.550> things<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
perfecting different things because I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.049 
perfecting different things because I
believe<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.830> hard<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.940> with

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
believe that it's so hard to do it with

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.610 
believe that it's so hard to do it with
this<00:00:33.210> character<00:00:33.660> create<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> plastic

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this character create the plastic

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.220 
this character create the plastic
surgery<00:00:34.980> options<00:00:35.340> there's<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> lot<00:00:37.200> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
surgery options there's not a lot of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.720 
surgery options there's not a lot of
it's<00:00:37.829> much<00:00:38.040> better<00:00:38.190> than<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.610> on

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it's much better than what it was on

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
it's much better than what it was on
last<00:00:38.940> gen<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.320> gen<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.890> still<00:00:41.219> not

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
last gen but on this gen it's still not

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.810 
last gen but on this gen it's still not
100%<00:00:42.649> what<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:43.920> expect<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.489> should<00:00:44.730> be

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
100% what I would expect you should be

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.490 
100% what I would expect you should be
able<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> grab<00:00:45.149> points<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> fierce<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
able to grab points of the fierce and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.990 
able to grab points of the fierce and
stretch<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> certain<00:00:47.309> sizes<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.879> stuff

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
stretch it to certain sizes and stuff

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
stretch it to certain sizes and stuff
layer<00:00:48.210> maybe<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> clicking<00:00:49.050> point<00:00:49.289> now

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
layer maybe have a clicking point now

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
layer maybe have a clicking point now
like<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> mouse<00:00:50.340> type<00:00:51.000> thing<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.239> click<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
like a mouse type thing and click and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
like a mouse type thing and click and
drag<00:00:51.840> stuff<00:00:52.110> instead<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.469> these<00:00:52.710> sliders<00:00:53.070> back

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
drag stuff instead of these sliders back

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.610 
drag stuff instead of these sliders back
and<00:00:53.610> forth<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.090> mean<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.050> still<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.440> it's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and forth I mean it's still good it's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.869 
and forth I mean it's still good it's
much<00:00:55.770> better<00:00:55.920> than<00:00:56.100> last<00:00:56.190> gen<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.670> said

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
much better than last gen like I said

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.200 
much better than last gen like I said
but<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:58.199> can't<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.489> exact<00:00:59.850> look<00:01:00.030> you're
