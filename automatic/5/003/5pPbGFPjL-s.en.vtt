00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.949
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.020
 another battlefield 4 comments 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.930
 today it's about the battlefield 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.910
 go four maps or which maps I too 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.670
 which game mode I prefer 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.800
 me a list of the game modes in 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.810
 I picked four worlds now 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.640
 to talk about it quite spontaneously 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.350
 which web I like that which I like 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.150
 I just do not like what I mean now 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.040
 The first thing that comes to mind is that then 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.440
 usually the truth when you go 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.030
 not for a long time thinks about it 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.040
 I do not know what's in here 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.660
 background will run out of gameplay 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.220
 because I really wanted to 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.610
 record gameplay because I just now 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.290
 had time to do so, however, came on 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.300
 13.11 so for me today for you 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.880
 probably the day before yesterday or so came 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.469
 the new update and associated with it 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.219
 Of course, the short construction period of 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.780
 world 4 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.329
 However , it should be 13 clock again 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.680
 go but did not go there Battlelog 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.229
 is still there now and we have 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.789
 now almost 15 o'clock and yes as I said 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.719
 Battlelog is still good as he is 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.100
 do not mind I can mine 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.280
 to record gameplay even later 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.209
 but so much if you are wondering 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.219
 that now the last two days 

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:17.569
 somehow no gameplays have any good 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.979
 But now I'm finally going to the 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.990
 comments we start with the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.799
 classic game modes or with the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.289
 classic game mode in battlefield 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.329
 with congress that's kind of like 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.479
 What Berlin makes up for tdm can also be 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.369
 So playing a cod I'm in Congress 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.469
 Principle of the mode of battlefield 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.899
 makes up for me and my favorites 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.219
 nap is a map that is rather less 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.829
 on the servers by the rather 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.719
 is unknown but I'm soo the 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.569
 Tank driver likes to be on the ground 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.719
 the dfv is in the sales 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.919
 fighting which levy 25 our stuff and 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.869
 of course the right ones too 

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:55.039
 Schutzpanzer likes to drive 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.840
 of course, the mobile 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.520
 artillery this now in battlefield 4 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.989
 There are two this year in the delphi too 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.039
 But I was already in the enjoyment yes 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.770
 unfortunately not come if because 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.020
 missing premium and that's why I like 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.509
 golmud railway resp 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.790
 golmud railway pointed to German means 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.630
 German translation met very much anyway 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.430
 in the 44th 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.900
 yes this is my favorite city united 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.510
 because 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.189
 each team has four cold four tanks 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.220
 I think there are two more pieces 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:26.200
 internally from tui fighting is gone and he 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.790
 is corrected at the cc or d point 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.549
 me if I'm wrong, yes, too 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.829
 another artillery around that means a lot 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.720
 very vehicle-specific maps of course 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.049
 Of course it is natural, of course 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.150
 exactly 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.189
 Of course it is also clear that on the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.109
 map because it is nice and flat 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.560
 only in principle, this one building and 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.540
 This one has very chat 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.400
 lastig and helicopter leave me something 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.980
 I do not like it myself because of myself 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.389
 Fly helicopters too 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.440
 However , then come on the jets and 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.030
 ask you away because you have that 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.109
 Helicopter really has no chances 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.549
 I somehow from the chat in 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.950
 to bring security because you have no 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.049
 mountain or so has for the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.909
 Aviation I just say that's it 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.819
 a relatively bad map but I am 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.980
 that's why the floor is playing galway because 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.519
 the best map in the game 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.959
 Bankruptcy goes well we go further 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.019
 dominate nomination is now 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.879
 just with a wash namely with roche 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.150
 with squad deathmatch and team deathmatch 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.010
 the same, so I do nothing in principle 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.290
 the shit flag is out for 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.819
 domination is exactly the same as me 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.709
 team deathmatch only by the flags 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.109
 something more interesting so I play 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.599
 In any case, a lot of things dominated 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.400
 rather than team deathmatch and 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.609
 I actually like nomination completely 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.280
 spontaneously , shanghai looks best 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.989
 could then still hainan resort and 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.489
 long ago then thinks I find relatively 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.379
 equal to the market breakdown ago 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.949
 you could also count on it 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.419
 and yes those are my three favorite 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.430
 website just now so one 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.650
 resort and focus on shanghai actually 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.090
 mostly just shanghai often 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.150
 one is already used to one 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.430
 classic good tdf is the roof 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.900
 somehow in the beta was a lot 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.720
 used more frequently like now in the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.459
 release version as in the beta was the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.819
 fight for the roof what the main thing that 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.139
 we are dominant and now it is in principle 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.729
 no idea somehow so no one 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.930
 more about that on the roof though 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.280
 we finally got it 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.889
 that it really brings nothing 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.510
 one but down a lot Merkel makes all right 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.540
 so much to so near as I said looks 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:30.389
 Shanghai also analyzed great because of the 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.590
 after the hotel and so the roof above 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.690
 Of course, then nothing brings in 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.120
 domination but what I always find cool 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.940
 if you are the team what is on the quasi 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.220
 river side or on the confluence side 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.500
 spontaneously well on the green meadow is the 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.600
 big and not on the plus side spawn 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.050
 then you can be relatively good team 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.360
 Wash behind your back behind the blow and 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.889
 from behind then the whole opponent from the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.120
 lure all opponents out so that is 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.380
 would have done relatively cool just times 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.419
 Try if you have three times as much 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.900
 time just left or right around 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.250
 relatively unnoticed around the pool and 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.479
 then from the back all the opponents 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.010
 switching off is a lot of fun 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.460
 you make a lot of so many 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.669
 really cool then it's on 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.150
 with washing spontaneously of course the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.610
 best map is actually bursting so 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.500
 Floodplains or flood plain really with 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.389
 distance the best map I love this 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.430
 roofs fight on it I love that 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.229
 just like one of the one 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.610
 side by side celebrates the first 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.139
 station, I do not think so great now 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.539
 but that is also always relatively fast 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.550
 So either the attacking team over 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.470
 do it or the defending team 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.450
 totally admit there is none 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.789
 middle way at the first station find 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.560
 I will after that but if the attacker 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.000
 team the first two stations out of the 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.010
 first station has turned off afterwards 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.020
 It's really exciting because 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.030
 on the roofs the fights are right 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.680
 horny one has an enormous amount of cover one 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.470
 can also be really good with the phone 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.490
 work that is great with the 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.639
 to sell stairs 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.650
 actually serving that makes one 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:03.030
 tremendous fun and then it starts 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:05.220
 as soon as you get to the parade I totally 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.479
 as soon as you are at the parking garage station 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.830
 so to speak, at the last 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.680
 That's where the right one starts 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.720
 wrong it is really cool as an attacker 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.460
 to wash in there because they are sitting there 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.410
 in her fifth 11 the notches and 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.080
 banners on the roofs like 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.370
 crazy and that's really how it works 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.300
 it's fun that attacker 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.280
 whitewash 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.020
 The defender is also superhot 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.590
 simply deliver the staircases 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.910
 and of course the driveways too 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.700
 ask because they have more or more 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.380
 less over because you get through that 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.599
 water only on the railings and 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.510
 so into the parking garage purely so that's 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:40.150
 just the world 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:43.270
 and I like it very much then 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.630
 literary i like the system on 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.190
 dearest simply because industry by the way 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.640
 even that is I find cool 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.020
 simply because no idea that with the 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.490
 waves and that's what I like 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.010
 I do not like kombis so much because 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.830
 I now less so the chat 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.680
 is regulated so I think the system 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:07.750
 he so a chat flier bankruptcy map so 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:10.180
 As I said, operation is easy to pass 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.710
 exactly what base tower is also great though 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.970
 only when you are on the islands 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.050
 and not on the first station with the 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.850
 ship this is just a wild one 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.220
 rumgeballer especially in 32 people or 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.140
 The fuse has been so good after quiet gram 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.720
 am still easy on godmodetrader 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.240
 because the village above is really short and 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.280
 cover is and then thinks too 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.690
 really cool because he knows these routes 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.160
 There are these typical in principle there is 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.150
 then only three runs that explained
