00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.570
 THE OLDEST CIVILIZATION OF HUMANITY 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.930
 HE WARNED US 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.959
 THAT THIS DAY 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.490
 WOULD ARRIVE 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.609
 This collective suicide makes reference to the calendar ... 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.690
 "... maya, who predicts that the end of time ..." 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.489
 "... it will happen on the 21st ..." 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.840
 "... December of this year." 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 "...this year." 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.570
 "...this year." 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.450
 What are our chances? 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.930
 FROM ROLAND EMMERICH 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.250
 "I thought everyone would die." 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.310
 THE DIRECTOR OF THE DAY OF INDEPENDENCE 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.990
 AND THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.680
 He said the government is building ships. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.320
 When will we let people find out? 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.995
 Our mission is to ensure the ... 

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:31.820
 ... continuity of our species. 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.925
 Has not it also been decided that people have ... 

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:36.470
 ... the right to fight for their lives? 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.400
 THE END 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.030
 IT IS ONLY THE PRINCIPLE 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.220
 No matter what happens... 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.550
 ... we will all stay together. 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.539
 THIS NOVEMBER 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.460
 "Discover the truth, find out about 2012."
