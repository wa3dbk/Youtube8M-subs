00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
make a decision on basically is it I

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.340 
make a decision on basically is it I
guess<00:02:52.490> would<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.760> be<00:02:52.850> sizeable<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.870> what<00:02:54.320> I

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
guess would it be sizeable and what I

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.440 
guess would it be sizeable and what I
mean<00:02:54.470> by<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.920> maybe<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:56.090> front

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
mean by that is maybe up front

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.880 
mean by that is maybe up front
guaranteed<00:02:56.900> money<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.320> would<00:02:57.590> have<00:02:57.620> you
