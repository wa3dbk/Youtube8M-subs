00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and I've noticed a significant

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.190 
and I've noticed a significant
difference<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.329> overall<00:00:39.450> appearance<00:00:39.989> of

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.680 
because when you do your foundation um
it<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.100> doesn't<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.090> smoothly<00:00:48.360> while

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it just doesn't go on as smoothly while

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.200 
it just doesn't go on as smoothly while
you're<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.200> combing<00:00:49.680> your<00:00:49.980> hairs<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.910> and

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
this just to make sure that I get a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
typically don't like to do that because

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.770 
typically don't like to do that because
