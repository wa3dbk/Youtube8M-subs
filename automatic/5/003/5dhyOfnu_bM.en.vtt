00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
we're just looking at photos of the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.129 
we're just looking at photos of the
Queen<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.340> TV<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.940> think<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:12.630> just<00:00:12.809> noticed

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
Queen on TV I think and we just noticed

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.749 
Queen on TV I think and we just noticed
that<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.290> Queen<00:00:13.469> seems<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.950> only<00:00:14.070> wear<00:00:14.400> one

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
that the Queen seems to only wear one

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.960 
that the Queen seems to only wear one
color<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.750> realized<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.320> always<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.369> case

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
color we realized it's always the case

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.720 
color we realized it's always the case
it<00:00:18.150> never<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:18.449> changes<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.170> then<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.460> he

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
it never really changes and then so he

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.830 
it never really changes and then so he
just<00:00:20.910> thought<00:00:21.029> it'd<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.119> quite<00:00:21.330> funny<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:21.720> we

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
just thought it'd be quite funny if we

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.210 
just thought it'd be quite funny if we
actually<00:00:21.990> made<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.350> our<00:00:22.680> just<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.010> whole

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
actually made like our just a whole

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.540 
actually made like our just a whole
scale<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.390> colors<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.050> actually<00:00:25.410> had<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.710> go

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
scale of colors we actually had to go

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.210 
scale of colors we actually had to go
onto<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> old<00:00:27.000> internet<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.220> scour

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
onto the old internet and scour

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
onto the old internet and scour
ridiculous<00:00:30.090> amount<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> images<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:31.080> trying

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
ridiculous amount of images just trying

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.560 
ridiculous amount of images just trying
to<00:00:31.439> find<00:00:31.800> through<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> years<00:00:33.210> through<00:00:33.390> these

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
to find through the years through these

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.650 
to find through the years through these
60<00:00:33.960> years<00:00:34.140> all<00:00:34.260> these<00:00:34.380> different<00:00:35.360> colors<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
60 years all these different colors in

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.240 
60 years all these different colors in
places<00:00:37.230> where<00:00:37.350> she<00:00:37.559> wore<00:00:37.739> them<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.160> we

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
places where she wore them and what we

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.990 
places where she wore them and what we
did<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> end

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
did in the end

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.880 
did in the end
Pam<00:00:39.329> Tony<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.020> fat<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.649> color

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
Pam Tony actually fat is the right color

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.299 
Pam Tony actually fat is the right color

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
reference so this is Pantone 15 40 41

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.729 
reference so this is Pantone 15 40 41
and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.690> she<00:00:45.750> went<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> Southampton<00:00:46.410> docks

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
very closely with Pantone on this very

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.569 
very closely with Pantone on this very
day<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:26.909> know<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.299> introduced<00:01:28.170> us<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
day you know they introduced us to the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.020 
day you know they introduced us to the
possibility<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.869> seven<00:01:31.259> color<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.250> print

possibility of the seven color and print
process<00:01:33.360> which<00:01:34.350> would<00:01:34.650> actually<00:01:35.130> allow<00:01:35.460> us<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
process which would actually allow us to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.660 
process which would actually allow us to
achieve<00:01:36.299> more<00:01:36.960> colors<00:01:37.500> than<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.130> standard

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
achieve more colors than the standard

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
achieve more colors than the standard
four<00:01:38.880> color<00:01:39.060> process<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.810> wanted<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> find<00:01:40.320> our

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
four color process we wanted to find our

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.499 
four color process we wanted to find our

data a data merge process of getting

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719 
data a data merge process of getting
those<00:01:42.720> numbers<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.170> quickly<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.610> we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
those numbers in quickly and then we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.859 
those numbers in quickly and then we
could<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> design

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
could look at the you know the design

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.480 
could look at the you know the design
and<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.170> kerning<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.770> also<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.310> image

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and the kerning but also with this image

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.170 
and the kerning but also with this image
of<00:01:48.299> finding<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.869> way<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.079> take<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:49.799> image

of finding a way to take one image
remove<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.869> color<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.920> then

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
remove all the color from it and then

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.450 
remove all the color from it and then
have<00:01:53.759> an<00:01:53.880> area<00:01:54.149> that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
have an area that
