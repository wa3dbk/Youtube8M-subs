actually as you can see we do not get

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
actually as you can see we do not get
any<00:01:50.729> power<00:01:51.060> brick<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.229> was<00:01:52.380> surprising

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

moto G let's get started and gives a
brief<00:02:09.509> idea<00:02:09.720> about<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.229> device<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.860> how

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
brief idea about the device and how

brief idea about the device and how
open<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.130> back<00:02:12.430> cover<00:02:12.460> and<00:02:13.020> insert<00:02:14.020> this<00:02:14.260> sim

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
open the back cover and insert this sim

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.900 
open the back cover and insert this sim
the<00:02:15.880> battery<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.390> also<00:02:16.630> sealed<00:02:16.900> inside<00:02:17.350> and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
the battery is also sealed inside and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.520 
the battery is also sealed inside and
just<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.030> quick<00:02:19.240> start<00:02:19.510> guide<00:02:19.600> how<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.110> get

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
just a quick start guide how to get

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.640 
just a quick start guide how to get
started<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.780> safety<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
started we have the safety and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.910 
started we have the safety and
regulatory<00:02:24.660> guide<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.690> guess<00:02:25.810> nothing<00:02:26.620> special

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
regulatory guide I guess nothing special

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
device itself and actually it's pretty

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.320 
device itself and actually it's pretty
small<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.410> pretty<00:02:33.220> compact<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.760> would<00:02:33.910> say<00:02:34.090> and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
small a pretty compact I would say and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.900 
small a pretty compact I would say and

this end actually nothing and actually
it's<00:04:07.660> pretty<00:04:07.780> sleek<00:04:08.230> let's<00:04:08.830> see<00:04:08.980> if<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.250> has

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
it's pretty sleek let's see if it has

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.490 
it's pretty sleek let's see if it has
any<00:04:09.400> power<00:04:09.850> so<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.690> will<00:04:10.810> be<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.989> first<00:04:11.170> boot

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
any power so this will be the first boot

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.910 
any power so this will be the first boot
for<00:04:11.709> this<00:04:11.890> Moto<00:04:12.160> G<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:13.799> immediately<00:04:14.799> it

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
for this Moto G and immediately it

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.370 
for this Moto G and immediately it
starts<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.430> just<00:04:15.459> says<00:04:15.910> Motorola<00:04:16.450> give<00:04:17.200> me<00:04:17.350> a

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
starts it just says Motorola give me a

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.250 
starts it just says Motorola give me a
haptic<00:04:17.620> feedback<00:04:17.799> also<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.930> screen<00:04:20.140> is

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
haptic feedback also and the screen is

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.570 
haptic feedback also and the screen is
pretty<00:04:20.470> bright

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
pretty bright

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.250 
pretty bright
so<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.910> might<00:04:24.120> take<00:04:24.420> some<00:04:24.630> time<00:04:24.660> because<00:04:25.110> this

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
so it might take some time because this

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.690 
so it might take some time because this
is<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:26.450> first<00:04:27.450> boot<00:04:27.810> for<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.230> device<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:31.700> it

of<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:48.780> GB<00:05:49.680> you<00:05:50.190> just<00:05:50.490> get<00:05:50.670> 5.1<00:05:51.390> GB<00:05:51.720> so<00:05:52.140> you

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
of that GB you just get 5.1 GB so you

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.560 
of that GB you just get 5.1 GB so you
need<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.560> be<00:05:52.650> careful<00:05:52.890> if<00:05:53.340> you<00:05:53.910> are<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:54.210> person

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
need to be careful if you are a person

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.150 
need to be careful if you are a person
who<00:05:54.600> likes<00:05:54.840> to<00:05:54.990> install<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.380> lot<00:05:55.620> of<00:05:55.650> apps<00:05:55.860> and

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
who likes to install a lot of apps and

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.100 
who likes to install a lot of apps and
games<00:05:56.340> it's<00:05:57.030> a<00:05:57.180> good<00:05:57.330> idea<00:05:57.450> that<00:05:57.750> you<00:05:57.780> go<00:05:57.870> with

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
games it's a good idea that you go with

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.440 
games it's a good idea that you go with
the<00:05:58.200> 16gb<00:05:58.560> version<00:05:58.950> instead<00:05:59.580> of<00:05:59.700> the<00:05:59.850> 8<00:06:00.060> GB

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
the 16gb version instead of the 8 GB

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.680 
the 16gb version instead of the 8 GB
version<00:06:00.950> so<00:06:01.950> it<00:06:02.850> closes<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.330> quad-core

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
version so it closes a quad-core

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.660 
version so it closes a quad-core
processor<00:06:04.410> and<00:06:04.650> then<00:06:04.950> let's<00:06:05.190> see<00:06:05.310> if<00:06:05.400> we<00:06:05.520> get

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
processor and then let's see if we get

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.790 
processor and then let's see if we get
this<00:06:05.820> question<00:06:06.000> known<00:06:06.420> for<00:06:07.170> the<00:06:07.260> are<00:06:07.350> tray<00:06:07.590> you

need to go like this and actually as you
can<00:06:11.280> see<00:06:11.430> not<00:06:11.730> a<00:06:11.790> lot<00:06:12.060> of<00:06:12.380> extra<00:06:13.380> apps<00:06:13.830> are

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070
