so<00:00:42.820> low<00:00:42.999> boost<00:00:43.269> and<00:00:43.629> then<00:00:44.289> normal<00:00:44.710> volume<00:00:45.100> gain

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
so low boost and then normal volume gain

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.660 
so low boost and then normal volume gain
a<00:00:45.909> clean<00:00:46.719> channel<00:00:47.140> you've<00:00:47.440> got<00:00:47.739> your<00:00:48.489> bass
