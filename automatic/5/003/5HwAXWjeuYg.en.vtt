00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 but good 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.140
 menu bar 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140
 open this is the presentation of this 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.160
 volume that I hold so much is a book on sibyls a deck of cards 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 evidently 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.610
 you know someone who is a donkey a little bit different though 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.780
 and is a 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.600
 naum 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.850
 kind of paper. minor evenings 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.390
 not the best for us 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.890
 in reality it is a blade that opens up the possibility 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.370
 d enter a different new world a new conception of cartomancy 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.290
 New Year 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.260
 because it's actually quite old 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.210
 but different from the usual one 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.770
 with the tarots that I love I want to be clear in short 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.290
 and very often it is faced even if it should not be so 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.390
 he has more serious judgments 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.130
 I am more 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.650
 more serious series 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.390
 the sibyls are cards instead 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.940
 born in the period of romanticism 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.570
 they are in the gossipy cards 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.299
 of the cards that I answer to questions above all of love but not only 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.330
 and hey let us see cartomancy 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.330
 as a chance to tell one's story 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.620
 because I wrote 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.380
 you have seen convivial cards 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 convivial shoes because 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.280
 l allow us to take a time 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.909
 to make this game 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.830
 not so much to find out what will happen tomorrow 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.310
 but for 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.970
 to tell each other 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.200
 tell yourself and others to be heard 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.939
 and to become aware of what we are experiencing 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.600
 relatively clearly to the question 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.330
 I'm a bunch of cards on 52 hunger 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.920
 and they are many 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.400
 It is one of the problems and the very fact that we have to memorize them 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.509
 and ed 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.729
 this was my commitment 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.280
 tarsu about this book on this work 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.039
 to look for a method that could help 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.599
 who wants to tackle this journey this journey 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.879
 it's a simple way to learn it 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.879
 cartomancy really must become 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.079
 a way to be together 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.339
 positive 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.629
 positive don't misunderstand me 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.049
 to find certain answers, but to have fun, to swallow that thing 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.499
 we lost because now 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:45.889
 however we have 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.200
 pizzeria 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.469
 crazy always with computer 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.529
 palpate rather than cellular 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:53.329
 there is no more 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.509
 the report 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.029
 interpersonal 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.879
 and this instead is a good system 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.870
 also to you vision and okay we all look to matheson e 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.559
 it is the perfect one if there is no one thing unique 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.629
 and so this year a good system for da 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.859
 pasta together for fun 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.919
 at the start of the response, however, there are not complicated to get to 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.499
 I understand these papers because many are frightened and many are not there 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:28.409
 let's memorize it is not enough just to look at things 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.109
 chissene image 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.180
 and the simple ones because the heart of the person will always present biagio questions 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.030
 affective 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.489
 flowers always 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.230
 questions related to passion and the desire to make pictures of material things 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.250
 and then the piche instead 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.140
 enough the cards 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.289
 complicated and same that 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:54.419
 at that moment yes i'm emotionally you live badly a situation gets sick 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:55.210
 you suffer 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.830
 there is something that is not clear that it is not good in the book then there are some 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.109
 simple game methods with examples 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.549
 and finally 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.499
 a handbook 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.629
 xp cartomanti 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.649
 in reality 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.960
 grass room obvious e 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.889
 but I care a lot about it 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:15.889
 why 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.150
 if you have the tendency to forget the importance 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.580
 when a consultation is done e 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.830
 to respect 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.270
 no opinions are expressed 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.029
 yes look for man solutions together 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.139
 on the basis of the authority of the cards obviously 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.999
 bette 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:39.779
 we are not talking about health 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.680
 here's one thing you don't 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.159
 this book dreams fucking 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.800
 I repeat it every time 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.110
 standard xd recognition of a state 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.639
 for that there is a remedy 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.639
 use a coffee in another term. 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.270
 to launch e 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.100
 it is like saying to approach other people very much 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.620
 very pupil 7 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:12.030
 -d
