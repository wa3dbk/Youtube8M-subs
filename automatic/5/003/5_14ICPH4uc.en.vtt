00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
more I don't know they probably didn't

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.210 
more I don't know they probably didn't
think<00:00:24.750> more<00:00:25.170> than<00:00:25.230> ghosts<00:00:25.680> even<00:00:25.920> though<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
think more than ghosts even though that

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
think more than ghosts even though that
might<00:00:26.490> better<00:00:26.789> that's<00:00:27.029> most<00:00:27.240> likely<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
might better that's most likely that the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.410 
might better that's most likely that the
truth<00:00:28.470> that's<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.769> most<00:00:28.980> likely<00:00:29.070> true<00:00:29.550> but

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
truth that's what most likely true but

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.290 
truth that's what most likely true but
it<00:00:30.720> comes<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.199> four<00:00:31.740> new<00:00:31.920> camos<00:00:32.340> beasts<00:00:32.790> dead

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.210 
that were actually see any map packs
though<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:31.229> you're<00:01:31.350> wondering<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.159> do

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
though so if you're wondering that I do

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.960 
though so if you're wondering that I do
doubt<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.810> possible<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.759> think

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
doubt it it's possible but I don't think

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.499 
doubt it it's possible but I don't think
that<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.710> yeah<00:01:38.640> come<00:01:39.360> we

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that they are going to so yeah come we

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.969 
that they are going to so yeah come we
think<00:01:39.840> down<00:01:40.020> below<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> these

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
think down below which one of these

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.410 
think down below which one of these
camels<00:01:41.400> look<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> best<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.270> any
