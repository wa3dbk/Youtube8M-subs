 hi youtube community was in this video 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 tutorial I will show you how to solve the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.630
 black screen problem of windows 8 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.610
 in virtual box well I have already put 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.270
 run my virtual path to not delay 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.180
 a lot this is what happens shows us 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.550
 the black screen a little accelerated well 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.690
 this happened after installing the one that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.690
 is said of virtualbox 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.030
 I just wanted to adapt all 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.030
 the screen to my monitor 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.480
 what a surprise 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.970
 as always there is no shortage of pork rinds 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.120
 The good thing is that you always find a 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.120
 solution 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.790
 next I will show you how 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.790
 solve this annoying window 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.580
 very well 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.060
 I will turn off my machine to show 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.060
 steps to follow 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.890
 well we turn to the properties of 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.890
 Machine configuration 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.049
 on screen we disable the option of 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.049
 3d acceleration 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.800
 we accept and proceed to initiate 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.800
 again our machine 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.280
 let's wait while you start 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.840
 let's wait a little 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.000
 good 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.600
 we have the beginning 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.900
 okay 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.100
 from this moment I will not have more 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.600
 problems I have already found with the solution and 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.600
 I can surf without problems 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.100
 I will try adapting the full screen 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.110
