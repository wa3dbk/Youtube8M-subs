getting kind of annoyed with myself

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.900 
getting kind of annoyed with myself
because<00:00:13.250> every<00:00:14.250> single<00:00:14.519> day<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> wasn't

because every single day I wasn't
uploading<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.299> felt<00:00:15.540> really<00:00:15.690> bad<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.230> there<00:00:16.440> is

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
uploading I felt really bad but there is

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.370 
uploading I felt really bad but there is
a<00:00:16.650> really<00:00:17.220> good<00:00:18.029> solid<00:00:18.539> reason<00:00:18.840> why<00:00:18.960> I've<00:00:19.199> been

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
a really good solid reason why I've been

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.160 
a really good solid reason why I've been
uploading<00:00:19.890> cod<00:00:20.580> videos<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.420> very<00:00:21.960> long<00:00:22.109> time

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.870 
uploading cod videos in a very long time
and<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.980> probably<00:00:23.220> should<00:00:23.430> have<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:23.760> been

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
and I probably should have actually been

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.790 
and I probably should have actually been
updating<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.449> guys<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.109> every<00:00:25.680> single

that I kind of did get a look at three

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.540 
that I kind of did get a look at three
or<00:02:22.530> four<00:02:22.680> kills<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.100> hope<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.310> guys<00:02:23.400> don't

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
or four kills that I hope you guys don't

or four kills that I hope you guys don't
mind<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.940> but<00:02:24.120> as<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.350> how<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> got

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
mind that but as you can see how I got

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.810 
mind that but as you can see how I got
the<00:02:25.770> psg-1<00:02:26.490> as<00:02:26.760> opposed<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.420> l<00:02:28.410> 96<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the psg-1 as opposed to the l 96 and the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.100 
the psg-1 as opposed to the l 96 and the
main<00:02:29.940> reason<00:02:30.240> for<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.600> because<00:02:30.630> it's

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
main reason for that is because it's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.860 
main reason for that is because it's
pretty<00:02:31.470> much<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:32.090> an<00:02:33.090> easy<00:02:33.300> gun<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.750> use

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
pretty much just an easy gun to use

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.750 
pretty much just an easy gun to use
because<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.800> there's<00:02:35.010> an<00:02:35.100> enemy<00:02:35.370> close

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
because if there's an enemy close

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.550 
because if there's an enemy close
distance<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.810> steady<00:02:37.080> aim<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.410> can

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
distance and you have steady aim you can

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.800 
distance and you have steady aim you can
really<00:02:37.770> easily<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.400> spray<00:02:38.760> him<00:02:38.940> down<00:02:39.000> or<00:02:39.660> at

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
really easily just spray him down or at

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.330 
really easily just spray him down or at
least<00:02:39.990> easier<00:02:40.470> then<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.709> would<00:02:40.890> be<00:02:40.920> able<00:02:41.130> to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
least easier then you would be able to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.000 
least easier then you would be able to
towards<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.940> 96<00:02:42.900> where<00:02:43.110> if<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.740> miss<00:02:43.890> your

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
towards a 96 where if you miss your

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.590 
towards a 96 where if you miss your
first<00:02:44.160> shot<00:02:44.340> you're<00:02:44.520> pretty<00:02:44.700> much<00:02:44.760> dead<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.360> i

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
first shot you're pretty much dead so i
