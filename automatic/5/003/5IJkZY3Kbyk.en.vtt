00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.490
 During an exam I am always afraid that I will block. 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.490
 You were driving well, my instructor said. But now I still get the jitters. 

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:21.602
 Good morning. Peter. Hey. When you are ready ... 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.039
 Getting your driver's license is an important moment in your life. 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.710
 Fear of failure can considerably disrupt that moment. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.110
 The CBR is happy to help customers with fear of failure. 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.130
 Welcome to the CBR, Desley 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.510
 and Renske, your trainer. 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.530
 You have chosen the fear of failure exam. 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 How did you come to the choice for the fear of failure exam? 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.410
 Because I am 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.060
 with exams 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.660
 say slam shut. 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.170
 That I say but forget. 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.960
 Through the nerves and things. 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 Sharon, what do you expect from the fear test? 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.770
 I expect it to be an exam which is very quiet, which is very relaxed. 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.290
 I really like that someone talks to me while driving. 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.760
 And I also like it when I get a good feedback about the things that are good 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.190
 because it just gives me more certainty and confidence. 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.070
 You have probably understood that there is a possibility to take a time out. 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.300
 Oh, yes, yes. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.800
 Do you have an idea what you can do with that, with that time out? What can you do that for 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.550
 use? Suppose I block or something, 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.790
 that I can still regain my peace. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.330
 yes and then with one 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.930
 fresh start on the road again. 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.210
 Have you discussed whether you want to bring Renske, your trainer? 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.109
 Or would you rather go on the road together? Yes the three of them. 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.070
 A bit nicer, yes. I would like to drive alone with you because I 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.320
 I'd rather have 2 eyes on me than 4. - Shall we go? 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.900
 Sharon, are we starting with the eye test? 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.300
 Would you like to read the license plate of the gray car? 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.700
 Yes, ZF-SG-48. Very well. 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.960
 We're going to the car. 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.040
 Can you tell me something about it 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.540
 the tires of the car? 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.630
 If I want to check my tires? What should I pay attention to? What is important? 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.720
 That the profile 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.820
 1.6. - Minimum 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.599
 Yes, minimal. And that there 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.499
 good tire pressure. 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.239
 I wish you a very pleasant ride. 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.079
 If you have any questions, ask them. 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:21.079
 And think of your timeout option. Yes? 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:25.779
 The fear of failure exam lasts a total of eighty minutes, 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.959
 including the 35-minute exam drive. 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.310
 During the ride, the examiner examines whether you are driving safely and independently. Thereby 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.849
 it includes the control of the car, your viewing behavior, the granting of 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.759
 priority, overtaking, entering and exiting and driving at intersections and roundabouts. 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.859
 Part of the exam consists of independent driving. It happens 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.009
 via the navigation system, a cluster assignment or driving to a friend 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.039
 point. 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.669
 In addition, you perform two special maneuvers and you get a situation 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.019
 query. 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.829
 The requirements for a fear of failure exam are the same ... 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.329
 ... as with a normal practical exam. 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.079
 Yes, everything to your liking? 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.970
 Can we take a timeout like this? Certainly, yes of course, yes. 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.999
 Just find a safe place. Beautiful. 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.399
 Sharon, I'll leave it to you. You can open the window for a moment, you can also 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:24.309
 get out, just what you want. 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.199
 We go a little further 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:30.029
 we turn right. 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:37.029
 We turn left at the traffic lights. 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:46.419
 Are you ready again? Yes. Very well. And then we drive on again. And then we can go that way. 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.369
 Desley, I want to ask you to bring us back to it with navigation 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:57.369
 CBR. 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:59.749
 Then I want to ask Sharon to 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:06.279
 to turn somewhere in this street. 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.999
 Then we go inside. 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.279
 I have good news. 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:13.359
 You passed, congratulations! Thank you. 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.109
 You are graduated. Super! 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.469
 Sharon, how did you like it? 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:19.850
 Yes, yes, it went well, it went well. 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.699
 Yes, I think that's fine. 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.520
 I was very comfortable. Have you previously taken a normal exam, a regular exam? 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.309
 What did you find the main difference with the fear of failure exam? 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.229
 Yes, there anyway 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.990
 much more rest. 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.069
 Less nervous. How did you experience the time out option? 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.730
 I really enjoyed it. 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.129
 Then I wish you many safe kilometers. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.840
 Well, now I passed too. 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.949
 Well done man, come, let's go! 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.949
 Good that there is a fear of failure exam! Yeah!
