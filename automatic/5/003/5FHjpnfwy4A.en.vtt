was working on the neighbors fuel pump

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.100 
was working on the neighbors fuel pump
the<00:00:10.980> other<00:00:11.099> day<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:12.300> decided<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.929> see

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
what's inside and why the heck are these

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.720 
what's inside and why the heck are these
things<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.240> expensive<00:00:15.980> okay<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
things so expensive okay here we have a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.010 
things so expensive okay here we have a
complete<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> tank<00:00:18.900> fuel<00:00:19.109> pump<00:00:20.869> with<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
complete in the tank fuel pump with the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.660 
complete in the tank fuel pump with the
sending<00:00:22.320> unit<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.710> everything<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.580> you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
sending unit and everything and what you

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.609 
sending unit and everything and what you
have<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.300> high-pressure<00:00:25.289> line

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
have is you have a high-pressure line

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.939 
have is you have a high-pressure line
the<00:00:26.039> feeds<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:27.119> your<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:28.320> your<00:00:28.349> engine<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the feeds out to your to your engine and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.320 
the feeds out to your to your engine and
then<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> return<00:00:29.699> line<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.119> here

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
then you have a return line right here

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.690 
then you have a return line right here
that<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.599> dumps<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.140> back<00:00:31.410> down<00:00:31.710> into<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
that just dumps right back down into the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.360 
that just dumps right back down into the
engine<00:00:33.000> or<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> fuel<00:00:34.350> tank<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.860> let's

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
engine or into the fuel tank so let's

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
engine or into the fuel tank so let's
take<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.640> off<00:00:36.500> yeah<00:00:39.379> Dadda<00:00:40.379> coming<00:00:40.680> apart

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
take that off yeah Dadda coming apart

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.139 
take that off yeah Dadda coming apart
too<00:00:41.100> much<00:00:41.250> take<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> cap<00:00:42.510> off<00:00:43.789> there's<00:00:44.789> that

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
too much take the cap off there's that

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.060 
too much take the cap off there's that
and<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.050> dumps<00:00:46.200> directly<00:00:46.649> down<00:00:46.800> into

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and it just dumps directly down into

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.400 
and it just dumps directly down into
here<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.960> fuel<00:00:49.230> pump

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
here and in here you have your fuel pump

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610 
here and in here you have your fuel pump
with<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.579> screen<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.629> everything<00:00:51.989> else<00:00:52.170> this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
with a screen and everything else this

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.720 
with a screen and everything else this
is<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.890> part<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> sending<00:00:53.670> unit

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is just part of the sending unit

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
is just part of the sending unit
essentially<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.719> filter<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.559> filter

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
essentially in a little filter to filter

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.680 
essentially in a little filter to filter
the<00:00:55.949> stuff<00:00:56.129> coming<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.760> let's<00:00:57.329> start<00:00:57.570> up

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the stuff coming in here let's start up

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
the stuff coming in here let's start up
at<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> motor<00:00:58.020> end<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
at the motor end so what we have here is

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
at the motor end so what we have here is
we<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> fuel<00:00:59.730> outlet<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
we have the fuel outlet and then you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.700 
we have the fuel outlet and then you
have<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.050> terminals<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.620> your

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
have your terminals you have your

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
have your terminals you have your
positive<00:01:02.160> negative<00:01:02.190> terminals<00:01:02.910> right<00:01:03.329> there

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
positive negative terminals right there

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.179 
positive negative terminals right there
and<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:04.350> always<00:01:04.439> connect<00:01:04.799> directly<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and they always connect directly to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.950 
and they always connect directly to
actually<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:05.700> metal<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.390> brass<00:01:06.630> little

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
actually these metal these brass little

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.109 
actually these metal these brass little
pins<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.280> those<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
pins here because those are actually the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.780 
pins here because those are actually the
top<00:01:09.330> two<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.720> motor<00:01:10.260> brushes<00:01:10.490> right<00:01:11.490> there

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
top two your motor brushes right there

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.820 
top two your motor brushes right there
and<00:01:12.080> they<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.170> there's<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> little<00:01:13.710> metal

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and they just there's a little metal

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
and they just there's a little metal
washers<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.580> connect<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
washers they just connect in there and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.310 
washers they just connect in there and
this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.509> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> crimped<00:01:16.140> around

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
this is just kind of crimped around

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
this is just kind of crimped around
there<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.770> there's<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.549> fuel<00:01:17.759> outlet<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
there but there's your fuel outlet and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
there but there's your fuel outlet and
just<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.470> electrical<00:01:19.860> connections

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
just some of your electrical connections

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.420 
just some of your electrical connections
nothing<00:01:21.119> major<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.650> off<00:01:22.860> top<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
nothing major and if we take off top of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.030 
nothing major and if we take off top of
this<00:01:23.659> we're<00:01:24.659> gonna<00:01:24.750> get<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> our<00:01:25.140> motor

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
this we're gonna get to our motor

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.770 
this we're gonna get to our motor
brushes<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.850> got<00:01:27.000> our<00:01:27.150> little<00:01:27.360> brushes<00:01:27.689> in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
brushes you got our little brushes in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.950 
brushes you got our little brushes in
there<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.020> they're<00:01:28.110> spring-loaded<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:29.549> know

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
there and they're spring-loaded you know

the help make an even make an electric
motor<00:01:49.380> spin<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.479> air<00:01:51.780> our

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
motor spin and then we just have air our

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.460 
motor spin and then we just have air our
rotor<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.780> here<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.170> see

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
rotor and here you can actually see

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.749 
rotor and here you can actually see
where<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> got<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.219> hot<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.729> actually

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
where it got so hot that it actually

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.450 
where it got so hot that it actually
melted<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.659> bubbled<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> plastic<00:01:58.439> even<00:01:59.250> in

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
melted and bubbled the plastic even in

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999 
melted and bubbled the plastic even in
between<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.479> could<00:02:00.689> tell<00:02:01.229> even<00:02:01.740> when

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
between here and I could tell even when

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
between here and I could tell even when
I<00:02:02.040> pulled<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> supplied<00:02:03.600> power<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
I pulled it out when I supplied power to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.270 
I pulled it out when I supplied power to
it<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.290> make<00:02:04.439> sure<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> contacts<00:02:05.040> weren't

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it just make sure the contacts weren't

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.730 
it just make sure the contacts weren't
dirty<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:06.540> gas<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:07.020> actually<00:02:07.350> bubbling

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
dirty the gas was actually bubbling

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.040 
dirty the gas was actually bubbling
boiling<00:02:08.220> around<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.660> our<00:02:09.869> motor

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
boiling around this so this our motor

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.500 
boiling around this so this our motor

let's<00:02:14.040> put<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.280> back<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> second<00:02:17.540> on

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
let's put that back in for a second on

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600 
let's put that back in for a second on
the<00:02:18.660> bottom<00:02:19.050> side<00:02:19.380> or<00:02:19.860> picks<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.250> gas<00:02:20.400> we

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
the bottom side or picks up the gas we

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.910 
the bottom side or picks up the gas we
do<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.910> fuel<00:02:21.120> filter<00:02:21.270> both<00:02:22.230> fuel<00:02:22.680> filter

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.520 
do have a fuel filter both fuel filter
screen<00:02:23.190> take<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.120> off<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.290> have

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
screen take that off and then we have

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.490 
screen take that off and then we have
air<00:02:25.800> our<00:02:26.220> plate<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.960> then<00:02:27.960> behind<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.290> we

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
air our plate and then behind that we

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.670 
air our plate and then behind that we
have<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:29.240> essentially<00:02:30.240> like<00:02:30.810> an<00:02:30.930> impeller<00:02:31.230> okay

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
have a essentially like an impeller okay

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
have a essentially like an impeller okay
and<00:02:32.160> you'll<00:02:32.640> notice<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> inside<00:02:33.300> this

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
and you'll notice on the inside this

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.500 
and you'll notice on the inside this
plate<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:35.280> groove<00:02:35.580> gets<00:02:36.000> shallower

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
plate that the groove gets shallower

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.570 
plate that the groove gets shallower
essentially<00:02:37.350> because<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.650> compressing<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
essentially because it's compressing the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.270 
essentially because it's compressing the
fuel<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.650> you'll<00:02:40.650> notice<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.250> actually

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
fuel and you'll notice that it actually

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.790 
fuel and you'll notice that it actually
pulls<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:43.140> side<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:46.260> inlet<00:02:46.590> on

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
pulls it up this side this the inlet on

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.230 
pulls it up this side this the inlet on
this<00:02:46.980> side<00:02:47.190> which<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.640> straight<00:02:47.940> through<00:02:48.030> hole

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
this side which is straight through hole

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.690 
this side which is straight through hole
lines<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.050> with<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.380> tab<00:02:49.620> or<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.490> groove

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
lines up with this tab or this groove

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.640 
lines up with this tab or this groove
right<00:02:50.760> here<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.510> as<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.810> gas<00:02:52.020> goes<00:02:52.260> around<00:02:52.440> it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
right here and as the gas goes around it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.440 
right here and as the gas goes around it
compresses<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.190> compresses<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:54.060> actually

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
compresses and compresses this actually

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.900 
compresses and compresses this actually
slopes<00:02:54.690> up<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.410> then<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.770> released<00:02:55.920> through

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
slopes up and then it's released through

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.890 
slopes up and then it's released through
there<00:02:57.150> up<00:02:58.080> around<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.280> motor<00:02:59.750> through<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
there up around the motor through the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.940 
there up around the motor through the
housing<00:03:01.350> out<00:03:02.810> through<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> top<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.830> know

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
housing out through the top you know

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.680 
housing out through the top you know
just<00:03:05.190> straight<00:03:05.520> up<00:03:05.640> through<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.330> cools<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
just straight up through so it cools the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.090 
just straight up through so it cools the
motor<00:03:06.870> at<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.080> same<00:03:07.200> time<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.500> gasoline<00:03:07.890> does

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
motor at the same time the gasoline does

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.730 
motor at the same time the gasoline does
and<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.000> just<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.510> series<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.170> staggered

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
and this is just a series of staggered

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.410 
and this is just a series of staggered
grooves<00:03:12.380> that's<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.710> is<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:15.000> know<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.270> a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
grooves that's all it is you know just a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.370 
grooves that's all it is you know just a
series<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.840> staggered<00:03:16.740> grooves<00:03:21.350> there's<00:03:22.350> a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
series of staggered grooves there's a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.229 
series of staggered grooves there's a
little<00:03:22.560> plastic<00:03:22.709> plate<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.430> yeah<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.060> actually

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
little plastic plate and yeah I actually

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.150 
little plastic plate and yeah I actually
broke<00:03:24.510> some<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.780> these<00:03:24.840> off<00:03:25.020> just<00:03:25.200> seen<00:03:25.410> how

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
broke some of these off just seen how

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.290 
broke some of these off just seen how
tough<00:03:26.220> they<00:03:26.489> were<00:03:26.520> it's<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:26.850> plastic

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
tough they were it's just plastic

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.330 
tough they were it's just plastic
nothing<00:03:27.600> major<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.830> will<00:03:28.950> just<00:03:29.040> sit<00:03:29.250> in

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
nothing major so this will just sit in

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.270 
nothing major so this will just sit in
there<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:31.230> motor<00:03:31.440> here<00:03:31.650> has<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.890> notch<00:03:32.100> on

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
there and the motor here has a notch on

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.760 
there and the motor here has a notch on
it<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.060> will<00:03:33.239> just<00:03:33.390> spin<00:03:33.660> press<00:03:34.650> the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
it so this will just spin press the

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.210 
it so this will just spin press the
gasoline<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:36.230> up<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.709> goes<00:03:37.830> into<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.100> engine

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
gasoline and up it goes into the engine

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.830 
gasoline and up it goes into the engine
that's<00:03:38.880> essentially<00:03:39.300> all<00:03:39.330> there<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.750> an

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
that's essentially all there is to an

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.620 
that's essentially all there is to an
electric<00:03:40.170> fuel<00:03:40.350> pump<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.060> why<00:03:42.060> they<00:03:42.239> cost<00:03:42.450> so

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
electric fuel pump so why they cost so

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.470 
electric fuel pump so why they cost so
much<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:43.080> have<00:03:43.980> no<00:03:44.280> idea<00:03:44.700> because<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.239> mean<00:03:45.390> the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
much I have no idea because I mean the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.660 
much I have no idea because I mean the
makings<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.290> virtually<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.190> exact

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
makings of this is virtually the exact
