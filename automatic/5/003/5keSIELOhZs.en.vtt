 zeiss in 1909 ordered it 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.600
 specially for the Irkutsk planetarium 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.360
 for a long time he kept the museum 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.350

 this whole complex is called but a sphere 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 except the planetarium and the observatory here 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.740
 there is a museum which however 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.110
 it is not much at least like

 swear at pool so virtuality 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.310
 becomes real noosphere employees 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.890
 sure now science stars and not only 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.079
 for Siberians will be more interesting and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.000
