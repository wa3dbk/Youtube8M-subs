00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.420
 I am Fernandez Mola Bizarro Liasa 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.709
 fernando 5 x 1 on twitter you know that 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.550
 you can follow us daily in our 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.830
 web www apple 5 x 1 point is good 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.199
 guys I bring you a news that I do not 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.029
 like to talk about issues of failures that 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.109
 we can find in the software that we 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.880
 we download on our devices 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.800
 well you know that you have 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.140
 found a serious failure in 2 706 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.370
 I do not know, I tried to find 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.630
 information but I do not know if this 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.270
 failure has been seen in other versions 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.600
 but at least in the fire guys 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.219
 have confirmed that good 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.359
 there is or 706 has a security breach 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:50.120
 that allows you to skip it 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.010
 let's say in the protection at the time of 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.550
 install an application in the app store 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.929
 good is a thing that translated can 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.699
 come to be that you can be 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.900
 installing an application with malware 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.760
 to be done 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.410
 strained with the security hole that 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.660
 has the operating system sneaks 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.730
 an application out there is user and the 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.370
 installs and from that moment the hackers 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.880
 they can monitor all functions 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.040
 that you execute on your phone in a way 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.660
 they could have access to all 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.370
 commands that you execute on your phone 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.710
 through the touch screen or the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.150
 physical buttons on your device what 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.310
 which can be a risk if you 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.590
 example you use post mail accounts 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 corporative of some work or by 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.160
 example if you are going to make use of 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.570
 applications like paypal or purchases 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.780
 open speaker through your 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.700
 smartphone or your tablet be careful what 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.160
 which it is a serious security problem 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.660
 but that is the only pain of 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.990
 head that has found support in this 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.190
 goodbye update 706 and that is that apart 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.119
 of that security failure that has 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.250
 found also found 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.320
 failures of several users who have already 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.020
 reported that downloading that 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.000
 update by jota I know that a lot does not 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.400
 that is to say, I'm perfectly going to say 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.140
 that there are some cases there are some cases 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.600
 that of users who are downloading 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.930
 application of the update via ote 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.960
 that is, by the wifi settings 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.729
 and once they have installed it they have been 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.600
 paid the phone and they were not able to 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.600
 understand it 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.490
 this in theory is arranged by making a 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.200
 recovery mode that you already know button 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.940
 power button home for a few seconds 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.410
 with the iphone plugged into the computer 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.700
 iPhone is put so 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.220
 recovery is installed the last 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.770
 version from itunes and good bye to 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.450
 problem but oysters for someone who does not 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.460
 be a potter how can we be you and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.110
 I the truth that it has to be a 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.490
 problem and a headache and of 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.770
 take your hands to your head and not 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.790
 it turns on that has happened 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.830
 translated will come out at 10 707 soon 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.210
 maybe yes it can that apple does not take long 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.130
 react and maybe even the 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.730
 next week let's see the update to 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.710
 the 707 is amazing because they do not take out anymore 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.630
 I 7.1 because I'm sure that apple 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.120
 You want to cover all these things before 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.830
 take out the one that will sell as the version 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.230
 final or that is the intention they have to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.140
 for the final version of them 7 and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.270
 focus totally on them already 8 like this 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.490
 that nothing guys you are warned if not 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.410
 you have updated not update and if 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.420
 you have already updated you should have 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.370
 made case but good to the best then os 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.470
 you have been forced to update in your 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.940

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.370
