00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.930
 I greet all viewers of my channel and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.490
 everyone who watches this video 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.759
 Meet the next review on my 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.860
 channel dedicated to the young brazilian 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.160
 chelsea talent vasko.ru 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.180
 but before we start the review I wanted 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.240
 to say have a frequenter of phrases Reviews 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.710
 players and indeed my videos and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.230
 just join my group in contact 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.189
 and visit the wonderful site 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.910
 FIFA dedicated FIFA 1 point ru 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.040
 So we have the characteristics of the Oscar 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.070
 In general, in this issue we will not be very 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.930
 long and wash like that literally 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.710
 every feature this time not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.079
 will take a quick run as a whole and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.860
 move on to the video review which will 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.870
 more extensive overall price Oscar 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.890
 now 14 thousand coins 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.610
 but u bought it two weeks ago he 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.450
 cost 6000 coins in open average 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.760
 the middle I do not know how such war covered 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.490
 will affect the game central so still 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.509
 midfielder so this is another reason 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.580
 go quickly to the video player reviews 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.060
 one of the delicacy of this player is 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 that skill and 4 stars 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 it certainly is not 504 is enough 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.189
 high and I think this player will have 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.460
 attend almost everyone 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.450
 hybrids cheap brazil because 4 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.799
 stars 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.860
 such a price is not very expensive and skill 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.549
 I can say that they are not very 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.630
 impressive and the total is not so 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.479
 too high like other players if 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.590
 here that look how much green we 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.579
 we see that there are very few of them only 7 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.289
 and so everything is average and of course 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.370
 I was disappointed by the strength of 31 strength 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.390
 of course it's not central 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.110
 midfielder 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.700
 where the key factor is well though 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.060
 would be one of the key factors is 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.300
 power but for central attacker 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.340
 midfielder is also equally important but 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.349
 let's see all the same 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.110
 how does he play and is he worth his money 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:38.280
 With 1 match of the game by this player, I realized that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.700
 all that is written skills of this player 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.000
 this is complete nonsense really all 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.709
 much better and much cooler starting 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.620
 speeds which are certainly not 81a more 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.370
 and ending even with the same power that 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.239
 31 of course not much more she 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.959
 anyway more well and now let's 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.659
 let's start the brain plus about the principle 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.810
 cons I'm with him as such and 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.599
 did not notice but let's start with the pros 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.110
 It is still a great shock when neighbors do not 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.790
 complete altogether with a punch this guy 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.330
 no problem he 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:27.760
 cool here and realizes all the moments 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:30.880
 and left and right and what you want not 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.890
 really liked it because with the purchase 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.920
 this player and with us tem releasing 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.130
 about the player as a basis he started to score 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.160
 much more forwards and score what 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.600
 swords flew as I said 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.470
 almost all and all strokes were 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:57.450
 magnificent on the left and on the right but it 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:01.720
 far from complete list of it 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:06.250
 merits would also like to say 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.930
 that I liked how he plays on 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.280
 central position still further 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.250
 midfielder pair work rates average 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.080
 average 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.570
 he does not lose his good choice 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:27.360
 positions what else can you say he is cool yes 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:30.820
 and all the second thing to go to and 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.680
 note in this the players is his dribbling 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.830
 and agility 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.990
 acceleration speed call whatever you want 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:44.530
 he knows how to handle the ball not only 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.870
 blows but also stroke it can circle in 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.690
 the right moment I circle not 1 and not 2 but 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.919
 packs around the players one by one 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.490
 to others and leaving them fools of course 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.770
 same 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.770
 a certain trump card in your sleeve 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.990
 transfer programs can only be noted 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.550
 at his best because he can 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:17.800
 give good gear that high quality 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:21.610
 and withdraw partners one on one in 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.050
 In general, everything is possible in principle. 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:29.560
 say about the gears his next plus 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:35.430
 this corner feed he amazingly serves 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:39.630
 angular i like it very much however 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.630
 like all his qualities 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.669
 even though I did nâ€™t give a little corner to them 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:50.590
 but most of them came to 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.830
 partners in some cases even 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.039
 managed to strike a dangerous blow and score 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.039
 stake 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:04.300
 cons as such I did not find and 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.729
 endurance fine speed fine 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.569
 kick order in my opinion it's perfect 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:14.770
 central attacking midfielder for 12 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:16.930
 or how much is there 14,000 to me he is very 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.219
 liked insanely simple 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:25.650
 and I will continue to play but also as I 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:29.319
 already said the price is fully consistent 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.509
 real price and I would even have a little 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:35.139
 overpaid for such a player because 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:38.379
 this player is tantamount to the mother and from the past 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.240
 FIFA version of the devil take it from me already 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.689
 ends text do not know what 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.750
 speak but this damn stuff that 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:48.729
 took away very long and very much and 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.210
 so I need to speak more literally 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:55.330
 minute something so let's you 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.719
 I will talk about the players on which I plan 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:01.870
 review the whole it will be players from 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:07.029
 apple may be from lpl 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:09.189
 and there may still be a series of others 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:13.220
 leagues is not planned yet because 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:16.100
 I don't have any squads from other leagues and 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:20.180
 and it will be very expensive to collect because 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:22.130
 what's not so rich in fifa so that every 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.800
 day to change the composition under the players 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.600
 who want to do a review so I 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.050
 I will do reviews on those players 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:35.210
 which I have it in the most 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:39.730
 degree apple will be review on our anelka 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:47.450
 tour for namaz from the forest number to 

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:50.750
 jarvis yar hung on scoring on strength and not 

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:54.620
 even on the collar honestly do it because 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:56.830
 what he drags but really the principle is 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.750
 first list but if they don't give me 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:04.460
 some kind of super player very 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:06.950
 expensive in the eyes can then plans 

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.620
 change a little bit but did not think that 

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:13.040
 it will happen and we will do everything 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:17.620
 standard in general, this is all thanks 

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.620
 for watching for watching everyone bye
