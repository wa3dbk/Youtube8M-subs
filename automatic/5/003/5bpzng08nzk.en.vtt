00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
where you know you can drop from and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.700 
where you know you can drop from and

edge and just go for it

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.790 
edge and just go for it
and<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.579> tender<00:00:51.180> too<00:00:51.329> flat<00:00:51.660> when<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.680> to
