00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
with me which is a nice feature in the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
with me which is a nice feature in the
guitar<00:01:11.070> face<00:01:11.280> 2<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.869> front<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.409> can

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
guitar face 2 on the front here you can

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.710 
guitar face 2 on the front here you can
see<00:01:13.770> we've<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:13.920> two<00:01:14.640> quarter<00:01:14.970> inch<00:01:15.000> inputs

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
see we've got two quarter inch inputs

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
see we've got two quarter inch inputs
and<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.590> name<00:01:16.860> guitar<00:01:17.369> face<00:01:17.549> 2<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> little

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and the name guitar face 2 is a little

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.660 
and the name guitar face 2 is a little
bit<00:01:18.299> misleading<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
bit misleading because you do have the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210 
bit misleading because you do have the
DI<00:01:20.880> inputs<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.590> plug<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> guitar

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
DI inputs so you can plug in a guitar

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.090 
DI inputs so you can plug in a guitar
bass<00:01:23.939> directly<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.680> actually

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
bass directly to it but you can actually

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.520 
bass directly to it but you can actually
switch<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.549> inputs<00:01:26.939> independently<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.229> line

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
switch the inputs independently to line

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.460 
switch the inputs independently to line
level<00:01:28.740> inputs<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.430> could<00:01:29.579> record<00:01:29.939> from

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
level inputs so you could record from

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
level inputs so you could record from
keyboard<00:01:31.470> cassette<00:01:32.250> deck<00:01:32.460> anything<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.030> has

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
keyboard cassette deck anything that has

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.960 
keyboard cassette deck anything that has
line<00:01:33.509> level<00:01:33.689> inputs<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:35.340> also<00:01:35.640> will

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
line level inputs and it also will

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.999 
line level inputs and it also will
provide<00:01:36.240> phantom<00:01:36.720> power<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.560> connect

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
provide phantom power so you can connect

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.160 
provide phantom power so you can connect
dynamic<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:38.729> condenser<00:01:39.119> mics<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> quarter

here I've got a camera connection kit
this<00:02:51.430> isn't<00:02:51.730> actually<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:52.269> Apple<00:02:52.840> one<00:02:52.989> this

is a five in one connection kit but both

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.030 
is a five in one connection kit but both
will<00:02:58.269> work<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.690> Apple<00:02:59.049> one<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.470> most<00:02:59.890> of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
will work the Apple one and most of

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.160 
will work the Apple one and most of
these<00:03:00.129> third-party<00:03:00.400> ones<00:03:00.790> as<00:03:01.000> well<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.450> I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
these third-party ones as well and I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.110 
these third-party ones as well and I
just<00:03:02.349> need<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.560> plug<00:03:02.769> my<00:03:02.950> guitar<00:03:03.579> face<00:03:03.760> into<00:03:04.090> a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
just need to plug my guitar face into a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.180 
just need to plug my guitar face into a
audio<00:03:04.480> source<00:03:04.930> here<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.319> then<00:03:05.799> when<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:05.950> play

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
audio source here and then when I play

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.580 
audio source here and then when I play
back<00:03:06.400> from<00:03:06.780> GarageBand<00:03:07.780> on<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.019> iPad<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:10.590> can

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
back from GarageBand on the iPad I can

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.690 
back from GarageBand on the iPad I can
set<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.340> up<00:03:12.549> so<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.090> records<00:03:14.340> directly<00:03:15.340> or

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
set it up so that it records directly or

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.970 
set it up so that it records directly or
plays<00:03:16.120> back<00:03:16.359> directly<00:03:16.629> through<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.410> guitar

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
plays back directly through the guitar

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.460 
plays back directly through the guitar
face

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.620 

so<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> first<00:03:22.770> time<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:24.150> could<00:03:24.300> hear<00:03:24.540> was

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
so the first time you could hear was

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.240 
so the first time you could hear was
coming<00:03:24.900> through<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.080> iPad<00:03:25.470> speakers<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.160> now

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
coming through the iPad speakers and now

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.949 
coming through the iPad speakers and now
it's<00:03:26.400> coming<00:03:26.670> through<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.940> PA<00:03:27.420> system<00:03:27.540> I've

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
it's coming through the PA system I've

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.630 
it's coming through the PA system I've
hooked<00:03:28.110> up<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.620> guitar<00:03:29.069> face<00:03:31.580> so<00:03:32.580> if

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
hooked up to the guitar face so if

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.780 
hooked up to the guitar face so if
you're<00:03:32.730> looking<00:03:33.000> for<00:03:33.180> an<00:03:33.690> easy<00:03:33.870> way<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.170> get<00:03:34.790> a
