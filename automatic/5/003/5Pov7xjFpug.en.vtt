push for auto but with these vehicles I
also<00:00:22.009> come<00:00:22.369> with<00:00:22.400> a<00:00:22.580> dual<00:00:22.880> climate<00:00:23.119> control

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
also come with a dual climate control

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.200 
also come with a dual climate control
where<00:00:24.710> you<00:00:24.740> can<00:00:24.980> push<00:00:25.160> this<00:00:25.369> side<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.910> it

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
where you can push this side and it

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.210 
where you can push this side and it
separates<00:00:26.840> it<00:00:27.020> so<00:00:27.320> if<00:00:27.529> you<00:00:27.650> want<00:00:27.829> this<00:00:28.009> side

you're going to push for auto and see it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.049 
you're going to push for auto and see it
changed<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.129> whole<00:00:55.280> screen<00:00:55.640> up<00:00:55.790> here<00:00:55.940> right

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
changed the whole screen up here right

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.609 
changed the whole screen up here right
away<00:00:57.339> so<00:00:58.339> on<00:00:58.519> auto<00:00:58.850> mode<00:00:59.170> you<00:01:00.170> see<00:01:00.440> the

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
away so on auto mode you see the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.710 
away so on auto mode you see the
temperature<00:01:01.339> digital<00:01:01.970> temperature<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:02.570> it

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
temperature digital temperature that it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.899 
temperature digital temperature that it
gives<00:01:02.900> that's<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.920> actual<00:01:04.189> temperature<00:01:04.699> that

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
gives that's the actual temperature that

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.780 
gives that's the actual temperature that
you're<00:01:05.089> choosing<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:07.100> more<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.310> turn<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.729> knob

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
you're choosing the more I turn the knob

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.649 
you're choosing the more I turn the knob

you see it going up and up so that was

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.660 
you see it going up and up so that was
going<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:11.990> make<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.320> hotter<00:01:12.710> in<00:01:12.950> here<00:01:13.159> because

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
going to make it hotter in here because

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.580 
going to make it hotter in here because
that's<00:01:13.939> letting<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.750> know<00:01:14.900> on<00:01:15.049> auto<00:01:15.290> mode

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
that's letting to know on auto mode

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.050 
that's letting to know on auto mode
that's<00:01:15.860> kind<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.250> temperature<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:16.729> want<00:01:16.909> to

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
that's kind of the temperature I want to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.929 
that's kind of the temperature I want to
be<00:01:17.210> at<00:01:17.390> inside<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.140> car<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.369> that's<00:01:19.579> all<00:01:19.759> that

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
so in here same thing now I'll turn it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.560 
so in here same thing now I'll turn it
down<00:01:26.539> from<00:01:26.780> heat<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.409> I<00:01:28.009> go<00:01:28.249> the<00:01:29.210> opposite

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
down from heat and I go the opposite

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.760 
down from heat and I go the opposite
direction<00:01:29.630> down<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:30.979> lower<00:01:31.280> temperature<00:01:32.770> 63

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
direction down to a lower temperature 63

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.020 
direction down to a lower temperature 63
and<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:34.159> see<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.399> goes<00:01:34.520> all<00:01:34.670> way<00:01:34.700> down<00:01:34.850> to

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
and then see it goes all way down to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.480 
and then see it goes all way down to
just<00:01:35.060> low<00:01:35.390> low<00:01:35.810> that's<00:01:36.770> going<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.039> turn<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.340> AC

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
just low low that's going to turn the AC

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.109 
just low low that's going to turn the AC
water<00:01:37.969> and<00:01:38.840> get<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.020> cool

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
water and get it cool

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.000 
water and get it cool
now<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.659> really<00:01:41.960> cool<00:01:42.110> thing<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.560> let's<00:01:42.830> say

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
now the really cool thing is let's say

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.800 
now the really cool thing is let's say
you<00:01:43.070> put<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.430> on<00:01:43.549> about<00:01:43.820> 70<00:01:44.420> somewhere

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
you put it on about 70 somewhere

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.930 
you put it on about 70 somewhere
comfortable<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:46.100> that's<00:01:46.280> showing<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:46.820> each

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
comfortable and that's showing for each

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.740 
comfortable and that's showing for each
side<00:01:47.180> right<00:01:47.360> now

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
side right now

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.840 
side right now
you<00:01:48.229> also<00:01:48.380> notice<00:01:48.860> as<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:49.130> change<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:49.549> back<00:01:49.640> and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
you also notice as I change it back and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.300 
you also notice as I change it back and

and<00:02:03.110> while<00:02:03.890> I'm<00:02:04.040> changing<00:02:04.280> your<00:02:04.580> temperature

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
and while I'm changing your temperature

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.700 
and while I'm changing your temperature
so<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.299> can<00:02:05.420> change<00:02:05.690> your<00:02:05.840> mode<00:02:05.990> also<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:06.649> you

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
can hit the mode button now it's on feet

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.470 
can hit the mode button now it's on feet
only<00:02:09.530> because<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.280> changed<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.120> light<00:02:11.300> to

passenger wants to be warmer so in dual
climate<00:03:06.230> control<00:03:06.739> now<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.010> can<00:03:07.400> turn<00:03:07.579> it<00:03:07.700> up<00:03:07.850> you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
climate control now I can turn it up you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.920 
climate control now I can turn it up you
know<00:03:09.079> see<00:03:09.410> there's<00:03:09.650> 85<00:03:10.130> 86<00:03:10.609> all<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.660> way<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:11.780> to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
know see there's 85 86 all the way up to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.590 
know see there's 85 86 all the way up to
high<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.670> heats<00:03:13.940> going<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.299> be<00:03:14.450> on
