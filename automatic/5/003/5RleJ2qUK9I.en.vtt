00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
 it's difficult because 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.380
 I wish I could give people joy 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.070
 my people suffering so much suffers 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.270
 of things 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.270
 Unfortunately we could not 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.030
 Sorry everyone robs all 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.140
 Brazilians 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.140
 I just really wanted the people to smile. 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.829
 everyone knows how much was the most 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.829
 important to me is 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.240
 The whole brazil happy for what I am 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.240
 doing soccer 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.500
 they were better 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.350
 prepared better made the best game 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.350
 as the two tomes in the 46 minutes 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.330
 It's a day to 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 a lot of sadness but a lot of learning 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 also in life 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.130
 those ten minutes he that germany 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 made 15 goals and you talked in the field 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.970
 unable to find any 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.200
 explanation why Brazil has become 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.710
 destabilized so much we miss a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710
 little there 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.250
 It's suddenly they saw that we were 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.200
 so they managed to score goals 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.710
 explained now will suffice the task is very 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.710
 difficult 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.479
 a dream to end 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.260
 not the way we wanted 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.560
 In my life I learned to be a man. 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:02:01.119
 all the moments of the flight originated 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.440
 takes over and I will never give up 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.770
 one day I will get this people Paulo 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.770
 some way
