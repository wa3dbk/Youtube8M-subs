00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
training class that I'm here for for all

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.250 
training class that I'm here for for all
those<00:01:01.350> guys<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.980> called<00:01:02.220> juice<00:01:02.490> boost<00:01:03.260> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
those guys it's called juice boost it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.140 
those guys it's called juice boost it's
basically<00:01:04.799> an<00:01:05.009> additive<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.000> add

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
basically an additive that you can add

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.399 
basically an additive that you can add
to<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> infinite<00:01:06.689> years<00:01:06.810> detailed<00:01:07.170> juice

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
to the infinite years detailed juice

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.749 
to the infinite years detailed juice
that<00:01:07.860> we'll<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:09.590> boost<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.040> polymer

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
that we'll just boost the polymer

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.719 
that we'll just boost the polymer
content<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.900> dramatic<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.100> leave

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
content in a dramatic way to leave

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.160 
content in a dramatic way to leave
behind<00:01:15.060> some<00:01:15.270> protection<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:15.869> you're<00:01:15.900> using

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
behind some protection when you're using

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.529 
behind some protection when you're using
the<00:01:16.380> Gary<00:01:16.710> Dean<00:01:16.890> wash<00:01:17.100> method<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:18.090> also<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
the Gary Dean wash method but also you

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.260 
the Gary Dean wash method but also you
can<00:01:18.960> use<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.469> a<00:01:19.499> waterless<00:01:20.249> wash<00:01:20.579> booster

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
can use it as a waterless wash booster

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.669 
can use it as a waterless wash booster
to<00:01:21.619> add<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.850> polymer<00:01:24.570> protection<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
to add to the polymer protection in that

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.200 
to add to the polymer protection in that
so<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.880> cool<00:01:27.119> thing<00:01:27.149> about<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.659> though<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.990> we

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
so the cool thing about it though is we

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.149 
so the cool thing about it though is we
basically<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.869> was<00:01:31.049> designed<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.920> intended

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
basically it was designed and intended

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
basically it was designed and intended
to<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> booster<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> infant<00:01:33.840> use

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to be a booster for the infant use

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.709 
to be a booster for the infant use
detailed<00:01:34.380> juice<00:01:34.640> but<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:36.299> were<00:01:36.420> able<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
detailed juice but we were able to

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.580 
detailed juice but we were able to
refine<00:01:37.289> it<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.060> tweak<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.289> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
refine it and tweak it out so that it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.709 
refine it and tweak it out so that it
can<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.159> used<00:01:41.520> directly<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.539> the

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
can actually be used directly on the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.700 
can actually be used directly on the
paint<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.369> place<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.960> beyond<00:01:46.289> offending

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
paint in place of the beyond offending

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.190 
paint in place of the beyond offending
sealant<00:01:47.039> so<00:01:47.219> I<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:47.939> will<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.600> replacing

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
sealant so I actually will be replacing

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.379 
sealant so I actually will be replacing
the<00:01:49.499> beyond<00:01:49.770> infinity<00:01:49.950> sealant<00:01:50.639> with<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
the beyond infinity sealant with the

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:55.459 
the beyond infinity sealant with the
juice<00:01:51.630> boost<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:53.310> also<00:01:53.659> will<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.689> able<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.289> be

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
juice boost it also will be able to be

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.219 
juice boost it also will be able to be
sprayed<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.609> wet<00:01:57.149> car<00:01:57.479> after<00:01:57.959> you<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
sprayed on a wet car after you do a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.959 
sprayed on a wet car after you do a
traditional<00:01:58.560> wash<00:01:59.039> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.399> choose<00:01:59.639> to<00:01:59.850> do

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
traditional wash if you choose to do

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.219 
traditional wash if you choose to do
that<00:02:00.179> instead<00:02:00.539> of<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> Gary<00:02:00.899> D<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.109> wash

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that instead of the Gary D and wash

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.260 
that instead of the Gary D and wash
method<00:02:02.389> on<00:02:03.389> a<00:02:03.450> dirtier<00:02:03.840> car<00:02:04.170> whatever<00:02:05.270> what

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
have you if you wanted to wash your car

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.730 
have you if you wanted to wash your car
while<00:02:09.240> it's<00:02:09.479> wet<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.899> could<00:02:10.050> spray<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.560> down

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
while it's wet you could spray it down

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.420 
while it's wet you could spray it down
with<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.370> juice<00:02:11.970> boost<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:13.160> do<00:02:14.160> what

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
with the juice boost and then do what

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.980 
with the juice boost and then do what
they<00:02:14.580> do<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> other<00:02:15.300> products<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.900> are

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
solid quality polymer protection

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.450 
solid quality polymer protection
basically<00:04:53.199> speeding<00:04:53.530> up<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.770> process<00:04:53.800> so

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
basically speeding up the process so

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.719 
basically speeding up the process so
instead<00:04:54.789> of<00:04:54.849> having<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:55.330> go<00:04:55.479> back<00:04:55.650> after<00:04:56.729> you

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
instead of having to go back after you

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.310 
instead of having to go back after you
wash<00:04:58.000> your<00:04:58.240> car<00:04:58.449> with<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.780> Gary<00:04:58.990> Dean<00:04:59.139> wash

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
wash your car with the Gary Dean wash

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.290 
wash your car with the Gary Dean wash
method<00:04:59.770> instead<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.370> having<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.580> go<00:05:00.729> back<00:05:00.759> and

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
method instead of having to go back and

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.779 
method instead of having to go back and
apply<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:02.320> beyond<00:05:02.740> infinity<00:05:02.919> sealant<00:05:03.520> you

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
apply the beyond infinity sealant you

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.760 
apply the beyond infinity sealant you
will<00:05:03.940> be<00:05:04.090> able<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.419> add<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.990> juice<00:05:05.169> boost<00:05:05.530> to

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
will be able to add the juice boost to

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.850 
will be able to add the juice boost to
your<00:05:05.800> wash<00:05:06.190> bucket<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.990> be<00:05:07.990> sealing<00:05:08.500> at<00:05:08.740> the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
your wash bucket and be sealing at the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.350 
your wash bucket and be sealing at the
same<00:05:09.070> time<00:05:09.280> you're<00:05:09.460> washing<00:05:09.699> so<00:05:10.240> that's

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
same time you're washing so that's

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.600 
same time you're washing so that's
pretty<00:05:10.570> cool<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:11.410> can<00:05:11.530> also<00:05:11.710> use<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:12.160> after

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
pretty cool you can also use it after

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.520 
pretty cool you can also use it after
you've<00:05:13.419> done<00:05:13.570> your<00:05:13.630> traditional<00:05:14.139> wash<00:05:14.320> or

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
you've done your traditional wash or

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.080 
you've done your traditional wash or
even<00:05:14.710> after<00:05:15.099> the<00:05:15.190> Gary<00:05:15.370> D<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:15.580> wash<00:05:15.669> method

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
even after the Gary D and wash method

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.839 
even after the Gary D and wash method
because<00:05:16.720> basically<00:05:17.650> if<00:05:18.099> you<00:05:18.220> use<00:05:18.370> it<00:05:18.580> like<00:05:18.699> to

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
because basically if you use it like to

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.189 
because basically if you use it like to
be<00:05:18.940> on<00:05:19.030> Infinity<00:05:19.449> sealant<00:05:19.780> so<00:05:19.840> after<00:05:20.080> you've

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
be on Infinity sealant so after you've

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.140 
be on Infinity sealant so after you've
washed<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.800> then<00:05:21.220> dried<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.639> car<00:05:21.820> with<00:05:22.060> the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
washed and then dried the car with the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.029 
washed and then dried the car with the
Gary<00:05:22.360> Dean<00:05:22.539> wash<00:05:22.720> method<00:05:23.169> you<00:05:23.530> can<00:05:23.650> go<00:05:23.800> back

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
Gary Dean wash method you can go back

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.909 
Gary Dean wash method you can go back
over<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.789> entire<00:05:25.210> vehicle<00:05:25.840> with<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.590> juice

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
over the entire vehicle with the juice

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.570 
over the entire vehicle with the juice
boost<00:05:27.220> by<00:05:27.550> itself<00:05:28.030> and<00:05:28.449> you<00:05:28.960> will<00:05:29.080> get<00:05:29.229> more

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
boost by itself and you will get more

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.830 
boost by itself and you will get more
polymer<00:05:30.580> in<00:05:30.789> contact<00:05:31.449> with<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.659> surface

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
polymer in contact with the surface

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.870 
polymer in contact with the surface
which<00:05:32.139> will<00:05:32.260> give<00:05:32.380> you<00:05:32.530> longer<00:05:33.190> lasting<00:05:33.729> more

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
which will give you longer lasting more

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.270 
which will give you longer lasting more
durable<00:05:34.360> protection<00:05:34.990> that<00:05:35.590> will<00:05:35.740> also<00:05:36.099> be

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
durable protection that will also be

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.909 
durable protection that will also be
super<00:05:36.639> slick<00:05:36.909> but<00:05:37.570> you<00:05:38.229> can<00:05:38.380> get<00:05:38.560> good<00:05:38.710> quality

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
super slick but you can get good quality

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.620 
super slick but you can get good quality
protection<00:05:39.340> by<00:05:39.729> adding<00:05:40.120> it<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.449> wash

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
protection by adding it to the wash

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.290 
protection by adding it to the wash
which<00:05:40.960> is<00:05:41.110> why<00:05:41.830> I<00:05:41.860> designed<00:05:42.639> the<00:05:42.759> product<00:05:43.180> in

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
which is why I designed the product in

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.210 
which is why I designed the product in
the<00:05:43.389> first<00:05:43.630> place<00:05:43.810> was<00:05:44.169> to<00:05:44.199> save<00:05:44.500> you<00:05:44.650> time<00:05:44.919> in

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
the first place was to save you time in

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.399 
the first place was to save you time in
the<00:05:45.310> wash<00:05:46.000> process<00:05:46.419> which<00:05:46.900> is<00:05:47.020> what<00:05:47.199> I'm

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
the wash process which is what I'm

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.909 
the wash process which is what I'm
consumed<00:05:48.220> with<00:05:48.220> so<00:05:49.259> it's<00:05:50.259> going<00:05:50.409> pretty<00:05:50.650> good

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
consumed with so it's going pretty good

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.870 
consumed with so it's going pretty good
this<00:05:51.370> whole<00:05:51.669> side<00:05:52.030> of<00:05:52.060> this<00:05:52.270> car<00:05:52.590> was

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
this whole side of this car was

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.629 
this whole side of this car was
basically<00:05:54.880> dried<00:05:55.840> by<00:05:56.229> sheeting<00:05:56.830> with

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
basically dried by sheeting with

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.850 
basically dried by sheeting with
exception<00:05:57.940> of<00:05:58.180> a<00:05:58.270> drop<00:05:59.050> here<00:05:59.289> and<00:05:59.470> there<00:05:59.650> I

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
exception of a drop here and there I

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.969 
exception of a drop here and there I
know<00:06:00.729> Daniel<00:06:01.419> loves<00:06:01.659> this<00:06:01.840> stuff<00:06:02.080> he's

know Daniel loves this stuff he's

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.430 
know Daniel loves this stuff he's
already<00:06:03.220> been<00:06:03.750> testing<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:04.900> testing<00:06:05.080> and

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
already been testing and testing and

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.499

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.800 
testing and he's super happy with it so
I'm<00:06:07.840> actually<00:06:08.580> thrilled<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.820> death<00:06:10.000> that<00:06:10.599> I'm

I'm actually thrilled to death that I'm
not<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.169> only<00:06:11.380> one<00:06:11.800> so<00:06:12.520> that's<00:06:12.639> pretty

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
not the only one so that's pretty

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:19.980
