00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
maybe I could actually find it because I

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.880 
maybe I could actually find it because I
like<00:02:45.060> lost<00:02:45.300> in<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> few<00:02:45.720> minutes<00:02:45.870> ago<00:02:46.080> because<00:02:46.770> I

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
like lost in a few minutes ago because I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.380 
like lost in a few minutes ago because I
actually<00:02:46.980> tried<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.520> record<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.150> few

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
actually tried to record this a few

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.900 
actually tried to record this a few
times<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.590> came<00:02:49.890> out<00:02:50.100> too<00:02:50.250> laggy<00:02:50.459> every

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
times and it came out too laggy every

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.870 
times and it came out too laggy every
time<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.480> yeah<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:53.070> finally<00:02:53.459> made<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.730> like

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
time so yeah and I finally made it like

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.660 
time so yeah and I finally made it like
the<00:02:54.209> least<00:02:54.720> laggy<00:02:55.320> 'used<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.220> like<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.519> is

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
the least laggy 'used and like this is

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.610 
the least laggy 'used and like this is
again<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.750> running<00:02:57.989> like<00:02:58.080> flawlessly

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
again this is running like flawlessly

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.680 
again this is running like flawlessly
right<00:02:58.830> now<00:02:58.920> my<00:02:59.130> netbook<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.850> have<00:03:00.239> no<00:03:00.480> lag

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
right now my netbook like I have no lag

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.360 
right now my netbook like I have no lag
at<00:03:00.720> all<00:03:00.989> it's<00:03:01.140> probably<00:03:01.380> gonna<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.590> laggy<00:03:01.890> like

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
at all it's probably gonna be laggy like

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.330 
at all it's probably gonna be laggy like
cuz<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:03.050> recorders<00:03:04.050> always<00:03:04.470> bring<00:03:05.160> up<00:03:05.250> a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
cuz like recorders always bring up a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.509 
cuz like recorders always bring up a
little<00:03:05.550> bit<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.760> lag<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:07.110> aside<00:03:07.920> from<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.130> um

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
little bit of lag but aside from that um

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.780 
little bit of lag but aside from that um
