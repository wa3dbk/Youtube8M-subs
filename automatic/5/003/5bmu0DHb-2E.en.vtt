00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.120
 today we need fleece patterns 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.550
 which can be found in the video description 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.860
 fill for the ears and the threads to start 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.940
 pinned noah rush two-layer UV 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.300
 forest step step x fold and cut 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.469
 so high here is the figure we get 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.469
 then we also cut a circle 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.840
 and then the ears should work 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.950
 four ears that is for each type two 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.710
 sides and eventually sew the main part 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.750
 to get a circle for the head and on top 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.620
 neatly circling and pinning all over 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.620
 we sew groups 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.730
 after that we turn out our hat 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.850
 now itâ€™s more or less like 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.820
 cap and now go to the eyelet sew 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.440
 ears so what happened 2 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 we turn out and we fill them with a filler 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.720
 then make a place for a mustache better in 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.800
 having measured it, then we cut out the cap 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.800
 holes on the cap 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.820
 and inside we sew and head 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.490
 to make the cap more accurate 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.530
 make two layers for this you need to do 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.319
 one more same cap only without ears 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.470
 and sew them by joining them 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.470
 inside 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.579
 but leave a small piece not sewn 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.409
 what was convenient to turn out and then 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.859
 turning out our cap we sew this 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.859
 slice 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.090
 Here is such a cool hat for us 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.090
 happened
