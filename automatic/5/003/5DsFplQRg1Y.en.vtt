00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.979 
it's so next we've we've installed a
normally<00:03:00.640> -<00:03:00.910> which<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.330> actually<00:03:01.660> one<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
normally - which is actually one of the

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.800 
normally - which is actually one of the
one<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.560> biggest<00:03:03.090> games<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.269> can<00:03:04.450> download

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.390 

it's<00:03:07.810> also<00:03:08.440> one<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.890> most<00:03:08.950> graphics

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
it's also one of the most graphics

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.770 
it's also one of the most graphics
intensive<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.930> as<00:03:11.110> we're<00:03:11.290> playing<00:03:11.560> this<00:03:12.780> you

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
intensive so as we're playing this you

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.509 
intensive so as we're playing this you
can<00:03:13.930> see<00:03:14.049> it's<00:03:14.170> actually<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.590> GPU<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.190> Adreno

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
can see it's actually the GPU the Adreno

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.000 
can see it's actually the GPU the Adreno
305<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.329> doing<00:03:16.630> very<00:03:16.930> well<00:03:17.049> it's<00:03:17.380> handling<00:03:17.769> all

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
305 is doing very well it's handling all

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.920 
305 is doing very well it's handling all
of<00:03:18.040> these<00:03:18.660> explosions<00:03:19.890> under<00:03:20.890> like<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
of these explosions under like is the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.500 
of these explosions under like is the
laser<00:03:23.380> lights<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.069> Adana<00:03:24.430> Meishan<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.209> of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
laser lights the Adana Meishan of the of

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.119 
laser lights the Adana Meishan of the of
the<00:03:25.660> characters<00:03:26.079> here<00:03:26.260> very<00:03:26.500> fluently<00:03:26.890> very

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
the characters here very fluently very

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.970 
the characters here very fluently very
well<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:29.079> you<00:03:29.170> can<00:03:29.260> see<00:03:29.410> these<00:03:29.620> explosions

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
well so you can see these explosions

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.720 
well so you can see these explosions
that<00:03:30.310> there's<00:03:30.519> absolutely<00:03:30.730> no<00:03:31.420> lag<00:03:32.730> it's

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
that there's absolutely no lag it's

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:43.040 
that there's absolutely no lag it's
doing<00:03:34.180> an<00:03:34.269> exception<00:03:34.989> one<00:03:35.140> looks<00:03:36.069> very<00:03:36.129> clear

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050
