00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:14.080
 simple for high -heeled shoes that 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.080
 we have a little bit big ok 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.359
 at the beginning of this hot season, 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.910
 more or less it was here it starts as a 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.000
 end of February because already for the 21st 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.230
 March here is a good heat 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.260
 then I bought these beautiful 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.870
 shoes that I liked very much 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.230
 look what beauty are not very high are 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.570
 heels 910 do not seem too high 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.400
 then they have this platform that the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.100
 They make me very comfortable and what I love is 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.680
 that almost the platform is not noticed 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.610
 because it 's like this with this strip 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.670
 red and see if it 's color between wants 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.570
 half and do not come two two-tone 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.030
 This beautiful fabric has its beautiful 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.520
 so that the little fingers come out the numbers 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.030
 so what happened that I bought these 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.670
 shoes I loved are very beautiful 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.550
 at the time of trying - in the shoe store 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.460
 they were really good for me 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.970
 they were super good but with the use this 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.830
 they were loosening me and good if you tend 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.100
 to spend that with the shoes that are 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.290
 cloth - covered fabric because it is what the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.440
 inside is carnaza 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.170
 that is skin but less less rigid 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.600
 that the skin that is used for when 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.909
 the shoe is leather on the outside 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 I love that it is a good material 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.500
 look on this side how it looks 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.619
 precious good then how are you 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.100
 they started to be loose I bought these 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.840
 templates these templates look at 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.840
 it's called to be 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.630
 p 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:07.320
 and they are a base for the sole of the foot 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:11.880
 that give support to also how 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.210
 it stays this way then they do not go 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.209
 forward his two feet are of 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.209
 silicone and has to say to say with pure 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.750
 plastic that yes that is pure plastic by 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.680
 that 's a very soft plastic or like 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.680
 can see clean 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:37.480
 they bring a movie they release it and then 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.180
 adhere to the wing to the shoe 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.280
 she is very soft really, she is very 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.430
 rich to walk is the seat like 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.730
 if I walked on some cushions and 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.430
 cough 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.290
 It is very tasty to walk and how to 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.239
 it sticks like it 's sticky it does not move 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.239
 super super comfortable 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.760
 well then I want to make you grab your 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:12.000
 template and accommodate where they are from 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.000
 the fingers that this is the most 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.930
 the least rigid is going forward and this 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.000
 is what supports the sole of the foot 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.450
 then grab your shoe and put it on 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.450
 A) Yes 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.870
 so 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.690
 and ready 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.020
 so you put it 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.980
 the orders were pasted 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.390
 good and that's how it is 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.690
 here is the template 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.130
 here is the template 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.310
 and here is the template then the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.420
 you can use very comfortably and what I 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.910
 love of this is that you can wait 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.610
 to clean also for that from that 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.040
 you can talk for example if you do not go to a 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.320
 lounge that you go to the street to a square 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.050
 Well, you can not put something in 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.140
 of dust because it is open from the part 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:17.549
 from here then you can take it off 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.290
 and clean with alcohol and that's all for 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.150
 the shoes that loosen or that you 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.520
 there are a larger number is very good 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.020
 very good solution already if the shoe you 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.300
 it is two centimeters bigger 2 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.620
 the biggest numbers here in mexico 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.260
 is by centimeters 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.560
 Well, I'll give you another solution that 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:45.300
 It is also very good but it will be another 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.220
