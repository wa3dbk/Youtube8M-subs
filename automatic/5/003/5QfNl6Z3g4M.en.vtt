00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
what happened in the movie and I'm just

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.080 
what happened in the movie and I'm just
like<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.030> hell<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:37.140> happened<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.729> I

like what the hell just happened so I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
like what the hell just happened so I
think<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> good<00:01:40.560> move

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
think this is not really a good move

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
think this is not really a good move
they<00:01:41.189> should<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.610> released<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.119> like

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
they should have just released it like

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.289 
they should have just released it like
the<00:01:43.770> week<00:01:43.979> after<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.520> film<00:01:44.700> came<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the week after the film came out that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
the week after the film came out that
