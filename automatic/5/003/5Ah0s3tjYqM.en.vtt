00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.550
 sales to his harkis live in deposit they are cultivated like that for 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.010
 limit their growth but we did not say it was a tree that came from 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.879
 France or Italy 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.709
 if you grow in deposit 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.779
 parents and to mingle chains of jobs 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.519
 and any type of trees you can find in parks and gardens 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.829
 right here 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.919
 then it is obviously temperate climate trees 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.880
 these trees will have to undergo even in pots 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.390
 a temperate climate 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.369
 they will have to have a cold winter 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.870
 a hot summer 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.230
 a fall and a rainy spring 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.810
 and the only way for him to be satisfied will be to let them 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.980
 outside 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.780
 the night the day 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.170
 and all year long 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.480
 objectively 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.820
 they are outdoor bonzaïs 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.630
 what is it that the mossad inside 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.470
 we wanted to have bonzaïs in the house in the room an office in 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.960
 the living room 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.360
 but in the house 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.550
 even at night 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.770
 in winter it is at least 18 degrees 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
 and then a relative an apple tree can not stand things appear 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.770
 'go to kill 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 So we went looking for exotic weapons of tropical trees 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.970
 which soil 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.760
 can admit 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.170
 to have such a temperature at night the winter there was a slip of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.030
 language that came about decided to call these trees to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.480
 indoor and often it's interpreted as the fact that so what 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.730
 are harkis to live inside twelve months out of twelve this 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.480
 is wrong a ficus 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.970
 my java wrist 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.580
 like this one 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.410
 they are tropical trees 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.270
 who come from parts of the world or in blue even during the bad season the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.950
 average temperature does not drop below 16 degrees obviously this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.680
 are people who are absolutely unable to undergo the cold of asia 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.540
 to and especially young people and who will kill them 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.590
 we must protect them during the bad season 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.400
 by making them live in a greenhouse or not 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.330
 in the House 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.870
 during the beautiful season 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.240
 the threat of even freezing cold has disappeared there is no longer any reason to 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.440
 keep it inside 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.910
 so we have 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.890
 during winters of indoor bonsai 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.080
 exotic tropical species and outdoor bonsai the species of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.529
 temperate climates 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.249
 and during the beautiful season 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.849
 there is more than bonzaïs outside since all bonsais 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.849
 should live dead during the beautiful season 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:22.620
 c 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.970
