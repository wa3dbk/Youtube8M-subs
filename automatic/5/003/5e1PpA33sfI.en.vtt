in<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.809> coupe<00:00:46.989> obviously<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.860> roof<00:00:48.070> is<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.280> big

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
in the coupe obviously the roof is a big

in the coupe obviously the roof is a big
deal<00:00:48.670> one<00:00:49.330> of<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.510> unusual<00:00:49.660> things<00:00:50.290> about<00:00:50.590> the

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
corvette coupe and convertible is how

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.630 
corvette coupe and convertible is how
little<00:00:53.110> difference<00:00:53.470> there<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.830> normally<00:00:54.580> you

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
little difference there is normally you

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.979 
little difference there is normally you
do<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.790> coupe<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.300> then<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:55.809> have<00:00:55.930> to

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
do a coupe and then you have to

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.870 
do a coupe and then you have to
reinforce<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.800> heck<00:00:56.980> out<00:00:57.219> of<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.489> underbody

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
reinforce the heck out of the underbody

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.479 
reinforce the heck out of the underbody
this<00:00:58.780> car<00:00:59.079> designed<00:00:59.559> as<00:00:59.710> an<00:00:59.800> open<00:01:00.070> car<00:01:00.250> cuz<00:01:00.430> the

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
this car designed as an open car cuz the

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.690 
this car designed as an open car cuz the
coupe<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.700> roof<00:01:01.030> comes<00:01:01.270> out<00:01:02.340> 60%<00:01:03.340> stiffer

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
coupe the roof comes out 60% stiffer

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.520 
coupe the roof comes out 60% stiffer
than<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:03.969> previous<00:01:04.360> generation<00:01:04.780> car<00:01:05.020> and<00:01:05.290> so

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
than the previous generation car and so

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.960 
than the previous generation car and so
we<00:01:05.649> can<00:01:05.770> use<00:01:05.890> all<00:01:06.130> those<00:01:06.340> exact<00:01:06.850> same

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
we can use all those exact same

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.210 
we can use all those exact same
structural<00:01:07.570> pieces<00:01:07.840> in<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.680> body<00:01:08.860> structure

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
structural pieces in the body structure

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.830 
structural pieces in the body structure
of<00:01:09.399> this<00:01:09.490> car<00:01:09.729> all<00:01:09.940> we<00:01:10.060> do<00:01:10.180> is<00:01:10.300> take<00:01:10.479> out<00:01:10.690> the

and the hatch in place and we just cap

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.370 
and the hatch in place and we just cap
it<00:01:14.920> over<00:01:15.160> no<00:01:15.880> extra<00:01:16.240> reinforcements<00:01:16.930> anywhere

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
suspension since you don't have to do a

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.710 
suspension since you don't have to do a
ton<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.560> reinforcement<00:01:30.400> how<00:01:30.729> does<00:01:31.420> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
ton of reinforcement how does the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.899 
ton of reinforcement how does the
convertible<00:01:32.290> compare<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.340> coupe<00:01:33.580> when<00:01:33.820> it

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
convertible compare to the coupe when it

comes to weight almost identical since

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.609 
comes to weight almost identical since
all<00:01:37.030> parts<00:01:37.390> is<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.540> same<00:01:37.780> it's<00:01:37.930> also<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.380> only

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
all parts is the same it's also the only

all parts is the same it's also the only
thing<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:39.040> adds<00:01:39.189> it<00:01:39.369> just<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.880> couple<00:01:40.150> kilos

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
thing that adds it just a couple kilos

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.890 
thing that adds it just a couple kilos
is<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.530> motor<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.600> hydraulics<00:01:43.600> for<00:01:43.840> the

one-button top the buttons right here it
operates<00:01:54.189> at<00:01:54.460> speed<00:01:54.939> so<00:01:55.240> up<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.479> 35<00:01:55.840> miles<00:01:56.049> an

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
operates at speed so up to 35 miles an

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.690 
operates at speed so up to 35 miles an
hour<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:56.470> can<00:01:56.590> put<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.799> up<00:01:56.920> or<00:01:57.130> down<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.579> one

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
hour you can put it up or down and one

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.069 
hour you can put it up or down and one
of<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.850> reasons<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.360> go<00:01:58.509> down<00:01:58.540> speed<00:01:58.990> is

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
of the reasons it can go down speed is

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.719 
of the reasons it can go down speed is
the<00:01:59.170> tonneau<00:01:59.380> cover<00:01:59.680> doesn't<00:01:59.890> flip<00:02:00.280> up<00:02:00.490> like

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
the tonneau cover doesn't flip up like

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.550 
the tonneau cover doesn't flip up like
we<00:02:00.880> did<00:02:00.909> before<00:02:01.150> where<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:01.869> opens<00:02:02.200> up<00:02:02.350> on<00:02:02.530> a

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
we did before where it opens up on a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.740 
we did before where it opens up on a
simple<00:02:02.920> mechanism<00:02:03.070> it's<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:04.090> very<00:02:04.299> complicated

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
simple mechanism it's a very complicated

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.600 
simple mechanism it's a very complicated
multi<00:02:05.380> link<00:02:05.590> design<00:02:05.890> which<00:02:06.040> actually<00:02:06.400> takes

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
multi link design which actually takes

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.069 
multi link design which actually takes
the<00:02:06.700> tonneau<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:07.030> places<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.570> over<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.930> deck

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
the tonneau and places it over the deck

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.900 
the tonneau and places it over the deck
lid<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.470> keeps<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.769> out<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.340> airstream

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
lid so it keeps it out of the airstream

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.460 
lid so it keeps it out of the airstream
so<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.179> can<00:02:10.269> have<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.420> big<00:02:10.540> parachute<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:11.260> don't

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
so you can have a big parachute I don't

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.080 
so you can have a big parachute I don't
have<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.650> big<00:02:11.769> parachute<00:02:12.070> big<00:02:12.400> drag<00:02:12.670> shoe<00:02:12.880> on

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
have a big parachute big drag shoe on

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.789 
have a big parachute big drag shoe on
the<00:02:13.239> top<00:02:13.450> by<00:02:13.690> itself<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:14.170> enough<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.590> drag

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
the top by itself is enough of a drag

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.000 
the top by itself is enough of a drag
chute<00:02:15.299> canvas<00:02:16.299> top<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:17.019> means<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.829> don't

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
chute canvas top that means is you don't

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.490 
chute canvas top that means is you don't
have<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.160> complexity<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.180> size<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
have the complexity and size of a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.130 
have the complexity and size of a
retractable<00:02:21.010> hardtop<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:22.269> one<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.019> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
retractable hardtop but one of the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.539 
retractable hardtop but one of the
things<00:02:23.290> people<00:02:23.350> might<00:02:23.590> think<00:02:23.829> is<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.400> it's

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
things people might think is that it's

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.180 
things people might think is that it's
going<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.730> be<00:02:24.850> loud<00:02:25.030> inside<00:02:25.390> no<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.860> latest

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
going to be loud inside no the latest

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.009 
going to be loud inside no the latest
canvas<00:02:27.579> tops<00:02:27.850> are<00:02:28.090> extremely<00:02:28.600> quiet

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
canvas tops are extremely quiet

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.539 
canvas tops are extremely quiet
in<00:02:29.110> fact<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.680> outside<00:02:29.950> canvas<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.519> a

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
in fact the outside canvas is a

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.240 
in fact the outside canvas is a
multi-layer<00:02:31.239> acoustic<00:02:31.840> canvas<00:02:32.349> so<00:02:32.800> actually

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
multi-layer acoustic canvas so actually

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.740 
multi-layer acoustic canvas so actually
the<00:02:33.370> convertible<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.209> little<00:02:34.450> bit<00:02:34.569> quieter

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the convertible is a little bit quieter

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.600 
the convertible is a little bit quieter
driving<00:02:35.349> down<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> road<00:02:35.739> than<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.980> coupe<00:02:36.129> is

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
driving down the road than the coupe is

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.770 
driving down the road than the coupe is
huh<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.150> if<00:02:37.270> you're<00:02:37.390> doing<00:02:37.480> long-distance

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
huh so if you're doing long-distance

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.110 
huh so if you're doing long-distance
travel<00:02:38.380> by<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.680> convertible<00:02:39.280> well<00:02:39.850> but<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
travel by the convertible well but the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.280 
travel by the convertible well but the
trunk<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> little<00:02:40.600> bit<00:02:40.690> smaller<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.140> just

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
trunk is a little bit smaller it just

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.510 
trunk is a little bit smaller it just
depends<00:02:41.560> on<00:02:41.620> what<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:41.890> want<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.340> don't

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
depends on what you want and you don't

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.860 
depends on what you want and you don't
have<00:02:42.640> access<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.450> coupe<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
have access to it in the coupe you to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.840 
have access to it in the coupe you to
reach<00:02:44.260> back<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.740> you<00:02:44.800> can<00:02:44.920> get<00:02:45.040> stuff<00:02:45.340> so

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
reach back and you can get stuff so

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.220 
reach back and you can get stuff so
there<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.240> know<00:02:46.270> there<00:02:46.390> just<00:02:46.570> depends<00:02:47.110> what

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
there you know there just depends what

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.830 
there you know there just depends what
you<00:02:47.320> want<00:02:47.350> how<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.580> trunk<00:02:48.850> space<00:02:48.940> given

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
you want how is the trunk space given

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.030 
you want how is the trunk space given
that<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.050> go<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.470> with<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.650> soft<00:02:50.830> top

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
that you go you in with the soft top

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.320 
that you go you in with the soft top
versus<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.400> hard<00:02:51.550> top<00:02:51.700> well<00:02:52.030> it's<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.180> lot

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
versus the hard top well it's a lot

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.180 
versus the hard top well it's a lot
better<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:52.870> put<00:02:52.990> golf<00:02:53.140> bags<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.740> here<00:02:53.950> all

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
better you can put golf bags in here all

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.070 
better you can put golf bags in here all
sorts<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.550> cell<00:02:54.760> K<00:02:54.940> given<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:56.050> a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
sorts of cell K given that you have a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.710 
sorts of cell K given that you have a
coupe<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.920> convertible<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:58.120> buy<00:02:58.330> which<00:02:58.570> one

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
coupe and a convertible to buy which one

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.720 
coupe and a convertible to buy which one
would<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.930> buy<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.410> like<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.100> flexibility<00:03:00.640> of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
would you buy I like the flexibility of

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.460 
would you buy I like the flexibility of
a<00:03:00.880> coupe<00:03:01.060> yeah<00:03:01.510> well<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.990> guess<00:03:02.140> maybe<00:03:02.260> we'll

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
a coupe yeah well I guess maybe we'll

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.900 
a coupe yeah well I guess maybe we'll
just<00:03:02.560> go<00:03:02.680> spend<00:03:02.920> some<00:03:02.950> hours<00:03:03.130> driving<00:03:03.490> second

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
just go spend some hours driving second

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.960 
just go spend some hours driving second
best<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:05.470> not<00:03:05.650> second<00:03:06.010> faster

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.480 

it<00:03:11.960> all<00:03:12.110> sounds<00:03:12.410> good<00:03:12.440> coming<00:03:12.860> out<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:12.980> taja's

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
it all sounds good coming out of taja's

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.160 
it all sounds good coming out of taja's
mouth<00:03:13.670> but<00:03:14.120> can<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.360> open-air<00:03:14.780> Corvette

previously perhaps the Corvette's
greatest<00:03:41.270> asset<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.840> fact<00:03:42.020> that<00:03:42.080> it

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
greatest asset is the fact that it

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.380 
greatest asset is the fact that it
requires<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:42.920> little<00:03:42.950> oh<00:03:43.490> here<00:03:44.090> we<00:03:44.210> are

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
really low to the ground so unless you

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.050 
really low to the ground so unless you
think<00:04:32.680> about<00:04:32.979> it<00:04:33.099> when<00:04:33.189> you're<00:04:33.310> coming<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:33.849> and

out of parking lots you're probably

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.510 
out of parking lots you're probably
going<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.229> scrape<00:04:35.469> it<00:04:35.529> so<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:35.919> be<00:04:36.039> careful

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520
