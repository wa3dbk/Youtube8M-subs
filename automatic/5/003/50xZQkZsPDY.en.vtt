00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
I pick up the box i thought it was empty

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.800 
I pick up the box i thought it was empty
honestly<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.279> thought<00:00:17.430> maybe<00:00:17.699> there<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.210> one

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
honestly I thought maybe there was a one

honestly I thought maybe there was a one
binding<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.320> there<00:00:19.470> there's<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:20.039> two

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
binding in there there's actually two

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.570 
binding in there there's actually two
these<00:00:20.430> things<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:20.970> electrolyte<00:00:22.310> tax<00:00:23.310> base

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
these things are electrolyte tax base

they're<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.180> Mountain<00:00:27.660> binding<00:00:28.109> I'd<00:00:28.230> pretty

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
they're all Mountain binding I'd pretty

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.290 
they're all Mountain binding I'd pretty
much<00:00:28.560> say<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> free<00:00:29.099> ride<00:00:29.369> body<00:00:29.640> they<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
much say a free ride body they have a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.700 
much say a free ride body they have a
very<00:00:30.390> stiff<00:00:31.019> flex<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:32.750> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.930> minimal

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
very stiff flex and this is minimal

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
very stiff flex and this is minimal
everything<00:00:35.520> has<00:00:35.670> been<00:00:35.820> reduced<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:37.050> these

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
everything has been reduced for these

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
everything has been reduced for these
bindings<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.190> light<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.120> flex<00:00:39.390> rating

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

on the one pen scale or 0 to 10 scale
and<00:00:47.460> let's<00:00:47.969> give<00:00:48.120> me<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.660> stiffer<00:00:49.020> end

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and let's give me on the stiffer end

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.840
