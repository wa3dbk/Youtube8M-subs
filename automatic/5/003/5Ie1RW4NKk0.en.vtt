00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
trust actually my first day was Vicky

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
trust actually my first day was Vicky
when<00:00:49.260> she<00:00:49.410> walked<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.250> did

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
when she walked in this is what we did

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.740 
when she walked in this is what we did
to<00:00:50.550> her<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> people

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
to her we like to do that to people

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
to her we like to do that to people
to<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.710> actually<00:00:52.829> fit<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to see if they actually fit into the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.630 
to see if they actually fit into the
class<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.969> actually<00:00:54.300> our<00:00:54.420> initiation<00:00:55.640> she's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
class it's actually our initiation she's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.529 
class it's actually our initiation she's
a<00:00:56.670> ball<00:00:56.969> python

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
a ball python

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.990 
a ball python
so<00:00:57.899> she<00:00:57.960> rolls<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> ball<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.579> makes<00:00:59.850> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
so she rolls up in a ball which makes it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
so she rolls up in a ball which makes it
very<00:01:00.120> difficult<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.750> measure<00:01:01.050> her<00:01:01.260> length

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
very difficult to measure her length

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.650 
very difficult to measure her length
it's<00:01:02.160> not<00:01:02.430> very<00:01:02.640> easy<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> measure<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.359> snake

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
it's not very easy to measure a snake

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.020 
it's not very easy to measure a snake
with<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> straight<00:01:04.650> ruler<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
with a straight ruler no it's not and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.060 
with a straight ruler no it's not and
the<00:01:06.450> kids<00:01:06.630> find<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.229> too<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.890> how<00:01:08.010> we

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the kids find that out too so how we

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
the kids find that out too so how we
gonna<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.760> don't<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
gonna do this I don't know we have to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.880 
gonna do this I don't know we have to
problem-solve<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.439> that's<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> kids

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
problem-solve that's that's the kids

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.350 
problem-solve that's that's the kids
this<00:01:11.040> morning<00:01:11.189> that's<00:01:11.760> right

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this morning that's right

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
when kids hold it for the first time

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.130 
when kids hold it for the first time
they<00:01:14.820> realize<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.720> things<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
they realize that it can do things that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
they realize that it can do things that
they<00:01:16.830> used<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> fear<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.700> they<00:01:17.790> were<00:01:17.880> hesitant

can<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.840> one<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.930> our<00:01:34.020> science<00:01:34.439> kits<00:01:34.650> during

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
can do one of our science kits during

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800 
can do one of our science kits during
the<00:01:35.070> year<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.340> mixtures<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.939> solutions<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the year is mixtures and solutions it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
the year is mixtures and solutions it
works<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.320> perfectly<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.040> our<00:01:38.310> saltwater

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
works in perfectly with our saltwater

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.850 
works in perfectly with our saltwater
tank<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.840> try<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> tell<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> kids<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
tank we try to tell the kids that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.050 
tank we try to tell the kids that
there's<00:01:41.009> no<00:01:41.130> sense<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> learn<00:01:41.579> something<00:01:41.970> if

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
there's no sense to learn something if

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520 
there's no sense to learn something if
you're<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> apply<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.409> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you're not going to apply it and if you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260 
you're not going to apply it and if you
do<00:01:43.649> apply<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.040> you're<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.119> learning

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
do apply it you're going to be learning

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
do apply it you're going to be learning
it<00:01:45.420> much<00:01:45.570> better<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.649> apply<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
it much better so they apply the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.130 
it much better so they apply the
knowledge<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.549> mixtures<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.000> solutions<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
knowledge of mixtures and solutions in a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
knowledge of mixtures and solutions in a
life-and-death<00:01:49.500> situation<00:01:50.310> yes<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:50.640> do

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
life-and-death situation yes they do

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.609 
life-and-death situation yes they do
they<00:01:51.360> learn<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.780> use<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.380> deep<00:01:52.770> six<00:01:53.149> which<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
they learn to use a deep six which is a

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.770 
they learn to use a deep six which is a
salinity<00:01:55.619> gauge<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.909> understand<00:01:57.509> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
salinity gauge and they understand that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.569 
salinity gauge and they understand that
if<00:01:58.020> there's<00:01:58.229> too<00:01:58.409> much<00:01:58.439> salt<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.219> enough

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
if there's too much salt or not enough

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.910 
if there's too much salt or not enough
salt<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.719> fish<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:01.079> die<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.619> they

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
salt then the fish will die and they

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
salt then the fish will die and they
know<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.490> that's<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.420> situation<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
know that that's the situation and that

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.990 
know that that's the situation and that
they're<00:02:04.530> actually<00:02:04.710> caretakers<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.640> these

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
they're actually caretakers to these

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.770 
they're actually caretakers to these
fish

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
fish

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.980 
fish
I<00:02:07.580> would<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.700> handle<00:02:08.970> all<00:02:09.179> spiders<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.810> would

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
I would not handle all spiders I would

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.290 
I would not handle all spiders I would
not<00:02:10.080> handle<00:02:10.320> all<00:02:10.500> tarantulas<00:02:11.100> but<00:02:11.820> our

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
not handle all tarantulas but our

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.700 
not handle all tarantulas but our
understanding<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
understanding is that this is a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.270 
understanding is that this is a
potential<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.550> fairly<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.720> gentle<00:02:16.620> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
potential that is fairly a gentle it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.980 
potential that is fairly a gentle it
does<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.670> its<00:02:17.820> fangs<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.330> does<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.660> venom

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
does have its fangs it does have venom

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.830 
does have its fangs it does have venom
but<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:20.300> strengths<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> venom<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.720> that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
but the strengths of the venom is that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.110 
but the strengths of the venom is that
like<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> bee<00:02:22.290> sting<00:02:22.320> we've<00:02:22.770> been<00:02:22.920> told<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.820> if

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
like a bee sting we've been told and if

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.699 
like a bee sting we've been told and if
a<00:02:24.209> child<00:02:24.420> gets<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.690> hold<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.990> tarantula<00:02:25.500> with

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
a child gets the hold of tarantula with

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.699 
a child gets the hold of tarantula with
parental<00:02:26.520> permission<00:02:27.230> they<00:02:28.230> feel<00:02:28.440> actually

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
parental permission they feel actually

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.810 
parental permission they feel actually
much<00:02:28.860> better<00:02:29.010> about<00:02:29.250> themselves<00:02:29.490> like

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
much better about themselves like

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.550 
much better about themselves like
they've<00:02:30.090> accomplished<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.660> goal<00:02:30.840> there's<00:02:31.470> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
they've accomplished the goal there's a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.920 
they've accomplished the goal there's a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
the students in the beginning of the

the students in the beginning of the
year<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.180> research<00:02:36.540> different<00:02:36.840> animals

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
year they research different animals

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.320 
year they research different animals
they're<00:02:37.890> responsible<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.550> make<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.820> backdrop

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
they're responsible to make a backdrop

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.150 
they're responsible to make a backdrop
with<00:02:39.690> their<00:02:39.900> research<00:02:40.260> information<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.130> that

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
with their research information so that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.520 
with their research information so that
they<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.400> care<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.970> animals<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:43.350> is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
they can care for the animals this is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.890 
they can care for the animals this is
our<00:02:43.709> bearded<00:02:44.130> dragon<00:02:44.459> lizard<00:02:44.489> 8<00:02:44.970> we<00:02:45.600> call<00:02:45.750> them

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
our bearded dragon lizard 8 we call them

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.620 
our bearded dragon lizard 8 we call them
a<00:02:45.989> because<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.500> beard<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:48.270> one<00:02:48.450> reason

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
a because of the beard that's one reason

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.420 
a because of the beard that's one reason
and<00:02:48.959> then<00:02:49.080> we<00:02:49.170> named<00:02:49.380> an<00:02:49.500> Abe<00:02:49.709> also<00:02:49.950> because

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and then we named an Abe also because

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.490 
and then we named an Abe also because
for<00:02:50.880> some<00:02:51.030> reason<00:02:51.060> students<00:02:52.050> have<00:02:52.140> been<00:02:52.290> led

it's<00:03:14.430> one<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.730> responds<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.209> students<00:03:15.630> as

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it's one that responds to students as

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.420 
it's one that responds to students as
they<00:03:15.840> walk<00:03:16.019> into<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.410> room<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.250> there's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
they walk into the room so there's

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.890 
they walk into the room so there's
things<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.880> they<00:03:18.060> can<00:03:18.239> do<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.570> smaller

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
things that they can do on a smaller

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.330 
things that they can do on a smaller
scale<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.410> doesn't<00:03:19.680> have<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.890> be<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> scale

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
scale it doesn't have to be a scale

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.640 
scale it doesn't have to be a scale
quite<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.820> large<00:03:20.930> although<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.110> think<00:03:22.500> once

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
quite this large although I think once

quite this large although I think once
they<00:03:22.830> realize<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.430> benefits<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.030> using<00:03:24.390> some

animals<00:03:25.170> they'll<00:03:25.410> probably<00:03:25.650> want<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.160> have

animals they'll probably want to have

more

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
more
