 collaboration of them to be able to open 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 a delegation here in argentina and power 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.040
 put something in a voluntary way in what 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.310
 that was the search specialty and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.350
 rescue and in August well when was the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.270
 earthquake in Peru we were able to attend with 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.240
 they in qualities we take charge of the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.340
 logistics part of the team at the time of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 choosing dogs there are certain breeds that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.590
 meet the ideal standards by 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.929
 those that are light no greater than 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.700
 40 kilos with long limbs 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.600
 and do not have any kind of complication 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.880
 having to move 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.670
 unstable surfaces that can be a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 collapsed structure and they can do 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.060
 a physical performance where it can 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.000
 to be someone broke us in the forest 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.619
 a dog that has a physical structure 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.120
 and a physical performance that we 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.820
 we can demand and fulfill the objective 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.030
 the link between the guide and his dog 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.860
 the dog has to be very strong 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.479
 It will always be everything with a trust 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.490
 so high because he knows that his guide 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.660
 accompanies and knows that his life supports him and 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.940
 will be there in all kinds of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.070
 situations both good and bad more 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.440
 in the good because it will be the one that goes 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.240
 to reward the effectiveness of their work and 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.490
 is going to keep a game with its place is 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.630
 because we are the only rescue team 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.730
 he was present in the tartagal avalanche 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.430
 when the river overflowed in February 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.290
 2009 and good the latest events 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.960
 that are more media coverage than 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.690
 is the earthquake of haiti the earthquake of 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.610
 chile and finally we were working 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.530
 in the agatha hurricane in guatemala now 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.940
 in June this way of knowing when the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.800
 dog encounter the person with life of 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.810
 the person cuts or when he is a victim 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.300
 live as the priority for us a 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.820
 Victim lives the dog that barks 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.100
 Now when we took us to 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.990
 you have to locate a corpse on 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.760
 marking that we teach in a 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.150
 training that is scratching can 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.040
 happen to the dog the smell is so 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.489
 aggressive and be so big 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.489
 that the dog goes from scratching to growling 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.650
 but everything that the guide knows 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.459
 interpret what he is doing 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.129
 dog like me who looks at it lola 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.500
 so to speak, it is part of my family and 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.879
 is part of the unit in the field of 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.040
 training is a tool of 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.109
 I work now when the bitch has to 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.599
 make your dog 's life makes his life 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.930
 dog and is a normal dog of a house 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.760
 that recently in the park and gets dirty 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.159
 and it messed up how many people rescued 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.810
 and you remember on the ground with whistles 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.609
 and he looked at me alive we carried a 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.709
 statistics of nine people living 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.120
 the furor has been the Haitian earthquake in 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.849
 which we have been allowed to rescue 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.319
 people with life because in the others 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.260
 previous emergencies we had 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.510
 only located bodies that does not stop 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.000
 of being a good job because also 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.489
 family members play a very important role 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.769
 important because no family member is going to 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.480
 rule out the possibility that your family 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.400
 be alive until you see the body 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.290
 notwithstanding the development of 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.560
 technology in this 21st century 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.700
 the dog is still irreplaceable in 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.190
 the functions 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.930
 social and humanistic content the moment 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.700
 no artifact has been created that 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.310
 can replace the dog's nose by 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.660
 the distance and by the ranges of meters 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.180
 of smell that can have a 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.610
 animal and by the speed that can be 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.040
 move in what I can look for 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.919
 a victim lost in a mountain of 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.630
 100 hectares so to speak what 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.770
 means to you personally what 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.910
 you do and it's our life we 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.970
 we face this work so 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.650
 volunteer without support and so we have a 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.050
 a lot of things we postpone to 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.710
 our family 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.930
 to our children in our work in 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.120
 our bosses two by three we did very 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.979
 well earthquake and we 're leaving or we 're 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.650
 dismiss or not dismiss us 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.610
 let's go and it's practically a not a 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.789
 work is a way of life 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.789
 do not 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.020
 when people 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.250
 he has not seen the propaganda when he says 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.710
 that there are things that money can not 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.930
 buy is the same is the same 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.460
 that feeling of being able to give life back and 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.449
 to be able to collaborate I tell you it 's something 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.449
 super beautiful
