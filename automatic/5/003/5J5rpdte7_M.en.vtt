 cristian core of the page actions of 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.450
 álex puntocom mother in the first letter 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.610
 of the day 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.300
 today grind four and the first letter 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.130
 more comes to our friend Martín Barrito 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.369
 hello cristian I'm Uruguayan he gave me a 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.790
 method 78 thousand pesos 80 kilos comes 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.220
 decided to buy creatine and amino acids 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.040
 psw to raise a little as it does 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.050
 a few months that I feel stuck not 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.720
 I have any experience with any of 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.899
 they therefore wanted to ask you in 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.780
 what time of day and how much bs 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.140
 give to I must take added to the three to 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.489
 Five grams of creatine grape juice 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.900
 after training I wait for you 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.260
 answer thank you good 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.260
 first of all I want to applaud our 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.080
 friend Martin because he knows that the dose 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.470
 Appropriate creatine are 3 to 5 grams 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.810
 of creatine only with grape juice 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.550
 another played sweet that is not cynical is 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.670
 like grapefruit juice or juice 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.220
 orange or that type of cv so very 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.620
 well with that remember the creatine 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.270
 Many products recommend the 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.460
 week of loading a week of loading 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.130
 for for the kidneys in hand for the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.670
 liver is useless is bad for 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.780
 everything so the perfect one had yes 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.280
 we get creatine of power 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.780
 training only in days of 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.170
 training means in days that 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.030
 tomorrow do not take it wash that double is a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.850
 good supplement that should be taken 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.070
 between training you should say no 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.979
 before not after but during that if 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.430
 you fill one hour 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.350
 I could take the whole ones in the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.000
 half an hour 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.950
 What you can do is take action a lot 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.909
 that is 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.380
 and so it is not 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.229
 is the fifth part of the portion each 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.759
 ten minutes the sixth part the fourth 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.170
 part the third part what you 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.229
 want but you not only during the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.689
 training that has that also not 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.229
 it replaces the water that simply 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.789
 Take a little hole and take a little bit of 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.860
 the position during training 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.850
 but they also took on top of that or 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.640
 separate from that 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.580
 I prefer a product or supplement 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.320
 proteins instead of more than the unit but 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.120
 because the protein has from the months of 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.570
 wafers have the advantage of taking the bc 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.210
 double to is that what you are ingesting 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.990
 what you are taking is directly and 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.670
 only one amino acid there are no others 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.890
 amino acids apart from amino acids 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.950
 essential are those that the body does not 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.950
 can create a good product because a 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.820
 low in calories many times is the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.920
 used with artificial sugar and not 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.140
 requires an insulin response that's why 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.970
 that you do not have to drink it with a drink 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.730
 sweet 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.370
 if you take the amino acid during 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.360
 training and creatine after 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.310
 workout and eat in 5 to 6 meals 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.580
 small wins targets throughout the day 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.670
 with enough water will not have to 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.840
 take any non - protein supplement 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.310
 will have to take a multivitamin 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.430
 you will not have to take anything 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.680
 If you do not want to buy a product before 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.000
 worker training I will give you a 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.120
 recommendation that will be quite 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.069
 easy to me to martín and to any other 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.590
 way because I 'm not taking caffeine 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.900
 but for you that if you take caffeine 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.700
 I recommend a cup of black coffee if 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.489
 you want to get him to take the right no 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.590
 it has to be the super no milk can 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.599
 being a black coffee cup can be a 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.730
 cup of coffee with sugar or a sugar 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.970
 artificially as the record or 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.310
 saccharin but not milk milk and not before 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.280
 of the training because the demanding of 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.900
 training, what can you do? 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.049
 susceptible to cramping 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.350
 so a cup of black coffee or with a 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.080
 little sugar before training 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.090
 before training 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.920
 amino acids during training and 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.140
 Creatine after training 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.780
 5 to 6 small meals earn targets and 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.940
 enough water and companions are going to be 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.550
 lined marked agonist strong and 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.140
 recovering and regenerating if they liked
