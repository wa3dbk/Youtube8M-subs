the movie I think this was definitely
one<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:49.180> darker<00:02:50.180> points<00:02:50.750> until<00:02:51.319> hoes<00:02:51.610> show

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
one of the darker points until hoes show

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.420 
one of the darker points until hoes show
a<00:02:52.640> show<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.750> career<00:02:56.590> pretty<00:02:57.590> much<00:02:57.799> gone<00:02:58.100> were

were really starting to like lose a lot
of<00:03:13.850> money<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:15.290> was<00:03:15.470> pretty<00:03:15.769> much<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.010> dark

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
of money and it was pretty much a dark

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.030 
of money and it was pretty much a dark
time<00:03:16.400> for<00:03:16.459> them<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.079> around<00:03:18.079> like<00:03:18.410> Godzilla

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
time for them so around like Godzilla

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.590 
time for them so around like Godzilla
versus<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> guy<00:03:19.519> again<00:03:19.820> they<00:03:20.030> really<00:03:20.269> started

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
versus a guy again they really started

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.150 
versus a guy again they really started
just<00:03:20.720> like<00:03:20.900> whipping<00:03:21.320> out<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.739> Godzilla

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
just like whipping out the Godzilla

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.780 
just like whipping out the Godzilla
movies<00:03:22.549> every<00:03:22.940> year<00:03:24.790> consecutively

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
movies every year consecutively

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.020 
movies every year consecutively
basically<00:03:26.299> from<00:03:26.480> seven<00:03:26.780> 1972<00:03:27.590> or<00:03:27.980> 1971<00:03:28.790> to

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
basically from seven 1972 or 1971 to

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.390 
basically from seven 1972 or 1971 to
1975<00:03:30.370> um<00:03:31.810> but<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:33.140> really<00:03:33.769> think<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:34.160> this

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
1975 um but I really think that this

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.470 
1975 um but I really think that this
vide<00:03:34.810> movie<00:03:35.810> doesn't<00:03:36.620> get<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.280> lot<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.150> like

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
vide movie doesn't get a lot of like

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.020 
vide movie doesn't get a lot of like
enough<00:03:39.049> respect<00:03:39.470> from<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:40.100> lot<00:03:40.190> of<00:03:40.370> fans<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:41.000> mean

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
enough respect from a lot of fans I mean

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.970 
enough respect from a lot of fans I mean
I<00:03:41.269> know<00:03:41.299> it<00:03:41.570> was<00:03:41.720> easily<00:03:42.079> one<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.500> goofiest

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
I know it was easily one of the goofiest

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.240 
I know it was easily one of the goofiest
and<00:03:43.430> cheesiest<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.900> series<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.650> some<00:03:46.130> of

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
and cheesiest in the series and some of

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.349 
and cheesiest in the series and some of
the<00:03:46.340> things<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:46.579> happen<00:03:47.030> are<00:03:47.180> just

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
the things that happen are just

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.660 
the things that happen are just
laughable<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:49.570> especially<00:03:50.570> in<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.670> US

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
laughable and especially in the US

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.050 
laughable and especially in the US
version<00:03:52.910> with<00:03:53.209> all<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.930> bad<00:03:54.140> dubbing<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
version with all the bad dubbing and

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.949 
version with all the bad dubbing and
because<00:03:56.060> yeah<00:03:56.209> some<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.540> dubbing<00:03:56.870> is

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
because yeah some of the dubbing is

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.309 
because yeah some of the dubbing is
really<00:03:57.350> bad<00:03:57.560> I'm<00:03:58.340> sorry<00:03:58.640> but<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.150> they<00:04:00.140> could

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
really bad I'm sorry but that they could

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.620 
really bad I'm sorry but that they could
have<00:04:00.410> done<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.890> much<00:04:01.459> better<00:04:01.519> job<00:04:01.819> on<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.180> but

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
have done a much better job on that but

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.180 
have done a much better job on that but
I<00:04:02.660> guess<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.079> maybe<00:04:03.500> they<00:04:03.680> just<00:04:03.709> didn't<00:04:04.040> care

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
I guess so maybe they just didn't care

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.879 
I guess so maybe they just didn't care
enough<00:04:04.389> which<00:04:05.389> which<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.049> unfortunate<00:04:06.709> for<00:04:06.739> a

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
enough which which is unfortunate for a

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:12.789 
enough which which is unfortunate for a
Godzilla<00:04:07.310> movie<00:04:07.810> um<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.389> guess<00:04:11.769> some<00:04:12.769> of

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
Godzilla movie um but I guess some of

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.050 
Godzilla movie um but I guess some of
the<00:04:12.950> monster<00:04:13.280> scenes<00:04:13.489> I<00:04:13.639> thought<00:04:13.850> were<00:04:13.910> really

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
the monster scenes I thought were really

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.719 
the monster scenes I thought were really
cool<00:04:14.500> i'll<00:04:15.500> just<00:04:15.950> maybe<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.639> just

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
cool i'll just maybe I just

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.450 
cool i'll just maybe I just
show<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.759> little<00:04:20.409> compassion<00:04:21.409> on<00:04:21.949> this<00:04:22.099> movie

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
show a little compassion on this movie

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.969 
show a little compassion on this movie
just<00:04:22.639> because<00:04:22.819> it<00:04:22.939> was<00:04:22.969> I<00:04:23.090> think<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.389> was<00:04:23.509> the

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
just because it was I think it was the

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.580 
just because it was I think it was the
third<00:04:24.979> or<00:04:25.189> fourth<00:04:25.460> movie<00:04:25.729> I<00:04:25.759> saw<00:04:26.120> yeah<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:27.469> was

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
third or fourth movie I saw yeah it was

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.860 
third or fourth movie I saw yeah it was
the<00:04:27.620> fourth<00:04:28.099> movie<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.490> saw<00:04:28.819> it<00:04:28.999> and<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.180> mean

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
the fourth movie I saw it and I mean

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.629 
the fourth movie I saw it and I mean
back<00:04:30.319> in<00:04:30.379> the<00:04:30.529> day<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.800> really<00:04:31.249> thought<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.490> was

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
back in the day I really thought it was

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.179 
back in the day I really thought it was
really<00:04:31.789> cool<00:04:32.120> being<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.289> think<00:04:33.319> eight<00:04:33.889> or<00:04:33.919> nine

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:34.189 
really cool being I think eight or nine

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.110 
really cool being I think eight or nine

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
guess you need to look at it more of its

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.360 
guess you need to look at it more of its
jet<00:04:40.400> it's<00:04:41.289> it<00:04:42.289> was<00:04:42.409> generated<00:04:42.770> for<00:04:43.009> more<00:04:43.189> of<00:04:43.279> a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
jet it's it was generated for more of a

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.409 
jet it's it was generated for more of a
younger<00:04:43.699> audience<00:04:44.229> jet<00:04:45.229> jaguar<00:04:45.439> easily<00:04:46.419> or

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:56.779 
where I read this but they are right

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.499 
where I read this but they are right
where<00:04:57.080> megalon<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:58.039> guy<00:04:58.279> again<00:04:58.550> they<00:04:59.330> also

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
where megalon and guy again they also

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.740 
where megalon and guy again they also
look<00:04:59.840> like<00:05:00.020> they<00:05:00.229> were<00:05:00.259> ultra<00:05:01.159> monsters<00:05:01.750> like

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
look like they were ultra monsters like

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.959 
look like they were ultra monsters like
in<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.259> way<00:05:03.939> um<00:05:06.370> yeah<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.400> thought<00:05:07.699> some<00:05:07.819> of<00:05:07.879> the

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:07.969 
in a way um yeah I thought some of the

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:13.029 
in a way um yeah I thought some of the
fight<00:05:08.120> scenes<00:05:08.360> were<00:05:08.629> pretty<00:05:09.069> cool<00:05:10.479> I<00:05:12.039> just

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
fight scenes were pretty cool I just

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.510 
fight scenes were pretty cool I just
like<00:05:13.339> all<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.610> old<00:05:14.589> old<00:05:15.589> show<00:05:15.949> a<00:05:15.979> Godzilla

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
like all the old old show a Godzilla

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.100 
like all the old old show a Godzilla

like laughable then I think would be

like laughable then I think would be
found<00:06:37.090> that<00:06:37.270> you<00:06:37.360> can't<00:06:37.539> go<00:06:37.690> in<00:06:37.840> into<00:06:38.349> the
