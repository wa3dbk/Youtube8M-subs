places<00:00:38.879> instead<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.250> use<00:00:41.670> small<00:00:42.059> version

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
places instead so I use small version

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.840 
places instead so I use small version
cover<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.079> toaster<00:00:44.450> abnormalities<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> use

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
cover up toaster abnormalities so I use

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.740

light blue and I highlight some of the
ripples<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> lighter<00:01:03.449> blue<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.409> make

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
ripples with a lighter blue so they make

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.620 
ripples with a lighter blue so they make
a<00:01:08.060> little<00:01:09.060> shine<00:01:09.330> maybe<00:01:11.210> that's<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.390> I'm

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
a little shine maybe that's what I'm

a little shine maybe that's what I'm
doing<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:14.630> what<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> use<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.580> dark<00:01:17.580> blue<00:01:17.820> moon

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
doing here what I use a dark blue moon

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.870 
doing here what I use a dark blue moon
then<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> medium<00:01:18.810> blue<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.350> top<00:01:19.610> then<00:01:20.610> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
then use a medium blue on top then we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.929 
then use a medium blue on top then we
light<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.780> top<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:23.640> makes

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939

light up you on top of that that makes
the<00:01:24.240> water<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.659> sprinkle<00:01:30.650> very<00:01:31.650> false

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the water and of a sprinkle very false

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.340 
the water and of a sprinkle very false
will<00:01:32.159> shine

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.840 

I<00:01:38.470> also<00:01:39.159> add<00:01:39.460> yellow<00:01:40.210> yellow<00:01:40.960> green<00:01:41.640> will<00:01:42.640> you

I also add yellow yellow green will you

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.830 
I also add yellow yellow green will you
some<00:01:43.299> of<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.600> trees<00:01:43.900> on<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.259> left<00:01:45.240> though<00:01:46.240> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
some of the trees on the left though the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.490 
some of the trees on the left though the
middle<00:01:47.140> branches<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.270> our<00:01:49.540> next<00:01:49.960> will<00:01:50.110> stand

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
middle branches and our next will stand

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.289 
middle branches and our next will stand
out<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.070> area<00:01:51.549> dies<00:01:52.180> too<00:01:52.509> dark<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:54.299> we

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
out in that area dies too dark so we

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.670 
out in that area dies too dark so we
break<00:01:55.810> right<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:57.040> monopoly<00:01:57.789> on<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.680> area

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
break right the monopoly on that area

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.870 
break right the monopoly on that area
there<00:02:00.070> click<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:00.789> more<00:02:01.149> interesting<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:02.880> also

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
there click it more interesting I also

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.380 
there click it more interesting I also
add<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.479> shadows<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.500> ripples<00:02:06.390> that's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
add the shadows to the ripples that's

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.979 
add the shadows to the ripples that's
you<00:02:07.720> got<00:02:07.930> lines<00:02:08.289> underneath<00:02:09.330> there<00:02:10.330> for<00:02:10.690> you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
you got lines underneath there for you

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.330 
you got lines underneath there for you
to<00:02:11.200> make<00:02:11.380> them<00:02:11.560> work<00:02:11.590> stand<00:02:12.250> out<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> little<00:02:12.730> bit

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
to make them work stand out a little bit

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.930 
to make them work stand out a little bit
let<00:02:15.340> me<00:02:15.489> see<00:02:15.790> final<00:02:16.450> stages<00:02:17.700> doing<00:02:18.700> some

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
let me see final stages doing some

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.750 
let me see final stages doing some
finite<00:02:19.569> fine<00:02:20.110> work<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:23.340> add<00:02:24.390> branches

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
finite fine work and add branches

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:38.510 
finite fine work and add branches
highlights<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.720> branches

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.460 

this<00:02:39.420> painting<00:02:40.260> took<00:02:40.680> me<00:02:40.890> about<00:02:42.230> two<00:02:43.230> days<00:02:43.260> to
