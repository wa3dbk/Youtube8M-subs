guys<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> team<00:02:39.820> play<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.030> lot<00:02:40.360> around<00:02:40.720> zigs

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
guys as a team play a lot around zigs

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.930 
guys as a team play a lot around zigs
because<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.350> seems<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.740> when<00:02:42.370> kurp<00:02:42.640> is<00:02:42.790> on

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
because it seems like when kurp is on

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.260 
because it seems like when kurp is on
Ziggs<00:02:43.270> millennium<00:02:44.260> plays<00:02:44.470> at<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.800> higher<00:02:45.220> level

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
Ziggs millennium plays at a higher level

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.680 
Ziggs millennium plays at a higher level
that<00:02:46.270> when<00:02:46.420> kurp<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.380> Ziggs<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:49.270> don't

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
that when kurp is not on Ziggs I I don't

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.810 
that when kurp is not on Ziggs I I don't
think<00:02:49.870> we<00:02:49.959> play<00:02:50.140> more<00:02:50.380> about<00:02:50.620> six<00:02:50.920> adjust<00:02:51.640> that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
think we play more about six adjust that

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.530 
think we play more about six adjust that
if<00:02:52.120> he<00:02:52.360> play<00:02:52.570> six<00:02:52.870> he<00:02:53.110> farms<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.590> ton<00:02:53.770> like<00:02:54.370> he<00:02:55.150> he

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
if he play six he farms a ton like he he

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.140 
if he play six he farms a ton like he he
roams<00:02:55.810> really<00:02:56.140> good<00:02:56.320> he<00:02:56.890> does<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.790> bombs

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
roams really good he does the the bombs

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.880 
roams really good he does the the bombs
to<00:02:58.330> help<00:02:58.510> out<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.989> lines<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.350> cases<00:02:59.530> a

know why but he has the potential to
believe<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.820> one<00:03:12.940> be<00:03:13.030> one<00:03:13.180> so<00:03:13.600> um<00:03:14.670> another

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
believe and one be one so um another

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.009 
believe and one be one so um another
champions<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.360> bit<00:03:16.480> different<00:03:16.840> because

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
champions it's a bit different because

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.500 
champions it's a bit different because
other<00:03:17.920> champions<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.519> course<00:03:18.730> higher<00:03:19.180> risk

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
other champions of course higher risk

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.020 
other champions of course higher risk
and<00:03:19.810> higher<00:03:20.080> reward<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.100> 6<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.489> just<00:03:21.880> safe

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
and higher reward so 6 is just safe

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.090 
and higher reward so 6 is just safe
bacon<00:03:22.420> if<00:03:22.600> cur<00:03:23.049> place<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.560> safe<00:03:23.830> and

week<00:03:44.170> one<00:03:44.380> we<00:03:44.590> felt<00:03:44.799> good<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.250> fell<00:03:45.430> really

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
week one we felt good we fell really

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.630 
week one we felt good we fell really
good<00:03:45.820> but<00:03:46.690> already<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.500> scrimps<00:03:47.950> we<00:03:48.190> felt

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
good but already in the scrimps we felt

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.550 
good but already in the scrimps we felt
that<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.420> other<00:03:49.660> teams<00:03:49.900> improved<00:03:50.320> really

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
that the other teams improved really

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.880 
that the other teams improved really
fast<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.880> managed<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.690> fix<00:03:52.930> their<00:03:53.410> the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
fast they managed to fix their the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.190 
fast they managed to fix their the
rotations<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.790> level<00:03:55.030> ones<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.900> swaps

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
rotations the level ones and the swaps

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.320 
rotations the level ones and the swaps
really<00:03:56.709> good<00:03:56.890> which<00:03:57.670> we<00:03:57.790> didn't<00:03:58.090> at<00:03:58.299> that

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
really good which we didn't at that

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.440 
really good which we didn't at that
point<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.049> was<00:03:59.440> basically<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.580> key

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
point so that was basically the the key

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.780 
point so that was basically the the key
why<00:04:01.750> we<00:04:01.900> lost<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.350> lot<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.620> games<00:04:02.920> like<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.220> and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
why we lost a lot of games like that and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
guys seem to have the ability to just

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.490 
guys seem to have the ability to just
destroy<00:04:23.800> when<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.400> hit<00:04:24.610> everything<00:04:25.410> but<00:04:26.410> you

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
we do wrong the thing is just we don't

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.260 
we do wrong the thing is just we don't
have<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.289> exact<00:04:57.190> person<00:04:57.460> who<00:04:57.729> just<00:04:57.760> tells<00:04:58.120> us

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
have a exact person who just tells us

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.830 
have a exact person who just tells us
how<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.570> fix<00:04:58.930> it<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.850> yeah<00:05:00.850> basically<00:05:01.449> how<00:05:01.780> to

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
how to fix it and yeah basically how to

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.689 
how to fix it and yeah basically how to
fix<00:05:02.139> it<00:05:02.289> we<00:05:02.410> see<00:05:02.740> our<00:05:02.860> problems<00:05:03.250> but<00:05:03.370> we<00:05:03.400> cannot

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
fix it we see our problems but we cannot

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.379 
fix it we see our problems but we cannot
just<00:05:03.820> teach<00:05:04.660> ourselves<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:05.650> fast<00:05:05.919> so<00:05:06.610> i

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
just teach ourselves that that fast so i

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.060 
just teach ourselves that that fast so i
think<00:05:07.600> that's<00:05:07.810> that's<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.470> most<00:05:08.620> important

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
think that's that's the most important

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.800 
think that's that's the most important
part<00:05:09.100> why<00:05:09.430> we<00:05:09.639> are<00:05:09.760> not<00:05:09.789> that<00:05:10.120> strong<00:05:10.180> yet<00:05:10.449> and

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
part why we are not that strong yet and

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.290 
part why we are not that strong yet and
why<00:05:11.770> we<00:05:11.889> can't<00:05:12.100> compete<00:05:12.400> with<00:05:12.580> such<00:05:12.820> as<00:05:12.970> k<00:05:13.120> and

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
why we can't compete with such as k and

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.820 
why we can't compete with such as k and
or<00:05:13.449> alliance<00:05:14.880> but<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.840> future<00:05:17.050> will<00:05:17.289> tell<00:05:17.320> we

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
or alliance but the future will tell we

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.219 
or alliance but the future will tell we
hope<00:05:18.010> we<00:05:18.220> can<00:05:18.430> face<00:05:18.760> them<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.200> destroy<00:05:20.200> them

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229
