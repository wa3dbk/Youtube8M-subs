00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.730
 Let's prepare for lemon recipes 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.250
 very easy 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.139
 for the base we are going to need 13 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.580
 packages of cookies or cookies 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.480
 of vanilla and an extra to decorate 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.480
 220 grams of melted butter 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.770
 600 grams of condensed milk 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.980
 three egg yolks 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.600
 lemon zest 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.899
 and 160,000 liters of lemon juice 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.370
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.790
 crush the cookies or the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.790
 vanilla cookies 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.120
 we can do it with a word processor 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.120
 foods 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.409
 once we have the crushed cookies 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.980
 We are going to place 220 grams of 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.980
 butter or melted margarine 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.790
 we mix well to integrate 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.690
 place the lemon zest and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.690
 we keep mixing 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.570
 once integrated everything we are going to 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.570
 place on a mold for country 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.440
 let's go fix the base and go 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.440
 pressing to make it compact 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.080
 once ready we are going to refrigerate 15 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.080
 minutes before baking 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.679
 and bake for 15 minutes 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.480
 approximately at 190 degrees while 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.750
 so much we will go preparing the filling 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.520
 we put 600 grams of condensed milk 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.520
 which is about a can and a half 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.050
 with the three egg yolks 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.080
 and we integrate 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.760
 finally we will add 160,000 liters 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.950
 of lemon juice that are approximately 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.950
 half a cup and a quarter cup 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.340
 we mix until completely integrated 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.290
 and we are going to make this mixture about 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.290
 base that we baked earlier 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.049
 we extend the filling well 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.220
 and we're going to bake 20 to 25 minutes 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.220
 190 degrees 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.909
 Once baked we will decorate as 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.909
 we want 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.270
 Y 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.430
 to finish we cover with meringue 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.610
 Swiss if you want to learn how to do it 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.160
 below I leave the recipe 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.440
 and so we have our country super 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.070
 home very easy to make and with few 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.070
 ingredients 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.700
