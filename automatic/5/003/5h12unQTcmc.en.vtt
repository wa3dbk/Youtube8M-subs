00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 
during the development of 12c we didn't

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.210 
during the development of 12c we didn't
want<00:00:07.180> to<00:00:07.360> compromise<00:00:07.660> we<00:00:08.230> wanted<00:00:08.650> a<00:00:08.740> car<00:00:08.980> that

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.230 

it's<00:01:33.710> perhaps<00:01:33.860> surprising<00:01:34.640> it's<00:01:34.910> a<00:01:34.970> lot<00:01:35.150> of

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's perhaps surprising it's a lot of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.360 
it's perhaps surprising it's a lot of
people<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.900> gt3<00:01:36.590> version<00:01:36.620> of<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.160> car

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
people that the gt3 version of the car

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.000 
people that the gt3 version of the car
has<00:01:37.610> less<00:01:37.910> power<00:01:38.270> than<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.750> road<00:01:38.960> car<00:01:39.230> this<00:01:39.800> is

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
has less power than the road car this is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.430 
has less power than the road car this is
because<00:01:40.400> of<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.730> phenomenal<00:01:41.360> pace<00:01:41.840> of<00:01:42.170> our

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.000 

we<00:02:32.569> believe<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.230> we've<00:02:33.379> developed<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.799> great

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
we believe that we've developed a great

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.250 
we believe that we've developed a great
GT<00:02:34.610> car<00:02:34.849> what's<00:02:35.209> important<00:02:35.689> to<00:02:35.750> us<00:02:35.870> though<00:02:36.110> is

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
GT car what's important to us though is

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.899 
GT car what's important to us though is
that<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.500> customer<00:02:36.950> experience<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.700> better

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
that the customer experience is better

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.449 
that the customer experience is better
than<00:02:38.689> any<00:02:38.870> GT<00:02:39.319> customer<00:02:39.829> has<00:02:39.950> experienced

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
than any GT customer has experienced

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.949 
than any GT customer has experienced
before<00:02:40.579> so<00:02:40.790> we're<00:02:41.120> determined<00:02:41.629> at<00:02:41.689> the<00:02:41.750> cost
