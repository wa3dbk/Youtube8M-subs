psychiatric hospital yeah um I was

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.220 
psychiatric hospital yeah um I was
actually<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.610> wasn't<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.239> trying<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> commit

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
actually I wasn't I'm trying to commit

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.369 
actually I wasn't I'm trying to commit
suicide<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.850> had<00:00:54.270> carved<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:54.840> arm<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
suicide but I had carved on my arm I

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.660 
suicide but I had carved on my arm I
guess<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:55.980> part<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> reason<00:00:56.520> why<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
guess that's part of the reason why I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.410 
guess that's part of the reason why I
was<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.629> drug<00:00:58.140> abuse<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.590> anger

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
was there and for drug abuse and anger

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
was there and for drug abuse and anger
so<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> don't<00:01:01.410> think<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.949> reason

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so and you don't think that's a reason

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.030 
so and you don't think that's a reason
to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.460> put<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> hospital<00:01:03.110> no<00:01:04.110> no<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.619> but

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
to be put in the hospital no no I do but

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.800 
to be put in the hospital no no I do but
I<00:01:05.189> don't<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.090> should<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.540> been

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
I don't think that I should have been

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.899 
I don't think that I should have been
sent<00:01:07.110> there<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.860> didn't<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.760> do
