00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.670 
there and it was fairly easy right and
so<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.500> have<00:02:18.650> cut<00:02:18.890> out<00:02:19.040> here<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.320> logo<00:02:21.320> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
so we have cut out here for the logo the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.430 
so we have cut out here for the logo the
mobile<00:02:22.070> or<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.580> motorola<00:02:22.970> logo<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.570> it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
mobile or the motorola logo and it's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.590 
mobile or the motorola logo and it's
rounded<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.400> edges<00:02:25.430> are<00:02:25.790> rounded<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.450> it's

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
rounded the edges are rounded so it's

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.810 
rounded the edges are rounded so it's
not<00:02:26.720> sharp<00:02:27.080> which<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.530> very<00:02:27.770> nice<00:02:27.950> very<00:02:28.640> nice

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
not sharp which is very nice very nice

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.040 
not sharp which is very nice very nice
feeling<00:02:29.240> right<00:02:30.370> buttons<00:02:32.710> easy<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:34.130> get<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:35.050> so

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
feeling right buttons easy to get to so

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.720 
feeling right buttons easy to get to so
far<00:02:37.420> right<00:02:38.420> no<00:02:38.720> problems<00:02:39.260> nothing<00:02:40.010> stopping

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
far right no problems nothing stopping

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.320 
far right no problems nothing stopping
me<00:02:40.760> from<00:02:40.910> pressing<00:02:41.660> it<00:02:41.840> very<00:02:42.830> quickly<00:02:45.280> right

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.240 

nothing's<00:02:50.330> being<00:02:50.600> blocked<00:02:51.080> now<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.739> ports

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
nothing's being blocked now the ports

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.010 
nothing's being blocked now the ports
being<00:02:52.520> blocked<00:02:53.739> we<00:02:54.739> got<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.070> edges<00:02:55.760> here

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.960 

that's<00:03:00.020> what<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.320> edges<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.980> case<00:03:01.550> looks

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
that's what the edges of the case looks

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.760 
that's what the edges of the case looks
like<00:03:02.980> bottom<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.430> top<00:03:04.930> there<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:08.770> that's

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
like bottom and the top there and that's

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.750 
like bottom and the top there and that's
pretty<00:03:10.190> much<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:12.290> color<00:03:12.560> here<00:03:13.160> hopefully

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
pretty much it the color here hopefully

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.550 
pretty much it the color here hopefully
I<00:03:13.790> mean<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.300> it's<00:03:14.900> probably<00:03:15.110> going<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.410> be<00:03:15.470> a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
I mean it it's probably going to be a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.970 
I mean it it's probably going to be a
little<00:03:15.769> washed<00:03:16.100> out<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.670> little<00:03:17.480> bright<00:03:17.870> but<00:03:18.680> i

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
little washed out a little bright but i

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.330 
little washed out a little bright but i
would<00:03:19.310> say<00:03:19.810> see<00:03:20.810> if<00:03:20.930> i<00:03:20.989> can<00:03:21.200> simulate<00:03:21.860> what<00:03:22.310> I

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
would say see if i can simulate what I

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.580 
would say see if i can simulate what I
see<00:03:22.670> here<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> very<00:03:26.269> pastel<00:03:26.900> kind<00:03:27.470> of

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
see here it is a very pastel kind of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.130 
see here it is a very pastel kind of
color<00:03:27.799> here<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.670> wouldn't<00:03:29.450> say<00:03:29.630> it's<00:03:29.870> close<00:03:30.110> to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
color here I wouldn't say it's close to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.410 
color here I wouldn't say it's close to
teal<00:03:30.530> teal<00:03:30.860> would<00:03:31.070> be<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.280> lot<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.910> little<00:03:32.330> bit

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
teal teal would be a lot a little bit

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.380 
teal teal would be a lot a little bit
darker<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> very<00:03:33.769> light<00:03:34.180> it'd<00:03:35.180> be<00:03:35.360> like

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
darker this is a very light it'd be like

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.160 
darker this is a very light it'd be like
a<00:03:35.540> baby<00:03:36.200> teal<00:03:37.120> if<00:03:38.120> there<00:03:38.330> is<00:03:38.510> such<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.720> thing<00:03:38.840> but

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
a baby teal if there is such a thing but

mint it's more like a very light color
mint<00:03:50.330> right<00:03:51.049> and<00:03:51.260> hopefully<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.519> can<00:03:52.700> have<00:03:53.030> some
