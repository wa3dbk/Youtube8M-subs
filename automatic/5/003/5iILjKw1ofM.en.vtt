your recorder we needed to capture some
video<00:01:01.090> footage<00:01:01.420> then<00:01:02.140> you<00:01:02.289> have<00:01:02.469> audio<00:01:02.859> in<00:01:03.039> and

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
video footage then you have audio in and

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.609 
video footage then you have audio in and
audio<00:01:03.429> out<00:01:03.640> being<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.750> it's<00:01:04.809> ethernet<00:01:05.409> IP

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619

cameras<00:01:06.250> are<00:01:06.430> capable<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.970> two-way<00:01:07.360> audio<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
cameras are capable of two-way audio so

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.580 
cameras are capable of two-way audio so
if<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:08.950> have<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.270> microphone<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:11.140> speaker

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
if you have a microphone and a speaker

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.560 
if you have a microphone and a speaker
you<00:01:11.710> can<00:01:11.890> actually<00:01:12.070> talk<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.909> back<00:01:13.420> and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
you can actually talk to a back and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.149 
you can actually talk to a back and
forth<00:01:13.750> through<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.200> then<00:01:14.799> you<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:15.070> have

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
forth through it and then you just have

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.149 
forth through it and then you just have
alarm<00:01:15.610> inputs<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.900> little<00:01:17.619> green<00:01:17.829> panel

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
alarm inputs on the little green panel

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.510 
alarm inputs on the little green panel
right<00:01:18.310> there<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:20.320> camera<00:01:20.680> has<00:01:20.710> 8<00:01:21.040> millimeter

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
right there the camera has 8 millimeter

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.240 
right there the camera has 8 millimeter
lens<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:22.390> it's<00:01:22.710> designed<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.860> be<00:01:24.009> back<00:01:24.220> a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
lens so it's designed to be back a

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.480 
lens so it's designed to be back a
little<00:01:24.549> bit<00:01:24.729> further<00:01:25.689> from<00:01:26.079> the<00:01:26.860> target<00:01:27.159> I

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
little bit further from the target I

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.569 
little bit further from the target I
mean<00:01:28.360> basically<00:01:28.720> an<00:01:29.710> eight<00:01:29.890> millimeter<00:01:30.070> lens

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
mean basically an eight millimeter lens

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.840 
mean basically an eight millimeter lens
i<00:01:30.820> would<00:01:31.000> say<00:01:31.240> should<00:01:32.110> be<00:01:32.259> around<00:01:32.500> 15<00:01:33.070> feet<00:01:33.340> to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
i would say should be around 15 feet to

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.170 
i would say should be around 15 feet to
20<00:01:34.180> feet<00:01:34.420> maybe<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:36.040> your<00:01:36.340> focal<00:01:36.729> point<00:01:36.939> it's<00:01:37.119> a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
20 feet maybe is your focal point it's a

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.899 
20 feet maybe is your focal point it's a
fixed<00:01:37.540> lens<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:38.590> can<00:01:38.619> change<00:01:39.430> these<00:01:39.610> lenses

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
fixed lens you can change these lenses

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.660 
fixed lens you can change these lenses
out<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.869> have<00:01:41.049> varifocal<00:01:41.649> lenses<00:01:42.220> or<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.520> can

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.820 
terabyte hard drive in there as you can
see<00:03:47.540> it's<00:03:47.690> flashing<00:03:48.140> because<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.650> hard

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
see it's flashing because of the hard

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.800 
see it's flashing because of the hard
drive<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.070> recording<00:03:49.610> there<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:49.940> that's

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
drive is recording there and that's

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.490 
drive is recording there and that's
because<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.290> camera<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.040> logged<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:53.500> this

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
because the camera is logged in so this

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.570 
because the camera is logged in so this
type<00:03:54.799> of<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:57.200> type<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.470> recording<00:03:57.980> device<00:03:58.040> is

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
type of this type of recording device is

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.500 
type of this type of recording device is
a<00:03:59.890> really<00:04:00.890> great<00:04:01.010> recording<00:04:01.549> device<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.209> it's

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
a really great recording device and it's

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.990 
a really great recording device and it's
a<00:04:02.600> lot<00:04:02.750> different<00:04:02.930> from<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.350> DVR<00:04:03.709> in<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.670> reason

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
a lot different from a DVR in the reason

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.760 
a lot different from a DVR in the reason
for<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.240> is

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
for that is

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.180 
for that is
you<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:06.880> have<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.450> NVR<00:04:07.990> at<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.410> different

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
you can have the NVR at a different

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.220 
you can have the NVR at a different
location<00:04:09.250> then<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.420> cameras<00:04:10.780> are<00:04:10.900> actually

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
location then the cameras are actually

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.530 
location then the cameras are actually
adds<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.800> way<00:04:12.070> if<00:04:12.700> say<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.150> have<00:04:13.510> a

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
adds so that way if say you have a

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.090 
adds so that way if say you have a
business<00:04:14.110> or<00:04:14.320> something<00:04:14.530> like<00:04:14.710> that<00:04:14.770> and<00:04:15.010> you

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
business or something like that and you

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.310 
business or something like that and you
have<00:04:15.310> all<00:04:15.910> your<00:04:16.239> cameras<00:04:16.630> at<00:04:16.750> your<00:04:16.870> business

in the event of a burglary or robbery or
anything<00:04:19.870> like<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.730> if<00:04:21.730> they're<00:04:22.000> looking

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
anything like that if they're looking

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.740 
anything like that if they're looking
for<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.510> DVR<00:04:23.280> wanting<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.400> steal<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.270> DVR

for the DVR wanting to steal the DVR

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.330 
for the DVR wanting to steal the DVR
that's<00:04:26.260> not<00:04:26.500> going<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.710> be<00:04:26.740> possible<00:04:26.980> because

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
that's not going to be possible because

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.580 
that's not going to be possible because
the<00:04:27.520> DVD<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.330> NVR<00:04:28.690> can<00:04:29.020> be<00:04:29.140> in<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.320> different

the DVD and NVR can be in a different

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.130 
the DVD and NVR can be in a different
location<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.940> can<00:04:31.150> wire<00:04:31.690> up<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:32.020> your

you see the resolution here is 1280 by
720<00:05:28.030> and<00:05:28.390> then<00:05:28.480> you<00:05:28.570> have<00:05:28.720> a<00:05:28.750> bit<00:05:29.050> rate<00:05:29.260> of<00:05:30.030> 2048

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
720 and then you have a bit rate of 2048

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.460 
720 and then you have a bit rate of 2048
and<00:05:31.270> 25<00:05:32.160> frames<00:05:33.160> per<00:05:33.310> second<00:05:34.020> you<00:05:35.020> can<00:05:35.200> change

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.110 
the power line frequency 50 Hertz 60
Hertz<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.400> then<00:05:39.400> you<00:05:39.490> have<00:05:39.610> a<00:05:39.640> secondary

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
Hertz and then you have a secondary

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.750
