hi everybody its ecological from my new

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.639 
hi everybody its ecological from my new
home<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.400> Worcester<00:00:06.000> Massachusetts<00:00:06.720> at<00:00:07.589> a

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
home in Worcester Massachusetts at a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.060 
home in Worcester Massachusetts at a
dorm<00:00:07.950> at<00:00:08.130> WPI<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:09.090> so<00:00:10.080> basically<00:00:10.530> I've<00:00:10.860> got<00:00:10.889> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
dorm at WPI and so basically I've got a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.789 
dorm at WPI and so basically I've got a
quick<00:00:11.490> video<00:00:11.790> showing<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.780> little<00:00:13.110> ghetto

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799

solution<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.670> for<00:00:15.230> interfacing<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
solution I have for interfacing of the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.310 
solution I have for interfacing of the
Raspberry<00:00:16.740> Pi<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.789> over<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.080> have

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
Raspberry Pi because over here I have

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.529 
Raspberry Pi because over here I have
the<00:00:19.500> PI<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.310> no<00:00:20.550> keyboard<00:00:20.820> no<00:00:21.119> mouse

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the PI but I have no keyboard no mouse

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.070 
the PI but I have no keyboard no mouse
no<00:00:22.130> external<00:00:23.130> display<00:00:23.550> no<00:00:24.060> way<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> find<00:00:24.720> no

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
no external display no way to find no

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.540 
no external display no way to find no
basically<00:00:25.470> no<00:00:25.650> way<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> find<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
basically no way to find out the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.179 
basically no way to find out the
ethernet<00:00:27.359> address<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.840> SSH<00:00:28.289> into<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.680> so

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
ethernet address so I can SSH into it so

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.460 
ethernet address so I can SSH into it so
but<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.480> an<00:00:31.050> easy<00:00:31.230> cap

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
but what I do have is an easy cap

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
but what I do have is an easy cap

the input on there

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.959 
the input on there
I've<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> 5<00:00:43.320> volt<00:00:43.590> phone<00:00:43.980> charger<00:00:44.430> right

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
I've got the 5 volt phone charger right

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.779 
I've got the 5 volt phone charger right
there<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.719> pie<00:00:45.899> itself<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.590> also<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.760> I

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
there and the pie itself but also what I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.940 
there and the pie itself but also what I
brought<00:00:48.090> was<00:00:48.420> an<00:00:48.600> Arduino<00:00:49.020> micro<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.770> my

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
brought was an Arduino micro and it's my

board<00:00:54.570> easily<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.620> really

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
board easily because it's really

breadboard<00:00:56.190> friendly<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:57.000> very

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
breadboard friendly and is very very

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000 
breadboard friendly and is very very
fast<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> lot<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.530> stuff<00:00:58.829> with

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
fast and it can do a lot of stuff with

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
fast and it can do a lot of stuff with
the<00:00:59.129> very<00:00:59.940> advanced<00:01:00.390> Atmel<00:01:00.719> chip<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> so

the very advanced Atmel chip on it so

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.900 
the very advanced Atmel chip on it so
basically<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.340> I've<00:01:02.430> done<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> I've<00:01:02.879> written

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
basically what I've done is I've written

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.090 
basically what I've done is I've written
a<00:01:03.149> program<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.989> stole<00:01:04.530> its<00:01:04.680> key<00:01:04.860> press

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
a program that stole its key press

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.500 
a program that stole its key press
events<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.610> makes<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> thing<00:01:06.090> behave<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
events and makes the thing behave as a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.120 
events and makes the thing behave as a
keyboard<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.650> see<00:01:07.770> I've<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
keyboard so you can see I've got the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.109 
keyboard so you can see I've got the
four<00:01:08.400> buttons<00:01:08.850> over<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.040> kept<00:01:11.970> my

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
four buttons over here so I kept my

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
four buttons over here so I kept my
students<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.990> now<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.380> there's<00:01:13.590> button

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
students so right now see there's button

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.780 
students so right now see there's button
one<00:01:14.100> being<00:01:14.369> pressed<00:01:15.439> or<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.070> release<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
one being pressed or you can release it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.399 
one being pressed or you can release it
but<00:01:18.000> basically<00:01:18.210> there's<00:01:18.689> four<00:01:19.020> key<00:01:19.200> press

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
but basically there's four key press

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.210 
but basically there's four key press
events<00:01:22.070> for<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.150> they<00:01:24.780> add<00:01:24.930> their<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
events for and so they add their the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
events for and so they add their the
debugger<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.970> basically<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> need<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
debugger but basically so I need to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.109 
debugger but basically so I need to
enter<00:01:28.680> four<00:01:29.040> commands<00:01:29.400> into<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.700> pot<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> need

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
enter four commands into the pot I need

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.859 
enter four commands into the pot I need
to<00:01:30.180> enter<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.900> username<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.710> password<00:01:32.869> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
to enter the username the password the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.340 
to enter the username the password the
command<00:01:34.500> ifconfig<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.610> enter<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.049> basically

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
command ifconfig and enter so basically

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.480 
command ifconfig and enter so basically
that's<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:37.979> I've<00:01:38.070> username

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that's what I have so I've username

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.080 
that's what I have so I've username
password<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.540> conflict<00:01:39.900> enter<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:41.090> over

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
password I have conflict enter all over

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
password I have conflict enter all over
there<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.979> I'll<00:01:43.979> show<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> working<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.890> press

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
there so I'll show you working so press

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
there so I'll show you working so press
the<00:01:47.159> first<00:01:47.369> button<00:01:47.520> try<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.570> in

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the first button try to get this all in

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.039 
the first button try to get this all in
frame<00:01:49.159> well<00:01:50.159> press<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.970> first<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.869> going

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
frame well press the first just going

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.320 
frame well press the first just going
out<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.259> focus<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.920> no<00:01:53.040> reason<00:01:54.259> but

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.240 

so<00:01:59.330> it's<00:01:59.450> not<00:01:59.630> focusing<00:02:00.140> as<00:02:00.440> always<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.040> need<00:02:01.190> a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
so it's not focusing as always I need a

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.560 
so it's not focusing as always I need a
new<00:02:01.400> camera<00:02:01.640> if<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.330> have<00:02:02.420> any

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
new camera if you have any
