better and these components are focus

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.769 
better and these components are focus
and<00:00:17.080> intensity<00:00:18.039> when<00:00:18.970> I<00:00:18.999> watch<00:00:19.300> the<00:00:19.539> top

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
and intensity when I watch the top

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.419 
and intensity when I watch the top
players<00:00:20.050> in<00:00:20.169> the<00:00:20.320> world<00:00:20.409> practice<00:00:21.039> in<00:00:21.130> Indian

Wells<00:00:22.050> last<00:00:23.050> year<00:00:23.349> I<00:00:23.619> saw<00:00:23.939> an<00:00:24.939> incredible

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
Wells last year I saw an incredible

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.499 
Wells last year I saw an incredible
amount<00:00:26.109> of<00:00:26.259> focus<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.009> intensity<00:00:27.819> and<00:00:28.149> I<00:00:28.210> see

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
amount of focus and intensity and I see

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.509 
amount of focus and intensity and I see
that<00:00:28.689> lacking<00:00:29.289> a<00:00:29.409> lot<00:00:29.560> of<00:00:29.619> times<00:00:29.919> with<00:00:30.130> junior

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
that lacking a lot of times with junior

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.639 
that lacking a lot of times with junior
players<00:00:30.849> as<00:00:31.239> well<00:00:31.269> as<00:00:31.749> adult<00:00:32.349> recreational

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
players as well as adult recreational

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.060 
players as well as adult recreational
players<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.960> when<00:00:35.110> we<00:00:35.290> watch<00:00:35.500> somebody<00:00:35.860> like

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
players so when we watch somebody like

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.340 
players so when we watch somebody like
Nadal<00:00:36.400> practice<00:00:37.000> we<00:00:37.600> see<00:00:37.630> that<00:00:37.960> there<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.320> a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
Nadal practice we see that there is a

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.010 
Nadal practice we see that there is a
very<00:00:38.740> high<00:00:39.010> level<00:00:39.370> of<00:00:39.490> intensity<00:00:40.060> close<00:00:40.840> to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
very high level of intensity close to

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.840 
very high level of intensity close to
what<00:00:41.170> he<00:00:41.260> has<00:00:41.440> in<00:00:41.680> matches<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.430> there's<00:00:42.580> also

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
what he has in matches and there's also

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.020 
what he has in matches and there's also
a<00:00:43.000> very<00:00:43.480> high<00:00:43.960> level<00:00:44.560> of<00:00:44.680> focus<00:00:45.010> so<00:00:45.820> he's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
a very high level of focus so he's

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.390 
a very high level of focus so he's
focused<00:00:46.510> on<00:00:46.600> every<00:00:47.080> single<00:00:47.440> shot<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.710> every

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
focused on every single shot and every

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.720 
focused on every single shot and every
single<00:00:48.820> shot<00:00:49.090> matters<00:00:49.630> a<00:00:49.660> lot<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.080> him<00:00:50.410> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
single shot matters a lot to him and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.950 
single shot matters a lot to him and
that<00:00:51.730> is<00:00:51.850> something<00:00:52.150> that<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.360> really<00:00:52.480> have

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
that is something that you really have

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.310 
that is something that you really have
to<00:00:53.290> learn<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.670> apply<00:00:55.600> in<00:00:55.660> your<00:00:55.900> practice

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
to learn and apply in your practice

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.080 
to learn and apply in your practice
sessions<00:00:56.650> if<00:00:56.800> you<00:00:56.920> want<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.250> improve<00:00:57.579> let's

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
sessions if you want to improve let's

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:16.380 
sessions if you want to improve let's
take<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.329> close<00:00:58.660> look<00:00:58.780> here

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.910 

so<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:17.570> clip<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.870> just<00:01:17.930> saw<00:01:18.170> Rafa<00:01:18.770> was

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
so in the clip you just saw Rafa was

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.850 
so in the clip you just saw Rafa was
just<00:01:19.220> hitting<00:01:19.610> balls<00:01:20.000> basically<00:01:20.590> he<00:01:21.590> was<00:01:21.680> not

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
just hitting balls basically he was not

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.470 
just hitting balls basically he was not
playing<00:01:22.130> points<00:01:22.640> he<00:01:22.760> was<00:01:22.880> not<00:01:23.060> doing<00:01:23.300> a

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
playing points he was not doing a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.080 
playing points he was not doing a
specific<00:01:23.750> drill<00:01:24.410> this<00:01:25.130> was<00:01:25.340> relatively<00:01:25.850> early

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
specific drill this was relatively early

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.960 
specific drill this was relatively early
in<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:26.690> practice<00:01:27.170> sessions<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:27.950> he<00:01:28.820> was

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
in the practice sessions and he was

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.780 
in the practice sessions and he was
hitting<00:01:29.180> balls<00:01:29.620> almost<00:01:30.620> only<00:01:31.550> down<00:01:31.760> the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
hitting balls almost only down the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.540 
hitting balls almost only down the
middle<00:01:32.180> with<00:01:32.420> his<00:01:32.600> practice<00:01:32.990> partner<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.860> the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
middle with his practice partner and the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.640 
middle with his practice partner and the
amount<00:01:34.820> of<00:01:34.940> focus<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.660> intensity<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.410> just

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
amount of focus and intensity is just

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.950 
amount of focus and intensity is just
incredible<00:01:37.270> let's<00:01:38.270> take<00:01:38.480> a<00:01:38.510> look<00:01:38.750> at<00:01:38.870> another

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
incredible let's take a look at another

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:55.289 
incredible let's take a look at another
practice<00:01:39.650> clip<00:01:39.920> from<00:01:40.130> Rafa<00:01:40.550> here

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.060 

so<00:01:56.299> Rafa<00:01:56.659> is<00:01:56.720> really<00:01:57.049> focused<00:01:57.530> on<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.710> process

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
so Rafa is really focused on the process

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.969 
so Rafa is really focused on the process
of<00:01:58.520> hitting<00:01:59.000> every<00:01:59.270> single<00:01:59.630> shot<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.170> moving

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
of hitting every single shot and moving

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.430 
of hitting every single shot and moving
in<00:02:01.100> between<00:02:01.540> possibly<00:02:02.540> he's<00:02:02.720> working<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.229> some

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
in between possibly he's working on some

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.440 
in between possibly he's working on some
minor<00:02:03.680> technical<00:02:04.280> things<00:02:04.640> but<00:02:05.360> he's

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
minor technical things but he's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.840 
minor technical things but he's
definitely<00:02:05.600> focusing<00:02:06.320> on<00:02:06.500> his<00:02:06.650> footwork<00:02:07.580> and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
definitely focusing on his footwork and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.410 
definitely focusing on his footwork and
his<00:02:07.970> intensity<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.550> main<00:02:10.700> point<00:02:11.000> here<00:02:11.090> is

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
his intensity so the main point here is

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.110 
his intensity so the main point here is
that<00:02:11.450> Rafa<00:02:11.989> is<00:02:12.020> not<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:12.590> hitting<00:02:12.830> balls<00:02:13.190> he's

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
that Rafa is not just hitting balls he's

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.020 
that Rafa is not just hitting balls he's
totally<00:02:14.480> focused<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:15.319> whatever<00:02:16.040> he's<00:02:16.550> working

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
totally focused on whatever he's working

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.420 
totally focused on whatever he's working
on<00:02:17.180> at<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.569> moment<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:18.319> he's<00:02:18.530> focused<00:02:19.340> on

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
on at the moment and he's focused on

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.690 
on at the moment and he's focused on
every<00:02:19.910> single<00:02:20.150> shot<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:22.280> let's<00:02:22.520> take<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
every single shot so now let's take a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.610 
every single shot so now let's take a
look<00:02:22.910> at<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.180> practice<00:02:23.630> clip<00:02:23.900> from<00:02:24.140> Caroline

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
look at a practice clip from Caroline

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.490 
look at a practice clip from Caroline

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
Wozniacki former world number one now

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.310 
Wozniacki former world number one now
Wozniacki<00:02:28.160> does<00:02:28.340> not<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:29.269> very<00:02:29.780> big<00:02:30.080> game

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
Wozniacki does not have a very big game

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.740 
Wozniacki does not have a very big game
she<00:02:30.680> doesn't<00:02:30.950> have<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.220> best<00:02:31.370> technique<00:02:31.850> but

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
she doesn't have the best technique but

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.290 
she doesn't have the best technique but
she<00:02:32.900> became<00:02:33.230> number<00:02:33.470> one<00:02:33.709> in<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.950> world<00:02:34.300> by

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
she became number one in the world by

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.870 
she became number one in the world by
being<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.690> tough<00:02:35.959> competitor<00:02:36.709> she<00:02:37.250> practices

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
being a tough competitor she practices

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.610 
being a tough competitor she practices
with<00:02:38.060> high<00:02:38.330> intensity<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.110> she<00:02:39.230> has<00:02:39.410> great

focus<00:02:40.310> on<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.670> court<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.300> let's<00:02:41.480> take<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> look

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.860 

so<00:03:07.070> as<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.340> can<00:03:07.460> see<00:03:07.520> Caroline<00:03:08.210> also<00:03:08.630> has<00:03:08.840> a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.410 
so as you can see Caroline also has a
very<00:03:09.380> high<00:03:09.620> level<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:10.100> focus<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.760> intensity

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
in her practice sessions so the question

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.800 
in her practice sessions so the question
