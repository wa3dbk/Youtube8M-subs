point I know that after going to sit Rep

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.660 
point I know that after going to sit Rep
and<00:00:51.000> look<00:00:51.149> at<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> map<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.160> was<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and look at the map and was not a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.779 
and look at the map and was not a
starter<00:00:54.539> game<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.590> course<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.489> deploy

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
starter game of course if you deploy

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.910 
starter game of course if you deploy
your<00:00:56.940> artillery<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.379> doesn't<00:00:58.649> matter<00:00:58.829> which

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
your artillery it doesn't matter which

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.130 
your artillery it doesn't matter which
faction<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.699> attacking<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.899> can

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
faction you are attacking you can

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.100 
faction you are attacking you can
immediately<00:01:02.149> force<00:01:03.149> attack<00:01:03.570> them<00:01:04.189> that<00:01:05.189> first

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
immediately force attack them that first

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.440 
immediately force attack them that first
barricade<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.350> front<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> middle<00:01:08.369> map<00:01:08.580> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
barricade in front of the middle map you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.899 
barricade in front of the middle map you
can<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.560> basically<00:01:10.799> force<00:01:11.340> attack<00:01:11.670> them

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
can you can basically force attack them

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.910 
can you can basically force attack them
and<00:01:12.090> then<00:01:12.360> point<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> location<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and then point to the location on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
and then point to the location on the
map<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.850> basically<00:01:15.150> somewhere<00:01:15.630> in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
map which is basically somewhere in

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960 
map which is basically somewhere in
front<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.799> bridge<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.759> just

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
front of that bridge and you can just

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.710 
front of that bridge and you can just
randomly<00:01:18.830> strike<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.070> area<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.030> easier<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
randomly strike that area it's easier to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.109 
randomly strike that area it's easier to
destroy<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.170> barricade<00:01:23.009> instead<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> read

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
destroy that barricade instead to read

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.310 
destroy that barricade instead to read
instead<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.320> wreck<00:01:25.619> attack<00:01:26.630> one<00:01:27.630> beer<00:01:28.080> key

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
instead of the wreck attack one beer key

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.670 
instead of the wreck attack one beer key
if<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.860> generalize<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.460> tap<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.500> on

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
if you generalize and tap that little on

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.399 
if you generalize and tap that little on
the<00:01:31.740> ground<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.299> basically<00:01:33.659> destroy<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the ground you can basically destroy a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.560 
the ground you can basically destroy a
whole<00:01:34.680> bunch<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.420> barricade<00:01:36.420> art<00:01:36.780> ones<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:38.570> you
