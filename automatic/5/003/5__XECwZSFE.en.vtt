 In addition to its great beauty, San Sebastian is a very reassuring place, you can live here really pleasantly. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.021
 This is Ondaretta beach, and the La Concha beach. 

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:35.015
 Me and my sons Xabi and Mikel Alonso came here from Barcelona when they were about eight years old. 

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:40.007
 At school they started playing football on the beach. 

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:47.015
 Here it is very typical. They played in the beach championship at La Concha and then went to Antigua. 

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:58.014
 Antigua was founded in 1982 in a small area of ​​Antiguo that belongs to San Sebastián. 

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:06.010
 Part of our work is to keep track of players from a young age and in their development, 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.010
 so that some get to the First Division. 

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:20.004
 Xabi Alonso was very small, very capable and shot very well, which he remained. 

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:26.013
 Walking to play on the beach is great for developing young players. 

00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:35.020
 It helps the development of physical strength as well as the development of gaming skills. Most Beach Helps Develop Coordination 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.000
 how to walk and how to move, which is important in football. 

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:49.000
 Kids carry goals, measure the pitch, draw lines. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.017
 It is played in all weather conditions. That makes them good guys. 

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:58.020
 We hope to have more Alonso and Arten from the beach in the future.
