the<00:03:39.260> crap<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:41.330> not<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.660> most<00:03:41.810> maneuverable

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
the crap it's not the most maneuverable

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.260 
the crap it's not the most maneuverable
thing<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.830> not<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.040> fucking<00:03:43.489> car<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.970> has<00:03:44.060> so

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
thing is not a fucking car it has so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.150 
thing is not a fucking car it has so
much<00:03:44.390> firepower<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.739> you'd<00:03:45.890> be

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
much firepower to it that you'd be

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.250 
much firepower to it that you'd be
ridiculous<00:03:46.730> just<00:03:46.940> run<00:03:47.209> around<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.720> map<00:03:47.870> it's

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
ridiculous just run around the map it's

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.229 
ridiculous just run around the map it's
a<00:03:48.349> sec<00:03:48.560> essentially<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:49.550> a<00:03:49.640> turret<00:03:50.030> that

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
a sec essentially it's a turret that

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.940 
a sec essentially it's a turret that
moves<00:03:50.480> slowly<00:03:50.750> run<00:03:51.020> exactly<00:03:51.530> that's<00:03:51.650> all<00:03:51.800> you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
moves slowly run exactly that's all you

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.380 
moves slowly run exactly that's all you
need<00:03:52.069> to<00:03:52.220> know<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.489> should<00:03:52.700> be<00:03:52.819> on<00:03:52.940> Rails<00:03:53.180> that

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
need to know it should be on Rails that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.000 
need to know it should be on Rails that
is<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.720> right<00:03:53.870> gameplay<00:03:54.380> decision<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:54.890> make

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
is the right gameplay decision to make

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.110 
is the right gameplay decision to make
and<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.280> think<00:03:55.459> they<00:03:55.520> move<00:03:55.760> that<00:03:55.910> in<00:03:56.000> that

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
and I think they move that in that

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.910 
and I think they move that in that
trailer<00:03:56.360> now<00:03:56.540> look<00:03:56.720> when<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:56.900> get<00:03:57.050> in<00:03:57.170> one<00:03:57.200> you

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
trailer now look when you get in one you

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.080 
trailer now look when you get in one you
know<00:03:58.069> your<00:03:58.220> positives<00:03:58.640> are<00:03:58.819> you<00:03:58.940> have

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
know your positives are you have

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.880 
know your positives are you have
incredible<00:03:59.360> firepower<00:03:59.780> your<00:04:00.290> negatives<00:04:00.709> are

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
incredible firepower your negatives are

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.240 
incredible firepower your negatives are
your<00:04:01.420> extremely<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:03.019> know<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.410> prone<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:04.069> fire

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
your extremely you know a prone to fire

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.040 
your extremely you know a prone to fire
because<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:05.420> know<00:04:05.540> your<00:04:05.660> animal<00:04:05.959> of
