casinopolisbort choose you got earlier
this<00:03:24.570> stage<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:25.079> fun<00:03:25.380> but<00:03:25.680> collecting<00:03:26.190> rings

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
this stage is fun but collecting rings

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.370 
this stage is fun but collecting rings
to<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.970> Emerald<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.480> too<00:03:27.750> much<00:03:27.900> like<00:03:28.140> hard

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
to get the Emerald is too much like hard

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.259 
to get the Emerald is too much like hard
work<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:29.040> here's<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.340> neat<00:03:29.640> trick

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
work so here's a neat trick

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.120 
work so here's a neat trick
you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.660> spin<00:03:30.989> -<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.440> jump<00:03:31.680> at<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.890> last

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
you can spin - and jump at the last

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.039 
you can spin - and jump at the last
second<00:03:32.670> through<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.150> part<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.600> wall<00:03:33.750> and

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
second through this part of the wall and

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.050 
second through this part of the wall and
land<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.470> these<00:03:34.709> coins<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.549> below<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
land on these coins just below the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.479 
land on these coins just below the
emeralds<00:03:36.540> room<00:03:36.750> by<00:03:37.109> charging<00:03:37.590> another<00:03:37.890> -<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
emeralds room by charging another - and

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.580 
emeralds room by charging another - and
jumping<00:03:38.880> again<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.329> can<00:03:39.450> get<00:03:39.600> some<00:03:39.810> air<00:03:40.079> then

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
jumping again you can get some air then

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.349 
jumping again you can get some air then
guide<00:03:40.829> Sonic<00:03:41.220> back<00:03:41.489> through<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.910> wall<00:03:42.090> and

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
guide Sonic back through the wall and

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.729 
guide Sonic back through the wall and
then<00:03:42.480> straight<00:03:42.780> up<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.200> platform<00:03:43.410> with

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
then straight up to the platform with

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.530 
then straight up to the platform with
the<00:03:43.829> Emerald<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.700> be<00:03:44.790> difficult<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.299> land

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
the Emerald it can be difficult to land

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.599 
the Emerald it can be difficult to land
on<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.900> coins<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.440> certain<00:03:46.799> parts<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.340> kill

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
on the coins and certain parts have kill

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.569 
on the coins and certain parts have kill
planes<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.390> be<00:03:48.569> careful<00:03:49.109> also<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.980> camera<00:03:50.310> can

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
planes so be careful also the camera can

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.490 
planes so be careful also the camera can
get<00:03:50.760> stuck<00:03:51.120> making<00:03:51.569> it<00:03:51.660> hard<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.989> see<00:03:52.230> where<00:03:52.470> to

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
get stuck making it hard to see where to

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.229 
get stuck making it hard to see where to
line<00:03:52.769> up<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.010> trickiest<00:03:53.400> part<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.970> jump

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
line up the trickiest part the jump

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.670 
line up the trickiest part the jump
through<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.690> wall<00:03:54.870> which<00:03:55.109> does<00:03:55.319> require<00:03:55.440> some

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
through the wall which does require some

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.099 
through the wall which does require some
tough<00:03:56.100> negotiating<00:03:56.910> but<00:03:57.209> overall<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:57.959> a

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
tough negotiating but overall this is a

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.259 
tough negotiating but overall this is a
neat<00:03:58.410> trick<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:59.069> should<00:03:59.489> note<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.730> beating

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
neat trick I should note that beating

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.180 
neat trick I should note that beating
stages<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.930> wrong<00:04:01.109> order<00:04:01.410> won't<00:04:01.829> skip

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
stages in the wrong order won't skip

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.009 
stages in the wrong order won't skip
parts<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> game<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.329> is<00:04:03.359> pretty<00:04:03.720> cool

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
parts of the game but it is pretty cool

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.110 
parts of the game but it is pretty cool
to<00:04:04.200> get<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.380> stages<00:04:04.889> early<00:04:05.100> for<00:04:05.700> instance
