00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
basically burlap pots and this stuff I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.639 
basically burlap pots and this stuff I
don't<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> but

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.459 
don't know if you can see it but
basically<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.879> just<00:00:59.940> rips<00:01:00.449> off<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.960> basically

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
basically it just rips off and basically

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.799 
basically it just rips off and basically
this<00:01:01.770> stuff<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.550> break<00:01:02.730> down<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this stuff is going to break down in the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.410 
this stuff is going to break down in the
soil<00:01:04.350> over<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> summertime<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
soil over the summertime and in the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.969 
soil over the summertime and in the
winter<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> mean<00:01:06.990> basically<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.590> turns<00:01:07.799> into

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
winter I mean basically it turns into

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.060 
winter I mean basically it turns into
fertilizer<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.909> next<00:01:09.330> year's<00:01:09.600> plans<00:01:10.070> after

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
fertilizer for next year's plans after

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.200 
fertilizer for next year's plans after
you<00:01:11.159> plant<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> pond<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.090> just

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you plant the pond in it you just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
you plant the pond in it you just
basically<00:01:12.390> cut<00:01:12.750> some<00:01:12.900> holes<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> bottom

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
basically cut some holes in the bottom

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.399 
basically cut some holes in the bottom
and<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.250> plant<00:01:14.490> grows<00:01:14.700> through<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.509> pot<00:01:15.720> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and the plant grows through the pot so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
and the plant grows through the pot so
