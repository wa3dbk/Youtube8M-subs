this image in an anchor tag we'll

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.679 
this image in an anchor tag we'll
pretend<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.920> we<00:02:06.070> want<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:07.060> user<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.420> be<00:02:07.570> able

thumbnail

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.460 

the<00:02:18.709> thumbnail<00:02:19.129> class<00:02:19.489> quickly<00:02:20.260> formats<00:02:21.260> the

the thumbnail class quickly formats the

the thumbnail class quickly formats the
image<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.610> makes<00:02:22.879> it<00:02:23.060> look<00:02:23.269> like<00:02:23.599> a<00:02:23.930> thumbnail

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
image and makes it look like a thumbnail

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.309 
image and makes it look like a thumbnail
by<00:02:25.190> putting<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.879> border<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.750> some<00:02:27.019> space

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
by putting a border and some space

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.339 
by putting a border and some space
around<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.950> here's<00:02:28.519> what<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.849> looks<00:02:29.060> like<00:02:29.349> now

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
around it here's what it looks like now

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.100 
around it here's what it looks like now
this<00:02:30.739> isn't<00:02:31.099> very<00:02:31.280> good<00:02:31.480> although<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.629> do<00:02:32.780> get<00:02:33.049> a

this isn't very good although I do get a
hover<00:02:33.440> effect<00:02:33.950> when<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.400> move<00:02:34.670> over<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:35.090> image
