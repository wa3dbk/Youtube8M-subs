5 this would be a tutorial about city

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.450 
5 this would be a tutorial about city
placement<00:00:09.679> okay<00:00:10.679> now<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.920> first<00:00:10.950> thing<00:00:11.280> we're

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
placement okay now the first thing we're

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.330 
placement okay now the first thing we're
gonna<00:00:11.550> discuss<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.860> what<00:00:13.860> happens<00:00:14.190> when

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
gonna discuss here is what happens when

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340 
gonna discuss here is what happens when
you<00:00:14.460> actually<00:00:14.639> settle<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> city<00:00:15.509> now<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> city

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
you actually settle a city now a city

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.990 
you actually settle a city now a city
can<00:00:16.619> only<00:00:16.650> work<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.130> certain<00:00:17.460> amount<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.760> tiles

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
can only work a certain amount of tiles

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.599 
can only work a certain amount of tiles
outside<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.920> area<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.310> you've<00:00:20.400> set

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
outside of the area that you've set

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.630 
outside of the area that you've set
alone<00:00:21.140> so<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.619> set<00:00:22.859> already<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.460> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
alone so as I set already here if I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.790 
alone so as I set already here if I
bring<00:00:23.789> up<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> grid<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.570> see<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> can

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
bring up the grid you can see that I can

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.160 
bring up the grid you can see that I can
work<00:00:25.920> any<00:00:26.189> tiles<00:00:26.490> inside<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.779> city's

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
work any tiles inside this city's

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.759 
work any tiles inside this city's
borders

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
borders

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.099 
borders
now<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.849> expand<00:00:30.269> out<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> three

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
now this can expand out up to three

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.700 
now this can expand out up to three
spots<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:32.070> two<00:00:32.579> three<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.630> means<00:00:33.899> any<00:00:34.260> three

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
spots one two three that means any three

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
spots one two three that means any three
spots<00:00:35.100> surrounding<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> city<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.239> work

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
spots surrounding the city I can work

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.010 
spots surrounding the city I can work
for<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> city<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.700> city<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.180> expand<00:00:39.690> beyond

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
for the city the city can expand beyond

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.569 
for the city the city can expand beyond
those<00:00:40.170> three<00:00:40.379> spots<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.219> only<00:00:41.340> work

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
those three spots but you can only work

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.720 
those three spots but you can only work
three<00:00:41.879> spots<00:00:42.440> surrounding<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> city<00:00:43.770> not

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
three spots surrounding the city not

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.270 
three spots surrounding the city not
sure<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> goes<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.510> diagonal<00:00:46.219> but<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
sure how it goes on that diagonal but I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.000 
sure how it goes on that diagonal but I
know<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:48.149> two<00:00:48.660> three<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> work<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.890> two

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
know one two three you can work out two

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.560 
know one two three you can work out two
here<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.219> probably<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:53.420> here<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
here so probably here here here here and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.250 
here so probably here here here here and
it<00:00:55.140> keeps<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.559> around<00:00:56.840> okay<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.079> first

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it keeps going around okay the first

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.090 
it keeps going around okay the first
thing<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.590> look<00:00:58.800> for

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
thing you look for

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
thing you look for
anytime<00:00:59.579> I'm<00:00:59.670> building<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> new<00:01:00.059> city<00:01:00.449> is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
anytime I'm building a new city is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.799 
anytime I'm building a new city is
access<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> fresh<00:01:02.039> water<00:01:02.329> it's<00:01:03.329> eat<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.600> our

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
access to fresh water it's eat about our

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.690 
access to fresh water it's eat about our
luxury<00:01:04.199> resource<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.369> sake<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
luxury resource but for the sake of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.100 
luxury resource but for the sake of
argument<00:01:05.970> we'll<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> access

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
argument we'll just go with the access

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380 
argument we'll just go with the access
to<00:01:07.229> fresh<00:01:07.439> water<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.760> reason<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to fresh water and the reason for that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
to fresh water and the reason for that
is<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:09.659> simple<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.369> look<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
is very simple if you look in the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.950 
is very simple if you look in the
technology<00:01:12.330> tree<00:01:12.950> civil<00:01:13.950> service<00:01:14.659> food<00:01:15.659> from

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
technology tree civil service food from

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
technology tree civil service food from
farms<00:01:16.380> increased<00:01:16.860> by<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.490> tiles<00:01:17.790> with

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
farms increased by one on all tiles with

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420 
farms increased by one on all tiles with
an<00:01:18.119> access<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> fresh<00:01:18.780> water<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.740> goes<00:01:20.009> for

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
an access to fresh water that goes for

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.980 
an access to fresh water that goes for
rivers<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> lakes<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.330> on<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.570> side

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
rivers and lakes and on a little side

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
rivers and lakes and on a little side
note<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.619> look<00:01:25.830> down<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.070> fertilizer

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
note if you look down here fertilizer

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.149 
note if you look down here fertilizer
it's<00:01:27.330> much<00:01:27.750> farther<00:01:28.200> into<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.740> technology

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it's much farther into your technology

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.030 
it's much farther into your technology
tree<00:01:29.689> food<00:01:30.689> from<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> farm<00:01:31.290> increased<00:01:31.650> by<00:01:31.799> one

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
tree food from the farm increased by one

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
tree food from the farm increased by one
and<00:01:32.189> all<00:01:32.280> times<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.790> no<00:01:33.000> access<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.420> fresh

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
and all times with no access to fresh
water<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.560> by<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> time<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
water so by the time you get the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.510 
water so by the time you get the
fertilizer<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:37.110> rivers<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.680> lakes<00:01:37.740> aren't

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
fertilizer the rivers and lakes aren't

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.810 
fertilizer the rivers and lakes aren't
as<00:01:38.670> important<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.869> you'll<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:41.009> civil

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
as important but you'll get civil

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.870 
as important but you'll get civil
service<00:01:42.150> way<00:01:42.420> before<00:01:42.810> you'll<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.110> fertilizer

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
service way before you'll get fertilizer

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.850 
service way before you'll get fertilizer
one<00:01:44.880> other<00:01:45.030> nice<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.479> about<00:01:45.509> building<00:01:46.200> next

to<00:03:44.639> take<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.239> city<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.930> lot<00:03:46.109> easier

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
to take the city and it's a lot easier

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.949

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.270 
to defend that type of city one last
thing<00:03:49.139> you<00:03:49.199> want<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.470> look<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:49.799> when<00:03:49.949> setting

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280

thing you want to look for when setting
the<00:03:50.370> city<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.879> I<00:03:51.120> don't<00:03:51.180> generally<00:03:51.540> think

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
the city and I don't generally think

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.869 
the city and I don't generally think
about<00:03:52.379> this<00:03:52.590> because<00:03:53.250> these<00:03:53.430> are<00:03:53.609> pretty<00:03:53.760> rare

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
about this because these are pretty rare

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.000 
about this because these are pretty rare
and<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.930> know<00:03:55.049> it's<00:03:55.230> rare<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.709> will<00:03:55.859> get

and you know it's rare that I will get

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.460 
and you know it's rare that I will get
one<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.790> an<00:03:56.970> area<00:03:57.269> where<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.629> can<00:03:57.900> settle<00:03:58.169> a<00:03:58.260> city

one in an area where I can settle a city
on<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.160> if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.310> can<00:03:59.430> get<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> city<00:03:59.819> with<00:03:59.970> a

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
third city here now this city doesn't

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.740 
have any access to any luxury resources

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
it also has high value tiles you got one

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.510 
it also has high value tiles you got one
they<00:05:12.920> can<00:05:13.130> reach<00:05:13.310> here<00:05:13.580> too<00:05:14.320> this<00:05:15.320> is<00:05:15.520> three

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
they can reach here too this is three

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.240 
they can reach here too this is three
four<00:05:17.150> I<00:05:17.180> mean<00:05:17.510> this<00:05:18.350> is<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.560> great<00:05:18.800> spot<00:05:19.010> for<00:05:19.070> a

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
four I mean this is a great spot for a

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.000 
four I mean this is a great spot for a
city<00:05:19.460> even<00:05:20.180> without<00:05:20.660> access<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.590> a<00:05:21.620> luxury

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
city even without access to a luxury

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.830 
city even without access to a luxury
versus<00:05:22.340> resource<00:05:22.820> is<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:22.970> great<00:05:23.210> spot<00:05:23.510> it<00:05:23.690> also

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
versus resource is a great spot it also

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.840 
versus resource is a great spot it also
doesn't<00:05:24.140> have<00:05:24.320> much<00:05:24.530> access<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:24.920> the<00:05:25.280> fresh

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
doesn't have much access to the fresh

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.280 
doesn't have much access to the fresh
water<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.360> think<00:05:26.660> you<00:05:26.720> could<00:05:26.840> build<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.080> farm

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
water I think you could build the farm

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.540 
water I think you could build the farm
no<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.710> can't<00:05:27.890> even<00:05:28.040> build<00:05:28.130> a<00:05:28.220> farm<00:05:28.430> here

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
no it can't even build a farm here

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.950 
no it can't even build a farm here
because<00:05:28.700> that's<00:05:28.850> sheep<00:05:29.120> so<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.810> really

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
because that's sheep so it really

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.780 
because that's sheep so it really
doesn't<00:05:30.170> even<00:05:30.350> have<00:05:30.770> access<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.280> a<00:05:31.310> river<00:05:31.580> but

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
doesn't even have access to a river but

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.190 
doesn't even have access to a river but
the<00:05:31.880> fact<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.150> matters<00:05:32.540> this<00:05:32.750> is<00:05:32.930> such<00:05:33.050> an

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
the fact that matters this is such an

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.780 
the fact that matters this is such an
incredible<00:05:33.590> spot<00:05:33.920> you<00:05:34.370> just<00:05:34.400> got<00:05:34.700> to<00:05:34.790> take<00:05:34.910> it

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
incredible spot you just got to take it

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.850 
incredible spot you just got to take it
okay<00:05:37.790> now<00:05:38.300> I<00:05:38.330> have<00:05:38.450> my<00:05:38.720> three<00:05:38.990> City<00:05:39.230> set<00:05:39.530> up<00:05:39.650> and

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
okay now I have my three City set up and

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.410 
okay now I have my three City set up and
I'm<00:05:39.950> just<00:05:40.160> going<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:40.430> go<00:05:40.670> along<00:05:40.910> and<00:05:41.090> show<00:05:41.360> you

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
I'm just going to go along and show you

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.330 
I'm just going to go along and show you
the<00:05:41.930> spots<00:05:42.230> I'm<00:05:42.410> thinking<00:05:42.770> about<00:05:42.860> making<00:05:43.190> my

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
the spots I'm thinking about making my

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.240 
the spots I'm thinking about making my
other<00:05:43.610> cities<00:05:44.000> in<00:05:44.440> rule<00:05:45.440> of<00:05:45.560> thumb<00:05:45.800> for<00:05:45.830> me

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
other cities in rule of thumb for me

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.610 
other cities in rule of thumb for me
generally<00:05:46.880> is<00:05:47.030> follow<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.630> rivers<00:05:47.990> this

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
generally is follow the rivers this

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.110 
generally is follow the rivers this
would<00:05:48.830> probably<00:05:49.010> be<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.340> nice<00:05:49.550> spot<00:05:49.880> right<00:05:50.060> here

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
would probably be a nice spot right here

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.060 
would probably be a nice spot right here
I<00:05:50.600> probably<00:05:50.870> wouldn't<00:05:51.170> settle<00:05:51.440> in<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.740> forest

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
I probably wouldn't settle in the forest

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.610 
I probably wouldn't settle in the forest
I'd<00:05:52.190> probably<00:05:52.370> settled<00:05:52.790> maybe<00:05:52.940> right<00:05:53.210> here

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
I'd probably settled maybe right here

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.690 
I'd probably settled maybe right here
maybe<00:05:54.620> I<00:05:54.740> would<00:05:54.920> sell<00:05:55.100> in<00:05:55.220> the<00:05:55.310> forest<00:05:55.640> I

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
maybe I would sell in the forest I

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.070 
maybe I would sell in the forest I
generally<00:05:56.060> try<00:05:56.210> not<00:05:56.240> to<00:05:56.360> sell<00:05:56.600> in<00:05:56.720> the<00:05:56.750> forest

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
generally try not to sell in the forest

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.270 
generally try not to sell in the forest
because<00:05:57.230> I<00:05:57.290> like<00:05:57.500> to<00:05:57.620> build<00:05:57.740> lumber<00:05:58.070> mills

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
because I like to build lumber mills

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.330 
because I like to build lumber mills
which<00:05:59.150> increase<00:05:59.900> the<00:05:59.930> production<00:06:00.620> of<00:06:00.800> forest

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
which increase the production of forest

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.730 
which increase the production of forest
tiles<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:01.910> I<00:06:02.510> like<00:06:02.690> that<00:06:02.840> production<00:06:03.350> if<00:06:03.620> you

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
tiles and I like that production if you

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.990 
tiles and I like that production if you
settle<00:06:04.010> in<00:06:04.190> here<00:06:04.220> you<00:06:04.490> can't<00:06:04.700> build<00:06:04.910> the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
settle in here you can't build the

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.280 
settle in here you can't build the
lumber<00:06:05.240> mill<00:06:05.390> there<00:06:05.600> and<00:06:05.780> then<00:06:05.930> I<00:06:05.960> would<00:06:06.170> only

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
lumber mill there and then I would only

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.550 
lumber mill there and then I would only
have<00:06:06.470> this<00:06:06.650> production<00:06:07.100> production<00:06:07.880> tile

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
have this production production tile

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.510 
have this production production tile
although<00:06:09.560> I<00:06:09.590> would<00:06:09.770> have<00:06:09.800> these<00:06:10.040> two<00:06:10.220> up<00:06:10.340> here

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
although I would have these two up here

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.950 
although I would have these two up here
so<00:06:10.790> yeah<00:06:10.940> I<00:06:10.970> would<00:06:11.150> settle<00:06:11.420> somewhere<00:06:11.720> in<00:06:11.870> this

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
so yeah I would settle somewhere in this

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.400 
so yeah I would settle somewhere in this
area<00:06:12.850> yeah<00:06:13.850> that's<00:06:14.630> another<00:06:14.870> thing<00:06:15.080> I<00:06:15.169> wanted

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
area yeah that's another thing I wanted

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.550 
area yeah that's another thing I wanted
to<00:06:15.669> tell<00:06:16.669> you<00:06:16.730> guys<00:06:17.080> you're<00:06:18.080> gonna<00:06:18.169> have<00:06:18.440> the

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
to tell you guys you're gonna have the

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.070 
to tell you guys you're gonna have the
recommended<00:06:18.919> building<00:06:19.760> sites<00:06:20.270> places<00:06:20.960> where

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
recommended building sites places where

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.630 
recommended building sites places where
you<00:06:21.140> should<00:06:21.290> build<00:06:21.410> cities<00:06:21.770> and<00:06:21.919> you<00:06:22.550> know

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
you should build cities and you know

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.460 
you should build cities and you know
what<00:06:22.850> if<00:06:23.419> you<00:06:23.570> don't<00:06:23.660> want<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:23.900> think<00:06:24.110> about<00:06:24.200> it

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
what if you don't want to think about it

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.110 
what if you don't want to think about it
you<00:06:24.680> can<00:06:24.860> build<00:06:25.220> on<00:06:25.400> these<00:06:25.580> areas<00:06:25.940> they're

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
you can build on these areas they're

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.030 
you can build on these areas they're
usually<00:06:26.330> pretty<00:06:26.720> good<00:06:27.020> as<00:06:27.470> a<00:06:27.500> matter<00:06:27.710> of<00:06:27.770> fact

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
usually pretty good as a matter of fact

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.250 
usually pretty good as a matter of fact
a<00:06:28.220> couple<00:06:28.400> times<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:29.570> computer<00:06:29.930> was<00:06:30.050> telling

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
a couple times the computer was telling

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.840 
a couple times the computer was telling
me<00:06:30.320> to<00:06:30.410> build<00:06:30.590> on<00:06:30.740> an<00:06:30.830> area<00:06:31.100> and<00:06:31.220> I<00:06:31.310> didn't<00:06:31.669> and

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
me to build on an area and I didn't and

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.510 
me to build on an area and I didn't and
I<00:06:31.910> probably<00:06:32.240> should<00:06:32.660> have<00:06:32.810> the<00:06:33.620> computer<00:06:34.040> the

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
I probably should have the computer the

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
I probably should have the computer the
computer<00:06:34.640> is<00:06:34.910> pretty<00:06:35.090> good<00:06:35.240> with<00:06:35.360> that<00:06:35.480> you

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
computer is pretty good with that you

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.170 
computer is pretty good with that you
could<00:06:35.750> go<00:06:35.930> buy<00:06:36.080> that<00:06:36.230> if<00:06:36.380> you<00:06:36.500> want<00:06:36.710> to<00:06:37.180> got

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
could go buy that if you want to got

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.820 
could go buy that if you want to got
some<00:06:38.330> desert<00:06:38.660> down<00:06:38.780> here<00:06:39.050> obviously<00:06:39.470> I<00:06:39.530> will

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
some desert down here obviously I will

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.950 
some desert down here obviously I will
avoid<00:06:40.190> this<00:06:40.340> at<00:06:40.520> all<00:06:40.550> costs<00:06:40.760> I<00:06:41.450> will<00:06:41.720> probably

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
avoid this at all costs I will probably

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.520 
avoid this at all costs I will probably
build<00:06:42.290> a<00:06:42.380> city<00:06:42.620> here<00:06:42.980> and<00:06:43.070> then<00:06:43.760> a<00:06:43.970> city

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
build a city here and then a city

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.180 
build a city here and then a city
possibly<00:06:45.530> here<00:06:45.830> you<00:06:46.340> do<00:06:46.490> want<00:06:46.669> coastal<00:06:47.120> cities

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
possibly here you do want coastal cities

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.390 
possibly here you do want coastal cities
for<00:06:49.450> for<00:06:50.450> a<00:06:50.480> navy<00:06:50.720> and<00:06:50.990> also<00:06:51.740> coastal<00:06:52.190> cities

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
for for a navy and also coastal cities

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.470 
for for a navy and also coastal cities
are<00:06:52.520> really<00:06:52.610> good<00:06:52.850> obviously<00:06:53.210> because<00:06:53.360> you

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
are really good obviously because you

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.960 
are really good obviously because you
see<00:06:53.660> for<00:06:53.690> gold<00:06:54.140> and<00:06:54.440> gold<00:06:55.280> is<00:06:55.430> very<00:06:55.490> important

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
see for gold and gold is very important

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.370 
see for gold and gold is very important
in<00:06:56.060> this<00:06:56.120> game<00:06:56.240> especially<00:06:56.600> the<00:06:56.870> way<00:06:56.990> I<00:06:57.020> play<00:06:57.350> I

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
in this game especially the way I play I

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.650 
in this game especially the way I play I
need<00:06:57.710> gold<00:06:57.950> I<00:06:58.160> spend<00:06:58.970> a<00:06:59.030> lot<00:06:59.060> of<00:06:59.180> gold

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
need gold I spend a lot of gold

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.420 
need gold I spend a lot of gold
so<00:06:59.870> coastal<00:07:00.320> cities<00:07:00.560> are<00:07:00.650> good<00:07:00.770> for<00:07:00.950> gold<00:07:01.160> and

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
so coastal cities are good for gold and

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.780 
so coastal cities are good for gold and
your<00:07:02.240> Navy<00:07:02.710> probably<00:07:03.710> needed<00:07:03.980> Navy<00:07:04.160> at<00:07:04.430> some

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
your Navy probably needed Navy at some

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.600 
your Navy probably needed Navy at some
point

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
point

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.399 
point
then<00:07:07.210> I<00:07:07.419> will<00:07:07.569> probably<00:07:07.780> just<00:07:07.930> follow<00:07:08.259> this

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:08.409 
then I will probably just follow this

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:11.219 
then I will probably just follow this
river<00:07:08.979> I<00:07:09.009> still<00:07:09.729> have<00:07:09.879> Scout<00:07:10.120> over<00:07:10.270> here<00:07:10.689> but

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:11.229 
river I still have Scout over here but

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:13.290 
river I still have Scout over here but
I'll<00:07:11.889> probably<00:07:12.129> just<00:07:12.460> follow<00:07:12.610> this<00:07:12.789> river<00:07:13.030> and

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
I'll probably just follow this river and

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.459 
I'll probably just follow this river and
build<00:07:13.419> in<00:07:13.599> this<00:07:13.689> general<00:07:13.960> direction<00:07:14.080> this<00:07:14.379> is

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:14.469 
build in this general direction this is

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:16.469 
build in this general direction this is
this<00:07:15.099> is<00:07:15.250> pretty<00:07:15.430> good<00:07:15.639> land<00:07:15.879> it's<00:07:16.060> a<00:07:16.150> little

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
this is pretty good land it's a little

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.390 
this is pretty good land it's a little
light<00:07:16.629> on<00:07:16.780> the<00:07:16.900> production<00:07:17.409> but<00:07:17.860> if<00:07:18.099> I<00:07:18.340> could

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
light on the production but if I could

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.520 
light on the production but if I could
just<00:07:18.550> you<00:07:18.969> know<00:07:19.000> have<00:07:19.629> these<00:07:19.780> forests<00:07:20.319> in<00:07:20.469> the

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
just you know have these forests in the
