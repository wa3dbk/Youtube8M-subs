dry to the touch it's been a few few
days<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:23.720> want<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.780> scrape<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.170> down<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
days and I want to scrape this down and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.960 
days and I want to scrape this down and
then<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.850> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.180> glaze<00:00:27.690> and<00:00:28.020> scumble

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
then I'm going to glaze and scumble

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.419 
then I'm going to glaze and scumble
additional<00:00:29.970> colors<00:00:30.360> over<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> top<00:00:31.249> now<00:00:32.249> this

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:32.429 
additional colors over the top now this

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:36.500 
additional colors over the top now this
band<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.510> color<00:00:33.749> here<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.260> distant<00:00:34.739> Bluff<00:00:35.510> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
band of color here this distant Bluff is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.799 
band of color here this distant Bluff is
way<00:00:36.839> too<00:00:36.899> monotonous<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.859> mean<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.609> color<00:00:38.850> when

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
way too monotonous I mean the color when

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.709 
way too monotonous I mean the color when
it<00:00:39.929> shifts<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.679> slightly<00:00:41.370> shifts<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it shifts it is slightly shifts and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.319 
it shifts it is slightly shifts and
there's<00:00:43.530> no<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:44.010> feeling<00:00:44.429> of<00:00:44.550> texture<00:00:45.089> or

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
there's no really feeling of texture or

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.649 
there's no really feeling of texture or

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
believability in this particular section

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.709 
believability in this particular section
here<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.170> might<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.710> too<00:00:49.949> light

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
here this might be a little too light

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.079 
here this might be a little too light
this<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.109> a<00:00:52.319> part<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.249> Mount<00:00:53.519> of<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
this is a part of the Mount of the

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.029 
this is a part of the Mount of the
bluffs<00:00:54.359> it<00:00:54.600> starts<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> flatten<00:00:55.229> a<00:00:55.589> little<00:00:55.920> bit

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
bluffs it starts to flatten a little bit

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.000 
bluffs it starts to flatten a little bit
as<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.249> comes<00:00:56.460> into<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.850> water<00:00:57.120> area<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
as it comes into this water area and it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.180 
as it comes into this water area and it
should<00:00:59.249> be<00:00:59.399> picking<00:00:59.729> up<00:00:59.819> a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> light<00:01:01.190> but

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
should be picking up a lot of light but

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
should be picking up a lot of light but
this<00:01:02.339> might<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.729> too<00:01:02.969> much<00:01:02.999> light<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
this might be too much light and it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.329 
this might be too much light and it
might<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.320> able<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.739> warm

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
might be able to warm

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.740 
might be able to warm
same<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.210> could<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> little

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
same with this this could be a little

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
same with this this could be a little
too<00:01:06.930> warm<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.560> might<00:01:07.829> want<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.040> put<00:01:08.219> some

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
too warm I might want to put some

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.580 
too warm I might want to put some
purples<00:01:08.880> into<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:12.229> I'm<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.439> gonna

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
purples into that so I'm just gonna

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.190 
purples into that so I'm just gonna
start<00:01:13.890> experimenting<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.670> glazing<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:16.049> when

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
start experimenting my glazing now when

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
start experimenting my glazing now when
I<00:01:16.229> put<00:01:16.469> on<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.590> glaze<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> mean<00:01:17.909> by<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I put on a glaze what I mean by that is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.679 
I put on a glaze what I mean by that is
just<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> very<00:01:18.840> thin<00:01:19.170> wash<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.100> color<00:01:20.689> without

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
just a very thin wash of color without

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.130 
just a very thin wash of color without
any<00:01:21.899> white<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:25.340> no<00:01:26.340> stumble<00:01:26.909> has<00:01:27.840> some

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
any white it and no stumble has some

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
any white it and no stumble has some
white<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.649> opaque<00:01:28.979> pigment<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.670> yellow

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
white or opaque pigment like yellow

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.690 
white or opaque pigment like yellow
ochre<00:01:30.509> or<00:01:30.750> cadmium<00:01:31.590> red<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:32.100> pigment<00:01:32.640> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
ochre or cadmium red some pigment that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270 
ochre or cadmium red some pigment that
will<00:01:33.000> block<00:01:33.359> obscure<00:01:34.109> the<00:01:34.350> colors<00:01:35.039> you<00:01:35.159> can

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
will block obscure the colors you can

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.270 
will block obscure the colors you can
Eve<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.359> if<00:01:36.719> you<00:01:36.869> stumble<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:38.000> with<00:01:39.000> some

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
Eve so if you stumble this with some

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.429 
Eve so if you stumble this with some
titanium<00:01:41.280> white<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> some<00:01:42.149> cadmium<00:01:42.630> red<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
titanium white and some cadmium red it

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.940 
titanium white and some cadmium red it
will<00:01:43.590> start<00:01:43.859> to<00:01:43.979> bring<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> value<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.780> lighter

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
will start to bring the value up lighter

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.249 
will start to bring the value up lighter
is<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.250> glaze<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.329> no<00:01:48.719> matter<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:49.079> color

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
is that glaze so no matter what color

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.840 
is that glaze so no matter what color
your<00:01:49.530> glaze<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> drop<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.789> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
your glaze was it's going to drop in the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.469 
your glaze was it's going to drop in the
color<00:01:51.060> down<00:01:51.659> lower<00:01:53.030> these<00:01:54.030> won't<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.359> as

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
color down lower these won't be as

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.389 
color down lower these won't be as
noticeable<00:01:54.659> what's<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.320> yellow<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:56.249> that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
noticeable what's a yellow like that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.380 
noticeable what's a yellow like that
lemon<00:01:56.579> yellow<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.270> very<00:01:57.479> transparent

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
lemon yellow which is very transparent

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.970 
lemon yellow which is very transparent
that's<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.810> yellow<00:01:59.020> light<00:01:59.290> or<00:01:59.530> something<00:01:59.860> like

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
that's a yellow light or something like

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.540 
that's a yellow light or something like
that<00:02:01.650> but<00:02:02.650> this<00:02:02.890> is<00:02:02.950> going<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.280> be<00:02:03.370> a<00:02:03.400> little

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
that but this is going to be a little

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.630 
that but this is going to be a little
tricky<00:02:03.820> here<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.920> haven't<00:02:06.190> quite<00:02:06.400> figured

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
tricky here and I haven't quite figured

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.520 
tricky here and I haven't quite figured
out<00:02:06.820> exactly<00:02:06.970> what<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.690> want<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:07.930> do<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.350> it's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
out exactly what I want to do so it's

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.440 
out exactly what I want to do so it's
gonna<00:02:08.710> entail<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.610> little<00:02:10.240> bit<00:02:10.360> of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
gonna entail a little bit of

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.530 
gonna entail a little bit of
experimentation<00:02:11.490> which<00:02:12.490> is<00:02:12.640> okay<00:02:13.000> because<00:02:13.300> at

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
experimentation which is okay because at

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.380 
experimentation which is okay because at
this<00:02:13.690> point<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.410> modify<00:02:15.310> any<00:02:15.640> any

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
this point I can modify any any

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.110 
this point I can modify any any
additional<00:02:16.900> paint<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.770> put<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.220> canvas<00:02:18.460> and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
additional paint I put on the canvas and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.630

that red and looking a little more
purple<00:02:59.650> shadow<00:03:00.120> kind<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.239> break<00:03:01.450> out<00:03:01.630> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
space a little bit more so it looks a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.720 
space a little bit more so it looks a
little<00:03:03.310> bit<00:03:03.519> more<00:03:04.110> dark<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.290> light<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.580> it's

little bit more dark and light so it's

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:18.770 
little bit more dark and light so it's
just<00:03:06.850> not<00:03:07.090> one<00:03:07.299> on<00:03:07.660> same<00:03:08.500> shape

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:04:23.680 

this<00:03:19.780> paint<00:03:20.049> is<00:03:20.170> very<00:03:20.260> very<00:03:20.799> thin

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.170 

if<00:04:24.690> my<00:04:25.050> reference<00:04:25.669> doesn't<00:04:26.669> have<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:26.850> sure

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
if my reference doesn't have a sure

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.360 
if my reference doesn't have a sure
getting<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.630> down<00:04:27.900> at<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.169> bottom<00:04:28.350> but<00:04:28.560> I've

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
getting this down at the bottom but I've

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.129 
getting this down at the bottom but I've
learned<00:04:29.580> from<00:04:29.790> past<00:04:29.970> experience<00:04:30.690> if<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:30.960> have

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
learned from past experience if I have

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.870 
learned from past experience if I have
that<00:04:31.380> road<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:34.860> grind<00:04:35.160> at<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.340> bottom<00:04:35.729> it<00:04:35.850> just

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
that road to grind at the bottom it just

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.090 
that road to grind at the bottom it just
isn't<00:04:36.270> work<00:04:36.600> so<00:04:36.900> I'm<00:04:36.990> going<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.199> shift<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.250> down

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
isn't work so I'm going to shift it down

00:04:40.100 --> 00:05:45.930 
isn't work so I'm going to shift it down
lower<00:04:41.100> values

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.880 

well<00:05:46.480> that's<00:05:46.630> basically<00:05:47.110> how<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.350> do<00:05:47.530> another

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
well that's basically how I do another

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.290 
well that's basically how I do another
painting<00:05:48.750> now<00:05:49.750> I<00:05:49.780> might<00:05:50.110> might<00:05:50.770> put<00:05:51.010> a<00:05:51.300> very

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
painting now I might might put a very

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.910 
painting now I might might put a very
slight<00:05:52.600> glaze<00:05:52.900> over<00:05:53.170> that<00:05:53.470> or<00:05:53.650> purple<00:05:55.920> just

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
slight glaze over that or purple just

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.200 
slight glaze over that or purple just
have<00:05:57.100> to<00:05:57.250> see<00:05:58.020> but<00:05:59.020> basically<00:05:59.860> that's<00:06:00.760> it

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
have to see but basically that's it

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:27.070 
have to see but basically that's it
