hair<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.610> um<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.649> tried<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.010> something

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

different<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.030> hair<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> teased<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
different with my hair so I teased the
top<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.070> got<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.430> big<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> end

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
top so it got really big and in the end

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.360 
top so it got really big and in the end
I<00:00:40.079> decided<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.710> put<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.980> back<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.219> 1/2

a legit sigh sigh we're not talking
about<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:05.090> half<00:03:05.300> we're<00:03:05.450> not<00:03:05.570> talking<00:03:06.020> six<00:03:06.380> we're

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
about a half we're not talking six we're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.040 
about a half we're not talking six we're
talking<00:03:07.250> widget<00:03:07.580> size<00:03:07.820> five<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.480> most<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:08.990> my

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
talking widget size five so most of my

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.350 
talking widget size five so most of my
shoes<00:03:09.520> will<00:03:10.520> shoes<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.790> general<00:03:11.060> are<00:03:11.180> just

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
shoes will shoes in general are just

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.590 
shoes will shoes in general are just
really<00:03:11.600> hard<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.930> find<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.970> fit<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> size<00:03:14.270> five

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
really hard to find that fit a size five

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.990 
really hard to find that fit a size five
because<00:03:15.080> most<00:03:15.709> shoes<00:03:15.950> start<00:03:16.340> at<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> size<00:03:16.730> six

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
because most shoes start at a size six

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.370 
because most shoes start at a size six
so<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.300> don't<00:03:17.510> even<00:03:17.630> have<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:17.900> as<00:03:18.140> an<00:03:18.290> option

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
so you don't even have that as an option

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.710 
so you don't even have that as an option
so<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.860> lot<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.130> my<00:03:19.280> shoes<00:03:19.489> are<00:03:20.120> really<00:03:20.360> big<00:03:20.630> on

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
so a lot of my shoes are really big on

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.410 
so a lot of my shoes are really big on
me<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.170> they're<00:03:21.320> like<00:03:21.350> padded<00:03:22.220> up<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.580> wazoo

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
me and they're like padded up the wazoo

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.510 
me and they're like padded up the wazoo

so that I can wear them but none of them
are<00:03:25.580> comfortable<00:03:25.970> because<00:03:26.180> none<00:03:26.330> of<00:03:26.360> them

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
I didn't buy them at first and then I

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.910
