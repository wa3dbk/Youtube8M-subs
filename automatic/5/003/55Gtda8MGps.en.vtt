it the chord structure is I'm not
thinking<00:00:59.060> of<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.329> melody<00:00:59.690> I'm<00:00:59.810> thinking<00:01:00.200> of

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
thinking of the melody I'm thinking of

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.310 
thinking of the melody I'm thinking of
the<00:01:00.470> chord<00:01:00.740> structure<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.579> song<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.320> then

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
the chord structure of the song and then

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.270 
the chord structure of the song and then
it<00:01:03.739> might<00:01:04.070> be<00:01:04.280> some<00:01:04.579> simple<00:01:04.970> scales<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:06.590> c-major

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
it might be some simple scales a c-major

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.539 
it might be some simple scales a c-major
scale<00:01:07.490> or<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.659> C<00:01:08.840> pentatonic<00:01:09.500> scale<00:01:09.740> on<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.340> C

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
scale or the C pentatonic scale on the C

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.320 
scale or the C pentatonic scale on the C
chord<00:01:10.899> when<00:01:11.899> it<00:01:12.020> goes<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.860> flat<00:01:13.130> 7<00:01:13.729> same

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
chord when it goes to the a flat 7 same

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.469 
chord when it goes to the a flat 7 same
thing<00:01:14.630> I'm<00:01:14.840> thinking<00:01:14.870> of<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.590> flat

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
thing I'm thinking of the a flat

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.810 
thing I'm thinking of the a flat
pentatonic<00:01:17.479> scale<00:01:17.750> with<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.170> added<00:01:18.710> flat<00:01:19.310> 7

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
pentatonic scale with the added flat 7

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.790 
pentatonic scale with the added flat 7
tone<00:01:20.120> for<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.310> you'll<00:01:22.310> do<00:01:22.520> fine<00:01:23.020> yes<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.590> in

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
tone for that you'll do fine yes so in

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.230 
tone for that you'll do fine yes so in
see<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.460> would<00:01:25.670> be<00:01:25.790> 1<00:01:25.970> 2<00:01:26.210> 3<00:01:26.240> 5<00:01:27.020> &amp;<00:01:27.440> 6<00:01:28.030> those<00:01:29.030> are

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
see it would be 1 2 3 5 &amp; 6 those are

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.050 
see it would be 1 2 3 5 &amp; 6 those are
the<00:01:29.270> tones<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.020> pentatonic<00:01:30.470> scale<00:01:31.060> when

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
the tones of the pentatonic scale when

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.219 
the tones of the pentatonic scale when
we<00:01:32.210> add<00:01:33.850> for<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.880> seventh<00:01:35.299> chord<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:36.080> I'm

mean it's how I'm lying tied notes

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.450 
mean it's how I'm lying tied notes
together<00:04:53.570> by<00:04:54.020> doing<00:04:54.740> little<00:04:54.919> rhythmical

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
together by doing little rhythmical

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.580 
together by doing little rhythmical
things<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:56.240> try<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.449> trouble<00:04:56.990> all<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:59.590> you

things to try to trouble all that you
can't<00:05:00.830> help<00:05:01.039> but<00:05:01.160> make<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.610> little<00:05:01.910> bit

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
can't help but make it a little bit

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.140 
can't help but make it a little bit
choppy<00:05:02.389> because<00:05:02.750> with<00:05:03.199> you<00:05:03.970> yet<00:05:04.970> we're

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150

choppy because with you yet we're
changing<00:05:05.539> court<00:05:05.810> forms<00:05:06.139> there<00:05:06.410> what<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:07.280> do<00:05:07.460> to

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
changing court forms there what I do to

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.960 
changing court forms there what I do to

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
mask and no that's the important anyway

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.850 
mask and no that's the important anyway
to<00:05:11.030> use<00:05:11.240> them<00:05:11.449> to<00:05:11.750> mask<00:05:12.020> I'm<00:05:12.350> going<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.590> do<00:05:12.710> it

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
to use them to mask I'm going to do it

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:20.379 
to use them to mask I'm going to do it
rhythmically<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:19.669> then<00:05:19.789> I<00:05:19.880> can<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.300> know

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
rhythmically and then I can you know

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.300 
rhythmically and then I can you know
I've<00:05:20.479> got<00:05:20.660> some<00:05:20.870> rest<00:05:21.080> in<00:05:21.349> there<00:05:21.560> it<00:05:22.039> kind<00:05:22.250> of

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
I've got some rest in there it kind of

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.930 
I've got some rest in there it kind of
seems<00:05:22.520> likely<00:05:22.849> that<00:05:22.880> 10<00:05:23.599> in<00:05:23.840> there<00:05:24.020> okay<00:05:24.979> let's

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
seems likely that 10 in there okay let's
