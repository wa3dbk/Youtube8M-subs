00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.860
 channel I stayed a long time without doing 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.230

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.359
 end of the year is final evidence 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.619

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.720
 vacation already back can bring much 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119
 content of the channel fill that only of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.880
 very cool video as well 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.590
 it's as if by the villain in the last video I 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.180
 I bought the new video card on google 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.030
 It's a 661 and I wanted to take a test. 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 They even asked me in one of the comments 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 video to do a test show 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 against the pms that the second largest of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.410
 games when the wheels and does not support 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.750
 the games like her performance so I 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.160
 I was interested in this and that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
 do there for you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.680
 well let's bet then japan pramil that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.799
 the marina can be seen that is acontendo 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.049
 board besides the two to him she has rotated 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.409
 extremely well it even because a game 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.040
 very recent and a football very well a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.200
 perfect document in a few hours 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.540
 caius the frames per second 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.610
 us and when there is too much explosion 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.540
 a lot of things happening normally only 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.119
 stay above 60 normal this game I 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.040
 I did not buy, I won by 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.979
 cause it is he who came along with 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.060
 the plate the shop with the next plate 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.829
 promotion 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 good there just like 2 like you can see 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.570
 a game in 2011 but even so he is 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.119
 very heavy so he has the best 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.869
 graphics of the current generation games né 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.390
 not 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.659
 the problem can the current generation because 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.149
 has no business generating business but he 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.330
 one of the best graphics today 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.870
 losing only to a few games there 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.510
 but there is the superbem rotated video card 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.870
 she endured normal only that she does not stay 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.800
 above 160 pms of the typically there 2 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:14.760
 always stays there below 60 above 30 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.820
 and it is a stand on a hill they judged 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.370
 mutilated so to speak that all games 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.660
 with the exception of one all games that 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.000
 They are shown here were changed in 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.250
 ultra and full HD 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.240
 So you two have one more motion there. 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.170
 because he is capable of the court showing 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.440
 talent does not care then the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.030
 which the super well the drug wheel and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.220
 second because he's pretty heavy 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.060
 some hours you can see that it's like 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.230
 60 frames per second but stays alone 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.240
 some parts of the conflict and things 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.209
 It does not look that way. 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.240
 Good, I call that game flash league. 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:59.430
 A life span is leaving. 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:03.000
 as well as new norms itself there a yes 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.380
 nothing and I also wanted to do a test for 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.580
 You'll see more or less like a game. 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:13.769
 of this size and super good and has no 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.209
 so much graphic so you have more or 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:22.380
 least an idea of ​​how one supports 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.110
 flash in case I showed many parts 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.610
 conflict like an infarction, for example 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.050
 because that time he was 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.080
 capturing had not even had 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.550
 happened then I needed to do this 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.360
 It's fast because I had some things. 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.050
 to do 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:46.260
 so I recorded this from there even fights 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:48.360
 friends and such is her name with her 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.620
 So much for a little more 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.870
 I know if I'm going to buy it, it was still 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.810
 playing with her when it was cold week 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.780
 but okay passing next game is a 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.230
 I really surprised you. 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.989
 this very heavy game and 78 in play with 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.490
 this is where it is running in 1 to 1 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.230
 was not hanged inside 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.650
 it 's sunday 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.870
 another this game was running on high 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.129
 I can not make another run is 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.979
 like this 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.260
 super good and get a place in the beam and 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.620
 even so it sometimes falls below 38 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.070
 of the second that is a thousand thing in so 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.630
 you can see metro 2033 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.669
 it was a game of 2009 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.880
 and even if it 's super heavy has graphics 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.699
 good so beautiful graphics but it 's a lot 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.320
 Heavy dude I really do not know why. 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.289
 I do not know if it's because of the year. 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.590
 lighting account what it wants but until 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.210
 I tried recordings there so the game more 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.250
 I thought until I regularize what a game is 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.320
 most current and in my opinion that 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.729
 better graphics and I've always heard 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.470
 people talking that he was very heavy 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.370
 but I had not taken that much into 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.740
 account 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.949
 but now he had part how to take 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.410
 own conclusions that it is very 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.770
 really heavy and I do not know why 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.060
 if they have made a shoddy 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.120
 This can put a lot 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.539
 noah performance but I did not realize what was 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.849
 but I play super heavy then I use cool 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.940
 I always have the will of the goal and now 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.919
 I might have not bought for 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.440
 consoles because well I was on time 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.780
 I've even thought about business for ten 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.940
 years the handsome boys of the method is that 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.389
 everybody lived talking then me 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.130
 I bought for pc and I bought it in hubble 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.440
 band one band I'll leave nobody to 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.889
 you in the description armor a super motion 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.020
 cool 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.500
 I think that from the natural increase of 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.320
 video recording on 5/12 is it going to 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.979
 be missing another seven days and promotion 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.130
 it is a promotion of the network that will have you 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:55.139
 That game producer is going to have 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.289
 several think that seven games if not me 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.389
 the producer's mistake that they are making 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.280
 there is a banana assumption even though 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.530
 I think you find her game is 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.169
 I can buy seven games if I do not 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.750
 I cheated I paid $ 6 for 6 hours. 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.690
 from now on the cei must give the 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.729
 equivalent to about twelve reais 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.969
 pricey is very cheap goes out much more 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:21.869
 cheap games even so loose 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.219
 well let's take a look and I think 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.919
 This was the video I got back, I'm going too. 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.389
 do it for you this week and I think 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.129
 That until Friday I'll be with enough 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.689
 and with the devil are the videos 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.919
 prepared cuca in the channel 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.110
 so I think this thanks a lot to 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.969
 to watch how you like the 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.499
 favorites in the still more slaves of the 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:39.869
 canaux en first video that know my 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:41.789
 or if you liked a lot of content that 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:44.360
 It's more for this very positive and 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.360
 Lighthouse
