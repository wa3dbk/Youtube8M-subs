00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the one of the greatest things about the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.810 
the one of the greatest things about the
helicopter<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> fact<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.610> course

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
helicopter is the fact that of course

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.889 
helicopter is the fact that of course
you're<00:00:50.940> getting<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> lot<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> kills<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> if

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you're getting a lot of kills with it if

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
you're getting a lot of kills with it if
you<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> good<00:00:52.320> pilot<00:00:52.530> who's<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.280> just

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you have a good pilot who's not just

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.950 
you have a good pilot who's not just
trying<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.730> kills<00:00:53.910> himself<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.570> allows

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
trying to get kills himself and allows

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.510 
trying to get kills himself and allows
his<00:00:55.140> Gunners<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> actually<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.250> kills

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
his Gunners to actually get the kills

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
his Gunners to actually get the kills
but<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.899> allows<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.890> allies

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
but it just allows you and your allies

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.099 
but it just allows you and your allies
to<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.550> move<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.750> enemy<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to actually move up because the enemy is

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.680 
to actually move up because the enemy is
preoccupied<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.340> helicopter<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.390> sky

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
preoccupied with a helicopter in the sky

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.960 
preoccupied with a helicopter in the sky
and<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.890> they're<00:01:05.070> preoccupied<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and if they're preoccupied with that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.100 
and if they're preoccupied with that
they're<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.689> pushing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
they're not going to really be pushing

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.750 
they're not going to really be pushing
up<00:01:07.470> towards<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.770> am<00:01:07.890> calm<00:01:08.070> stations<00:01:08.490> because

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
up towards the am calm stations because

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.890 
up towards the am calm stations because
they're<00:01:09.030> worried<00:01:09.270> they're<00:01:09.390> gonna<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.659> killed

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
they're worried they're gonna get killed

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.719 
they're worried they're gonna get killed
on<00:01:10.080> ieave<00:01:11.010> ndu<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.549> there's<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
on ieave ndu this when there's a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.570 
on ieave ndu this when there's a
helicopter<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:13.290> above<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.340> really

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
helicopter up up above I or I really

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.060 
helicopter up up above I or I really
won't<00:01:14.850> venture<00:01:15.299> too<00:01:15.750> far<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.950> open

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
won't venture too far out into the open

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
won't venture too far out into the open
and<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:18.119> basically<00:01:18.479> slows<00:01:18.840> down<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and this just basically slows down the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
and this just basically slows down the
defense<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.799> allows<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:20.759> allies

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
defense and allows you and your allies

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
defense and allows you and your allies
to<00:01:21.210> move<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.470> second<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:22.920> you're

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
to move up the second thing you're

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.960 
to move up the second thing you're
really<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> want<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> take

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
really going to want to do is take

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.580 
really going to want to do is take
advantage<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> tanks<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.439> one

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
advantage of the tanks and this is one

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
advantage of the tanks and this is one
of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> best<00:01:25.920> ways<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> basically

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
of the best ways to do it basically

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.850 
of the best ways to do it basically
you're<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> ride<00:01:28.080> right<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.380> to

just going to want to tackle it by

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.319 
just going to want to tackle it by
slowly<00:01:38.040> moving<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.549> making<00:01:38.850> sure<00:01:39.000> there's<00:01:39.240> no

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.819 
slowly moving up making sure there's no
one<00:01:39.479> flanking<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.380> left<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
one flanking you on the left or the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
one flanking you on the left or the
right<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.610> long<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:42.090> allies

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
right of you but as long as your allies

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.950 
right of you but as long as your allies
are<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.720> around<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> should<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.979> fine

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
are are around you you should be fine

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.530 
are are around you you should be fine
here<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.320> good<00:01:46.500> good<00:01:47.450> kind<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
here this is a good good kind of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
here this is a good good kind of
scenario<00:01:48.810> where<00:01:49.259> our<00:01:49.799> team<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> almost<00:01:50.549> losing

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
scenario where our team is almost losing

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.389 
scenario where our team is almost losing
but<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.229> only<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.590> 19<00:01:53.040> tickets

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
but I think we only have like 19 tickets

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.520 
but I think we only have like 19 tickets
left<00:01:53.579> or<00:01:53.820> close<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.960> maybe<00:01:55.079> even<00:01:55.200> less

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
left or close to that or maybe even less

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
left or close to that or maybe even less
and<00:01:55.939> I'm<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> tank<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.630> what's<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.229> good

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and I'm in the tank and what's so good

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
and I'm in the tank and what's so good
about<00:01:58.380> using<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> tank<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.250> it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
about using the tank is that it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.830 
about using the tank is that it
distracts<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> enemy<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.390> actually

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
distracts the enemy from actually

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929 
distracts the enemy from actually
defending<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> M<00:02:01.770> comm<00:02:01.920> station<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.640> makes

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
defending the M comm station and makes

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.709 
defending the M comm station and makes
them<00:02:03.090> shoot<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:04.759> RPGs<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.540> more

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
them shoot you with RPGs and the more

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.940 
them shoot you with RPGs and the more
that<00:02:06.750> they're<00:02:06.960> doing<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.469> less<00:02:07.619> they're

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that they're doing that the less they're

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.309 
that they're doing that the less they're
actually<00:02:08.250> shooting<00:02:08.429> your<00:02:08.700> allies<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.319> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
actually shooting your allies and I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.710 
actually shooting your allies and I
basically<00:02:11.190> allowing<00:02:11.730> your<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.209> your<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.599> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
basically allowing your in your you and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.020 
basically allowing your in your you and
your<00:02:12.840> team

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
your team

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.460 
your team
to<00:02:13.180> move<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.569> M<00:02:13.720> conversation<00:02:14.200> and

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
to move up to the M conversation and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.250 
to move up to the M conversation and
actually<00:02:14.890> planting<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.959> another<00:02:16.959> than<00:02:17.140> that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
actually planting it another than that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.480 
actually planting it another than that
you're<00:02:17.440> also<00:02:17.590> going<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.830> get<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> lot<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.160> kills

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
you're also going to get a lot of kills

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.440 
you're also going to get a lot of kills
which<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.880> also<00:02:19.209> very<00:02:19.450> sweet<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:22.180> basically

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
which is also very sweet so basically

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.490 
which is also very sweet so basically
what<00:02:22.600> you're<00:02:22.630> going<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.870> do<00:02:22.990> is<00:02:23.170> once<00:02:23.410> you

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
what you're going to do is once you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.020 
what you're going to do is once you
actually<00:02:23.620> get<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:23.980> M<00:02:24.130> comm<00:02:24.310> station<00:02:24.490> move<00:02:24.819> up

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
actually get the M comm station move up

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.520 
actually get the M comm station move up
make<00:02:25.209> sure<00:02:25.240> no<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:25.660> actually<00:02:25.810> gets<00:02:26.110> into<00:02:26.410> it

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
make sure no one actually gets into it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.440 
make sure no one actually gets into it
and<00:02:26.650> just<00:02:27.400> kind<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.610> rain<00:02:27.790> death<00:02:28.000> upon<00:02:28.120> anyone

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
and just kind of rain death upon anyone

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.930 
and just kind of rain death upon anyone
that's<00:02:28.690> trying<00:02:29.020> right<00:02:30.010> here<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.489> tank

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
that's trying right here on the tank

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.030 
that's trying right here on the tank
actually<00:02:31.239> blows<00:02:31.450> up<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:32.140> as<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.440> can<00:02:32.530> see<00:02:32.770> you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
actually blows up but as you can see you

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.590 
actually blows up but as you can see you
know<00:02:33.550> they're<00:02:33.790> distracted<00:02:34.239> by<00:02:34.300> trying<00:02:34.540> to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
know they're distracted by trying to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.000 
know they're distracted by trying to
take<00:02:34.720> out<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> tank<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.350> not<00:02:35.709> actually

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
take out the tank and not actually

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.890 
take out the tank and not actually
getting<00:02:36.100> amcom<00:02:36.520> station<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.030> we're<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.660> we<00:02:37.780> are

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
getting amcom station so we're so we are

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.290 
getting amcom station so we're so we are
able<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.290> take<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.560> out<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.910> if<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.150> are

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
able to take it out now if you are

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.580 
able to take it out now if you are
actually<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.840> foot<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.290> you're<00:02:41.410> going<00:02:41.530> to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
actually on foot and you're going to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.840 
actually on foot and you're going to
want<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.739> make<00:02:41.860> your<00:02:42.010> way<00:02:42.040> over<00:02:42.130> there<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:42.670> is

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
want to make your way over there this is

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.520 
want to make your way over there this is
probably<00:02:43.180> one<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.480> my<00:02:43.569> favorite<00:02:44.020> routes<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
probably one of my favorite routes and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.840 
probably one of my favorite routes and
basically<00:02:45.100> what<00:02:45.310> you're<00:02:45.400> going<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.610> want<00:02:45.730> to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
basically what you're going to want to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.060 
basically what you're going to want to
do<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.209> you're<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.080> head<00:02:47.320> along<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
do is you're going to head along the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.550 
do is you're going to head along the
right<00:02:48.400> side<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.120> zone<00:02:49.330> wall<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.810> guess<00:02:50.410> it's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
right side of the zone wall I guess it's

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.930 
right side of the zone wall I guess it's
really<00:02:50.769> not<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.920> zone<00:02:51.220> wall<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:51.640> pretty<00:02:51.910> much

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
really not a zone wall but pretty much

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.479 
really not a zone wall but pretty much
the<00:02:52.209> on<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.900> edge<00:02:53.019> of<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> map<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.680> you're

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
the on the edge of the map and you're

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.440 
the on the edge of the map and you're
going<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.670> want<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.850> make<00:02:54.970> your<00:02:55.090> way<00:02:55.180> over<00:02:55.209> to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
going to want to make your way over to

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.910 
going to want to make your way over to
that<00:02:55.570> house<00:02:55.810> over<00:02:56.080> there<00:02:56.260> off<00:02:56.560> into<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
that house over there off into the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.590 
that house over there off into the
distance<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.489> what<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.180> really<00:02:58.450> like<00:02:58.569> about

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
distance and what I really like about

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.420 
distance and what I really like about
this<00:02:58.930> route<00:02:59.200> is<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.500> fact<00:02:59.709> that<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.040> has<00:03:00.160> great

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
this route is the fact that it has great

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.420 
this route is the fact that it has great
line<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:00.730> sight<00:03:00.910> along<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.630> be<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.980> BM<00:03:03.250> comm

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
line of sight along the be the BM comm

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.800 
line of sight along the be the BM comm
station<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:04.030> can<00:03:04.060> pretty<00:03:04.330> much<00:03:04.420> take<00:03:04.660> out

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
station you can pretty much take out

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.210 
station you can pretty much take out

allies<00:03:08.709> with<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:09.850> can<00:03:09.880> pretty<00:03:10.300> much<00:03:10.360> lock

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
allies with you you can pretty much lock

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.960 
allies with you you can pretty much lock
it<00:03:10.780> down<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.140> allow<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:12.640> people<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:12.940> are

actually trying to go for the M comm

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.750 
actually trying to go for the M comm
station<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.980> chance<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.370> get<00:03:15.489> up<00:03:15.550> there<00:03:15.700> and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
station the chance to get up there and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.840 
station the chance to get up there and
and<00:03:16.180> plant<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.290> but<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.920> really<00:03:18.100> great<00:03:18.489> thing

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
and plant it but the really great thing

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.090 
and plant it but the really great thing
about<00:03:18.940> this<00:03:19.239> this<00:03:20.079> position<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.860> fact

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
about this this position is the fact

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.819 
about this this position is the fact
that<00:03:21.250> once<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.510> M<00:03:22.630> compensation<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.350> planted

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
that once the M compensation is planted

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.190 
that once the M compensation is planted
it<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.100> easily<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.790> best<00:03:25.090> place<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:26.019> actually

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
it is easily the best place to actually

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.440 
it is easily the best place to actually
defend<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:27.400> has<00:03:27.519> great<00:03:27.760> line<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.060> sight<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
defend it it has great line of sight and

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.600 
defend it it has great line of sight and
as<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.690> can<00:03:28.810> see<00:03:29.019> here<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.530> second<00:03:29.890> my<00:03:30.370> team

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
as you can see here in a second my team

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.100 
as you can see here in a second my team
and<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.820> are<00:03:30.850> going<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.090> pretty<00:03:31.660> much<00:03:31.810> be<00:03:31.959> able

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
and I are going to pretty much be able

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.960 
and I are going to pretty much be able
to<00:03:32.170> lock<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.500> down<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.950> make<00:03:32.980> sure<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.730> no

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
to lock it down and make sure that no

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.960 
to lock it down and make sure that no
enemies<00:03:34.420> are<00:03:34.570> going<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.870> be<00:03:34.959> actually<00:03:35.140> able<00:03:35.350> to

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
enemies are going to be actually able to

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.729 
enemies are going to be actually able to
defuse<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.150> bomb<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.560> pretty

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
defuse the bomb and so this is pretty

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.830 
defuse the bomb and so this is pretty
much<00:03:38.860> like<00:03:39.579> I<00:03:39.700> said<00:03:39.910> my<00:03:40.060> favorite<00:03:40.390> position<00:03:40.750> to

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
much like I said my favorite position to

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.110 
much like I said my favorite position to
take<00:03:41.019> for<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.590> first<00:03:41.859> base<00:03:42.130> if<00:03:42.400> I'm<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.000> the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
take for this first base if I'm on the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.349 
take for this first base if I'm on the
ground<00:03:43.239> it's<00:03:44.170> just<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.470> great<00:03:44.680> spot<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.269> as<00:03:46.269> you

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
ground it's just a great spot and as you

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.180 
ground it's just a great spot and as you
can<00:03:46.480> see<00:03:46.510> here<00:03:46.810> I'm<00:03:46.989> pretty<00:03:47.290> much<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.530> mowing

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
can see here I'm pretty much just mowing

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.580 
can see here I'm pretty much just mowing
people<00:03:48.310> down<00:03:48.549> so<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.120> my<00:03:49.209> allies<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:50.410> think

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
people down so is my allies and I think

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.160 
people down so is my allies and I think
here<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:50.799> a<00:03:50.859> second<00:03:51.130> we<00:03:51.220> actually<00:03:51.519> cap<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.299> the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
here in a second we actually cap the the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.620 
here in a second we actually cap the the
M<00:03:53.260> comm<00:03:53.440> station<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.890> that's<00:03:54.040> great<00:03:54.480> now<00:03:55.480> if

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
M comm station so that's great now if

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.910 
M comm station so that's great now if
you're<00:03:55.780> trying<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:55.989> go<00:03:56.109> for<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.350> am<00:03:56.709> come

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
you're trying to go for the am come

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.560 
you're trying to go for the am come
station<00:03:57.340> this<00:03:57.519> is<00:03:57.579> probably<00:03:58.030> at<00:03:58.180> least<00:03:58.299> in<00:03:58.480> my

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
station this is probably at least in my

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.910 
station this is probably at least in my
opinion<00:03:58.690> while<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.230> hardest<00:03:59.590> wants<00:03:59.799> to

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
opinion while the hardest wants to

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.800 
opinion while the hardest wants to
actually<00:04:00.489> take<00:04:00.730> on<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.000> map<00:04:01.209> just<00:04:01.510> because

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
actually take on this map just because

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.390 
actually take on this map just because
there's<00:04:02.140> there's<00:04:02.739> really<00:04:02.890> not<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.100> whole<00:04:03.190> lot

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
there's there's really not a whole lot

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.530 
there's there's really not a whole lot
of<00:04:03.549> line<00:04:03.670> of<00:04:03.700> sight<00:04:03.820> you<00:04:04.120> can<00:04:04.269> take<00:04:04.420> advantage

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
of line of sight you can take advantage

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.900 
of line of sight you can take advantage
of<00:04:04.989> so<00:04:05.590> what<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:05.920> like<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.130> do<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.609> I<00:04:06.730> like<00:04:06.760> to

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
of so what I like to do is I like to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.460 
of so what I like to do is I like to
move<00:04:07.090> up<00:04:07.209> with<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:07.420> tank<00:04:07.660> once<00:04:07.870> again<00:04:08.200> and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
move up with the tank once again and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.849 
move up with the tank once again and
just<00:04:09.010> move<00:04:09.220> up<00:04:09.310> with<00:04:09.459> my<00:04:09.609> with<00:04:10.030> my<00:04:10.209> squad<00:04:10.859> here

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
just move up with my with my squad here

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.349 
just move up with my with my squad here
the<00:04:12.010> M<00:04:12.190> comm<00:04:12.340> station<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.730> already<00:04:12.910> planted<00:04:13.120> in

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
the M comm station is already planted in

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.550 
the M comm station is already planted in
Kiana<00:04:13.630> gives<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.959> good<00:04:14.049> idea<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.410> how

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
Kiana gives you a good idea of how

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.279 
Kiana gives you a good idea of how
effective<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.100> tank<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.820> kind<00:04:16.000> of

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
effective the tank is that just kind of

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.840 
effective the tank is that just kind of
destroying<00:04:17.289> anyone<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.769> tries<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:17.979> tries<00:04:18.820> to

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
destroying anyone that tries to tries to

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.909 
destroying anyone that tries to tries to
diffuse<00:04:19.269> it<00:04:19.450> but<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.260> reason<00:04:20.410> why<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.680> would

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
diffuse it but the reason why I would

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.469 
diffuse it but the reason why I would
use<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.039> tank<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.459> because<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:22.030> line<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.300> sight

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
use a tank is because the line of sight

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.210 
use a tank is because the line of sight
is<00:04:22.630> pretty<00:04:23.050> much<00:04:23.169> or<00:04:23.710> there's<00:04:23.919> really<00:04:24.039> no

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
is pretty much or there's really no

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.460 
is pretty much or there's really no
cover<00:04:24.520> over<00:04:25.300> there<00:04:25.479> and<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.140> you're<00:04:26.289> not<00:04:26.380> gonna

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
cover over there and so you're not gonna

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.879 
cover over there and so you're not gonna
be<00:04:26.560> able<00:04:26.590> to

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
be able to

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.800 
be able to
I<00:04:26.919> if<00:04:27.249> you're<00:04:27.669> just<00:04:27.759> doing<00:04:27.909> this<00:04:28.060> with<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.330> on

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
I if you're just doing this with a on

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.600 
I if you're just doing this with a on
foot<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.349> so<00:04:29.949> it's<00:04:30.159> just<00:04:30.219> gonna<00:04:30.340> be<00:04:30.460> really
