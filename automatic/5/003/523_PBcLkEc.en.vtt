00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:13.160
 we are on board the lexus rx 450h and how 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.339
 you see he is shooting a dvd 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.730
 because this is a car also equipped 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:21.619
 of reading dvd from the disc obviously here 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.779
 on the bridge and nothing is left to chance 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.839
 because there is also the central speaker 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.769
 place well above peace now so also 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:33.280
 audio with a dedicated mark system 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:38.140
 levinson that sounds really good 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.789
 in short, everything devoted to the cuddle of 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.510
 of the driver but also of the passengers 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:47.480
 because they are placed behind the seats 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.039
 front two displays that can be 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.230
 used for any source because 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.629
 we have analog inputs that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.399
 they can view each source 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.460
 analog but back to the 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.440
 on the infotainment we leave the dvd 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.920
 we have two parts for control 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.500
 water on the bridge with more springs 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.600
 use two buttons to move 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
 in the menu in addition to two wheels volume and 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.090
 also here movement in the various lists and 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.320
 then this pad which is very particular 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.770
 because it has a feed that reproduces i 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.880
 buttons that we find in the display then 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.700
 makes the shots that are synchronized with 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.060
 click the on the display a lot 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.409
 particularly easier to ensure that from 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.689
 tell each other with the menu button 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.820
 we enter the home page of 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.610
 configuration is a thousand parameters 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.070
 which we can configure from the vehicle that 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.740
 and seeing the trend of energy 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.380
 why we are talking about a vehicle 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.780
 hybrid up to the settings at 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.780
 traffic information on parking lots 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.340
 that we have around and 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.250
 configurations not only 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.799
 of the infotainment but also proper of the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.890
 of the vehicle with the possibility of 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.479
 customize the vehicle on more 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.760
 then we have the option 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.950
 to enter 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.500
 we have something to do with navigation 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.630
 directly from water I first wanted 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.720
 show the air conditioner that can 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.420
 be managed directly by the dal 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.300
 large panel with buttons then placed 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.270
 in the dashboard and the last two 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.940
 menus are those related to the phone 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.500
 because obviously it has a voice that 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.670
 works very well even at high 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.280
 speed thanks own 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.310
 the soundproofing of this one of this 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.980
 car and last but not least the part 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.760
 audio part audio that can be here in 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.510
 high 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.420
 declined in radio am fm or so 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.690
 digital audio broadcasting with six 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.270
 pre-stored stations or if 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.070
 let's go on like this between connecting the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.220
 disc now we have a dvd inside but 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.770
 reading quietly in an ipod mp3 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.100
 this case connected with the cable to the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.770
 usb usb which is placed here in the drawer 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.709
 of next to an auxiliary entrance e 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.560
 above the cigarette lighter socket then 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.330
 convenient if we want to recharge any 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.690
 any driveway iphone device either 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.320
 as a phone like ipod or even the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.080
 bluetooth 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.620
 obviously connecting the cable we are 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.269
 connected with the cable in ipod mode 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.790
 we can select the music we go 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:36.900
 on a music that makes us feel a 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.900
 the audio quality of this is little 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.750
 ok i have to say that even at maximum volume 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.610
 The facility never distorts at a great 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.030
 subwoofer really feels very much 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.180
 well 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.640
 this is the main screen of the 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.510
 car where we have three information 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.790
 that creature finalizer to 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.890
 car and the navigator these 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.090
 formations you can then enlarge either 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.490
 that of the safe car of the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.980
 navigator 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.480
 let's try entering a destination for 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.090
 see the speed of the navigator 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.640
 navigator that works very well has the 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 possibility to do online research in 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.010
 In this case, a mobile phone must be configured 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.820
 to act as a modem I have 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.280
 found 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.410
 not really comfortable the fact that 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.450
 first he asks us to enter the road and then 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.200
 the city has to be moved manually 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:41.590
 on the city ​​and go to place comfortable 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:49.210
 the last cities entered and we go to 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:52.760
 put a road to chance ok and we activate 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:57.070
 the navigation 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.930
 once the navigation is 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.960
 destination is set to 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.970
 navigator studies the road and we can 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.790
 also ask him for three paths 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.320
 alternative the quickest the fastest 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:15.350
 secondary to the first is the 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.880
 short route once selected then 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.500
 web browsing will start 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.870
 will convince you that it is in 3d and above all 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.450
 also have the buildings when we go 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.850
 to the city ​​almost from information 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.680
 on the time of arrival and on the kilometers 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.300
 stayed on arrival and of course thanks 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.140
 al tmc also gives us information on the 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.080
 traffic 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:43.060
 well i would say a very much infotainment 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.590
 very complete that comes further 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.100
 enriched by the buttons on the steering wheel that 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.740
 allow us to change the source 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.340
 input between ipod radio what it is 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.160
 connected the fair volume change the 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.800
 then traces an infotainment that is 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.720
 very complete perhaps the graphic a bit a 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.520
 little 90s would be a bit to review the 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.680
 graphic part but as functionality 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.790
 really at the top and above all it sounds 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.790
 really great
