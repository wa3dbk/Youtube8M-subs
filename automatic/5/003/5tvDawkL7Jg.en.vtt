 University of Coimbra has been a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.020
 wonderful experience especially 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.539
 to know these contrasts of teaching 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.760
 and learning from the Brazilian university 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.229
 for the Portuguese university and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.310
 mainly know others 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.909
 students 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.830
 Good before I came here I did not know 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.920
 much about the traditions of coimbra not 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.150
 I knew a lot about this as coimbra more 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.080
 knew its importance for how to 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.030
 European university or not 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 best universities in europe and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.619
 When I arrived here it surprises me . 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.659
 because I had the opportunity to participate 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.520
 some extra things out 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.740
 curricular activities of the university in 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
 to my course and I think it has added 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.610
 a lot of my professional life for me 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.950
 is a fantastic experience and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.689
 I'm here because the environment is 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.439
 completely different from the river of 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.880
 January 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.170
 here I met people all over the world 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.659
 here the conviviality is much greater with 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.759
 staff from other countries 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.649
 I think it's very cool to be here on 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.020
 university of coimbra because the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.479
 university has a well-established tradition. 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.299
 unlike anything I 've ever known 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.850
 in addition the environment is very welcoming 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.350
 the students are very receptive to 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.140
 university is 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.700
 around the world for being one of the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.520
 oldest of europe 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.370
 so it is a very comfortable environment to 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.720
 Coimbra is a wonderful city. I 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.290
 I fell in love with Coimbra as soon as I 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.030
 decide bus and I've decided that when 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.190
 getting older will bring my kids 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.130
 To meet the university there. 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.000
 I studied a city itself is beautiful and 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.520
 offers a one of the big scenery man 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.010
 and I like this place very much. 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.470
 theater gil vicente spends the afternoon in 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.220
 diego in the world of rock nostalgia of 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.830
 younger stuff in poems 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.640
 I have many good shorts culturally 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.489
 I 've also been to TVg a few times and it's 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.819
 a theater the very good cat like this 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.120
 and also in addition the night environment 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.890
 the city is also very very welcoming 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.049
 It's very good, this is it. 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.519
 I think the city coimbra very beautiful one 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.830
 city ​​to be a city of the interior 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.250
 said he has many options of 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.829
 culture and I really enjoy parks and 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.620
 coimbra and the academic theater that is the 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.400
 I usually go then I think for the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.120
 students is in general a city that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.120
