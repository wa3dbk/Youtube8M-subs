00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.300 
I haven't decided what I'm going to do
before<00:01:19.940> I<00:01:20.149> start<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:20.750> really<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:21.560> take<00:01:22.190> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
before I start it's really I take the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.410 
before I start it's really I take the
feel<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.580> inspiration<00:01:25.580> from<00:01:26.000> how<00:01:26.360> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
feel and the inspiration from how the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.609 
feel and the inspiration from how the
fruit<00:01:26.600> vegetables<00:01:27.140> look<00:01:27.229> when<00:01:27.409> they<00:01:27.470> just

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
fruit vegetables look when they just

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.919 
fruit vegetables look when they just
kind<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.920> laid<00:01:28.100> up<00:01:28.250> around<00:01:28.520> me<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:29.000> just<00:01:29.690> start

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
kind of laid up around me I just start

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.960 
kind of laid up around me I just start
designing<00:01:30.319> and<00:01:30.649> then<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.860> kind<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.250> takes<00:01:31.729> over

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
designing and then it kind of takes over

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:49.820 
designing and then it kind of takes over
it<00:01:32.450> says<00:01:32.690> only<00:01:32.920> it's<00:01:33.920> his<00:01:34.100> own<00:01:34.280> thing
