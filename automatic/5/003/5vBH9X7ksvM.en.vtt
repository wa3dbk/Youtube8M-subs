00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
decision and reject the whole thing if

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.409 
decision and reject the whole thing if
those<00:02:52.500> kids<00:02:52.739> could<00:02:53.069> have<00:02:53.160> walked<00:02:53.370> out<00:02:53.669> at<00:02:54.180> that

moment if I said should we go to
McDonald's<00:02:56.819> I<00:02:56.910> think<00:02:57.269> everyone<00:02:57.660> at<00:02:57.690> once<00:02:58.019> said

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
McDonald's I think everyone at once said

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.240 
McDonald's I think everyone at once said
yes<00:02:58.440> why<00:02:59.010> don't<00:02:59.190> say<00:02:59.310> yes<00:02:59.519> or<00:03:00.769> there<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:01.919> some

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
yes why don't say yes or there is some

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.400 
yes why don't say yes or there is some
element<00:03:02.489> of<00:03:02.970> dissatisfaction<00:03:03.410> because

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
element of dissatisfaction because

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.860 
element of dissatisfaction because
there's<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.769> idea<00:03:04.919> that<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.940> had<00:03:06.269> endless

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
there's the idea that if I had endless

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.610 
there's the idea that if I had endless
choices<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:08.090> then<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.239> get<00:03:09.480> something<00:03:10.019> of

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
choices and then I get something of

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.180 
choices and then I get something of
course<00:03:10.919> it's<00:03:11.099> not<00:03:11.220> perfect<00:03:12.620> maybe<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.769> made<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
course it's not perfect maybe I made the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.099 
course it's not perfect maybe I made the
wrong<00:03:14.340> choice<00:03:14.910> maybe<00:03:15.329> there<00:03:15.660> was<00:03:15.840> something

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
wrong choice maybe there was something

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:16.610 
wrong choice maybe there was something
that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.729 
that
out<00:03:16.799> there<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.280> didn't<00:03:17.580> choose<00:03:18.709> okay
