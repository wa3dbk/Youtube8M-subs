00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Welcome to the next episode 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.740
 the peg road to glory with wayne rooney 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.450
 and I hope I forgive that 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 like to be there the last time 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 really cool , we have 500 likes 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.549
 Cracked that would be me too today 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.289
 again as a target and maybe 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.270
 we can get it out that we had so much 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.350
 really nice and you have some 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.830
 Suggestions made what we change 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.590
 could 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 For example, the suggestion was that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 The packs I worked out for myself 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.680
 or have earned at the beginning of the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.000
 next next goal 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.470
 I think that's very good, we'll be like that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.010
 and I have a few more 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.489
 Added more rules and see that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.800
 we here 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.739
 because discard packs should be synonymous 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.070
 because a defeat and yes that has 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.420
 not quite well formatted but the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 worst player at one 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.780
 defeat should be replaced 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.280
 so that we become one, so to speak 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.510
 guilty in the team have except 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 Of course Wayne Rooney has to go with it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 stay 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.690
 he 'll come out and we will 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.109
 last time the packs were pulled 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.879
 to have 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.440
 which is not going to do it now 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.300
 it now directly into the match we look for 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.140
 an adversary is just like that we have 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.880
 our opponent connection is ok 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.790
 Let's go there I was curious what 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.300
 we have better opponents here 79 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.570
 rating with 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.580
 tello torres june everything just does not know 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.890
 it just is not there missing a lot 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.980
 spanish team start the game like 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.270
 watch how our opponent plays and what 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.009
 we can do that very nicely 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.320
 and pulled to get out simply 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.179
 promises to turn around so mega good 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:43.140
 we just tasted robin van 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.140
 persie is implemented 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.500
 Bernard prelates are beautiful again 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.410
 I almost ran my head 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.410
 got and skipass 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.859
 and there is through that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.340
 and there are eleven meters there like it 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:18.950
 looks eleven meters a bit unhappy 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 roberto gets annoyed a little bit 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.180
 I've run it 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.840
 he had not gotten his hands on and 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.840
 then there's eleven meters here 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.750
 we know who we shoot with that very much 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.750
 probably clear 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.470
 with robin van persie by no means 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.910
 rooney ok full concentration june you 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.910
 Do the thing you do 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.640
 motto is still bad 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.370
 hit anyway 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.530
 oh man oh man oh man oh man with 1 0 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.530
 under the direction of wayne rooney 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.360
 10 clean 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.790
 very nice we have ok 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.750
 oh the worse pass what was that 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 shoots but shoots shoots 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.980
 but I do not get it after that 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.980
 excluded 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.740
 and the shot was not good bernard 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.740
 man man man man man 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.689
 No 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.819
 what a scary tor who was s on then 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:55.569
 end who was it with matthias appel 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.629
 actually I had that in there already 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.170
 have to have again postage doll 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.609
 Rumpel Gretel and the thing was in it 20 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.530
 because my opponents very, very angry 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.629
 determines for me annoy the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.510
 if you have such a disgusting counterfeit 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.510
 gets 20 very good 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.900
 oh man oh man oh man warded off it is 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.550
 It's really tight actually 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.550
 he could have met before 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:32.930
 and allowed 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:35.350
 very beautiful there is the referee 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.350
 In the way 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.139
 and the match thanks super that 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.310
 the referee or whoever 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.350
 but I saw each other so fast 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:50.430
 can suddenly be a bit like that 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:52.470
 which was in the area numbers 2 1 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.840
 Of course there is always the last action 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.599
 the half-time break or closing is 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.550
 always a goal here are work a lot 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.590
 offensive make much more shots 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:08.729
 Tor as the opponent so actually now 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:11.180
 already clearly as it stands right now 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.180
 like 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.820
 as is spent time with keeper 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.820
 all clear very well what is good 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.629
 the exchange against store 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.789
 sets itself by 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:52.179
 Very good graduation so we have to see 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.369
 so we wanted it veni vidi vici 

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:56.869
 he just does not come at all 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:06:00.979
 beirren shoots the keeper also like 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:07.579
 sometimes with the gate wonderful miracles 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:10.569
 wonderful again rudi the post to the 

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:10.569
 damn post 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.240
 we are lucky we have the thing 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:25.110
 not pure but beside it co o 83 10 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.110
 minute 84 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.240
 okay, there is the corner two again 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.370
 minutes are replayed that's enough 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.310
 not to shoot two goals here 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.440
 be should we actually because 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.000
 victory should be guaranteed even if here 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.660
 maybe not hit out, no 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.660
 he does not get it 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:59.239
 I should just keep on running 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:02.149
 ok with june ok so win that 

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:04.999
 then you have to glass around who who 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:07.309
 shot many goals won with it 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:09.439
 there is no disc pack but for 

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:11.839
 Us means that in the next episode 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:14.599
 that we can open a few packs 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:18.019
 I mean all right once again june 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:21.589
 june and once bernard means five 

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:25.759
 points thus five points for each 

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:28.879
 24 june motor as 4 + 1 from bern am 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:31.759
 8.5 and still thinks the victory is 

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:34.009
 So clean 66 in the next episode 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.889
 good rating from june two goals 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:38.809
 of course shot eleven meters but yes 

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.679
 six text the next i follow 

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:41.360
 Hope you like it now 

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:42.619
 The happy again thumb up there 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.329
 and then we'll see each other in the next 

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:46.329
 Follow it again will be fine until then
