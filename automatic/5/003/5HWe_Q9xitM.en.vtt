they<00:05:14.460> bumped<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:14.910> knife<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.420> really<00:05:15.960> don't<00:05:16.080> know

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
they bumped a knife I really don't know

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.250 
they bumped a knife I really don't know
but<00:05:17.370> for<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.640> brand<00:05:18.030> new<00:05:18.150> blade<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.750> have<00:05:18.960> that

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
but for a brand new blade to have that

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.710 
but for a brand new blade to have that
the<00:05:19.740> lines<00:05:19.950> going<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.370> way<00:05:20.550> or<00:05:20.700> oil<00:05:20.880> as<00:05:21.570> you

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
the lines going this way or oil as you

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.010 
the lines going this way or oil as you
can<00:05:21.840> see<00:05:22.080> but<00:05:22.800> that<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:26.280> is<00:05:26.460> in<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.700> knife

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
can see but that that is in the knife

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.570 
can see but that that is in the knife
and<00:05:28.020> that<00:05:28.830> bothers<00:05:29.250> me<00:05:30.650> i'm<00:05:31.650> pretty<00:05:31.919> picky<00:05:32.160> but

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
and that bothers me i'm pretty picky but

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.040 
and that bothers me i'm pretty picky but
something<00:05:32.970> like<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.270> stain<00:05:33.600> it<00:05:33.750> out<00:05:33.870> on<00:05:34.020> a

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
something like that stain it out on a

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.680 
something like that stain it out on a
satin<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:35.100> up<00:05:35.220> though<00:05:35.400> enough<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.330> drive<00:05:36.540> me

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
satin is it up though enough to drive me

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.909 
satin is it up though enough to drive me
nuts<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:39.780> shows<00:05:40.050> up<00:05:40.260> pretty<00:05:40.530> good<00:05:40.710> in<00:05:40.830> the

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
nuts it shows up pretty good in the

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.659 
nuts it shows up pretty good in the
light<00:05:43.160> so<00:05:44.160> i'm<00:05:44.940> not<00:05:45.090> gonna<00:05:45.540> deal<00:05:45.930> with<00:05:46.140> that

that's<00:05:53.160> right<00:05:53.430> let<00:05:53.760> me<00:05:53.790> see<00:05:53.850> if<00:05:54.030> i<00:05:54.060> can<00:05:54.210> get<00:05:54.270> you

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
that's right let me see if i can get you

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.370 
that's right let me see if i can get you
a<00:05:54.450> better<00:05:54.600> view<00:05:56.630> these<00:05:57.630> aren't<00:05:57.810> nearest<00:05:58.169> bed

there's<00:05:58.620> just<00:05:58.770> one<00:05:58.979> tiny<00:05:59.220> mark<00:05:59.700> where<00:05:59.850> you<00:05:59.910> can

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
there's just one tiny mark where you can

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
how the matrix the large was that I had

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.190 
how the matrix the large was that I had
the<00:06:05.160> minis<00:06:05.430> right<00:06:05.669> lock<00:06:06.419> bar<00:06:06.660> is<00:06:06.780> done<00:06:06.960> right

the minis right lock bar is done right

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.590 
the minis right lock bar is done right
and<00:06:07.710> on<00:06:08.340> this<00:06:08.490> side<00:06:08.700> you<00:06:08.760> can<00:06:09.060> see<00:06:09.090> just<00:06:09.210> one

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
and on this side you can see just one

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.810 
and on this side you can see just one
tiny<00:06:09.840> little<00:06:09.960> ring<00:06:10.410> where<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.800> end<00:06:11.370> mill<00:06:11.580> went

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
tiny little ring where the end mill went

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.200 
tiny little ring where the end mill went
in<00:06:11.910> to<00:06:12.030> cut<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.360> groove<00:06:12.680> not<00:06:13.680> bad<00:06:13.890> at<00:06:14.040> all<00:06:14.210> the

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
in to cut the groove not bad at all the

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.010 
in to cut the groove not bad at all the
thing<00:06:15.390> that<00:06:15.510> bugs<00:06:15.720> me<00:06:17.090> after<00:06:18.090> a<00:06:18.330> mark<00:06:18.780> on<00:06:18.870> the

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
thing that bugs me after a mark on the

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.390 
thing that bugs me after a mark on the
blade<00:06:19.290> is<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:20.460> grind<00:06:20.700> height<00:06:21.710> it<00:06:22.710> is<00:06:22.770> shorter

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
blade is the grind height it is shorter

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.980 
blade is the grind height it is shorter
on<00:06:23.580> this<00:06:23.790> side<00:06:24.030> you<00:06:24.060> see<00:06:24.510> if<00:06:24.570> I<00:06:24.630> get<00:06:24.780> a<00:06:24.810> better

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
on this side you see if I get a better

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.340 
on this side you see if I get a better
angle<00:06:25.220> where<00:06:26.220> it<00:06:26.340> comes<00:06:26.550> across<00:06:27.140> the<00:06:28.140> height

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
angle where it comes across the height

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.860 
angle where it comes across the height
from<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:28.740> bottom<00:06:29.070> of<00:06:29.160> the<00:06:29.250> knife<00:06:29.400> to<00:06:29.790> here<00:06:30.180> is

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
from the bottom of the knife to here is

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.750 
from the bottom of the knife to here is
much<00:06:31.350> less<00:06:31.710> on<00:06:31.979> this<00:06:32.370> side<00:06:34.460> than<00:06:35.460> it<00:06:35.490> is<00:06:35.729> on

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
much less on this side than it is on

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.830 
much less on this side than it is on
this<00:06:36.060> side<00:06:36.330> and<00:06:37.940> I<00:06:38.940> don't<00:06:39.120> like<00:06:39.240> to<00:06:39.300> it<00:06:39.510> being

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
this side and I don't like to it being

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.780 
this side and I don't like to it being
on<00:06:40.020> even<00:06:40.350> because<00:06:40.680> it<00:06:40.830> causes<00:06:41.010> an<00:06:41.370> issue<00:06:41.490> in

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
on even because it causes an issue in

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.490 
on even because it causes an issue in
the<00:06:41.880> grind<00:06:42.150> here<00:06:42.540> you<00:06:42.900> see<00:06:43.110> the<00:06:43.140> distance

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
the grind here you see the distance

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.290 
the grind here you see the distance
from<00:06:45.010> this<00:06:45.370> point<00:06:45.640> to<00:06:45.910> the<00:06:46.120> end<00:06:46.270> of<00:06:46.390> the<00:06:46.450> blade

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:58.040 
from this point to the end of the blade
it<00:06:49.300> is<00:06:49.480> larger<00:06:49.870> on<00:06:49.990> this<00:06:50.170> side

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
I mean well there's me also the edges

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:06.200 
I mean well there's me also the edges
here<00:07:03.000> are<00:07:03.750> sharp<00:07:03.990> enough<00:07:04.139> to<00:07:04.319> shave<00:07:04.470> with<00:07:05.210> it

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
here are sharp enough to shave with it

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:07.379 
should have been knocked down a little

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:10.760 
should have been knocked down a little
