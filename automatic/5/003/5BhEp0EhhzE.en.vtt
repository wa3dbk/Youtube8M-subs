fire

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.940 

well<00:05:13.210> that's<00:05:13.360> one<00:05:13.860> nos<00:05:14.860> be<00:05:15.070> restored<00:05:15.550> Magneto

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
well that's one nos be restored Magneto

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.680 
well that's one nos be restored Magneto
instead<00:05:17.950> of<00:05:18.040> going<00:05:18.220> flat<00:05:18.820> out<00:05:18.850> and<00:05:19.180> polishing

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
the brass to a mirror finish I decided

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.310 
the brass to a mirror finish I decided
to<00:05:21.880> give<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.030> light<00:05:22.330> rubdown<00:05:22.810> on<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.110> wheels

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
to give a light rubdown on the wheels

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.040 
to give a light rubdown on the wheels
and<00:05:25.230> play<00:05:26.230> that<00:05:26.410> sort<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.680> rustic<00:05:26.920> look<00:05:28.050> still

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050

a lot of corrosion and little dents in
it<00:05:30.850> but<00:05:31.140> I'm<00:05:32.140> not<00:05:32.290> going<00:05:32.410> to<00:05:32.500> restore<00:05:32.770> the

it but I'm not going to restore the

it but I'm not going to restore the
engine<00:05:33.220> 100%<00:05:33.940> I'm<00:05:34.030> going<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.210> leave<00:05:34.330> the

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
original paint higher so I think this

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.750 
original paint higher so I think this

cylinder<00:07:19.900> that's<00:07:20.900> why<00:07:21.050> there's<00:07:21.260> so<00:07:21.349> much

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.470 
cylinder that's why there's so much

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.279 
cylinder that's why there's so much
smoke<00:07:21.770> on<00:07:21.979> startup<00:07:22.400> before<00:07:22.990> every<00:07:23.990> time<00:07:24.169> I

smoke on startup before every time I

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:27.279 
smoke on startup before every time I
shut<00:07:24.440> it<00:07:24.500> off<00:07:24.650> it<00:07:24.830> just<00:07:24.979> keeps<00:07:25.190> leaking<00:07:26.289> so

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:27.289 
shut it off it just keeps leaking so

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:29.140 
shut it off it just keeps leaking so
that's<00:07:27.560> next<00:07:27.860> on<00:07:27.949> the<00:07:28.039> list<00:07:28.190> I'll<00:07:28.580> rebuild<00:07:28.820> the

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 
set and put proper greeting them I'll

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.810 
set and put proper greeting them I'll
find<00:07:33.590> out<00:07:33.949> what's<00:07:34.160> recommended<00:07:34.789> in<00:07:34.910> anyway

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:36.820 
find out what's recommended in anyway

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.810 
find out what's recommended in anyway
