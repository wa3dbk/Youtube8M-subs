it let's say we got some more stuff in

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.350 
it let's say we got some more stuff in
here<00:02:08.190> looks<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> charging<00:02:08.879> cable<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
here looks like the charging cable the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.850 
here looks like the charging cable the
battery<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.200> thing<00:02:10.379> supposed<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.649> last

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
battery on this thing supposed to last

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.710 
battery on this thing supposed to last
for<00:02:11.039> about<00:02:11.099> five<00:02:11.400> days<00:02:11.730> which<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
for about five days which is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.540 
for about five days which is
it's<00:02:13.440> kind<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.800> weird<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.280> you'll<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.490> to

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
it's kind of weird that you'll have to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.760 
it's kind of weird that you'll have to
charge<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.240> watch<00:02:15.480> because<00:02:15.720> normally<00:02:16.380> watches

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
charge a watch because normally watches

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.640 
charge a watch because normally watches
lasts<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.280> long<00:02:17.460> time<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.050> don't<00:02:19.320> think<00:02:19.470> it's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
lasts a long time but I don't think it's

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.620 
lasts a long time but I don't think it's
that<00:02:19.740> bad<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.160> something<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.760> five

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that bad for something like this five

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.420 
that bad for something like this five
days<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.080> pretty<00:02:22.200> good<00:02:22.380> battery<00:02:22.680> life<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.100> I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
days it's pretty good battery life and I

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.610 
days it's pretty good battery life and I
think<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.760> e<00:02:23.790> display<00:02:24.540> also<00:02:24.780> plays<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> part<00:02:25.410> in

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
think the e display also plays a part in

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.400 
think the e display also plays a part in
that<00:02:25.800> with<00:02:26.010> making<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.700> battery<00:02:27.000> life<00:02:27.150> longer

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
that with making the battery life longer

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.810 
that with making the battery life longer
huh<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.860> not<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.100> easiest<00:02:29.310> unboxing

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
huh this is not the easiest unboxing

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.680 
huh this is not the easiest unboxing
ever<00:02:30.030> done<00:02:30.180> I'll<00:02:30.270> tell<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.480> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
ever done I'll tell you that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.940 
ever done I'll tell you that
