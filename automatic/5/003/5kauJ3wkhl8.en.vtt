00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello I introduce myself my name is 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.910
 vincent was neither talking to you today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 from the range of devices 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.710
 orthodox darva so I'm going to you 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.199
 present the 3 plus of that of sweat 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.410
 towers the 3 plus it's a device that 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.119
 is an antenna tri device it's a 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.310
 device that was designed to be the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.990
 easier to use and who will you 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.420
 allow both to make a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.309
 quick search efficient and also 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.690
 to do the so-called multi searches 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.579
 victims in terms of functioning 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.620
 the device is super simple ie 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.809
 we have a main button that is 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.410
 located below the device with a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.230
 security 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.660
 you just have to shoot at security 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 to get it started here you are 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.260
 have a little control 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.820
 of the screaming device will check all 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.930
 reception functions and missions 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 as well as the battery level 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.280
 so in terms of emissions the 3 more 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.460
 it is a device that transmits on a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 frequency of 457 km is the frequency 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820
 who use all the trees 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.439
 currently on the market 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.210
 we have a little more on their thorax which 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.799
 allows you to be sure of being found 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.840
 regardless of the situation in which 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.090
 we to be buried this little bit more 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.500
 it's smart technology and so has 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.259
 we have integrated a tilt sensor 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 in our devices that will calculate your 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.659
 position under the snow when you are 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.670
 in team situation 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.070
 so it's pretty simple depending on 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.570
 the position of the camera under the snow 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.850
 next if the horizontal or 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.130
 vertical this sensor is going to be able to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.229
 determine this position is to change 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.700
 his way dm on one of the three 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.860
 antennas so always a put 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.350
 optimally so that's really 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.390
 a technology to help you be 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.340
 find as quickly as possible 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.079
 no matter what this case the researcher at 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.399
 above the snow 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.690
 at the reception level now 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.180
 so we are sure 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.170
 a failover that was designed to be 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.330
 the simplest possible 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.740
 it's with his two thumbs and two 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.630
 knives so we lie 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.300
 here you see button that's that too 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.860
 it's super easy to use since 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.290
 finally you go into search 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.780
 from Iran visitors are looking for you 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.210
 always have a security that allows 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.110
 the device to reboot into transmission in 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.150
 avalanche case 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.680
 so that's again thanks to this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.830
 motion sensor inside 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.990
 if you are static for more than 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.370
 120 seconds the device goes back into 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.500
 broadcast in 4 on and valence 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.730
 if you ever have time to see 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.990
 the avalanche arrived on you when 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.240
 you are in search you can also 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.810
 have the reflex of just pressing the 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.600
 button that is in front of the device so there 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.820
 you go back to mission so the implementation 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.400
 device route 3 more cherrueix 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.920
 so we just remove the security that 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.690
 is at this level too 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.840
 turning the one puts the button in laxe 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.390
 and so the device do a check of 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.459
 its functions so emission reception 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.870
 then will tell us the percentage of 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.800
 available batteries as well as the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.650
 software version 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.930
 so here is once these controls 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.640
 have been made we see a sign to whom 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.260
 flash on the device screen 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.090
 so that means that the camera had 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.880
 correctly and so we can leave 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.560
 safely in the field 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.590
 now to move from function 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 broadcast at reception so we come 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.390
 so just to get in reception 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.150
 now only suitable 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.930
 shoot the manads that are above 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.040
 the device is here and we will have 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.750
 more information that will 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.019
 appear 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.720
 so we're going to have a direction a 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.970
 figure here as well as we're going 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.190
 also have the number of victims 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.959
 so here we see that potentially we have 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.910
 two victims under the snow while 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.830
 just handling is enough 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.200
 simple just point the arrow 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.780
 in the end of the device so if we are 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.290
 not in the axis see like these by 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.410
 example we simply have the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.250
 opportunity to come back put the arrow 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.210
 in the face of the dial 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.770
 and so you have to work building 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.000
 quite slowly with the camera especially 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.470
 in final approach when we 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.300
 expressed on this kind of distances from 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.160
 way to allow time to analyze 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.720
 information is safe but you have to 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.130
 as well well know his 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.210
 device before it can be effective 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.770
 in search now to be sure of 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.160
 be effective in multi search 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.380
 victims 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.750
 we have a function of marking to the agreement 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.100
 thorax and that on the device when you 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.419
 go locate your first victim 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:39.040
 just press the flag 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.740
 and you see the first victim who 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.150
 appears black here so and you do not have 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.160
 more than to fetch the next 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.660
 so here you follow the fishing and you 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.880
 can search up to three victims 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.940
 in this mode there with the multi 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.660
 victims for the device 3 more than 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.630
 firefox 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.300
 we have the opportunity to update the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.730
 device software so this setting to 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.250
 day is available from the dealer 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.350
 Orthodox and one can also consult 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.020
 if updates are available on 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.020
 the website www.archos.com
