00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 are all guys are eyes from 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.120
 and today we are here in a videoblog 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.589
 really guys the weeks are 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.570
 flying I say yes three years it seems 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.269
 mines to have registered the first 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.920
 video pullovers on Saturday boys boys 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 and girls we have reached 40 thousand 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.449
 obviously fully enrolled 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.400
 in a positive sense because I generally 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.930
 should know that in my mind for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 I think it 's enough 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.949
 normal I do more or less calculations 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.390
 how many subscribers a month is 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.119
 quite normal thing really is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 the latter was such a good peak 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.620
 in the history of the canal and therefore boys 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.840
 thanks for everything is really going 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.360
 great and let's continue these for one 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.950
 special 40,000 yes I could do it maybe 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.629
 he even did something very very much 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.520
 pussy and then wait for ai 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.739
 fifty years I don't know what they go through 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.210
 an idea but let's say that in this too 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.070
 video there will be a small gift for 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.960
 you curious and obviously you will have understood 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.090
 from the title is still guys now me 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.949
 I'm putting a lot of effort into doing 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.870
 all the videos he is doing then 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 let's say for me every video is very much 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.460
 special so it's a bit useless or 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.589
 hypocritical make a special because I have 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.810
 reached 50 my writings rather 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.430
 40 high we say that for now my idea 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.250
 and give the maximum in every video then 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.960
 try to always bring more content 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.090
 looking more beautiful in these years 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 before starting with the questions though 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.830
 what am i doing with the body 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.690
 I wanted to do it 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.120
 so two things we say terribly 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.530
 future series for the channel first 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.210
 if you have a lot of ideas 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.040
 original daughters things that did not appear 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.960
 the interesting facts they could 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.480
 like to write below in the comments 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.010
 I recommend second thing for videos 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.500
 I was thinking about flash 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.780
 finally this series must begin 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.550
 play off plans from the beginning then in 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.350
 this case maybe you can write me 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.970
 zombies with which I could start this 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.590
 village something quito then 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.920
 how clearly I will choose those more 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.080
 beautiful 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.300
 third thing on Wednesday this could 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.830
 exiting a video does not create them joe plasma 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.840
 of another mobile phone game 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.970
 very well known not spoiler 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.200
 every inter will be a very very video 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.270
 slight not having asked type in 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.000
 thousand and thousands of people anyway 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.369
 I thought let's say we make this video 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.540
 obviously if you don't like the genre there is 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.550
 an idea that the game can 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.100
 quietly fifty years of a 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.990
 candied effect however please it is not 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.250
 that you open the video put I don't like 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.170
 just because 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.940
 soccer clan relief queens because 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.400
 in the end if you think about that a lot 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.140
 there is very stupid dramatic music 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.220
 down here in the background because mine 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.220
 parents are watching a movie 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.330
 I do n't know if you still feel one 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.160
 fiat and on television and so I was 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.600
 saying this video will come out if you have 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.580
 want to look at it if not who cares 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.410
 But guys, don't worry, I have in 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.640
 mind of ideas second style children 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.110
 all for clash of prince 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.970
 so I recommend you stay 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.860
 stay tuned because gods will arrive 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.570
 video very much children now guys 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.220
 we then went on to infiltrate 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.200
 let's go with the saliva to the questions 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.060
 start by making good wishes 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.020
 siffredi coincidences 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.209
 I do not think I do not think 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.220
 geometric is born that is the usual 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.200
 Hacking praise veteran always goes 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.550
 very very interesting questions 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.220
 archi we will make videos about what you do 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.690
 dress TV show game will obviously do so if 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.060

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.040

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.510
 something with him attention 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.400
 we have a challenge 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.350

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.230

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.360
 cereal aims as hidden advertising 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.350
 because the china pays me to do these 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.350
 video so we hope so 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.510
 and since the biscuits are square 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.610
 sky we limit to methane 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.019

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.019

 I know you're taking screenshots 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:25.700
 It does not sit well with me the great try again 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:32.480
 then the trick and throw it in the air and 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:42.610
 take a job we are almost kids 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:42.610
 we ca n't make it we are almost there 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.520
 Yes No 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.639
 I'm all dirty or half sneezed 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.590
 killer this is written by the name 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.810
 quite ineligible to register 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.820
 with all the Democrat who's crash 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.729
 you had to put on your glasses 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.919
 with joke we actually say few is 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.260
 only tourist could have been also 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.750
 blame for the clash of class because we say 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.580
 they beat friends yesterday just from 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.220
 many hours even from sky 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.550
 everything and therefore this is one 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.770
 sad truth no joke actually 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.060
 I 'm just mine because some 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.250
 my ancestor was less then 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.040
 center-left all fan the log files 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.229
 if you don't attack us and for profits 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.510
 I would piss but I know you are 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.700
 very good and do not attack me old 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.700
 attack them to give me real trophies 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.410
 next question what would you do if you 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.729
 cancel clash of class 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.860
 you would simply find out by looking at the 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.380
 newscasts with initial titles 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.229
 15 year old commits suicide by jumping off the balcony 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.100
 for abstinence at crescia plans figured out 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.550
 on the first floor 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.470
 9 I live in a small house but have some details 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.789
 instead he asks us would you ever want to 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.919
 meet all your writings 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.600
 if so how I would like to greet you with 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.120
 some original scene from the moment 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.440
 earth then premising that to meet 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.590
 all members would be a cause 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.970
 very very impossible because you are 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.310
 40,000 you imagine how many cabbages they are 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.630
 40 thousand that is how it fills networks as in 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.900
 a stadium of modest size 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.639
 really wow is it just isn't that 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.470
 I invent strange things to do with you 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.000
 I'd just like to exchange four 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.740
 chat because I am now 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.550
 talking like a moron to one 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.349
 camera 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.660
 you are looking at a former pastor 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.030
 best striker 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.230
 of the room and this is the logic of 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.820
 xxi century 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.140
 so guys for this will avoid everyone 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.610
 that I remember you as you know to pass 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.460
 for facebook page 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:07.800
 but what is written in the title ok there 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.630
 I say calmly why your name is you 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.550
 ask the question that nobody has ever asked me 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.590
 made fi as it did each prevented 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.540
 video if I am not mistaken I had answered to 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.130
 this question is sometimes in one of the 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.990
 my first more eni if ​​I'm not mistaken in the 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.600
 First I had answered before moving 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.340
 typhoid but does not pull now are go cards 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.080
 however let's say since we arrived at 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.500
 40 thousand lusia but as an excuse for 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.880
 reveal it also because the typhoid in 300 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.980
 that you sent requests on mine 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.910
 private facebook profile so you have 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.740
 sgam 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.300
 Just I wake me because I think 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.520
 you will be a little sick because it is one 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.920
 the arches are very banal graphics 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.440
 derives from my name that jacopo chi da le 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.480
 derives from my surname which is such a sio of 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.400
 apostrophe lesio with one not like
