um<00:00:07.750> I<00:00:09.580> there's<00:00:10.580> a<00:00:10.700> write<00:00:10.940> up<00:00:11.060> on<00:00:11.270> it<00:00:11.420> but<00:00:11.600> I

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:11.810 
um I there's a write up on it but I

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.350 
um I there's a write up on it but I
could<00:00:12.140> not<00:00:12.260> figure<00:00:12.500> out<00:00:12.710> how<00:00:12.860> fast<00:00:13.160> to<00:00:14.030> push

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
could not figure out how fast to push

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.810 
could not figure out how fast to push
down<00:00:14.600> the<00:00:14.750> pedal<00:00:14.960> to<00:00:15.680> actually<00:00:16.129> get<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.490> do<00:00:16.670> it

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
down the pedal to actually get to do it

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.670 
down the pedal to actually get to do it
I've<00:00:16.939> already<00:00:17.090> tried<00:00:17.330> like<00:00:17.480> 35<00:00:17.930> times<00:00:18.260> pretty

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
I've already tried like 35 times pretty

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.489 
I've already tried like 35 times pretty
much<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:19.099> I've<00:00:19.189> got<00:00:19.460> it<00:00:19.609> down<00:00:20.359> pat<00:00:20.630> now<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.199> I'm

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:21.499 
much and I've got it down pat now so I'm

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.890 
much and I've got it down pat now so I'm
I'm<00:00:22.310> gonna<00:00:22.519> show<00:00:23.060> you<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.269> steps<00:00:23.539> on<00:00:23.689> how<00:00:23.749> to

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
I'm gonna show you the steps on how to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.339 
I'm gonna show you the steps on how to
do<00:00:24.169> it<00:00:25.480> just<00:00:26.480> in<00:00:26.599> case<00:00:26.630> you<00:00:26.900> need<00:00:27.079> to<00:00:27.140> check

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
do it just in case you need to check

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.130 
do it just in case you need to check
your<00:00:27.470> check<00:00:27.650> engine<00:00:27.829> light<00:00:28.159> like<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.699> did<00:00:29.140> so

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
your check engine light like I did so

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.170 
your check engine light like I did so
it's<00:00:30.529> pretty<00:00:30.649> useful<00:00:31.039> instead<00:00:31.579> of<00:00:31.669> having<00:00:31.939> to

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
it's pretty useful instead of having to

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.420 
it's pretty useful instead of having to
pay<00:00:32.840> for<00:00:32.870> anything<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.680> get<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:33.950> checked<00:00:34.220> or

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
pay for anything to get it checked or

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.389 
pay for anything to get it checked or
anything<00:00:34.610> but<00:00:35.420> um<00:00:35.769> first<00:00:36.769> thing<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:37.190> want<00:00:37.370> to

just<00:01:02.629> flashed

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.790 

okay<00:01:06.320> flash<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.770> once<00:01:06.920> that's<00:01:07.130> one<00:01:08.800> two

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
okay flash to once that's one two

another<00:01:14.480> two<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.970> one<00:01:17.150> flash<00:01:17.450> there<00:01:18.110> may<00:01:18.170> be

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
another two and one flash there may be

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:28.000 
another two and one flash there may be
four<00:01:18.470> codes<00:01:20.530> I'll<00:01:21.530> do<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:21.770> again<00:01:23.950> on<00:01:24.950> flash<00:01:27.010> two

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
four codes I'll do it again on flash two

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:38.320 
four codes I'll do it again on flash two
flashes<00:01:30.970> two<00:01:31.970> flashes<00:01:32.480> pause<00:01:34.480> one<00:01:35.480> flash<00:01:37.330> so

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
flashes two flashes pause one flash so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330 
flashes two flashes pause one flash so
if<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:38.960> have<00:01:39.080> more<00:01:39.410> than<00:01:39.590> one<00:01:39.740> code<00:01:40.040> it's

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
if you have more than one code it's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.750 
if you have more than one code it's
going<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:41.650> it's<00:01:42.650> going<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.920> flash<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.490> couple

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
going to it's going to flash a couple

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.340 
going to it's going to flash a couple
times<00:01:43.970> mine<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.450> keeps<00:01:44.720> flashing<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.170> same

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
times mine this keeps flashing the same

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.870 
times mine this keeps flashing the same
code<00:01:45.590> because<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:45.830> only<00:01:45.980> have<00:01:46.100> one<00:01:46.280> coat<00:01:46.610> it's

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
code because I only have one coat it's

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.240 
code because I only have one coat it's
one<00:01:47.450> two<00:01:47.690> two<00:01:47.870> one<00:01:48.110> all<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.650> codes<00:01:48.860> are<00:01:49.040> four

one two two one all the codes are four
digit<00:01:49.520> codes<00:01:49.730> and<00:01:50.030> there's<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.780> there's<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.830> link

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
digit codes and there's a there's a link

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.800 
digit codes and there's a there's a link
down<00:01:52.310> below<00:01:52.370> that<00:01:52.850> will<00:01:53.000> show<00:01:53.300> you<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.600> chart

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
down below that will show you the chart

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.560 
down below that will show you the chart
of<00:01:54.110> all<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.830> monotron<00:01:55.430> codes<00:01:55.790> fall<00:01:56.120> codes<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
of all the monotron codes fall codes and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.160 
of all the monotron codes fall codes and
what<00:01:56.660> they<00:01:56.810> mean<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:58.490> 1<00:01:58.640> 2<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.030> 1<00:01:59.300> is<00:01:59.600> the<00:02:00.020> o2

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
what they mean the 1 2 to 1 is the o2

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.830 
what they mean the 1 2 to 1 is the o2
sensor<00:02:00.770> if<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.070> get<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.430> one<00:02:01.510> but<00:02:02.510> that's

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
sensor if you get that one but that's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.930 
sensor if you get that one but that's
pretty<00:02:02.990> much<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.230> it's<00:02:04.100> kind<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.490> hard<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.760> get

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
pretty much it it's kind of hard to get

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.770 
pretty much it it's kind of hard to get
the<00:02:05.350> speed<00:02:06.350> down<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.950> feet<00:02:07.190> because

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
the speed down on the feet because

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.820 
the speed down on the feet because
you're<00:02:08.780> either<00:02:08.840> doing<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.170> too<00:02:09.349> fast<00:02:09.530> you're

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
you're either doing it too fast you're

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.770 
you're either doing it too fast you're
doing<00:02:10.069> too<00:02:10.190> slow<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.910> has<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.270> be<00:02:11.390> really

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
doing too slow so it has to be really

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.160 
doing too slow so it has to be really
picky<00:02:12.020> about<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.630> it's<00:02:14.630> pretty<00:02:14.810> much<00:02:15.020> how

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
picky about it so it's pretty much how

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.809 
picky about it so it's pretty much how
you<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.590> thanks<00:02:16.070> for<00:02:16.100> watching

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
you do it thanks for watching

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.879 
you do it thanks for watching
