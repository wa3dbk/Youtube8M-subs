transitioning<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> first<00:01:06.479> place<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
transitioning in the first place was to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
transitioning in the first place was to
get<00:01:07.409> thicker<00:01:07.619> hair<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> might<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
get thicker hair because I'm you might I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
get thicker hair because I'm you might I
had<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> length<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> didn't<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
had the length but I didn't have the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
had the length but I didn't have the
thickness<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> wanted<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.900> that's

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
thickness with that I wanted so that's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.370 
thickness with that I wanted so that's
why<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.590> even<00:01:13.860> thought<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.189> transitioning

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
why I even thought about transitioning

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.640 
why I even thought about transitioning
