right<00:01:24.790> there<00:01:24.939> you<00:01:25.119> can<00:01:25.240> see<00:01:25.360> right<00:01:25.420> over<00:01:25.540> there

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
right there you can see right over there

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.420 
right there you can see right over there
in<00:01:25.720> that<00:01:25.810> box<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.320> was<00:01:26.649> waiting<00:01:26.920> for<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.250> come

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
in that box I was waiting for it to come

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.249 
in that box I was waiting for it to come
in<00:01:27.549> here<00:01:27.790> you<00:01:28.180> can<00:01:28.329> actually<00:01:28.479> hear<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.049> comes

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
in here you can actually hear it comes

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.300 
in here you can actually hear it comes
in<00:01:29.439> right<00:01:29.590> behind<00:01:29.740> me<00:01:29.920> over<00:01:30.009> there<00:01:30.159> where<00:01:30.280> I

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
in right behind me over there where I

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.530 
in right behind me over there where I
just<00:01:30.399> looked<00:01:30.729> before<00:01:30.850> you'll<00:01:31.210> see<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.479> a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
just looked before you'll see in a

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.120 
just looked before you'll see in a
minute<00:01:31.719> here<00:01:31.869> that<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.469> PERT<00:01:32.649> machine<00:01:32.890> right

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
minute here that the PERT machine right

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.289 
minute here that the PERT machine right
there<00:01:33.159> as<00:01:33.430> you<00:01:33.549> can<00:01:33.579> see<00:01:33.700> you're<00:01:33.909> here<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.149> hit

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
there as you can see you're here to hit

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.910 
there as you can see you're here to hit
and<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.540> can<00:01:34.630> see<00:01:34.780> how<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.960> dust<00:01:35.649> come<00:01:35.799> up

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
and you can see how the dust come up

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.990 
and you can see how the dust come up
over<00:01:36.040> there<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.250> there<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.610> park<00:01:36.759> machine

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
over there and there is the park machine

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.850 
over there and there is the park machine
just<00:01:37.149> shot<00:01:37.390> into<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.570> ground<00:01:37.840> from<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.290> sky

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
just shot into the ground from the sky

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.649 
just shot into the ground from the sky
so<00:01:39.490> that's<00:01:39.640> pretty<00:01:39.789> cool<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.149> animation<00:01:40.539> how

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
so that's pretty cool the animation how

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:41.760 
so that's pretty cool the animation how
they<00:01:40.750> actually<00:01:40.869> come<00:01:41.110> into<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.320> game<00:01:41.469> and<00:01:41.710> it

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
they actually come into the game and it

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.230 
they actually come into the game and it
makes<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.039> lot<00:01:42.159> harder<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.640> survive<00:01:42.789> if<00:01:43.149> you

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
makes it a lot harder to survive if you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.399 
makes it a lot harder to survive if you
don't<00:01:43.450> get<00:01:43.539> chugged<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.869> later<00:01:44.049> on<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
don't get chugged to later on in the

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.709 
don't get chugged to later on in the
game<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:45.460> pretty<00:01:45.700> sure<00:01:45.880> quick<00:01:46.149> revive<00:01:46.360> always

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
game I'm pretty sure quick revive always

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.749 
game I'm pretty sure quick revive always
always<00:01:47.020> spawns<00:01:47.350> first<00:01:47.619> I<00:01:47.860> don't<00:01:48.219> know<00:01:48.430> if<00:01:48.549> joke

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
always spawns first I don't know if joke

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.029 
always spawns first I don't know if joke
spawns<00:01:49.030> second<00:01:49.420> everytime<00:01:49.719> or<00:01:50.020> not<00:01:50.200> but<00:01:51.009> I

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
spawns second everytime or not but I

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.929 
spawns second everytime or not but I
know<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.310> other<00:01:51.340> ones<00:01:51.640> are<00:01:51.789> definitely

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
know the other ones are definitely

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.599 
know the other ones are definitely
random<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.680> luck<00:01:53.859> of<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.009> draw<00:01:54.189> on<00:01:54.399> that

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
random so it's luck of the draw on that

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.459 
random so it's luck of the draw on that
as<00:01:54.850> far<00:01:55.000> as<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.329> goes<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.810> pack<00:01:55.990> punch<00:01:56.259> also

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
as far as that goes the pack punch also

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.349 
as far as that goes the pack punch also
spawns<00:01:56.859> in<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.340> now<00:01:57.729> there's<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.969> couple<00:01:58.149> other

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
spawns in and now there's a couple other

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.359 
spawns in and now there's a couple other
locations<00:01:58.899> that<00:01:59.079> actually<00:01:59.380> have<00:01:59.500> no<00:01:59.799> things

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
locations that actually have no things

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.410 
locations that actually have no things
there<00:02:00.490> as<00:02:00.549> you<00:02:00.609> can<00:02:00.640> see<00:02:00.789> right<00:02:01.119> over<00:02:01.299> there

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
there as you can see right over there

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.090 
there as you can see right over there
there<00:02:01.539> was<00:02:01.630> boxes<00:02:01.810> as<00:02:02.140> well<00:02:02.170> I'm<00:02:02.680> not<00:02:03.039> sure

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
there was boxes as well I'm not sure

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.069 
there was boxes as well I'm not sure
what<00:02:03.520> spawns<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:04.060> over<00:02:04.210> there<00:02:04.390> yet<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.659> haven't

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
what spawns in over there yet I haven't

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.420 
what spawns in over there yet I haven't
actually<00:02:05.170> gotten<00:02:05.439> far<00:02:05.590> enough<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.859> know<00:02:06.039> if

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
actually gotten far enough to know if

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.800 
actually gotten far enough to know if
anything<00:02:06.759> even<00:02:07.000> does<00:02:07.149> spawn<00:02:07.390> in<00:02:07.539> there<00:02:07.689> but

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
anything even does spawn in there but

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.050 
anything even does spawn in there but
I'm<00:02:07.899> assuming<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.380> since<00:02:08.560> those<00:02:08.649> boxes<00:02:09.130> were

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
I'm assuming that since those boxes were

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.820 
I'm assuming that since those boxes were
filled<00:02:10.210> with<00:02:10.330> perks<00:02:10.630> in<00:02:10.869> my<00:02:11.350> game<00:02:11.620> I'm

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
filled with perks in my game I'm

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.620 
filled with perks in my game I'm
assuming<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.250> something<00:02:12.370> wolf<00:02:12.700> will<00:02:13.180> spawn

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
assuming it's something wolf will spawn

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.270 
assuming it's something wolf will spawn
and<00:02:13.780> over<00:02:13.930> there<00:02:14.080> eventually<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.100> game<00:02:15.250> I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and over there eventually in the game I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.560 
and over there eventually in the game I
can't<00:02:15.610> think<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.820> what<00:02:15.910> else<00:02:16.060> would<00:02:16.180> spawn<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
can't think of what else would spawn and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.910 
can't think of what else would spawn and
maybe<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.810> other<00:02:16.840> perks<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.410> don't<00:02:17.770> know<00:02:17.830> if

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
maybe the other perks I don't know if

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.620 
maybe the other perks I don't know if
tombstones<00:02:18.340> in<00:02:18.460> this<00:02:18.550> map<00:02:18.700> or<00:02:18.820> not<00:02:18.940> can't<00:02:19.570> be

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
tombstones in this map or not can't be

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.330 
tombstones in this map or not can't be
completely<00:02:19.960> honest<00:02:20.200> with<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:21.220> as<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
can see here I actually go over and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.910 
can see here I actually go over and
pack-a-punch<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:23.050> gun<00:02:23.200> for<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.380> guys<00:02:23.500> just<00:02:23.530> you

pack-a-punch a gun for you guys just you
the<00:02:23.980> packet<00:02:24.250> bunches<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.580> got<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> executioner

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
the packet bunches I got the executioner

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.650 
the packet bunches I got the executioner
over<00:02:25.720> here<00:02:26.700> around<00:02:27.700> 23<00:02:28.120> there's<00:02:28.270> another<00:02:28.450> box

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
over here around 23 there's another box

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.610 
over here around 23 there's another box
right<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.140> hasn't<00:02:29.349> had<00:02:29.470> anything

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
right there that hasn't had anything

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.920 
right there that hasn't had anything
spawn<00:02:29.890> into<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.220> yet<00:02:30.400> not<00:02:30.640> sure<00:02:30.910> what<00:02:31.150> could<00:02:31.720> or

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
spawn into it yet not sure what could or

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.020 
spawn into it yet not sure what could or
would<00:02:32.140> spawn<00:02:32.410> in<00:02:32.590> there<00:02:32.770> but<00:02:33.700> as<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.819> can<00:02:33.970> see

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
would spawn in there but as you can see

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.010 
would spawn in there but as you can see
over<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.270> come<00:02:34.450> over<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.690> pack<00:02:34.810> lunch

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
over here I come over to the pack lunch

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.330
