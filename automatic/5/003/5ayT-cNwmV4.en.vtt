changes<00:05:05.289> you're<00:05:05.440> just<00:05:05.740> obviously<00:05:06.280> need<00:05:06.520> admin

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940

rights<00:05:07.260> and<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.789> want<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.000> secure

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
rights and you you want to secure

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.180 
rights and you you want to secure
desktop<00:05:10.630> because<00:05:10.720> it's<00:05:10.960> more<00:05:11.080> secure<00:05:11.440> in<00:05:11.889> case

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
desktop because it's more secure in case

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.750 
desktop because it's more secure in case
of<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.460> virus<00:05:13.060> attack<00:05:13.500> so<00:05:14.500> what<00:05:15.220> I<00:05:15.250> mean<00:05:15.460> is<00:05:15.610> the

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
of a virus attack so what I mean is the

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.149 
of a virus attack so what I mean is the
virus<00:05:16.030> won't<00:05:16.180> control<00:05:16.599> it<00:05:16.810> because<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.949> dims

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
virus won't control it because it dims

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.550 
virus won't control it because it dims
the<00:05:18.310> desktop<00:05:18.729> which<00:05:19.180> is<00:05:19.300> more<00:05:19.419> secure<00:05:19.810> so

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
the desktop which is more secure so

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.900 
the desktop which is more secure so
those<00:05:21.280> are<00:05:21.430> two<00:05:21.550> options<00:05:21.729> I<00:05:22.330> like<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:23.110> show<00:05:23.320> and

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
those are two options I like to show and

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.879 
those are two options I like to show and
