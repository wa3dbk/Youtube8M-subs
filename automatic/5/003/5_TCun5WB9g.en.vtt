00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello I'm gabriela from gluten-free taciones 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.620
 today we are going to learn how to make cookies 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.880
 gluten-free and decorate them also for 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.880
 to be able to enjoy with our children 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.480
 to prepare the gluten-free cookies what 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.150
 what we are going to need is to have a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.689
 prepared from gluten-free flours that are 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.910
 of corn potato starch rice 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.930
 also need not need 200 grams 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.380
 of butter 80 grams of egg and 200 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.420
 grams of sugar 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.570
 once we prepare this mixture 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.399
 we put them in the oven and we can cut 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.140
 before putting the oven to use 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.000
 different cutters to get the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.420
 forms that we want in this case we're going to 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.739
 use a butterfly cutter because 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.109
 what we are going to do is decorate 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.190
 butterflies elements to decorate that 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:06.130
 let's use is a roller a 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.700
 knife that has a brush edge 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.210
 let's use corn syrup and let's 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.610
 to use color fondant of course 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.610
 gluten - free fondant in different colors 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.700
 while we wait for the cookies to be 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.110
 finish baking once the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.390
 let's get out of the oven we have to put 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.330
 in grids to cool down we can 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 go forward the next step to 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.550
 this we are going to use one of the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.830
 colors that we have prepared with the 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.030
 fondant and we are going to do a job that 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.000
 it's simple we have to do two 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.790
 very easy rolls this can be done 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.040
 with the kids 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.850
 let's knead and let's make two 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.630
 red rolls this is the same 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 technique that is used with all colors 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.100
 once we have all the rolls 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.380
 Mixed with the different colors 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.310
 we are going to join we are going to place one at 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.050
 side of the other and what we are going to do is 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.950
 knead them with the rolling pin 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.870
 once we have kneaded all the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.970
 roll these together what we do is 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.010
 use the cookie cutter that 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.050
 we had in this case is that of the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.910
 butterfly but it can be done in 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.910
 any type of cutter 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.370
 we remove the excess 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.410
 Now what we are going to do is paste the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.660
 fondant in the cookie for this we are going to 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.310
 use corn syrup which is a 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.310
 product that is suitable for coeliacs 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.730
 we paint and paste it on the cookie 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.810
 and in this way we have a butterfly 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.810
 multicolored
