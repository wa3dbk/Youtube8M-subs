00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
Freddy especially so I really had a

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.370 
Freddy especially so I really had a
speculation<00:03:35.170> video<00:03:35.530> on<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:36.400> fact<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.760> this

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
speculation video on the fact that this

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.130 
speculation video on the fact that this
head<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.650> torso<00:03:38.980> on<00:03:39.490> and<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.140> mannequin

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.660 
head and torso on and the the mannequin
was<00:03:41.320> actually<00:03:41.740> golden<00:03:42.040> Freddy<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.370> nap

was actually golden Freddy a nap

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.970 
was actually golden Freddy a nap
potentially<00:03:43.300> happens<00:03:43.630> by<00:03:44.260> going<00:03:44.470> back<00:03:44.740> in<00:03:44.890> the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
potentially happens by going back in the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.920 
potentially happens by going back in the
game<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:45.310> fantastic<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.270> exactly<00:03:46.600> why

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
game is fantastic so that is exactly why

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.890 
game is fantastic so that is exactly why

especially<00:04:25.940> but<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.300> writing<00:04:26.600> was<00:04:26.660> golden

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
especially but the writing was golden

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.940 
especially but the writing was golden
then<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.470> suddenly<00:04:27.650> went<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:29.170> red<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.710> color

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
then it suddenly went to red the color

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.580 
then it suddenly went to red the color
of<00:04:31.040> blood<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.700> just<00:04:32.030> gives<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:33.110> tangle

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
of blood it just gives you that tangle

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.230

and<00:04:33.680> feeling<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.220> is<00:04:34.310> exactly<00:04:34.460> why<00:04:34.760> the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
and feeling and that is exactly why the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.900 
and feeling and that is exactly why the
writing<00:04:35.720> isn't<00:04:36.080> number<00:04:36.800> six<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.730> number

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
long cut where you see the camera

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.550 
long cut where you see the camera
panning<00:04:45.980> down<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.640> hallway<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:47.540> one<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.500> the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
hallways anyway and you can see the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.700 
hallways anyway and you can see the
arcade<00:04:50.300> machine<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.660> seemed<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.900> focus<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.440> on

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
arcade machine it seemed to focus in on

that arcade machine which it looks like

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.110 
that arcade machine which it looks like
it's<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.840> classic<00:04:54.410> a<00:04:54.560> retro<00:04:55.250> machine<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:56.090> is

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
it's a classic a retro machine that is

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.470 
it's a classic a retro machine that is
potentially<00:04:56.750> from<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.620> era<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:58.340> Fred<00:04:59.210> bears
