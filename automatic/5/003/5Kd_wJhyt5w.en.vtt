 Y 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.380
 Hi, I'm in Colombia, this is the 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.619
 first of a series of videos that I'm going to 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.870
 do touring the country from 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.140
 Now you can see my trips through the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.140
 channel 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.660
 and there is more 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.160
 to understand is why it is called the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.030
 active cloud forest and the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.030
 fog along the way 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.340
 the park is also known as the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.070
 park of the clouds and it's because by the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.240
 formation of the mountains accumulate 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.079
 easily 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.820
 the mists and the clouds creating a 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.619
 super humid environment where 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.310
 rainfall are practically 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.310
 daily 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.040
 and what I just found 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.460
 a group of llamas 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.500
 that comes to me 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.540
 and I had no idea what was here 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.480
 I hope I do not die 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.800

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.800

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.430

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.430

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.069

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.080

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.640
