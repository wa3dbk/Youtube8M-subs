from<00:01:38.490> from<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.240> type<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.810> mascara<00:01:40.439> brush<00:01:41.280> so

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
from from that type of mascara brush so

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.100 
from from that type of mascara brush so
I<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.299> carnal<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> best<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I think as you get carnal at the best of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.850 
I think as you get carnal at the best of
both<00:01:43.259> worlds<00:01:43.590> really

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
both worlds really

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.580 
both worlds really
so<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.939> big<00:01:45.479> brush<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.229> meant<00:01:46.470> for

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so this the big brush here is meant for

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
so this the big brush here is meant for
just<00:01:46.979> coming<00:01:47.520> through<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> lashes<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.149> then

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
just coming through the lashes and then

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.999 
just coming through the lashes and then
you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.479> use<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.229> lift<00:01:49.500> 20

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you can use this to kind of lift 20

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.620 
you can use this to kind of lift 20
lashes<00:01:50.340> knee<00:01:50.700> inner<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.090> outer<00:01:51.210> corners<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
lashes knee inner and outer corners and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.139 
lashes knee inner and outer corners and
coarse<00:01:51.899> underneath<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> lower<00:01:53.579> lashes<00:01:53.880> so

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
coarse underneath on the lower lashes so

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.639 
coarse underneath on the lower lashes so
I<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.500> it's

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
I really really like that I think it's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.630 
I really really like that I think it's
kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.219> an<00:01:56.729> unusual<00:01:56.969> unusual<00:01:57.750> design

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
kind of this an unusual unusual design

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.450 
kind of this an unusual unusual design
the<00:01:59.640> formulation<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.659> mascara<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
the formulation of this mascara is

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.940 
the formulation of this mascara is
surprisingly<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.759> quite<00:02:03.060> dry<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:04.079> do

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
surprisingly it's quite dry and I do

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.630 
surprisingly it's quite dry and I do
usually<00:02:05.520> prefer<00:02:06.000> dry<00:02:06.329> mascaras<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.259> one

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
usually prefer dry mascaras this one

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.940 
usually prefer dry mascaras this one
is<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.360> little<00:02:08.660> bit<00:02:08.780> too<00:02:09.080> dry<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.350> think<00:02:09.770> but<00:02:09.920> I

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
is a little bit too dry I think but I

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.440 
is a little bit too dry I think but I
think<00:02:09.979> maybe<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.700> reason<00:02:10.789> for<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.240> is

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
think maybe the reason for that is

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.110 
think maybe the reason for that is
because<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.810> brush<00:02:12.020> is<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.560> large<00:02:12.980> if<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.000> was

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
because the brush is so large if it was

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.150 
because the brush is so large if it was
like<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.300> wet<00:02:14.630> formulation<00:02:15.380> you'd<00:02:15.980> probably

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
like a wet formulation you'd probably

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.940 
like a wet formulation you'd probably
get<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.520> everywhere<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.569> um<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.680> know<00:02:18.709> it's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
get it everywhere so um you know it's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.760 
get it everywhere so um you know it's
it's<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.060> kind<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.690> difficult<00:02:20.900> really<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:21.440> do

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
it's it's kind of difficult really I do

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.530 
it's it's kind of difficult really I do
like<00:02:22.370> drive<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.819> skies<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
like drive the skies I like the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.970 
like drive the skies I like the
formulation<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.230> drawing<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.650> scholar<00:02:24.920> I

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
formulation of the drawing the scholar I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.350 
formulation of the drawing the scholar I
just<00:02:25.280> find<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.760> work<00:02:25.940> with<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.240> little

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
just find it we work with it a little

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.420 
just find it we work with it a little
bit<00:02:26.570> better<00:02:26.750> than<00:02:26.959> in<00:02:27.050> wet<00:02:27.230> mascara<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.980> letter

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
bit better than in wet mascara of letter

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.180 
bit better than in wet mascara of letter
formula<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.840> yeah<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.350> guess<00:02:30.740> maybe<00:02:30.980> that's

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
formula so yeah I guess maybe that's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.710 
formula so yeah I guess maybe that's
maybe<00:02:31.580> that's<00:02:31.700> kind<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.090> trade<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.450> see<00:02:32.630> you

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
maybe that's kind of a trade on see you

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.240 
maybe that's kind of a trade on see you
know<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:32.900> get<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.140> big<00:02:33.500> brush<00:02:33.770> but<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.100> get

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
know they get the big brush but you get

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.220 
know they get the big brush but you get
like<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> dry<00:02:34.700> formulation<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.600> therefore<00:02:36.170> we

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
like a dry formulation and therefore we

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.809 
like a dry formulation and therefore we
have<00:02:36.380> more<00:02:36.560> control<00:02:36.830> over<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.250> because<00:02:37.459> as<00:02:37.700> I

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
have more control over it because as I

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.760 
have more control over it because as I
said<00:02:37.880> if<00:02:38.180> you've<00:02:38.330> got<00:02:38.510> like<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.989> wet<00:02:39.290> formula<00:02:39.709> or

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
said if you've got like a wet formula or

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.470 
said if you've got like a wet formula or
mascara<00:02:40.190> just<00:02:40.489> smudge<00:02:40.880> everywhere<00:02:41.330> with<00:02:41.450> a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
mascara just smudge everywhere with a

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.990 
mascara just smudge everywhere with a
brush<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:41.900> size<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.770> do<00:02:42.890> quite<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.459> do<00:02:43.550> quite

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
brush this size so I do quite I do quite

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.699 
brush this size so I do quite I do quite
like<00:02:44.030> that

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
like that

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.160 
like that
um<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:46.070> mascara<00:02:46.580> I<00:02:46.910> would<00:02:47.060> not<00:02:47.209> say<00:02:47.450> is

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
um this mascara I would not say is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.990 
um this mascara I would not say is
particularly<00:02:48.830> lengthening<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:49.790> very

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
particularly lengthening but it is very

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.880 
particularly lengthening but it is very
thickening<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.810> I'll<00:02:51.410> show<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.650> all<00:02:51.739> my

see the kind of wool found out it does

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.440 
see the kind of wool found out it does
lift<00:03:05.930> um<00:03:06.700> that's<00:03:07.700> that's<00:03:07.940> very<00:03:08.209> true

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
lift um that's that's very true

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.940 
lift um that's that's very true
statement<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.959> they<00:03:09.140> made<00:03:09.320> it's<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:09.890> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
statement that they made it's it's a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.610 
statement that they made it's it's a
really<00:03:10.190> nice<00:03:10.340> lifting<00:03:11.000> with<00:03:11.180> scorer<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:12.019> it's

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
really nice lifting with scorer and it's

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.080 
really nice lifting with scorer and it's
very<00:03:12.829> very<00:03:12.980> thickening<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.670> wasn't<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:13.970> it's

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
very very thickening I wasn't so it's

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.699 
very very thickening I wasn't so it's
lengthy<00:03:14.480> it's<00:03:14.690> very<00:03:14.900> fitting<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.440> actually

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
lengthy it's very fitting and actually

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.740 
lengthy it's very fitting and actually
relieve<00:03:15.950> darkens<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.519> lash<00:03:16.940> line<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.480> that's

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
or down below but say is it's rather

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.640 
or down below but say is it's rather
than<00:04:04.910> une<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.269> mascara<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.930> know<00:04:06.019> they<00:04:06.320> came

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
than une this mascara I know they came

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.530 
than une this mascara I know they came
out<00:04:06.680> with<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.040> scandalize<00:04:07.579> version<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.420> then

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
out with the scandalize version and then

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.820 
out with the scandalize version and then
obviously<00:04:08.630> this<00:04:08.900> is<00:04:09.049> a<00:04:09.079> different<00:04:09.380> one

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
obviously this is a different one

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.190 
obviously this is a different one
scandalize<00:04:10.280> show<00:04:10.490> off<00:04:10.670> mascara<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:12.020> it's<00:04:12.140> a

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
scandalize show off mascara so it's a

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.780 
scandalize show off mascara so it's a
different<00:04:12.470> version<00:04:12.620> I'm<00:04:13.130> not<00:04:13.310> quite<00:04:13.520> sure<00:04:13.550> the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
different version I'm not quite sure the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.950 
different version I'm not quite sure the
difference<00:04:14.060> between<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.330> two<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.510> think<00:04:14.840> it

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
difference between the two I think it

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.259 
difference between the two I think it
might<00:04:15.110> be<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.290> brush<00:04:15.760> but<00:04:16.760> don't<00:04:16.940> quote<00:04:17.090> me<00:04:17.239> on

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
might be the brush but don't quote me on

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.539 
might be the brush but don't quote me on
that<00:04:17.360> so<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.620> know<00:04:18.709> I'm<00:04:18.830> pretty<00:04:18.980> impressed<00:04:19.190> I

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
that so you know I'm pretty impressed I

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:20.920 
that so you know I'm pretty impressed I
really<00:04:19.820> like<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.180> warmth<00:04:20.450> I<00:04:20.540> think<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.750> one's

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
really like the warmth I think the one's

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.140 
really like the warmth I think the one's
kind<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.260> kind<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.190> different<00:04:22.580> take<00:04:22.820> on<00:04:22.970> it

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
kind of kind of a different take on it

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.610 
kind of kind of a different take on it
is<00:04:23.330> one<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.720> plastic<00:04:23.930> bullets<00:04:24.410> which<00:04:24.500> I'm

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
is one of the plastic bullets which I'm

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.100 
is one of the plastic bullets which I'm
not<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:24.890> don't<00:04:24.950> usually<00:04:25.250> favor<00:04:25.610> but<00:04:26.330> some<00:04:26.660> in

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
not I don't usually favor but some in

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.420 
not I don't usually favor but some in
this<00:04:27.290> case<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.680> think<00:04:27.740> it's<00:04:27.950> really<00:04:28.130> really

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
this case I think it's really really

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.800 
this case I think it's really really
nice<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:28.610> I<00:04:28.910> love<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.180> fact<00:04:29.390> that<00:04:29.420> you've<00:04:29.660> got

so that's really good as a concern as

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
far as it's like so yeah pretty much I'm

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.480 
far as it's like so yeah pretty much I'm
really<00:04:47.270> impressed<00:04:47.780> it's<00:04:48.170> it's<00:04:48.560> it's<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.100> really

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
I think the formulation of it is nicer

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.080 
I think the formulation of it is nicer
like<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.840> thrush<00:04:54.110> other<00:04:54.890> color<00:04:55.190> as<00:04:55.310> well<00:04:55.490> so

absolutely<00:05:08.360> but<00:05:08.930> as<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.230> said<00:05:09.290> it's<00:05:09.500> normalling

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
absolutely but as I said it's normalling

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.160 
absolutely but as I said it's normalling
thing<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.490> is<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.730> thickening<00:05:11.090> mascara<00:05:11.420> in<00:05:11.990> my

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
thing it is a thickening mascara in my

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.380 
thing it is a thickening mascara in my
opinion<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:12.860> bear<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.460> in<00:05:13.580> mind<00:05:13.640> if<00:05:14.000> you<00:05:14.120> if
