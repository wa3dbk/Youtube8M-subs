00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
do it with the spacer it's going to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.060 
do it with the spacer it's going to
affect<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> cooking<00:00:36.930> time<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
see it that's going to burn so I'm going

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.080 
see it that's going to burn so I'm going
to<00:00:40.590> cook<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> spacer<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.790> know<00:00:41.850> we're

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.490 
to cook it with the spacer I know we're
going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.329> how<00:00:42.660> long<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:42.960> takes

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
going to see how long it actually takes

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
now on this edge here so that has had 25

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.120 
now on this edge here so that has had 25
minutes<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.720> other<00:02:16.840> side<00:02:17.230> I'm<00:02:17.709> going<00:02:18.069> to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
minutes on the other side I'm going to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.160 
minutes on the other side I'm going to
turn<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.430> back<00:02:18.459> over<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.330> other<00:02:19.360> way<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.989> have

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
turn it back over the other way and have

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.430 
turn it back over the other way and have
a<00:02:20.200> look<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.530> see<00:02:20.590> how<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:21.040> looks<00:02:22.319> what<00:02:23.319> I've

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
a look to see how it looks what I've

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.470 
a look to see how it looks what I've
turned<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.860> over<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.640> looking<00:02:24.910> pretty<00:02:25.090> soggy

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
turned it over it's looking pretty soggy

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.059 
turned it over it's looking pretty soggy
this<00:02:25.780> side<00:02:26.019> but<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.319> will<00:02:26.440> do<00:02:26.709> because

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
this side but it will do because

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.070 
this side but it will do because
obviously<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.670> juices<00:02:28.150> have<00:02:28.269> run<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> top

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
obviously the juices have run to the top

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.740 
obviously the juices have run to the top
of<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.319> chicken<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.550> maybe<00:02:30.819> one<00:02:31.269> way<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.510> doing

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
of the chicken so maybe one way of doing

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.390 
of the chicken so maybe one way of doing
it<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.200> do<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.560> bottom<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.069> chicken

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
it is to do the bottom of the chicken

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.589 
it is to do the bottom of the chicken
before<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.819> do<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.120> top

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
before you do the top

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.809 
before you do the top
however<00:02:35.349> I've<00:02:35.650> done<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.069> way<00:02:36.130> now<00:02:36.519> this

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
however I've done it this way now this

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.910 
however I've done it this way now this
is<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> way<00:02:37.239> we're<00:02:37.420> testing<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.019> today<00:02:38.349> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
is the way we're testing it today the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.949 
is the way we're testing it today the
juices<00:02:39.459> are<00:02:39.610> running<00:02:39.819> clear<00:02:40.030> when<00:02:40.569> I<00:02:40.600> put<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
juices are running clear when I put the

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.320 
juices are running clear when I put the
skewering<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.250> that's<00:02:42.459> looking<00:02:42.850> good<00:02:43.090> so

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
skewering so that's looking good so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.050 
skewering so that's looking good so

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.420

as<00:03:40.630> I'm<00:03:40.750> cooking<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.200> chicken<00:03:41.380> if<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.190> had

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
as I'm cooking the chicken if I had

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.680 
as I'm cooking the chicken if I had
another<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.180> would<00:03:43.359> have<00:03:43.450> put<00:03:43.600> the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
another and I would have put the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.330 
another and I would have put the
potatoes<00:03:44.170> all<00:03:44.319> around<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.799> chicken<00:03:45.010> I've

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
potatoes all around the chicken I've

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.819 
potatoes all around the chicken I've
tried<00:03:46.060> doing<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.630> before<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.350> doesn't

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
tried doing that before and it doesn't

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.710 
tried doing that before and it doesn't
work<00:03:47.980> out<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.280> potatoes<00:03:49.060> don't<00:03:49.269> seem<00:03:49.569> to

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
work out that potatoes don't seem to

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.449 
work out that potatoes don't seem to
cook<00:03:49.900> very<00:03:50.170> well<00:03:50.350> I've<00:03:50.590> tried<00:03:51.040> putting<00:03:51.370> them

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
cook very well I've tried putting them

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.400 
cook very well I've tried putting them
on<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.670> top<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.209> bottom<00:03:52.540> all<00:03:52.660> around<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.380> I

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
on the top on the bottom all around so I

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.680 
on the top on the bottom all around so I
think<00:03:53.560> that's<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.430> slight<00:03:54.730> downside<00:03:55.389> for<00:03:55.660> me

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
think that's the slight downside for me

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.509 
think that's the slight downside for me
if<00:03:55.989> you're<00:03:56.109> doing<00:03:56.319> most<00:03:56.440> potatoes<00:03:56.859> however

I've got plenty of time
so<00:03:59.620> next<00:04:00.010> 45<00:04:00.430> minutes<00:04:00.489> I'm<00:04:00.910> going<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.090> roast<00:04:01.209> my

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
so next 45 minutes I'm going to roast my

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.050
