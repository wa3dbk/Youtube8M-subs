00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 new 2013 from sako not herat 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.500
 minimalist sneakers very 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.160
 curious model warranty 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.340
 excess heel toe is zero then 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.139
 have Sabrina basic concept 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.050
 minimalist sneakers but at the same time 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.500
 the sole is a good 18 millimeters 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.039
 highly abrasive and highly 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 shock absorbing foam 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.260
 its plus is almost the entire sole of a virath 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.940
 made of willow plus there is only 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.559
 small heel inserts on the edge of us 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.790
 us to out of protection tires xp 900 that is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.010
 rear insert protects against abrasion 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.829
 the place where the blow falls 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.770
 when setting the heel of the active 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 setting with the heel and the front where there 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.039
 should be repulsive when 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.219
 correct technique of running under big 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.739
 finger but from my point of view it is not 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.530
 much longer life 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.549
 Virats because , after all, the main 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.030
 basis erasure will occur under 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.979
 the center of the sole speed is 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.869
 there any you are high enough but 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.490
 thought 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.439
 ropes for 500 virats should be enough for 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.880
 order to match another 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.570
 classic minimalist concept 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.420
 sneakers be as flexible as possible and not 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.930
 provides any support work 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.270
 feet 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.329
 liking the city and made of twenty 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.460
 four independent elements 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.700
 triangular and therefore 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 virrador the sole of the virata can be bent into 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.630
 almost anywhere anywhere 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.390
 in the place where our foot is not at all 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.070
 bends with this depreciation sole 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.780
 Virats 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.030
 enough even when running on asphalt for 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.090
 runners weighing up to 75 80 kilograms 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.640
 virata is narrow but not extreme 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.579
 narrow runners wide foot 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.329
 run in Iraq can be closely but 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.329
 tolerated 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:18.300
 Interestingly, the top of the virata is a two-layer 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:22.200
 first there is a thin but strong fine 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.850
 breathable mesh and inward inserted 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.280
 almost full sized sock he 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:35.510
 mesh only in place 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:40.410
 attaching the tongue and back over the top 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.710
 This sock is made from 1 hidra material 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.370
 max he is very pleasant to the touch and will find 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.340
 will be moisture 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.860
 if it would be more carefully done 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.490
 tongue and special seam attachment. 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.640
 clean you could run barefoot even 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.920
 long cross and although I have created 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.340
 impression that this sock can 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.110
 fast enough rub but on the other 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.260
 hand it shouldn't be serious 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:19.080
 affect the quality of your run in 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:21.680
 herat for runners who love very much 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.480
 minimalist shoes and crossed 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.260
 minimalist city ​​run is great 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.460
 option to lengthen your 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.670
 jogging and speed recovery after 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.190
 them for runners who 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.920
 adheres to traditional views on 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:46.430
 running year the city ​​is a very good flag 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.160
 great that made heel reinforcement and 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.330
 strengthening us to there is a cut button when 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.190
 repulsion and so if you don't have 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.070
 serious volume and chronic problems then 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.890
 have you a neutral runner and you 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.040
 a good strong foot then pick and you can 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.620
 do fast enough acceleration and on 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:13.160
 treadmill and on the highway and performs 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.160
 in competitions up to the half marathon
