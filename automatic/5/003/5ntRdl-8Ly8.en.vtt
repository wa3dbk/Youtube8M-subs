00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.619 

I<00:00:50.160> wonder<00:00:51.160> what<00:00:51.309> as<00:00:51.399> much<00:00:51.579> as<00:00:51.789> my<00:00:51.969> son<00:00:52.239> wanting

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629

I wonder what as much as my son wanting
one<00:00:52.829> he<00:00:53.910> he<00:00:54.910> ultimately<00:00:55.540> he<00:00:55.690> convinced<00:00:56.140> us

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
one he he ultimately he convinced us

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770 

the<00:01:06.770> point<00:01:07.070> where<00:01:07.280> he's<00:01:07.430> actually<00:01:07.780> designing

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
the point where he's actually designing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.200 
the point where he's actually designing
a<00:01:08.990> PowerPoint<00:01:09.530> presentation<00:01:09.620> to<00:01:10.520> show<00:01:10.730> us<00:01:10.940> is

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
a PowerPoint presentation to show us is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.970 
a PowerPoint presentation to show us is
the<00:01:11.600> point<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.990> sort<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.290> realized<00:01:12.560> just<00:01:12.830> how

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
the point you sort of realized just how

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.770 
the point you sort of realized just how
much<00:01:13.100> he<00:01:13.400> wants<00:01:13.520> one<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:16.630> there<00:01:17.630> was<00:01:17.720> a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
much he wants one and there was a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.960 
much he wants one and there was a
certain<00:01:17.930> sort<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.260> frustration<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.700> early

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
certain sort of frustration in the early

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.540 
certain sort of frustration in the early
days<00:01:20.150> because<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:21.800> things<00:01:22.040> he<00:01:22.160> wanted<00:01:22.400> to

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
days because the things he wanted to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.360 
days because the things he wanted to
build<00:01:22.760> he<00:01:23.720> wasn't<00:01:23.990> old<00:01:24.050> enough<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.410> make<00:01:27.370> when

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
build he wasn't old enough to make when

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.170 
build he wasn't old enough to make when
you<00:01:28.490> put<00:01:28.670> something<00:01:29.030> on<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:30.080> um<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:31.180> thing

MakerBot<00:02:29.130> will<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.459> into<00:02:29.610> position

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
MakerBot will go into position

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.910 
MakerBot will go into position
and<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.190> has<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.400> heat<00:02:32.580> up<00:02:32.990> yes<00:02:33.990> they<00:02:34.230> get<00:02:34.770> up

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and that has to heat up yes they get up

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.490 
and that has to heat up yes they get up
to<00:02:35.030> 230<00:02:36.030> degrees<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:37.290> doesn't<00:02:37.800> fairly<00:02:38.100> quickly

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
to 230 degrees it doesn't fairly quickly

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.410 
to 230 degrees it doesn't fairly quickly
takes<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.950> couple<00:02:40.980> minutes<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:45.000> will<00:02:45.150> draw

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
takes like a couple minutes it will draw

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.199 
takes like a couple minutes it will draw
a<00:02:45.720> shape<00:02:46.080> on<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.410> platform<00:02:46.860> using<00:02:47.850> plastic

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
a shape on the platform using plastic

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.020 
a shape on the platform using plastic
and<00:02:48.690> fill<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.620> then<00:02:50.010> go<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.850> layer

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
and fill it in and then go up a layer

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:00.460 
and fill it in and then go up a layer
and<00:02:51.209> then<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.630> again<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:53.130> make<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.340> bigger

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:30.480 

here<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.560> is
