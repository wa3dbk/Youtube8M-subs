00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
string and then I'm following up on the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.520 
string and then I'm following up on the
fifth<00:03:21.630> fret<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:23.040> 30<00:03:23.610> seconds<00:03:24.530> and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
fifth fret with the for 30 seconds and

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:39.570 
fifth fret with the for 30 seconds and
then<00:03:25.620> we<00:03:25.739> take<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:25.980> up<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.459> whole<00:03:26.640> step

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.650 

and<00:03:40.240> then<00:03:40.360> he<00:03:40.480> does<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.870> walk<00:03:41.170> down

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.630 

so<00:03:44.410> what<00:03:44.620> we're<00:03:44.800> doing<00:03:45.070> there<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.370> we're<00:03:45.490> going

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
so what we're doing there is we're going

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.490 
so what we're doing there is we're going
to<00:03:45.700> go<00:03:45.820> from<00:03:46.030> three<00:03:46.390> on<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.720> fifth<00:03:46.960> string<00:03:47.110> to

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
to go from three on the fifth string to

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.420 
to go from three on the fifth string to
two<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.920> open<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:50.260> hit<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.620> sixth<00:03:50.950> string<00:03:51.160> at

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
two to open to hit the sixth string at

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.840 
two to open to hit the sixth string at
the<00:03:51.610> third<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.900> open<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:54.220> then<00:03:54.370> when<00:03:54.610> we<00:03:54.730> hit

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
the third to open and then when we hit

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.820 
the third to open and then when we hit
that<00:03:54.910> open<00:03:55.330> we're<00:03:55.720> back<00:03:55.900> into<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.440> opening

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.970 

during<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.760> we'd<00:04:01.970> they<00:04:02.270> come<00:04:03.050> into<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.410> chorus

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
during the we'd they come into a chorus

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.260 
during the we'd they come into a chorus
and<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:06.260> rhythm<00:04:07.130> guitar<00:04:07.490> is<00:04:07.640> doing<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.060> notes

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
and the rhythm guitar is doing the notes

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.259 
and the rhythm guitar is doing the notes
that<00:04:08.630> we<00:04:08.780> know<00:04:08.930> from<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.260> beginning

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.439 

and<00:04:14.870> then<00:04:15.110> he<00:04:15.200> does<00:04:15.379> two<00:04:15.650> measures<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.340> 1/2

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
and then he does two measures of 1/2

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:43.370 
and then he does two measures of 1/2
each<00:04:17.540> so<00:04:17.959> he<00:04:18.049> speeds<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.620> up<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:19.100> this

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.250 

so<00:04:44.340> what<00:04:44.490> he's<00:04:44.610> doing<00:04:44.970> therefore<00:04:45.510> during<00:04:46.140> the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
so what he's doing therefore during the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.200 
so what he's doing therefore during the
actual<00:04:46.560> lead<00:04:46.770> guitar<00:04:47.160> park<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.670> rhythm<00:04:48.060> is

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
actual lead guitar park the rhythm is

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.810 
actual lead guitar park the rhythm is
we're<00:04:48.510> playing<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:49.080> like<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.290> G<00:04:49.560> cooler<00:04:49.890> but

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
we're playing it's like a G cooler but

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.470 
we're playing it's like a G cooler but
we're<00:04:51.630> going<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.780> use<00:04:51.840> our<00:04:52.350> root<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.480> fifth

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
we're going to use our root of the fifth

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.830 
we're going to use our root of the fifth
string<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.560> it'll<00:04:55.800> be<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.040> D<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.750> we're<00:04:57.750> gonna

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
string so it'll be the D and we're gonna

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.560 
string so it'll be the D and we're gonna
follow<00:04:58.080> up<00:04:58.350> with<00:04:58.710> our<00:04:58.890> second<00:04:59.460> finger<00:04:59.570> I'm

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
follow up with our second finger I'm

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.970 
follow up with our second finger I'm
sorry<00:05:00.780> our<00:05:00.900> first<00:05:01.110> finger<00:05:01.380> on<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.500> second

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
sorry our first finger on the second

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.220 
sorry our first finger on the second
fret<00:05:02.300> with<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.450> fourth<00:05:03.720> string

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.760 

these<00:05:06.770> two<00:05:07.070> around<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.850> third<00:05:08.060> also<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:09.650> then

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
these two around the third also and then

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:19.320 
these two around the third also and then
we<00:05:09.830> go<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:09.980> a<00:05:10.100> deep

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.790 

so<00:05:20.110> he<00:05:20.170> does<00:05:20.350> have<00:05:20.530> for<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.800> total<00:05:21.160> of<00:05:22.800> six

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
so he does have for a total of six

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.360 
so he does have for a total of six
measures<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:25.570> then<00:05:25.780> we<00:05:25.900> come<00:05:26.140> in<00:05:26.320> with<00:05:29.370> those

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
measures and then we come in with those

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.580 
measures and then we come in with those
opening<00:05:30.880> notes<00:05:31.060> again<00:05:31.480> the<00:05:31.780> lead<00:05:31.960> guitar<00:05:32.290> part

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
opening notes again the lead guitar part

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:51.040 
opening notes again the lead guitar part
at<00:05:32.710> speed

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.980 

so<00:05:51.710> what<00:05:51.860> we<00:05:51.979> do<00:05:52.129> in<00:05:52.280> there<00:05:52.460> it's<00:05:52.849> pretty<00:05:53.509> basic

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
so what we do in there it's pretty basic

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.629 
so what we do in there it's pretty basic
Brad<00:05:54.259> no<00:05:56.139> Floyd<00:05:57.139> string<00:05:57.590> at<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:57.949> second<00:05:58.460> fret

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
Brad no Floyd string at the second fret

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.490 
Brad no Floyd string at the second fret
and<00:05:58.849> we're<00:05:59.090> going<00:05:59.240> to<00:05:59.270> come<00:05:59.479> up<00:05:59.659> to<00:05:59.900> the<00:06:00.080> m25

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
and we're going to come up to the m25

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.140 
and we're going to come up to the m25
and<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.849> count<00:06:02.090> is<00:06:02.470> on<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.860> then<00:06:04.520> two<00:06:04.789> of<00:06:05.000> this

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
and the count is on and then two of this

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.450 
and the count is on and then two of this
five<00:06:06.099> and<00:06:07.099> do<00:06:07.550> that<00:06:07.699> again<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:09.129> then<00:06:10.129> we<00:06:10.250> just

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
five and do that again and then we just

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:20.279 
five and do that again and then we just
do<00:06:10.639> one<00:06:10.819> of<00:06:10.970> each

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.960 

he<00:06:21.289> does<00:06:21.500> that<00:06:21.650> again<00:06:21.710> for<00:06:22.220> a<00:06:22.250> total<00:06:22.610> of<00:06:22.669> six

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
he does that again for a total of six

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.379 
he does that again for a total of six
measures<00:06:23.449> and<00:06:23.949> then<00:06:24.949> we<00:06:25.130> just<00:06:27.789> and<00:06:28.789> the<00:06:29.060> guitar

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
measures and then we just and the guitar

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.510 
measures and then we just and the guitar
comes<00:06:29.599> in<00:06:29.840> kind<00:06:30.110> of<00:06:30.229> Paul<00:06:30.440> muted<00:06:30.860> again<00:06:31.190> and

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
comes in kind of Paul muted again and

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.680 
comes in kind of Paul muted again and
this<00:06:31.880> time<00:06:31.940> he's<00:06:32.419> doing<00:06:32.569> a<00:06:32.900> minor<00:06:33.169> to<00:06:33.740> G<00:06:33.770> and<00:06:34.690> to

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
this time he's doing a minor to G and to

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:47.100 
this time he's doing a minor to G and to
D<00:06:35.960> here

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.330 

so<00:06:48.110> that<00:06:48.260> should<00:06:48.470> give<00:06:48.590> you<00:06:48.680> an<00:06:48.800> idea<00:06:48.950> how<00:06:49.280> the

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
so that should give you an idea how the

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.340 
so that should give you an idea how the
electric<00:06:49.850> goes<00:06:50.060> and<00:06:50.480> then<00:06:50.630> they<00:06:50.750> di<00:06:50.900> take<00:06:51.200> it

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
electric goes and then they di take it

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.400 
electric goes and then they di take it
out<00:06:51.470> with<00:06:51.620> the<00:06:51.740> chorus<00:06:52.160> so
