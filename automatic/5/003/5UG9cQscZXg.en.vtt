00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.360
 the earth is changing its rivers are 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.029
 contaminated and their soils is also 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.000
 almost certainly at this step we provoke 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:36.160
 a massive extinction but before this 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.160
 diversity there is still something to be done 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.180
 the construction this is the activity 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.760
 human that generates 50 percent of the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
 pollution on earth they have is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 total mountains and finish him off with 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 complete systems to extract the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.829
 minerals needed with which 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.769
 produces the material cement that in the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.540
 Today this is not recyclable 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.930
 used to build bridges houses 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.899
 buildings and finally all the habitat in 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.060
 living human beings extractions 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.200
 cause the extinction of species 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.649
 massive deforestation and gradually 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.649
 self-destruction 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.679
 the bamboo 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 of the grass family the bamboo 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.880
 shares genetic load with pastures 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.880
 the sugar cane and the reed 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 there are around 1,200 species 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.800
 until other ideas for the photos all 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.200
 these species are scattered 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.970
 throughout the planet inhabited earth 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.030
 by the continents except for 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.030
 Europe 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 its physiological and 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.100
 harvest towards the bamboo much more 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.410
 sustainable that the wood stopping more 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.209
 carbon dioxide if you could extract 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:30.810
 with a fifth of the time in 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:32.760
 comparison to a tree every bamboo is 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.340
 You can start using the fourth year 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.739
 of seeded harvesting material every year 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.840
 premium for around 80 years 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.480
 while the average trees 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.280
 they need 20 years to be used 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.280
 and dying once felled 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.180
 cheerful earth is a session if not 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.340
 education in favor of the trust that 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.860
 put at our fingertips with demonstration 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.780
 sustainable having a duration of 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.090
 four days facilitating the lodging and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.010
 food throughout the course these 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.030
 courses are taught on the cheerful coast 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.030
 in the state of Jalisco 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.050
 The purpose of these courses is to generate 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.910
 wider awareness and teach 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.180
 the technical participants for the 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.180
 conception 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.580
 The people who attend the course are 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.410
 able to build with tools 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.140
 simple what their imagination 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.140
 allow also learn to play something 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.610
 and finally design structures 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.410
 resistant sometimes natural as 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.980
 earthquakes and floods 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.980
 overcoming 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800
 and
