what is creation and creation is taking
something<00:01:35.850> from<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> nothingness<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
something from the nothingness and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
something from the nothingness and
bringing<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.560> into<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.860> somethingness<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
bringing it into the somethingness and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.850 
bringing it into the somethingness and
so<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.540> sort<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.900> become<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.380> doorway<00:01:40.799> for

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so you sort of become the doorway for

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.289 
so you sort of become the doorway for
something<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> come<00:01:41.640> from<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> nothingness

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
something to come from the nothingness

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.700 
something to come from the nothingness
into<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> something<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.409> when<00:01:43.590> you're

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
into the something is so when you're

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.630 
into the something is so when you're
creating<00:01:43.920> you're<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:45.180> experiencing

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
creating you're actually experiencing

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
creating you're actually experiencing
flow<00:01:47.640> through<00:01:48.090> from<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.960> infinite<00:01:49.380> into<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
flow through from the infinite into the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.069 
flow through from the infinite into the
finite<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
finite and that I think that is the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.510 
finite and that I think that is the
feeling<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.680> love<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.490> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
feeling that we love so much is that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.060 
feeling that we love so much is that
sense<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.149> feeling<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.590> thing<00:01:55.920> when

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
sense of feeling that that thing when

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
sense of feeling that that thing when
you're<00:01:56.250> working<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.180> jokes<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.689> all<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
you're working on jokes and all of a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
you're working on jokes and all of a
sudden<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.170> goes<00:01:58.259> from<00:01:58.320> being<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.799> Drudge<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
sudden it goes from being a Drudge to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.429 
sudden it goes from being a Drudge to
all<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> sudden<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.090> holy<00:02:00.420> shit<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
all of a sudden it's like holy shit you

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.389 
all of a sudden it's like holy shit you
know<00:02:01.530> what's<00:02:01.649> happening<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.340> a

know what's happening and all of a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.740 
know what's happening and all of a
sudden<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.610> get<00:02:02.729> sucked<00:02:03.119> into<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.450> weird

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
sudden I get sucked into this weird

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.719 
sudden I get sucked into this weird
vacuum<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:05.189> you've<00:02:05.430> written

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
vacuum and you and you you've written

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.219 
vacuum and you and you you've written
for<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.390> hours<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.869> feels<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
for like two hours and it feels like a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.130 
for like two hours and it feels like a
second<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.099> know<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.149> sense<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.899> being

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
second you know that that sense of being

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.559 
second you know that that sense of being
pulled<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.739> momentary<00:02:11.520> current<00:02:12.150> or

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
pulled into a momentary current or

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.460 
pulled into a momentary current or
something's<00:02:13.020> coming

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
something's coming

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.260 
something's coming
out<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.770> that's<00:02:13.950> clearly<00:02:14.550> not

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
necessarily you that to me is like one

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.570 
necessarily you that to me is like one
of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.320> ultimate<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.070> it's<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> ultimate

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
of the ultimate it is it's the ultimate

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.670 
of the ultimate it is it's the ultimate
feeling<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.560> know<00:02:22.590> I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
feeling and I have a the you know I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.250 
feeling and I have a the you know I
think<00:02:23.030> if<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.240> go<00:02:24.420> by<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:24.660> idea<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.110> this

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
think if you go by this idea of this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.950 
think if you go by this idea of this
attractor<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.790> mckenna<00:02:27.150> talks<00:02:27.450> about<00:02:27.780> or

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
attractor the the mckenna talks about or

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.110 
attractor the the mckenna talks about or
this<00:02:28.140> thing<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.680> exists<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.490> hyperspace

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
this thing that exists in hyperspace

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.570 
this thing that exists in hyperspace
that<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.170> what<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.620> wants<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.130> come<00:02:32.310> through

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that it's what it wants to come through

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.370 
that it's what it wants to come through
us<00:02:32.610> into<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.090> universe<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.900> wants<00:02:34.260> to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
us into this universe it wants to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.170 
us into this universe it wants to
express<00:02:34.890> itself<00:02:34.920> through<00:02:35.430> us<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:38.180> think

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
express itself through us and I think

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.340 
express itself through us and I think
that's<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.540> compulsion<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.140> you're

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
that's the compulsion that you're

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.000 
that's the compulsion that you're
talking<00:02:40.560> about

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
talking about

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.620 
talking about
I<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.370> that's<00:02:41.550> an<00:02:41.730> alternative<00:02:42.390> viewpoint

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
I think that's an alternative viewpoint

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.770 
I think that's an alternative viewpoint
obviously<00:02:43.640> there's<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.700> cynical<00:02:45.450> way<00:02:45.630> of

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
obviously there's the cynical way of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.810 
obviously there's the cynical way of
looking<00:02:46.140> at<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.590> no<00:02:46.770> no<00:02:47.070> no<00:02:47.100> no<00:02:47.340> that's<00:02:47.700> a

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
looking at it like no no no no that's a

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.880 
looking at it like no no no no that's a
natural<00:02:48.360> inclination<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:49.290> people<00:02:49.650> have

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
natural inclination that people have

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.190 
natural inclination that people have
monkeys<00:02:50.610> are<00:02:50.820> curious<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.720> what<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.020> do

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
bounced back and forth with the idea of

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.150 
bounced back and forth with the idea of
the<00:03:36.660> imagination<00:03:37.320> being<00:03:38.720> almost<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:40.160> like

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
the imagination being almost like like

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.740 
the imagination being almost like like
when<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.550> and<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.850> have<00:03:42.030> imagination<00:03:42.630> that

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the imagination is the real force behind

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.920 
the imagination is the real force behind
the<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.769> evolution<00:03:47.459> what<00:03:47.880> imagination<00:03:48.540> truly

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
the the evolution what imagination truly

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.020 
the the evolution what imagination truly
is<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.260> we<00:03:49.380> think<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.799> as<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.040> oh<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.730> see

is is we think of as like oh I can see
things<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.540> can<00:03:51.720> work<00:03:51.900> around<00:03:52.049> problems<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.220> have

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
things I can work around problems I have

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.690 
things I can work around problems I have
this<00:03:53.459> idea<00:03:53.640> but<00:03:54.299> when<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.290> imagine<00:03:56.190> an<00:03:56.310> idea

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
where's what is the signal what is the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.010 
where's what is the signal what is the
route<00:04:37.669> of<00:04:37.820> this<00:04:37.970> signal<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.570> be<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.889> know

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
route of this signal to be so you know

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.570 
route of this signal to be so you know
mathematical<00:04:42.020> about<00:04:42.290> it<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.620> say<00:04:42.830> wow<00:04:43.310> it's

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
mathematical about it and say wow it's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.520 
mathematical about it and say wow it's
just<00:04:43.639> human<00:04:44.210> ingenuity<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:45.139> that's<00:04:45.290> what<00:04:45.440> it

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
just human ingenuity and that's what it

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.260 
just human ingenuity and that's what it
is<00:04:45.560> it's<00:04:45.860> good<00:04:46.040> old<00:04:46.190> stick-to-itiveness<00:04:46.729> and

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
know I don't necessarily know it's it is

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.750 
know I don't necessarily know it's it is
possible<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.800> imagination<00:05:01.370> is

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
possible that the imagination is

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.659 
possible that the imagination is
something<00:05:02.389> that<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.870> information<00:05:03.830> that<00:05:04.550> is

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
something that is information that is

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.100 
something that is information that is
out<00:05:04.789> there<00:05:05.060> like<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.690> idea<00:05:05.960> of<00:05:06.020> the

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
out there like the the idea of the

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.129 
out there like the the idea of the
Acacia<00:05:06.410> chrec<00:05:06.740> ERDs<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.520> idea<00:05:07.820> of<00:05:08.030> yeah<00:05:08.690> that

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
Acacia chrec ERDs the idea of yeah that

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.500 
Acacia chrec ERDs the idea of yeah that
there's<00:05:09.380> shit<00:05:09.919> out<00:05:10.070> there<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.669> then<00:05:11.090> what<00:05:11.360> we

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
there's shit out there and then what we

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.110 
there's shit out there and then what we
are<00:05:11.539> is<00:05:11.930> little<00:05:12.380> Antanas<00:05:13.010> sitting<00:05:13.340> in<00:05:13.490> yeah

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
are is little Antanas sitting in yeah

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.330 
are is little Antanas sitting in yeah
and<00:05:14.210> that<00:05:14.570> are<00:05:14.810> when<00:05:15.260> we<00:05:15.380> tune<00:05:15.650> into<00:05:15.830> something

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
and that are when we tune into something

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.670 
and that are when we tune into something
if<00:05:16.520> we<00:05:16.729> pick<00:05:17.030> up<00:05:17.060> this<00:05:17.419> this<00:05:17.900> signal<00:05:18.380> for<00:05:18.590> the

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
if we pick up this this signal for the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.860 
if we pick up this this signal for the
engine<00:05:19.100> and<00:05:19.310> someone<00:05:19.910> picks<00:05:20.510> that<00:05:20.690> up

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
engine and someone picks that up

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.290 
engine and someone picks that up
excellent<00:05:21.470> once<00:05:21.979> that<00:05:22.190> piece<00:05:22.430> is<00:05:22.639> in<00:05:22.789> place<00:05:23.270> oh

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
excellent once that piece is in place oh

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.600 
excellent once that piece is in place oh
and<00:05:23.900> then<00:05:23.990> it<00:05:24.080> flowers<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:24.979> blossoms<00:05:25.550> like

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
and then it flowers and blossoms like

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.810 
and then it flowers and blossoms like
like<00:05:26.090> a<00:05:26.120> Fibonacci<00:05:26.690> sequence<00:05:27.050> on<00:05:27.380> a<00:05:27.410> fucking<00:05:27.820> a

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
like a Fibonacci sequence on a fucking a

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.240 
like a Fibonacci sequence on a fucking a
sunflower<00:05:29.419> you<00:05:30.020> know<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.229> all<00:05:30.350> bursts<00:05:30.800> out<00:05:30.919> you

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
sunflower you know it all bursts out you

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.129 
sunflower you know it all bursts out you
know<00:05:31.570> exponentially<00:05:32.570> in<00:05:32.690> certain<00:05:33.020> directions

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
know exponentially in certain directions

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.440 
know exponentially in certain directions
and<00:05:33.680> then<00:05:33.830> that<00:05:34.220> starts<00:05:34.760> creating<00:05:35.240> more

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
and then that starts creating more

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.810 
and then that starts creating more
inventions<00:05:36.080> with<00:05:36.260> all<00:05:36.410> which<00:05:36.830> also<00:05:37.099> bursts

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
inventions with all which also bursts

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.360 
inventions with all which also bursts
out<00:05:38.060> but<00:05:38.539> all<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:39.110> them<00:05:39.320> emanate<00:05:40.130> in<00:05:40.280> the

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
out but all of them emanate in the

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.520 
out but all of them emanate in the
imagination<00:05:41.000> initially<00:05:41.479> all<00:05:41.690> of<00:05:41.750> them<00:05:42.320> have

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
imagination initially all of them have
