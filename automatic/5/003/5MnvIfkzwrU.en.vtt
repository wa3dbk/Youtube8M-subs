00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.629
 as far as sampaoli goes that you want 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.609
 the bald strategist referred to tomorrow's game with violence from the 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.039
 regularity and series that your team has reached 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.630
 the military parade on Monday, December 9 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.499
 vii 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.499
 financial regulators 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.089
 but it will not 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.700
 the directors of rr ee 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.490
 the government of evo morals in January 2009 and 2010 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.960
 since yesterday 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.580
 no no it has not been very successful and it could be valued initially 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.230
 percent 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.790
 much more point than 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.370
 although still that the performance initially does not conform us too much 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210
 percent but it would be a very solid team very 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.130
 very a preparation for 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.940
 so that in those moments where I could not 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.650
 p in him 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.369
 the traits of two million other encounters 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.160
 can win the matches 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.810
 being a teenager 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.600
 good in the last presentation the team for sure you can choose team 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.130
 of the insistence congratulations 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 that allowed us to always generate goal options 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.670
 efe but hey he has us 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.880
 outside 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.110
 p happy in which the ability to read 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.260
 ripped out too 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.860
 the results I insisted consciously that we have to keep improving for 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.050
 to fight a tournament that is competitively contested na 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.260
 I think the team is working well percent 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.740
 I think a more regular team 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.150
 in in the imposition of conduct 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.640
 after the team that have had presentations very high as Catholic 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.560
 It was the last of colo colo 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.370
 the one who thinks yes 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.090
 yes you can if you can keep the guy against rivals very well 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.940
 very very very hard very even with us 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.939
 we talk to you about 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.129
 well balanced he talked about his team manager 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.209
 follow big grass juan 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.189
 percent and keep trying to play with the ones in the middle of the court 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.029
 there is talk of an equal system to the previous semester it seems to me that 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:27.189
 For the duration of the operation in that aspect, they have still improved a lot 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.449
 and the decision 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.679
 since the implementation of old ddd kilos capacities 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.719
 40 in the previous plan have 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.369
 have made the team and 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:39.719
 do not have too many irrigations the sup 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.009
 Inter de Milan 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.989
 any go any of your equipment also has the same quality of 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:47.889
 players 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.939
 and the time can not be real 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.479
 for respect to anyone a collective idea 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.849
 then believe it, try to tell us, still have 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.639
 and concerns 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.389
 to us not 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.579
 with this kind of 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.029
 to live a little bit and to touch 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.579
 It would not be in our best interest to change the group - change club 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.739
 there are events we are very well and excited about the idea that 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.679
 Quickly solve the issue 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.569
 to keep linked this awesome 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.809
 sampaoli also made an analysis of the match by South American cup that 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.149
 have 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:27.589
 and mentioned that being in the selection I read the steps players 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.539
 all with round trips in Latin American 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.319
 tyson seven complexes 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.639
 we have 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.699
 adapt to the chile version 3 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.679
 I'm afraid that first classify 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:43.009
 Juarez theater always exempting visitors 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.629
 Now I congo with 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.040
 we passed of national happiness that national is a team that is very well 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.349
 constituted 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.349
 that has very good master players is going to be a very interesting match 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.719
 because we have very good equipment and tae mid-court forward 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.899
 and 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:01.859
 but 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.099
 undoubtedly I think that the team is proving to be recovering 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.749
 Some players 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.749
 that really of the basin of the duero the international participation 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.060
 tata torcuato player the selection excites him and generates an expectation 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:19.219
 differently we have always said what it is 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.449
 the coach of the selection does not 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.069
 makes us part of this 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.819
 of sales excitement or I think that procure that they are cited of juan at level 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.439
 international with your country's shirt 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.879
 they have a plus 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.879
 I think that because of what Eduardo shows, he has the capabilities 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.930
 to set in the selection surely good 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.880
 percent sometimes when one generates so much expectation in a player either 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.779
 will solve it in a match 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.990
 with the quality of the rival, that is, it seems to me that value may be important 

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:54.590
 future process of 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.139
 will be selected eliminatory and the world goes through the font so it has 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.930
 shown in the local tournament 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.289
 undoubtedly that the internal competition in Chile with the great singer and 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.029
 from Juarez that has 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.460
 the team becomes much more complex but 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.370
 but I hope you have 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.509
 missing a match for what 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.430
 it was developed in a way that that signal that yes they approach it to a chile 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.170
 and that the selector may have the chance to have a more
