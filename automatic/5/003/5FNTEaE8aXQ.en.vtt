00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
just make a loop and also so I can blow

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.560 
just make a loop and also so I can blow
my<00:00:52.670> nose<00:00:52.700> so<00:00:53.360> I'll<00:00:53.660> be<00:00:53.990> right<00:00:54.230> back<00:00:54.940> ok<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.000> we

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
my nose so I'll be right back ok so we

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.560 
my nose so I'll be right back ok so we
have<00:00:56.600> our<00:00:56.870> tracks<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:58.850> have<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.030> minecart

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
have our tracks and we have a minecart

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.660 
have our tracks and we have a minecart
now<00:00:59.990> we<00:01:00.050> gotta<00:01:00.440> know<00:01:00.680> how<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.040> push<00:01:01.490> our

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
now we gotta know how to push our

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.550 
now we gotta know how to push our
minecart<00:01:02.090> first<00:01:02.870> way<00:01:03.080> i'm<00:01:03.230> going<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:03.410> show<00:01:03.530> you

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
minecart first way i'm going to show you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.850 
minecart first way i'm going to show you
it's<00:01:04.160> a<00:01:04.660> little<00:01:05.660> bit<00:01:05.780> more<00:01:05.930> basic<00:01:06.440> than<00:01:06.470> the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
it's a little bit more basic than the

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.670 
it's a little bit more basic than the
other<00:01:07.010> way<00:01:07.450> there<00:01:08.450> are<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.690> few<00:01:08.900> drawbacks<00:01:09.200> to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
other way there are a few drawbacks to

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.860 
other way there are a few drawbacks to
it<00:01:09.800> but<00:01:10.040> if<00:01:10.370> you<00:01:10.430> have<00:01:10.580> limited<00:01:10.760> space<00:01:10.970> i<00:01:11.600> would

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
it but if you have limited space i would

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.560 
it but if you have limited space i would
recommend<00:01:12.410> this<00:01:12.560> method<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:14.060> what<00:01:14.450> you're

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
recommend this method so what you're

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.190 
recommend this method so what you're
going<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.870> want<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.110> do<00:01:15.230> is<00:01:16.600> put<00:01:17.600> down<00:01:17.630> for

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
going to want to do is put down for

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.500 
going to want to do is put down for
rails<00:01:18.560> all<00:01:19.340> right<00:01:19.790> next<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.060> each<00:01:20.120> other<00:01:20.270> and

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
rails all right next to each other and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.170 
rails all right next to each other and
i'll<00:01:20.600> make<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.780> circle<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:21.950> then<00:01:22.160> you're<00:01:23.060> going

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
i'll make a circle so then you're going

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.300 
i'll make a circle so then you're going
to<00:01:23.240> take<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:24.170> mine<00:01:24.410> cards<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:24.950> put<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.190> on

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
to take to mine cards and put it on

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.830 
to take to mine cards and put it on
there<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:27.860> kind<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.310> changes<00:01:28.909> depending<00:01:29.720> on

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
there I it kind of changes depending on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.480 
there I it kind of changes depending on
which<00:01:29.990> direction<00:01:30.020> you're<00:01:30.560> going<00:01:30.590> but<00:01:31.010> you

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
which direction you're going but you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.250 
which direction you're going but you
have<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.730> put<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.240> right<00:01:32.540> next<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:32.990> each<00:01:33.020> other

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
have to put to right next to each other

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.800 
have to put to right next to each other
and<00:01:34.300> they<00:01:35.300> should<00:01:35.540> be<00:01:35.570> going

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
and they should be going

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.980 
and they should be going
counterclockwise<00:01:36.620> if<00:01:37.340> it's<00:01:37.490> working

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
counterclockwise if it's working

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.330 
counterclockwise if it's working
correctly<00:01:40.540> ok<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.440> seems<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:43.040> be<00:01:43.130> working

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
correctly ok so that seems to be working

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.300 
correctly ok so that seems to be working
so<00:01:46.540> let's<00:01:47.540> give<00:01:47.870> it<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:48.020> go<00:01:48.050> oh<00:01:48.380> there's<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.040> pig

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.850 

Oh<00:02:02.570> framerate<00:02:03.570> issues<00:02:05.510> yes<00:02:06.510> okay<00:02:07.170> anyway<00:02:07.560> it's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
Oh framerate issues yes okay anyway it's

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
Oh framerate issues yes okay anyway it's
working<00:02:08.340> ah<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.580> little

working ah as you can see this little

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.990 
working ah as you can see this little
thing<00:02:12.210> is<00:02:12.240> boosted<00:02:12.870> our<00:02:12.990> mine<00:02:13.230> cart<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:17.000> from

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
thing is boosted our mine cart and from

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.820 
thing is boosted our mine cart and from
what<00:02:18.150> I've<00:02:18.270> seen<00:02:18.300> they<00:02:18.600> go<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.200> pretty<00:02:19.680> much

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
what I've seen they go on pretty much

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.950 
what I've seen they go on pretty much
forever<00:02:20.130> when<00:02:20.520> they're<00:02:20.670> boosting<00:02:20.850> I'm<00:02:21.810> not

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
forever when they're boosting I'm not

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.700 
forever when they're boosting I'm not
sure<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.470> oh<00:02:22.770> jeez<00:02:23.520> i'm<00:02:23.670> lagging<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:25.260> i<00:02:25.350> got

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.960 
sure really oh jeez i'm lagging so i got
a<00:02:25.740> rear<00:02:25.980> ender<00:02:26.959> alright<00:02:27.959> that's<00:02:28.110> better<00:02:28.970> okay

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
a rear ender alright that's better okay

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.910 
a rear ender alright that's better okay
um<00:02:31.040> Jesus<00:02:32.040> damn<00:02:32.250> Pig<00:02:34.910> get<00:02:35.910> back<00:02:36.120> here<00:02:36.150> okay

um Jesus damn Pig get back here okay
alright<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:39.600> definitely<00:02:39.870> has<00:02:40.110> drawbacks

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
alright so this definitely has drawbacks

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.770 
alright so this definitely has drawbacks
as<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.920> can<00:02:41.040> see<00:02:41.220> sometimes<00:02:41.760> it'll<00:02:42.030> go<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
as you can see sometimes it'll go in the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.560 
as you can see sometimes it'll go in the
wrong<00:02:42.900> direction<00:02:42.959> or<00:02:43.650> whatever<00:02:44.450> sometimes<00:02:45.450> it

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
wrong direction or whatever sometimes it

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.320 
wrong direction or whatever sometimes it
can<00:02:45.690> get<00:02:45.810> stuck<00:02:46.110> you'll<00:02:46.380> see<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> other

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
can get stuck you'll see so the other

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.290 
can get stuck you'll see so the other
way<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.709> boost<00:02:50.250> your<00:02:50.430> mind<00:02:50.670> cards<00:02:51.030> I

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
way that you can boost your mind cards I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.580 
way that you can boost your mind cards I
would<00:02:51.840> recommend<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:54.200> pretty<00:02:55.200> much<00:02:55.380> no

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
would recommend it it's a pretty much no

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.449 
would recommend it it's a pretty much no
maintenance<00:02:55.830> once<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.400> put<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.670> down<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.459> I'm

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
maintenance once you put it down so I'm

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.240 
maintenance once you put it down so I'm
going<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.730> cut<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> video<00:03:00.120> here<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.250> i'll

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
going to cut the video here and i'll

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.430 
going to cut the video here and i'll
make<00:03:02.760> one<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.150> those<00:03:03.590> things<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:06.320> don't<00:03:07.320> know

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440

here<00:03:15.600> pretty<00:03:16.380> basic<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:17.150> it'll<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.330> trick

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
here pretty basic but it'll do the trick

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.280 
here pretty basic but it'll do the trick
so<00:03:20.570> first<00:03:21.570> thing<00:03:21.750> you're<00:03:21.870> going<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.019> want<00:03:22.110> to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so first thing you're going to want to

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.009 
so first thing you're going to want to
do<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:23.060> make<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.530> second<00:03:25.530> ah<00:03:26.959> way<00:03:27.959> of

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
do to make this second ah way of

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.180 
do to make this second ah way of
boosting<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:29.120> place<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.360> block<00:03:30.980> right<00:03:31.980> where

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
boosting is place a block right where

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.370 
boosting is place a block right where
you<00:03:32.280> want<00:03:32.459> your<00:03:32.610> track<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.450> then<00:03:34.170> right

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
you want your track to be and then right

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.470 
you want your track to be and then right
next<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.739> block<00:03:35.160> place<00:03:35.760> another<00:03:36.150> block

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
next to that block place another block

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.070 
next to that block place another block
and<00:03:37.700> on<00:03:38.700> your<00:03:39.120> first<00:03:39.330> block<00:03:39.600> you're<00:03:39.870> going<00:03:39.900> to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
and on your first block you're going to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.030 
and on your first block you're going to
place<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.739> rail<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.670> top<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.200> then<00:03:43.890> in

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
place a rail on top of it and then in

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.400 
place a rail on top of it and then in
the<00:03:44.160> direction<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.790> want<00:03:45.140> your<00:03:46.140> track

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
the direction that you want your track

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.070 
the direction that you want your track
to<00:03:46.560> go<00:03:46.739> for<00:03:47.400> me<00:03:47.489> it's<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.850> way<00:03:48.000> you're<00:03:48.750> going

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
to just make a track simple enough and

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.110 
to just make a track simple enough and
so<00:03:55.049> now<00:03:55.080> for<00:03:55.590> your<00:03:55.799> second<00:03:56.579> block<00:03:56.820> right<00:03:57.090> here

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
this is going to be another track you

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.130 
this is going to be another track you
need<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.530> for<00:04:01.709> boosting<00:04:02.239> you're<00:04:03.239> just<00:04:03.480> not

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
need this for boosting you're just not

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.900 
need this for boosting you're just not
going<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.650> put<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.829> rail<00:04:05.040> here<00:04:05.459> you're<00:04:05.670> just

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
going to put a rail here you're just

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.360 
going to put a rail here you're just
going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.269> put<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.690> rail<00:04:07.019> there<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.650> make<00:04:08.190> it

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
going to put a rail there and make it

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.290 
going to put a rail there and make it
shorter<00:04:08.790> track<00:04:09.440> okay<00:04:10.440> um

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.780 

so<00:04:13.650> then<00:04:14.650> what<00:04:14.800> you're<00:04:14.890> going<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.070> do<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:15.520> make

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
so then what you're going to do is make

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.009 
so then what you're going to do is make
a<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.600> upward<00:04:17.470> incline<00:04:17.890> I'd<00:04:18.610> say<00:04:18.910> usually<00:04:19.720> at

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
a and upward incline I'd say usually at

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.410 
a and upward incline I'd say usually at
least<00:04:20.080> four<00:04:20.500> high<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.880> should<00:04:22.120> do<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.270> trick

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
least four high that should do the trick

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:44.490 
least four high that should do the trick
for<00:04:24.300> both<00:04:25.300> tracks<00:04:29.130> okay<00:04:42.570> okay<00:04:43.570> so<00:04:44.320> we<00:04:44.470> have

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
for both tracks okay okay so we have

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.010 
for both tracks okay okay so we have
that<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.100> then<00:04:45.430> just<00:04:45.790> for<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:46.210> track<00:04:46.540> here

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
that and then just for this track here

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.570 
that and then just for this track here
we're<00:04:47.650> going<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.190> make<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.550> downward<00:04:49.060> incline

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
we're going to make a downward incline

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.770 
we're going to make a downward incline
ok<00:04:52.230> so<00:04:53.490> finish<00:04:54.490> up<00:04:54.670> your<00:04:54.700> first<00:04:55.180> track<00:04:55.510> just

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
ok so finish up your first track just

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:10.050 
ok so finish up your first track just
follow<00:04:56.320> it<00:04:56.500> through<00:05:02.880> already<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:08.910> now<00:05:09.910> what

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
follow it through already and now what

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
you're going to do is start making your

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.930 
you're going to do is start making your
second<00:05:12.220> track<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:15.280> then<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.460> have<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:15.670> make

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
second track and then you have to make

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:23.780 
second track and then you have to make
this<00:05:17.790> one<00:05:18.790> higher<00:05:20.460> but<00:05:21.460> then<00:05:21.640> you're<00:05:21.820> going<00:05:21.910> to

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
this one higher but then you're going to

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.600 
this one higher but then you're going to
get<00:05:24.790> rid<00:05:24.940> of<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:25.240> track<00:05:26.110> or<00:05:26.590> rail<00:05:27.010> right<00:05:27.280> here

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
get rid of this track or rail right here

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.159 
get rid of this track or rail right here
and<00:05:28.180> you're<00:05:28.270> going<00:05:28.390> to<00:05:28.450> put<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.600> block<00:05:28.900> right

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
and you're going to put a block right

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.950 
and you're going to put a block right

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
there so let me show you what the point

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.720 
there so let me show you what the point
of<00:05:32.080> this<00:05:32.200> is<00:05:33.600> here's<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.810> boosting<00:05:35.400> mine<00:05:36.400> cart

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
of this is here's the boosting mine cart

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.550 
of this is here's the boosting mine cart
and<00:05:36.820> here's<00:05:37.690> where<00:05:37.840> you're<00:05:37.990> mine<00:05:38.169> carts<00:05:38.470> going

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
and here's where you're mine carts going

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.420 
and here's where you're mine carts going
to<00:05:38.680> be<00:05:39.180> so<00:05:40.440> pretty<00:05:41.440> much<00:05:41.650> when<00:05:42.130> you're<00:05:42.220> mine

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
to be so pretty much when you're mine

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.340 
to be so pretty much when you're mine
cart<00:05:42.730> goes<00:05:42.880> down<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.810> I'll<00:05:43.930> start<00:05:44.140> hitting

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
cart goes down and I'll start hitting

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.050 
cart goes down and I'll start hitting
against<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.680> boosting<00:05:45.070> mine<00:05:45.220> cart<00:05:45.520> and<00:05:45.610> it'll

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
against the boosting mine cart and it'll

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.530 
against the boosting mine cart and it'll
just<00:05:46.090> glitch<00:05:46.450> out<00:05:46.630> pretty<00:05:46.870> much<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:48.540> just

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
just glitch out pretty much and just

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.740 
just glitch out pretty much and just
boost<00:05:50.530> it<00:05:50.740> pretty<00:05:50.919> much<00:05:51.070> so<00:05:51.760> when<00:05:52.300> it<00:05:52.390> gets<00:05:52.540> the

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
boost it pretty much so when it gets the

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.860 
boost it pretty much so when it gets the
top<00:05:53.020> here<00:05:53.880> this<00:05:54.880> buying<00:05:55.150> car<00:05:55.390> can't<00:05:55.600> go<00:05:55.660> any

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
top here this buying car can't go any

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.540 
top here this buying car can't go any
further<00:05:56.110> since<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.800> hits<00:05:56.980> right<00:05:57.160> there<00:05:57.190> so

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
further since it hits right there so

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.550 
further since it hits right there so
i'll<00:05:57.669> just<00:05:57.700> go<00:05:58.030> back<00:05:58.060> there<00:05:58.419> and<00:05:58.570> reset<00:05:59.320> itself

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
i'll just go back there and reset itself

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.650 
i'll just go back there and reset itself
or<00:05:59.710> the<00:05:59.770> next<00:05:59.980> time<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:00.580> it's<00:06:00.700> pretty<00:06:01.240> much<00:06:01.360> no

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
or the next time so it's pretty much no

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.380 
or the next time so it's pretty much no
maintenance<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:03.220> it<00:06:03.400> works<00:06:03.550> great<00:06:03.730> let's<00:06:04.120> try

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
maintenance and it works great let's try

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
maintenance and it works great let's try
it<00:06:04.450> out<00:06:07.950> ok<00:06:09.060> seems<00:06:10.060> to<00:06:10.210> work<00:06:10.240> be<00:06:10.720> working<00:06:11.140> so<00:06:11.320> if

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
it out ok seems to work be working so if

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:22.550 
it out ok seems to work be working so if

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
those are you two basic ways of making

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.410 
those are you two basic ways of making
boosters<00:06:30.670> for<00:06:31.090> mine<00:06:31.690> cart<00:06:32.200> tracks<00:06:34.590> so
