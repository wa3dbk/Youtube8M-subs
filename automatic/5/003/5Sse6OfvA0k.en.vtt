00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.610
 U 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.810
 U 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:23.450
 Those people think that a person handapnida 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:27.260
 I 'm just as naughty as I am. 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:33.250
 There are two kinds of people in the world. 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.250
 If you know a good person, 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.020
 1 Ah 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.720
 There's a good guy at first sight. 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.620
 Looking a little more sagyeo 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.470
 If you look a little longer, there are nice people. 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.030
 So, after all, it's a good deal. 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.269
 Yes Yes 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.800
 But I believe that. 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:03.320
 Known as a good man, a good look alive 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.320
 That's what we really are . 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:14.500
 Do not try to read it. 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:21.100
 It must be strong again because it is strong to defeat someone 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:24.460
 It's not strong, but it's strong enough to protect me and protect someone. 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.460
 Why are you so strong to keep strong 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:33.850
 When I try to protect my child, I get stronger. 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:39.520
 She's strong. She's weak, but she's strong. 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:45.160
 Why should I keep it? 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.030
 The strength to live it is that we must be equipped to defeat it through this performance. 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.850
 It's possible 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 Because if you do not have a puppy, you do not know yourself. 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.450
 I get stuck in that or something. 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.860
 If it is strong then it is not. 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:09.610
 A really strong person does not grumble or discern 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:11.380
 But when it weakens, the body becomes weaker and the heart becomes weaker , and from then on, 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.350
 I can not help it. 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.069
 There is no one to ride because I want to ride. 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.780
 It's not . 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:27.590
 But it's weak. So you have to be strong. 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.239
 North and do not scatter profusely second reading when a man is what he wants 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.719
 To achieve 1 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:39.340
 It comes to this kind of sparse 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:43.280
 If you get bored, but if you become strong, you will defend yourself to protect people 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.530
 To be strong to defend someone 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:54.379
 I will not forget the original purpose of that. 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:57.970
 So the person who met the law is the one who met the law is bright and strong 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:02.860
 Yes. Bright and strong. 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:08.980
 So bright and strong Forever in my original look 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.730
 Originally that's what I look like. I originally declared it bright and strong, and that 's what I saw. 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.600
 I will. 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:19.780
 Enlarge The original 2000 Act through prayer times through the execution that's my 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.400
 I'm trying to get back through it. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.190
 I do not mean to say good-bye . 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.660
 I do not mean to be ignored if you are good. 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:37.090
 If the stronger will be the Cheonan, O good man charm 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:43.090
 Through prayer, you must receive a lot of energy. 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.500
 Times every day, every breath so whenever there every day, every moment sunga long day 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.850
 Get it 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:58.209
 If you receive what you received, do not be afraid again. 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:05.380
 Write and write some change being looked translate from the practice associated color isnt practice 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:11.500
 Saenga'll become stronger like some diamonds while now largely repeated many times 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:18.940
 The good of these good-hearted guests 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:21.790
 Constitute a very important cultural spirit of civilization'll be the one foundation 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.890
 I will ride my own good heart. 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:32.200
 That's why I'm getting out of the second round 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:35.010
 I sincerely ask you to make your efforts to become a strong cloth 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.010
 I hope
