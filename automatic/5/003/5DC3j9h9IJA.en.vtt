00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.189
 the plank 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.120
 as I told you there are two ways to 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:11.519
 cut them there is one that is doing without the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.639
 edge for example you do not make the cut 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.859
 this and more circus if it's the clamp as if 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.460
 it was a clamp and there you will form the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.169
 table but in this case when the cloth 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.169
 it's thick then 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.340
 be thick totally what the race 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.630
 here what is done is we have a 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.580
 eyelash 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.920
 in this case and he 's dialing three 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.500
 quarters of an inch here I put you one 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.330
 inch and a half and an inch 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.400
 up and three quarters and there 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.710
 just this side because you what are you going 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.680
 to do is cut here all this you're going 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.290
 to cut you are going to increase your tab here 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.920
 and short but you're going to cut already doing 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.920
 that rectangle 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.809
 after that cuts is why 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.790
 you stop I put you half because because the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.040
 back of the front 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.560
 wear sewing 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.550
 she is going to do right now is feet 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 in this part of here 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.480
 and put the other one back 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.840
 the molds I think it's going to be here yes 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.830
 and and when some pickets are made are 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.890
 notched snitches that you're my dad to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.870
 that when she is already going to be already 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 start to put together what you have to do 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.150
 first is to double what is going to talk like that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.940
 found because it's going to be a table 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.120
 find then you have to iron 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.000
 how we make the pants is the break 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.020
 of a September mix then yes already 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 can you re-unfold you can 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.939
 about giving this part and start putting together 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.939
 that is, city is part of the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.350
 the owner has to do this 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.680
 corresponding tab 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.750
 but if you make a promise you are going to 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.500
 mark the doubles 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.100
 What is it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.060
 this 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.120
 so but it takes from you 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.520
 disarm in the skirt makes a stroke 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.560
 they have to make increases accounting 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.380
 that we are seeing as a power 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.940
 the blows that we are doing as a 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.920
 starts in one piece when it arrives 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.830
 see that the table is below 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.260
 you make a broad being here 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.590
 but you should always place the line or 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.260
 the length of the skirt on a line in a 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.530
 base 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.959
 so that we do not strain or leave like this 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.700
 like waves because if you do not do not do this 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.769
 we are hanging 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.450
 it increases once you do 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.569
 of account that you are online 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.909
 initiative and they increased an inch and 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.090
 she so that a thumb in it what 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.280
 is going to be after that is to mark the 14 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.180
 who told him it's going to be what he's going to 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.269
 form your board 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.510
 but since otherwise it will be 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.510
 A) Yes 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.240
 or you are going to see guardianships and mediates the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.890
 time to form the plank will be more 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.890
 deep and down 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.650
 there are others who arrive even wearing the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.650
 increase 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.860
 as it seems to me then when does the 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.240
 line 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.240
 why 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.930
 how are they when school 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.540
 morning 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.220
 at least one they will draw it for 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.220
 to see how they are for the environments 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.030
 so 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.589
 not so much cloth but to make the arm and 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.930
 and nothing else I explain how to place 

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:40.559
 blatter but the way they are placed is 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.159
 so you get twice its width 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:47.249
 of cloth make picket samples what 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:49.949
 want and they are going to double the two halves 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.139
 the sleeves folded and found for 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.320
 than the exact third so that 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:05:01.330
 doubles centers 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:03.550
 so when they carry tables 5 other x 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.900
 or that the guy who has to have center 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.900
 back and center of the table 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.960
 sir that guy 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.210
 that is all
