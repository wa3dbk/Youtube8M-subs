with the mini at least that was our
first<00:01:59.409> annual<00:01:59.620> cobblestone<00:02:00.250> stuff<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.580> you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
first annual cobblestone stuff and you

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.760 
first annual cobblestone stuff and you
know<00:02:00.730> we're<00:02:00.909> back<00:02:01.090> at<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.330> again<00:02:01.480> with<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:02.350> e63

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
know we're back at it again with the e63

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.710 
know we're back at it again with the e63
and<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.190> know<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.370> it's<00:02:04.240> not<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.540> bad

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
and you know it it's not so bad

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.970 
and you know it it's not so bad
especially<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.350> comforts<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.770> and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
especially the comforts that and

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.830 
especially the comforts that and
especially<00:02:06.040> its<00:02:06.550> kind<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.120> tailing<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.750> all

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
especially its kind of tailing it all

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.330 
especially its kind of tailing it all
right<00:02:08.050> i<00:02:08.080> mean<00:02:08.229> when<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.500> go<00:02:08.679> over<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.860> big<00:02:09.069> bump

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
right i mean when you go over a big bump

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.399 
right i mean when you go over a big bump
it's<00:02:09.519> a<00:02:09.610> little<00:02:09.879> a<00:02:09.909> little<00:02:10.090> bit<00:02:10.659> of<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> chatter

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
it's a little a little bit of a chatter

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.320 
it's a little a little bit of a chatter
but<00:02:11.800> it's<00:02:11.920> not<00:02:12.099> too<00:02:12.280> horrendous<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.239> know

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
but it's not too horrendous and you know

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.280 
but it's not too horrendous and you know
i<00:02:13.360> think<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.629> kind<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.810> speaks<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
i think that kind of speaks to the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.339 
i think that kind of speaks to the
refinement<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.069> e63<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.690> can<00:02:16.959> go<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
refinement of the e63 it can go in the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.500 
refinement of the e63 it can go in the
city<00:02:17.530> if<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.709> wanted<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.129> unlike<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> Nissan

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
city if you wanted to unlike a Nissan

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.420 
city if you wanted to unlike a Nissan
GTR<00:02:19.840> which<00:02:20.200> will<00:02:20.409> be<00:02:20.560> absolutely<00:02:21.129> miserable

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
GTR which will be absolutely miserable

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.270 
GTR which will be absolutely miserable
and<00:02:22.269> now<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.390> brought<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> GTR<00:02:23.170> into<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.739> have

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
and now I brought the GTR into it I have

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.920 
and now I brought the GTR into it I have
to<00:02:24.370> hit<00:02:24.459> on<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> certain<00:02:25.000> point<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.629> sit

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
to hit on a certain point when you sit

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.380 
to hit on a certain point when you sit
inside<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.409> GTR<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.819> have<00:02:28.000> all<00:02:28.269> these

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
inside the GTR you have all these

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.030 
inside the GTR you have all these
mechanisms<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.260> all<00:02:29.409> around<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.830> hear

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
mechanisms going on all around you hear

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.290 
mechanisms going on all around you hear
the<00:02:30.129> transmission<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.269> differential

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
the transmission the differential

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.640 
the transmission the differential
here<00:02:32.540> are<00:02:32.600> all<00:02:32.690> these<00:02:32.780> things<00:02:33.020> working<00:02:33.380> around

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
here are all these things working around

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.310 
here are all these things working around
you<00:02:33.860> now<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.940> e63<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:35.840> refined<00:02:36.140> you

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
you now in the e63 it's so refined you

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.320 
you now in the e63 it's so refined you
don't<00:02:36.470> hear<00:02:36.560> any<00:02:36.710> of<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:36.890> stuff<00:02:37.180> it's<00:02:38.180> kind

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
don't hear any of that stuff it's kind

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.930 
don't hear any of that stuff it's kind
of<00:02:38.420> like<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.570> Swiss<00:02:38.840> watch<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.830> just<00:02:40.040> works<00:02:40.310> you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
of like a Swiss watch it just works you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.070 
of like a Swiss watch it just works you
know<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.090> don't<00:02:41.360> hear<00:02:41.510> really<00:02:41.690> much<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.930> a

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
know you don't hear really much of a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.510 
know you don't hear really much of a
tick<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.530> just<00:02:42.680> kind<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:42.890> does<00:02:43.070> what<00:02:43.280> it's<00:02:43.370> got

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
tick it just kind of does what it's got

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.460 
tick it just kind of does what it's got
to<00:02:43.550> do<00:02:43.790> being<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.990> mercedes-benz

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
to do being that this is a mercedes-benz

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.650 
to do being that this is a mercedes-benz
you<00:02:46.040> would<00:02:46.130> expect<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.790> deliver<00:02:47.150> on<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
you would expect it to deliver on the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.170 
you would expect it to deliver on the
luxury<00:02:48.050> front<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.650> does<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.190> spades<00:02:49.820> I

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
luxury front and it does in spades I

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.870 
luxury front and it does in spades I
mean<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.440> example<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:52.070> seats<00:02:52.310> there's<00:02:52.790> so

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
mean for example the seats there's so

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.400 
mean for example the seats there's so
much<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.120> talk<00:02:53.180> about<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.690> don't<00:02:54.170> know<00:02:54.230> where<00:02:54.350> to

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
much to talk about I don't know where to

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.600 
much to talk about I don't know where to
begin<00:02:54.500> their<00:02:55.250> active<00:02:55.790> ventilated<00:02:56.720> heated

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
begin their active ventilated heated

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.280 
begin their active ventilated heated

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
massaging and the bolsters tighten

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.700 
massaging and the bolsters tighten
around<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:01.510> but<00:03:02.510> there's<00:03:03.140> also<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.440> little<00:03:03.590> bit

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
around you but there's also a little bit

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.340 
around you but there's also a little bit
of<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.950> negative<00:03:04.280> point<00:03:04.460> i<00:03:04.670> mean<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.900> interiors

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
of a negative point i mean the interiors

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.050 
of a negative point i mean the interiors
a<00:03:06.380> little<00:03:06.680> bit<00:03:06.770> chin<00:03:07.010> see<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.670> know<00:03:07.790> i<00:03:07.820> hate<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
a little bit chin see you know i hate to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.670 
a little bit chin see you know i hate to
