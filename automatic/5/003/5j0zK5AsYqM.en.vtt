now<00:00:16.289> here's<00:00:16.560> your<00:00:16.740> f150<00:00:17.400> bracket<00:00:17.940> this

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
now here's your f150 bracket this

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.609 
now here's your f150 bracket this
portion<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> plate<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.439> mount

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
portion of the plate is going to mount

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.529 
portion of the plate is going to mount
to<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> pinch<00:00:20.070> weld<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.880> rocker<00:00:21.090> panel

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
to the pinch weld this the rocker panel

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.679 
to the pinch weld this the rocker panel
pretty<00:00:22.020> much<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.150> now<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> factory

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
pretty much just like so now the factory

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.950 
pretty much just like so now the factory
locations<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.529> mounting<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.550> step<00:00:27.150> is

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
locations for mounting this this step is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.349 
locations for mounting this this step is
a<00:00:28.349> lot<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.070> times<00:00:29.220> covered<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:29.849> tape

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
a lot of times covered up by tape

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.759 
a lot of times covered up by tape
especially<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:30.960> you've<00:00:31.050> never<00:00:31.199> had<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
especially if you've never had a a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.010 
especially if you've never had a a
running<00:00:32.040> board<00:00:32.329> installed<00:00:33.329> from<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> factory

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
running board installed from the factory

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
running board installed from the factory
so<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.710> you'll<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.070> you'll<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.370> remove

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
so what you'll do is you'll just remove

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.450 
so what you'll do is you'll just remove
that<00:00:35.850> tape<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.450> you're<00:00:37.260> gonna<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.680> some

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
that tape and you're gonna see some

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.750 
that tape and you're gonna see some
mounting<00:00:38.820> holes<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:41.070> step<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
mounting holes the step is going to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
mounting holes the step is going to
mount<00:00:41.969> or<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.840> bracket<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
mount or the the bracket is going to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
mount or the the bracket is going to
mount<00:00:43.410> directly<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.040> those<00:00:44.340> holes<00:00:44.640> both<00:00:45.570> in

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
mount directly to those holes both in

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
mount directly to those holes both in
the<00:00:45.930> pinch<00:00:46.230> weld<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> rocker<00:00:47.010> panel

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the pinch weld up in the rocker panel

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.930 
the pinch weld up in the rocker panel
and<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:48.300> order<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.399> step<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and in order to get the the step to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.500 
and in order to get the the step to
mount<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.329> those<00:00:51.480> locations<00:00:51.860> we'll<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.510> some

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
mount in those locations we'll have some

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
mount in those locations we'll have some
of<00:00:54.570> these<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> call<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.860> nuts

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
of these what I call you nuts

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.549 
of these what I call you nuts
these<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.449> slip<00:00:58.340> right<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.289> make<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
these will slip right in and make a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
these will slip right in and make a
threaded<00:01:02.370> location<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.000> behind<00:01:03.329> these

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
threaded location right behind these

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:24.670 
threaded location right behind these
holes<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.270> install<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:06.810> four<00:01:07.110> units

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.180 

next<00:01:25.680> we're<00:01:25.800> going<00:01:25.980> to<00:01:26.190> loosely<00:01:27.020> hang<00:01:28.190> the

go back and tighten up those bolts you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
go back and tighten up those bolts you
start<00:01:49.410> with<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> bolts<00:01:50.010> on<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.190> pinch<00:01:50.700> weld

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
start with the bolts on the pinch weld

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700 
start with the bolts on the pinch weld
first<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.450> then<00:01:51.630> move<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.410> bolts<00:01:52.620> on

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.360 
upside down and set it on top of the
brackets<00:02:03.470> now<00:02:04.470> take<00:02:04.710> these<00:02:04.830> square-headed

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
brackets now take these square-headed

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.190 
brackets now take these square-headed
bolts<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.140> four<00:02:07.500> per<00:02:08.010> bracket<00:02:09.200> let's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
bolts you have four per bracket let's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.300 
bolts you have four per bracket let's
slide<00:02:10.440> them<00:02:10.679> into<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.520> board<00:02:11.820> like<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:13.310> do

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
slide them into the board like so do

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.310 
slide them into the board like so do
this<00:02:14.520> front<00:02:15.060> bracket<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:15.510> front<00:02:15.810> track<00:02:16.020> and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
this front bracket or front track and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.280 
this front bracket or front track and
also<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> rear<00:02:17.220> track<00:02:18.080> next<00:02:19.080> I'm<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.230> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
also the rear track next I'm going to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.690 
also the rear track next I'm going to
take<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.530> board<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.920> flip<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.220> upside<00:02:20.520> or

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
take the board and flip it upside or
