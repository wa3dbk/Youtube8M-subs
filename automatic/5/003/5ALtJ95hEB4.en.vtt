uh before there mt4 g3 unboxing I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.380 
uh before there mt4 g3 unboxing I
haven't<00:00:35.040> even<00:00:35.130> heard<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.640> hadn't<00:00:36.120> even<00:00:36.180> heard

some<00:00:51.350> over<00:00:52.350> sprite<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:53.840> that's<00:00:54.840> why<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> have

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
some over sprite here that's why I have

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.590 
some over sprite here that's why I have
the<00:00:55.410> light<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> little

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the light so I can get it a little

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.470 
the light so I can get it a little
better<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.340> don't<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.820> there's<00:01:00.239> black

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
better I don't know but there's black

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.219 
better I don't know but there's black
overspray<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.730> whatever<00:01:02.870> second<00:01:03.870> above<00:01:04.080> me

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
overspray so whatever second above me

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.260 
overspray so whatever second above me
I'll<00:01:04.470> probably<00:01:04.650> plus<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> code<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> bottom

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
I'll probably plus the code the bottom

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.960 
I'll probably plus the code the bottom
of<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.189> yellow<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.729> I'm

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
of it but I like the yellow in it I'm

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.550 
of it but I like the yellow in it I'm
not<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.330> yellow<00:01:09.570> fan<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
not really a yellow fan but I like the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.160 
not really a yellow fan but I like the
yellow<00:01:10.680> black<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:12.479> gonna<00:01:12.600> keep<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> front

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
yellow black so I'm gonna keep the front

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.130 
yellow black so I'm gonna keep the front
it<00:01:16.170> has<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.619> unlocking<00:01:17.570> or<00:01:18.570> locking<00:01:18.930> walking

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
it has this unlocking or locking walking

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.510 
it has this unlocking or locking walking
top<00:01:22.140> plate<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> hold<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
top plate here it's just to hold the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.550 
top plate here it's just to hold the
battery<00:01:26.790> tray<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> maybe<00:01:27.540> protect<00:01:28.409> some

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
battery tray down and maybe protect some

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.730 
battery tray down and maybe protect some
of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> electronics<00:01:29.369> underneath<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.740> doubt

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
of the electronics underneath I doubt

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.440 
of the electronics underneath I doubt
it's<00:01:32.009> gonna<00:01:32.130> keep<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.490> any<00:01:32.670> dirt<00:01:32.729> since

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
it's gonna keep out any dirt since

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.249 
it's gonna keep out any dirt since
there's<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.020> holes<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> top<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.450 

it's<00:01:40.259> four<00:01:40.409> by<00:01:40.560> four<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:43.020> front<00:01:43.290> has<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:44.070> think

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it's four by four the front has I think

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.200 
it's four by four the front has I think
I<00:01:44.490> believe<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.939> called<00:01:45.119> dual<00:01:45.869> pivot<00:01:46.320> ball

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
I believe is called dual pivot ball

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
I believe is called dual pivot ball
suspension<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> front<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.320> didn't

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
suspension in the front which I didn't

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.590 
suspension in the front which I didn't
like<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.189> first<00:01:51.530> just<00:01:52.530> looks<00:01:52.770> at<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
like it first just looks at it but I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.690 
like it first just looks at it but I
don't<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.049> guess<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.070> kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.579> now

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
don't know I guess I kind of like it now

used<00:06:06.320> a<00:06:07.270> $60<00:06:08.270> coupon<00:06:08.840> I<00:06:10.240> got<00:06:11.240> the<00:06:11.389> gold<00:06:11.630> numbers

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
used a $60 coupon I got the gold numbers

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.490 
used a $60 coupon I got the gold numbers
codes<00:06:12.979> and<00:06:13.340> I<00:06:14.060> got<00:06:14.389> sixty<00:06:14.720> off<00:06:14.870> so<00:06:15.110> it<00:06:15.229> came<00:06:15.350> out

to 199

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.980 
to 199
so<00:06:19.890> 315<00:06:20.890> some<00:06:21.340> $1<00:06:21.900> it<00:06:22.900> wasn't<00:06:23.170> too<00:06:23.260> bad<00:06:23.410> for<00:06:23.800> a
