00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.990
 Explanations give to those who wanted that view they are StrÃ¶er makers 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.590
 around the us institute you showed me in so what this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.990
 Percent I think I'm behind ManUtd Greens or so 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.810
 to get that done, you need it 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.880
 percent 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.740
 Bochmann the video file savior part of it so that in an animation 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.840
 Boonen, so I can show that now I know it now 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.760
 show with a text and 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 Oh well 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.880
 Euro so honor 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 as you said you can in the background next to you want 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.170
 or stop where I all succeed- part my goodness 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 and he does it through your own background 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.470
 Then I made a tip and finished here 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.870
 they sunlit funny broke out 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.780
 does not matter 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.470
 and now a new level appears down here on the new levels 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.010
 to the new levels 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.560
 important for my slowness 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.360
 okay and just get dressed now 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.049
 in the box 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.359
 it has fill the box with envy 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.519
 Press Control to make the selection go 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.699
 Pisch 1 now a new level 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.419
 because the selection right extract stuff 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.419
 and pull us in here still says Rossi 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.699

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.889
 for our guests numbers 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.949
 and here also we write and AXA be 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.290
 yet morning harms Todd Solondz's wrong color 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.589
 to write like that 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.019
 that's valuable 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.769
 Train from Celik has died 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.079
 Photoshop ARZ 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.949
 allowing them to tear 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.289
 as examples 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:04.899
 Gardening pleasure and 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.339
 Sopron 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:11.089
 Now to do that in an animation Jochen following we go up here 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.960
 window 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.849
 because animations 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.109
 Round if I look at the text layer 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.229
 and 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.229
 click on the button published selected friends 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.089
 kloeckner times up 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.869
 and show the text layer here again 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.869
 by pointing to the SZ on the first animated film 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.569
 and click on the 4 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.859
 small rings 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.209
 there is a Klamandt few Nations Nation France 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.099
 Kittner on at no time 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.119
 so that so few france press is faster and more so 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:50.460
 Francis is so slow that it seems so slow 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.039
 I'll do it now 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.099
 as a viewer seems 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.879
 and once fast 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.619
 Pacult 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:02.669
 if he has done just once Ramsen clock the Franzke years 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.139
 indicated 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.039
 Petit the last one out 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.509
 the last animation is clouded 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.679
 while here the text layer off 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.679
 Go back to the four little fingers 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:23.180
 here is the previous stranger the kindergarten Truffaz selected and because 

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:26.479
 again the same friends or Rehlinger or brevity depending on how you are 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.249
 want 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.300
 occurs here again 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.610
 I do not do that right now in Marne Nations 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.569
 commander 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.059
 that jerks quite well 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:40.259
 and who now go often for Uebber and p Diddy save 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.379
 kloeckner on and 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.379
 so now he puts that 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240
 so pressed then save 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.129
 then we miss out on our destinations 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.029
 in a comment the same thing happened 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.599
 so press hitchhiker though save synonymous 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.330
 then he saves that 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.830
 so 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.830
 Daniel 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.289
 not that my entire field is very anxious AR 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.289
 Son is not wrong here 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.939
 suddenly Manzke 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.839
 have defense and power and 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:23.949
 overlook 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.949
 it appears and goes away again 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.150
 it was actually too expensive a background with a poison in one 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.789
 Box, so to speak, debris 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.990
 and I hope I could help people who wanted to see it that way 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.469
 the house of Dr &amp; Cie 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.430
 Subscribe with five stars rate that we quite nice of enough 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.569
