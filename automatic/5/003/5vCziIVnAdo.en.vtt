00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.550

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.279
 return of the legend 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 that is, khalid kadirov we have today 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.990

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.480
 In general, I even see for the first time I vaguely remember 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.780

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.780

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:58.380

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.890

 played so-so, but Kadyrov closed us 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.330
 remember that there is a Russian company 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.250
