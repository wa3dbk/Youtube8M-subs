00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 the game itself here in the audi-sportpark that is the workplace of 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.250
 Ingolstadt it must be Basel 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.250
 and then especially the right wing outside where we are here now 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.250
 the area of ​​my today's interlocutor must have been then 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.149
 but she had to 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.970
 the right wing is then at home you would be in the front as in the back 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.500
 Quarters in midfield what do you think I was better at play 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.640
 especially I like that very much 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.359
 of course that's from Durban back so if I'm in the 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.259
 Outsider position games 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.610
 It would therefore even before the weekend, but it is also very offensive 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.800
 but of course you would 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.470
 because national coach percent lower exhibition only means that I am in the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.600
 Team can help the most 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.450
 The last defeat Dierkes goes off that at their own stadium against the 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.650
 Spielvereinigung Greuther Fürth with 0 2 and then 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.710
 then started the series since the 4 2 1 in Karlsruhe 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.100
 8 games in a row without defeat what happened there because it does 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.889
 January open to specialist companies for us 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.410
 and we have to remember the foreigners percent but we also notice in the village 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.769
 basically stupid 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.520
 Played art us-boy 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.640
 Aaron 4% well then the cunning he steps around missing 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.220
 just to go with him then the winner from the square 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 but they worked even harder to do even more 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.689
 and around 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.560
 good ones, of course, with percent 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.700
 we can look forward to the first band of true revelers this season 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.490
 since I assume that the season still works because he gives us too 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.590
 many options after training still individual 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.890
 everyone in his area to work and percent rest the farm animal

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.980
 can count on it 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.199
 Maybe already in the home game against Erzgebirge Aue becomes easy 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.649
