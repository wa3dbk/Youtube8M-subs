00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.939
 where your physical craze 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:13.359
 an important reason 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.900
 the sp buyers export tobacco goods worth with the purchase 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.669
 but let's see how the under three leave

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.590
 with which he stands the basis of your bike greenportlane 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.820
 I am a bit concerned with the part 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.110
 as you can see 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.940
 I have been on a board before 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.880
 with that you choose your steering drivers at the workplace on the polenplein 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.440
 individuals 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.240

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.240

 set positions were 7 on 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.250

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040
 the buildings around the peloton 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.310
