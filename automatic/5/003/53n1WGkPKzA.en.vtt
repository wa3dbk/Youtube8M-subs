this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.140> test<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.340> only<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:03.149> test

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.749 

hey<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.550> prototype<00:00:12.179> 9000<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.759> created

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
hey this is prototype 9000 I created

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.200 
hey this is prototype 9000 I created
something<00:00:15.089> new<00:00:15.480> all<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.560> really<00:00:16.890> new<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.210> for

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
something new all not really new but for

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.980 
something new all not really new but for
me<00:00:18.650> it's<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.920> water<00:00:20.220> injection<00:00:21.150> water

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
me it's a water injection water

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.529 
me it's a water injection water
injection<00:00:22.619> system<00:00:23.250> via<00:00:24.240> venturi<00:00:24.869> effect<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
injection system via venturi effect and

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.980 
injection system via venturi effect and
this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> came<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:29.570> this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this is what I came up with this is the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
this is what I came up with this is the
container<00:00:31.320> hold<00:00:31.710> water<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.340> her<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
container hold water and her just a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.389 
container hold water and her just a
little<00:00:33.030> hose<00:00:33.950> goes<00:00:34.950> down<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:37.190> simple<00:00:38.190> thing

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
little hose goes down it simple thing

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
little hose goes down it simple thing
and<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:41.180> venturi<00:00:42.180> pump<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.140> I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and I got a venturi pump here that I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.190 
and I got a venturi pump here that I
made<00:00:43.559> out<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.640> various<00:00:45.200> needle<00:00:46.200> valves

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
made out of various needle valves

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.930 
made out of various needle valves
compression<00:00:49.200> fittings<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:51.270> stop<00:00:51.570> hose<00:00:52.940> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
compression fittings and stop hose and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.650 
compression fittings and stop hose and
another<00:00:54.480> another<00:00:55.289> venturi<00:00:55.860> pump<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:57.329> breaks

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
another another venturi pump this breaks

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.599 
another another venturi pump this breaks
it<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.960> into<00:00:58.109> smaller<00:00:58.500> particles<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.399> water

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it up into smaller particles the water

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.570 
it up into smaller particles the water
it's<00:00:59.789> being<00:00:59.969> pumped<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:02.300> found<00:01:03.300> that

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
it's being pumped to it I found that

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's being pumped to it I found that
when<00:01:05.580> you're<00:01:05.729> pumping<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> water<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.990> need

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
when you're pumping the water you need

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.460 
when you're pumping the water you need
to<00:01:07.409> valve<00:01:07.680> close<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.810> water<00:01:10.170> supply

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
to valve close to the water supply

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.420 
to valve close to the water supply
erupts<00:01:11.119> routes<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.830> amount<00:01:13.830> being<00:01:14.070> pumped

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
erupts routes the amount being pumped

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.899 
erupts routes the amount being pumped
changes<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> volume<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> came<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.549> put

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
changes with the volume so I came up put

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.539 
changes with the volume so I came up put
two<00:01:18.090> two<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.799> pump<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> water<00:01:20.189> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
two two of them one to pump the water I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
two two of them one to pump the water I
wanted<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> split<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.299> into<00:01:21.509> smaller

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
wanted to split it up into smaller

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.109 
wanted to split it up into smaller
particles<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:23.909> saves<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.509> lot<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:25.470> gas<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.119> went

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
particles it saves a lot of gas and went

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.929 
particles it saves a lot of gas and went
up<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:29.119> like<00:01:30.119> 20<00:01:31.130> those<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.640> was

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
up from like like 20 those like in I was

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.620 
up from like like 20 those like in I was
getting<00:01:33.860> getting<00:01:34.860> around<00:01:35.159> 18<00:01:35.790> 19<00:01:35.820> miles<00:01:36.450> per

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
getting getting around 18 19 miles per

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.480 
getting getting around 18 19 miles per
gallon<00:01:37.759> I'm<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.210> 24<00:01:40.110> 25

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
sometimes 27 miles per gallon depends on

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
sometimes 27 miles per gallon depends on
driving<00:01:46.200> conditions<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:49.409> I'll<00:01:49.590> fire<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> up

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
driving conditions and I'll fire it up

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:42.920 
driving conditions and I'll fire it up
and<00:01:50.520> let<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.689> thing<00:01:51.899> does

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.809 

octorok<00:03:10.230> came<00:03:10.590> down

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.580 

you<00:03:16.329> just<00:03:16.629> says<00:03:16.810> about<00:03:17.500> that

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
you just says about that

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.170 
you just says about that
tiny<00:03:19.769> pop

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.630 

if<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.569> get<00:03:24.720> air<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.049> line<00:03:25.319> that's<00:03:25.650> fine<00:03:25.890> it's

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
if you get air in line that's fine it's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.839 
if you get air in line that's fine it's
supposed<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:26.970> happen<00:03:28.129> you<00:03:29.129> really<00:03:29.459> just<00:03:29.640> got

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
supposed to happen you really just got

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.039 
supposed to happen you really just got
to<00:03:29.879> keep<00:03:30.150> fiddling<00:03:30.750> with<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.140> air<00:03:32.010> intake<00:03:32.220> and

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
to keep fiddling with the air intake and

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.929 
to keep fiddling with the air intake and
here<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.260> taking<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> water<00:03:34.890> flow<00:03:35.250> until<00:03:35.819> you

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
here and taking the water flow until you

00:03:35.939 --> 00:04:00.000 
here and taking the water flow until you
get<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.360> right

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.759 

yeah<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.849> get<00:04:01.090> pretty<00:04:01.420> good<00:04:01.720> gas<00:04:02.230> mileage<00:04:02.260> and

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
yeah I get pretty good gas mileage and

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.130 
yeah I get pretty good gas mileage and
you<00:04:02.860> get<00:04:03.010> like<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.370> power<00:04:03.580> it<00:04:04.480> was<00:04:04.599> easier<00:04:04.959> the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
you get like the power it was easier the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.860 
you get like the power it was easier the
speed<00:04:05.440> with<00:04:05.680> us<00:04:05.799> because<00:04:06.069> usually<00:04:06.400> we're<00:04:06.870> good

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
speed with us because usually we're good

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.970 
speed with us because usually we're good
is<00:04:07.989> on<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.319> gas<00:04:08.530> pedal<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:11.349> know<00:04:11.440> usually

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
is on the gas pedal it you know usually

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.910 
is on the gas pedal it you know usually
you'll<00:04:12.159> be<00:04:12.340> going<00:04:12.610> like<00:04:12.849> maybe<00:04:13.349> 345<00:04:14.349> miles<00:04:14.590> per

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
you'll be going like maybe 345 miles per

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.240 
you'll be going like maybe 345 miles per
hour<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.660> you're<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:17.410> know<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.650> get<00:04:17.829> used<00:04:18.010> to

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
hour and you're you know you get used to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.360 
hour and you're you know you get used to
that

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
that

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.170 
that
you<00:04:20.820> get<00:04:20.970> used<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.329> there<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.780> then

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
you get used to there and then

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.029 
you get used to there and then
then<00:04:23.720> when<00:04:23.990> you're<00:04:24.110> just<00:04:24.289> driving<00:04:24.530> then<00:04:24.889> all

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
then when you're just driving then all

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.980 
then when you're just driving then all
sudden<00:04:25.400> you're<00:04:25.490> doing<00:04:25.759> 70<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.449> that<00:04:26.630> doesn't

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
sudden you're doing 70 and that doesn't

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.310 
sudden you're doing 70 and that doesn't
you<00:04:27.979> know<00:04:28.009> putting<00:04:28.940> any<00:04:29.120> additional<00:04:29.810> pressure

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
you know putting any additional pressure

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.600 
you know putting any additional pressure
down<00:04:30.680> on<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.100> gas<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.850> normal<00:04:33.220> there's<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.310> big

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
down on the gas the normal there's a big

00:04:34.610 --> 00:05:02.520 
down on the gas the normal there's a big
noticeable<00:04:35.150> change<00:04:35.419> in<00:04:35.600> power

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.040 

I<00:05:02.560> got<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.280> list<00:05:03.490> off<00:05:03.730> parts<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:04.510> think<00:05:04.900> you

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
I got a list off parts I think you

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.960 
I got a list off parts I think you
people<00:05:05.230> are<00:05:05.500> smart<00:05:05.860> enough<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.130> get<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:06.610> by

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
people are smart enough to get this by

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.770 
people are smart enough to get this by
yourself

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.739 

oops<00:05:13.530> looks<00:05:13.920> like<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.250> came<00:05:14.370> disconnected<00:05:15.120> the

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:16.749 
oops looks like it came disconnected the

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:24.300 
oops looks like it came disconnected the
we<00:05:17.139> gotta<00:05:17.349> watch<00:05:17.559> out<00:05:17.799> for<00:05:17.830> that

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:36.700 

take<00:05:24.850> the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.530 

in<00:05:37.130> time<00:05:37.430> I'll<00:05:37.669> come<00:05:37.910> up<00:05:38.060> with<00:05:38.240> something

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
in time I'll come up with something

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.620 
in time I'll come up with something
better<00:05:38.690> in<00:05:38.900> this<00:05:39.020> aquarium<00:05:39.500> gang<00:05:40.100> Bell<00:05:40.630> last

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
better in this aquarium gang Bell last

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.429 
better in this aquarium gang Bell last
one<00:05:41.900> kind<00:05:42.139> of<00:05:42.260> had<00:05:42.410> a<00:05:42.440> kind<00:05:43.340> of<00:05:43.430> melted<00:05:43.850> on<00:05:44.000> me

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:46.439 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.399 

hey<00:05:46.979> it<00:05:47.489> works

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
hey it works

00:05:49.409 --> 00:06:06.370 
hey it works
just<00:05:49.649> gotta<00:05:50.069> improve<00:05:50.489> it<00:05:50.639> a<00:05:50.699> little<00:05:50.909> bit

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.000 

so<00:06:06.890> it<00:06:07.040> was<00:06:07.190> pretty<00:06:07.550> satisfying<00:06:08.270> watch

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
so it was pretty satisfying watch

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.920 
so it was pretty satisfying watch
bubblies<00:06:10.010> doing

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.230 

give<00:06:14.050> it<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.139> little<00:06:14.320> bit<00:06:14.500> more<00:06:14.650> water

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.879 

or<00:06:20.330> flow<00:06:20.630> in<00:06:20.810> there

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:29.390 

and<00:06:27.759> another<00:06:27.939> thing<00:06:28.270> is<00:06:28.479> when<00:06:28.659> you're<00:06:28.870> doing

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
and another thing is when you're doing

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.450 
and another thing is when you're doing
this<00:06:30.400> you<00:06:30.729> got<00:06:30.909> a<00:06:31.889> tuning<00:06:32.889> the<00:06:33.009> flow<00:06:33.250> you

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
this you got a tuning the flow you

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.980 
this you got a tuning the flow you
should<00:06:33.490> do<00:06:33.849> it<00:06:33.969> at<00:06:34.120> a<00:06:35.009> high<00:06:36.009> rpm<00:06:36.550> above<00:06:37.479> two<00:06:37.840> and

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
should do it at a high rpm above two and

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.060 
should do it at a high rpm above two and
a<00:06:38.020> half<00:06:38.169> thousand<00:06:38.650> rpm

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.100 

or<00:06:43.520> else<00:06:43.670> then<00:06:44.210> you<00:06:44.360> look<00:06:44.540> keep<00:06:44.720> losing

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
or else then you look keep losing

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.320 
or else then you look keep losing
pressure<00:06:45.350> in<00:06:45.590> the<00:06:45.680> lines<00:06:45.920> if<00:06:46.820> you<00:06:46.940> don't<00:06:47.150> do

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
pressure in the lines if you don't do

00:06:47.330 --> 00:07:02.250 
pressure in the lines if you don't do
that

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:14.650 

oh<00:07:02.320> you<00:07:02.980> need

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:14.660 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.050 

all<00:07:15.170> of<00:07:15.320> one<00:07:15.500> other<00:07:15.680> thing<00:07:16.040> this<00:07:16.310> is<00:07:16.550> powered

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
all of one other thing this is powered

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.130 
all of one other thing this is powered
by<00:07:17.380> hard<00:07:18.380> only<00:07:18.830> by<00:07:19.190> vacuum<00:07:19.760> using<00:07:20.450> the<00:07:20.600> venturi

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
by hard only by vacuum using the venturi

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.410 
by hard only by vacuum using the venturi
effect<00:07:21.260> to<00:07:22.220> pump<00:07:22.490> the<00:07:22.640> water<00:07:22.790> out<00:07:23.000> the
