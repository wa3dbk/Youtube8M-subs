start<00:01:11.310> predicting<00:01:11.640> since<00:01:12.030> he's<00:01:12.180> making<00:01:12.510> all

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
start predicting since he's making all

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
start predicting since he's making all
the<00:01:12.840> obvious<00:01:13.200> switches<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.700> know<00:01:14.939> he<00:01:15.150> has<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the obvious switches so I know he has a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
the obvious switches so I know he has a
solid<00:01:15.570> man<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.049> gonna<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.320> straight<00:01:16.650> for

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
solid man so I'm gonna go straight for

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.280 
solid man so I'm gonna go straight for
the<00:01:16.890> ice<00:01:17.070> leg<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.670> due<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> intimidate<00:01:19.049> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the ice leg but due to intimidate I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
the ice leg but due to intimidate I
swing<00:01:19.799> isn't<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.700> much<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
swing isn't really gonna do as much as I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.510 
swing isn't really gonna do as much as I
hope<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.590> don't<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.340> type<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
off a Draco meteor and I'd be able to it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.679 
off a Draco meteor and I'd be able to it
just<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.880> he<00:01:39.030> goes<00:01:39.180> straight<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
just but he goes straight for the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.990 
knowing he's going to predict me to over

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
predict so it messes though which is

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
predict so it messes though which is
like<00:02:30.329> pretty<00:02:30.629> bad<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.109> whatever<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.709> deal

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.990 
for the tea Bowl and he gets wrecked so
if<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.319> focus<00:02:40.799> blast<00:02:40.980> would<00:02:41.220> hit<00:02:41.430> would<00:02:41.909> have

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
if that focus blast would hit would have

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.509 
if that focus blast would hit would have
been<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.390> helpful<00:02:42.599> but<00:02:43.019> whatever<00:02:43.890> eighty

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
been kind of helpful but whatever eighty

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.289 
been kind of helpful but whatever eighty
percent<00:02:44.640> isn't<00:02:45.450> accurate<00:02:45.750> enough<00:02:46.290> i<00:02:46.500> guess<00:02:46.530> so

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
percent isn't accurate enough i guess so

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.910 
percent isn't accurate enough i guess so
i'm<00:02:48.299> pretty<00:02:48.930> sure<00:02:49.200> he's<00:02:49.349> not<00:02:49.470> gonna<00:02:49.620> want<00:02:49.859> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
i'm pretty sure he's not gonna want to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.680 
i'm pretty sure he's not gonna want to
switch<00:02:50.099> out<00:02:50.280> broom<00:02:50.519> Garrison's<00:02:51.120> pretty<00:02:51.510> much
