00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
good job at explaining I'm how to how to

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.920 
good job at explaining I'm how to how to
do<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.100> style<00:03:48.489> this<00:03:49.239> is<00:03:49.390> where<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:49.600> got<00:03:49.900> it

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
do this style this is where I got it

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:59.070 
do this style this is where I got it
from<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.340> once<00:03:57.880> you<00:03:58.060> get<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.330> hang<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.900> it

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
from and once you get the hang of it it

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:33.100 
from and once you get the hang of it it
goes<00:03:59.290> bra<00:03:59.739> really<00:04:00.310> goes<00:04:01.140> by<00:04:02.140> really<00:04:02.380> fast

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.880 

so<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.740> take<00:04:33.980> that<00:04:34.190> up<00:04:35.200> when<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.380> pull<00:04:36.650> the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
so you take that up when you pull the

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.570 
so you take that up when you pull the
hook<00:04:37.130> under<00:04:37.910> your<00:04:38.060> braid<00:04:38.360> make<00:04:38.840> sure<00:04:39.140> that

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
hook under your braid make sure that

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.100 
hook under your braid make sure that
this<00:04:40.580> little<00:04:41.000> lever<00:04:41.870> thing<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.870> thing

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
this little lever thing that thing

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.160 
this little lever thing that thing
sticking<00:04:45.440> up<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.950> closed<00:04:46.630> because<00:04:47.630> if<00:04:47.990> not

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
sticking up is closed because if not

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.990 
sticking up is closed because if not
it's<00:04:48.440> going<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.740> catch<00:04:49.220> on<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.580> your<00:04:49.790> hair

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
it's going to catch on to your hair

00:04:50.000 --> 00:06:22.850 
it's going to catch on to your hair
probably<00:04:50.510> break<00:04:50.750> it

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.399 

I<00:06:23.990> finished<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.520> basically<00:06:26.520> the<00:06:27.080> outside<00:06:28.080> of

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
I finished the basically the outside of

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.439 
I finished the basically the outside of
this<00:06:29.219> whole<00:06:29.490> style<00:06:30.949> so<00:06:31.949> I<00:06:31.979> crochet<00:06:32.550> this<00:06:33.000> part

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
this whole style so I crochet this part

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:40.429 
this whole style so I crochet this part
that<00:06:33.840> I<00:06:33.930> was<00:06:34.080> talking<00:06:34.289> about<00:06:34.560> in<00:06:35.069> the<00:06:36.060> back<00:06:39.439> and

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:40.439 
that I was talking about in the back and

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:42.709 
that I was talking about in the back and
i'm<00:06:40.590> going<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:40.860> start<00:06:41.099> filling<00:06:41.460> in<00:06:41.729> more<00:06:42.030> so<00:06:42.689> on

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
i'm going to start filling in more so on

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:48.770 
i'm going to start filling in more so on
these<00:06:43.400> right<00:06:44.400> here<00:06:44.629> i'm<00:06:45.629> going<00:06:45.900> to<00:06:45.990> do<00:06:46.199> 8<00:06:46.819> 10<00:06:47.819> 10

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
these right here i'm going to do 8 10 10

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.730 
these right here i'm going to do 8 10 10
and<00:06:49.199> i'ma<00:06:49.409> feel<00:06:49.710> these<00:06:50.219> three<00:06:50.819> in<00:06:51.349> so<00:06:52.349> like<00:06:52.500> the

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
and i'ma feel these three in so like the

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.770 
and i'ma feel these three in so like the
three<00:06:53.099> will<00:06:53.280> probably<00:06:53.699> end<00:06:53.849> up<00:06:54.060> adding<00:06:54.270> more

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
three will probably end up adding more

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.019 
three will probably end up adding more
down<00:06:55.409> here<00:06:55.439> to<00:06:56.129> make<00:06:56.279> it<00:06:56.400> a<00:06:56.490> little<00:06:56.639> bit<00:06:56.849> more
