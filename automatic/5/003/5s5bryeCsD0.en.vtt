00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.179 
zonal marking didn't really work out
faster<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.719> ball<00:01:57.930> had<00:01:58.290> roosts<00:01:58.740> such

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
faster because the ball had roosts such

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.149 
faster because the ball had roosts such
a<00:01:59.219> long<00:01:59.460> way<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.110> they<00:02:01.110> also<00:02:01.409> plays<00:02:01.890> didn't<00:02:02.100> do

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
a long way and they also plays didn't do

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.560 
a long way and they also plays didn't do
much<00:02:02.310> because<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.820> zone<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.240> marking

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
much because of that zone and marking

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.959 
much because of that zone and marking
zonal<00:02:04.200> marking<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.590> basically<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.130> told<00:02:05.460> you

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
zonal marking is basically they told you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.809 
zonal marking is basically they told you
