down pulled the wires out of stuff got
the<00:01:09.420> turn<00:01:09.630> signals<00:01:10.080> straight<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> back

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the turn signals straight at the back

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.370 
the turn signals straight at the back
like<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.490> thought<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.790> pretty<00:01:12.030> cool

breaking<00:01:18.360> my<00:01:18.479> turn<00:01:18.720> signals<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.360> that's<00:01:21.360> what

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
breaking my turn signals so that's what

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.170 
breaking my turn signals so that's what
I<00:01:21.600> did<00:01:21.630> there

throttle cable also the brake line here
we're<00:02:29.050> all<00:02:29.140> right<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.920> rear<00:02:30.100> at

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
we're all right you just have to rear at

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.110 
we're all right you just have to rear at
them<00:02:30.989> these<00:02:31.989> wires<00:02:32.320> though<00:02:32.910> for<00:02:33.910> all<00:02:33.970> your

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
them these wires though for all your

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.610 
them these wires though for all your
electronics<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.110> cut<00:02:35.350> them<00:02:35.500> and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
electronics you have to cut them and

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.210 
electronics you have to cut them and
extend<00:02:35.980> himself<00:02:37.440> basically<00:02:38.440> what<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.650> did<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:39.100> I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
extend himself basically what I did is I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.580 
extend himself basically what I did is I
just<00:02:39.430> chopped<00:02:39.790> him<00:02:40.000> right<00:02:40.150> here<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.440> I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
just chopped him right here and I

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.830 
just chopped him right here and I
extended<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.130> wires<00:02:42.400> out<00:02:42.730> he<00:02:43.330> just<00:02:43.540> put<00:02:43.720> like

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
extended the wires out he just put like

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.720 
extended the wires out he just put like
a<00:02:43.900> 8<00:02:44.350> inch<00:02:44.530> wire<00:02:44.769> in<00:02:45.010> there<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.459> solder

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
a 8 inch wire in there and just solder

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.210 
a 8 inch wire in there and just solder
it<00:02:45.940> or<00:02:46.030> whatever<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.769> that's<00:02:47.890> all<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.160> did<00:02:50.220> after

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
it or whatever so that's all I did after

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.580 
it or whatever so that's all I did after
I<00:02:51.459> was<00:02:51.700> done<00:02:51.910> with<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.239> though<00:02:52.540> my<00:02:53.410> bike

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
I was done with that though my bike

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.050 
I was done with that though my bike
didn't<00:02:53.890> start<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:54.580> was<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:54.850> what<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
didn't start and I was like what the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.360 
didn't start and I was like what the
 couldn't<00:02:56.260> figure<00:02:56.470> out<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.680> problem<00:02:57.070> was

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
 couldn't figure out the problem was

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.930 
 couldn't figure out the problem was
turns<00:02:58.209> out<00:02:58.480> i<00:02:59.070> guess<00:03:00.070> it<00:03:00.220> was<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> grounding

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
turns out i guess it was a grounding

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.710 
turns out i guess it was a grounding
issue<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.400> stock<00:03:03.640> ones<00:03:03.940> were

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
issue with because of stock ones were

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.060 
issue with because of stock ones were
over<00:03:04.930> here<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.230> can<00:03:05.350> see<00:03:05.500> they're<00:03:05.650> all<00:03:05.769> chrome

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
over here you can see they're all chrome

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.830 
over here you can see they're all chrome
and<00:03:06.780> i<00:03:07.950> guess<00:03:08.950> these<00:03:09.130> boxes<00:03:09.760> here<00:03:10.090> are

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
and i guess these boxes here are

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.750 
and i guess these boxes here are
grounded<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.650> handlebar<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.400> what<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.579> had

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
grounded to the handlebar so what I had

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.690 
grounded to the handlebar so what I had
to<00:03:12.790> do<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:14.410> can't<00:03:14.650> tell<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.190> measured<00:03:15.579> i

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
to do you can't tell but I measured i

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.210 
to do you can't tell but I measured i
just<00:03:15.910> put<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> little<00:03:16.480> mark<00:03:16.870> here<00:03:17.230> on<00:03:17.950> both

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
just put a little mark here on both

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.780 
just put a little mark here on both
sides<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:19.260> i<00:03:20.260> took<00:03:20.799> my<00:03:21.070> little<00:03:21.190> dremel<00:03:21.610> tool

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
sides and i took my little dremel tool

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.150 
sides and i took my little dremel tool
and<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:22.000> ground<00:03:22.269> them<00:03:22.420> all<00:03:22.510> down<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:23.890> way

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
and I ground them all down so that way

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.800 
and I ground them all down so that way
when<00:03:24.310> these<00:03:24.489> clamps<00:03:24.820> go<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:25.239> they're<00:03:25.450> actually

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
when these clamps go on they're actually

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.559 
when these clamps go on they're actually
going<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.320> metal<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.709> not<00:03:26.890> some

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
going to the metal and not some

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.979 
going to the metal and not some
black<00:03:28.230> paint<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.390> how's<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.599> issue<00:03:30.689> was

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989
