think this is super saiyan god only

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
think this is super saiyan god only
because<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.940> lit<00:00:57.239> only<00:00:57.629> put<00:00:57.960> goku<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.379> vegeta

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
because it lit only put goku and vegeta

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220 
because it lit only put goku and vegeta
there<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.270> was<00:01:00.359> universe<00:01:00.809> 6<00:01:01.050> i

there and like if it was universe 6 i

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.660 
there and like if it was universe 6 i
think<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> would<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.100> all<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
think that it would be like all of the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.429 
think that it would be like all of the
cast<00:01:02.910> or<00:01:03.180> at<00:01:03.270> least<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.840> fighting<00:01:04.229> cats

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
cast or at least all the fighting cats

I<00:01:30.000> mean<00:01:30.600> hey<00:01:31.140> yeah<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.100> couldn't<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.549> them

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
I mean hey yeah it couldn't just be them

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
I mean hey yeah it couldn't just be them
it's<00:01:33.150> possible<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> blue

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's possible but you know the blue

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.950 
it's possible but you know the blue
light<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.420> similar<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
light is just like it's very similar to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
light is just like it's very similar to
the<00:01:37.170> light<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:37.829> shown<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.909> Goku<00:01:39.270> first

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the light that was shown when Goku first

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.710 
the light that was shown when Goku first
of<00:01:39.630> all<00:01:39.689> first<00:01:40.380> turn<00:01:40.770> Super<00:01:41.189> Saiyan<00:01:41.400> God<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
of all first turn Super Saiyan God and I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.240 
of all first turn Super Saiyan God and I
also<00:01:42.899> think<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.290> was<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> flashback<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
also think it was in the flashback or it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.310 
also think it was in the flashback or it
could<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.430> wrong<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.329> flashback<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
could be wrong the flashback of the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350 
could be wrong the flashback of the
first<00:01:46.560> Super<00:01:46.799> Saiyan<00:01:47.009> God<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.240> like

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
first Super Saiyan God that it was like

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.149 
first Super Saiyan God that it was like
a<00:01:48.390> bunch<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.840> blue<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.740> obviously

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
a bunch of blue and then it obviously

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.520 
a bunch of blue and then it obviously
went<00:01:50.490> away<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.320> super

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
went away I think that that is super

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.200 
went away I think that that is super
saiyan<00:01:52.860> god<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.340> may<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:53.939> least<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
saiyan god it may be at least to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
saiyan god it may be at least to
symbolize<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.439> all<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.649> know<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
symbolize it you know for all we know it

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.940 
symbolize it you know for all we know it
could<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.659> only<00:01:57.950> beerus

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
could just be like that just only beerus

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.190 
could just be like that just only beerus
we<00:01:59.189> sand<00:01:59.729> all<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.000> them<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.420> possible<00:02:01.049> edge

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
we sand all of them it's possible edge

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130 
we sand all of them it's possible edge
not<00:02:01.619> anything<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.759> i'm<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> hunch

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
not anything but you know i'm on a hunch

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
not anything but you know i'm on a hunch
and<00:02:04.350> speculation<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.219> yeah<00:02:05.640> i<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and speculation then yeah i think that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.440 
and speculation then yeah i think that
it's<00:02:06.270> person<00:02:06.600> Super<00:02:06.840> Saiyan<00:02:07.020> God<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:08.160> know

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
it's person Super Saiyan God you know

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.729 
it's person Super Saiyan God you know
think<00:02:08.629> actually<00:02:08.750> i<00:02:08.959> think<00:02:09.080> it's<00:02:09.440> all<00:02:09.619> the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
think actually i think it's all the

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.680 
think actually i think it's all the
above<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.369> actual<00:02:10.489> journey<00:02:10.879> it's<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
above it's the actual journey it's the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.020 
above it's the actual journey it's the
journey<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.379> walking<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.250> next<00:02:13.580> level

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
journey of the walking to the next level

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.850 
journey of the walking to the next level
and<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.720> get<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.080> next<00:02:15.260> level<00:02:15.410> they<00:02:15.739> have

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
and to get to the next level they have

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.350 
and to get to the next level they have
to<00:02:16.010> get<00:02:16.160> through<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.340> beer<00:02:16.670> sweets<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.269> of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
to get through a beer sweets and of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.110 
to get through a beer sweets and of
course<00:02:17.629> of<00:02:17.840> Champa<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:18.980> his<00:02:19.370> people<00:02:19.879> version

course of Champa and his people version

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.430 
course of Champa and his people version
with<00:02:20.239> now<00:02:20.420> not<00:02:20.629> not<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.870> student<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:21.349> the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
with now not not a student or the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.420 
with now not not a student or the
fighting<00:02:21.800> but<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.040> they<00:02:22.099> have<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.310> get

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
fighting but just they have to get

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.339 
fighting but just they have to get
through<00:02:22.550> them<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.569> reach<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> light<00:02:24.050> dinner

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
through them to reach the light dinner

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.350 
through them to reach the light dinner
tunnel<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.370> could<00:02:25.489> also<00:02:25.610> lead<00:02:25.940> into<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
tunnel and that could also lead into the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.509 
tunnel and that could also lead into the
actual<00:02:26.750> universe<00:02:27.380> 6<00:02:27.739> where<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
actual universe 6 where you know the

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.009 
actual universe 6 where you know the
series<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.880> going<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.150> take<00:02:29.300> us<00:02:29.450> as<00:02:29.630> Toriyama

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
series is going to take us as Toriyama

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.650 
series is going to take us as Toriyama
told<00:02:30.290> us<00:02:30.730> back<00:02:31.730> when<00:02:32.000> did<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.239> press<00:02:32.420> confe

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
told us back when did the press confe

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.960 
told us back when did the press confe
days<00:02:32.989> ago<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.170> think<00:02:33.650> it's<00:02:33.769> all<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:33.980> working

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
days ago I think it's all that working

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.120 
days ago I think it's all that working
about<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.360> oh<00:02:35.569> yeah<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.530> could<00:02:36.709> also<00:02:36.860> make

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
about that oh yeah it could also make

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.369 
about that oh yeah it could also make
sense<00:02:37.400> i<00:02:37.549> mean<00:02:37.580> they<00:02:38.180> are<00:02:38.510> walking<00:02:38.780> towards<00:02:39.260> it

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
sense i mean they are walking towards it

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.479 
sense i mean they are walking towards it
and<00:02:39.470> everything<00:02:39.769> like<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.069> it<00:02:40.340> could

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
and everything like that so it could

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.710 
and everything like that so it could
symbolize<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.970> they're<00:02:41.209> going<00:02:41.569> on<00:02:41.660> a

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
symbolize that they're going on a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.979 
symbolize that they're going on a
journey<00:02:42.049> in<00:02:42.440> terms<00:02:42.769> of<00:02:42.920> their<00:02:43.430> power<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.030> then

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
journey in terms of their power and then

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.809 
journey in terms of their power and then
yeah<00:02:45.440> i<00:02:45.470> could<00:02:45.680> either<00:02:45.890> symbolize<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:46.340> super

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
yeah i could either symbolize that super

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.729 
yeah i could either symbolize that super
saiyan<00:02:47.000> god<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.959> lot<00:02:48.079> of<00:02:48.260> things<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.620> I

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
saiyan god it's a lot of things that I

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.530 
saiyan god it's a lot of things that I
could<00:02:48.890> actually<00:02:49.010> symbolize<00:02:49.640> yeah<00:02:50.299> so

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
could actually symbolize yeah so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.390 
could actually symbolize yeah so
personally<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.799> super<00:02:52.010> saiyan<00:02:52.220> god

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
personally I think it's super saiyan god

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.250 
personally I think it's super saiyan god
I<00:02:52.459> don't<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.150> about<00:02:53.329> it<00:02:53.569> being<00:02:53.690> everything<00:02:54.110> I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
I don't know about it being everything I

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.100 
I don't know about it being everything I
mean<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.890> very<00:02:55.040> possible<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.390> will<00:02:56.930> take

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
mean it's very possible so I will take

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.509 
mean it's very possible so I will take
that<00:02:57.140> into<00:02:57.319> consideration<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:58.190> mean<00:02:58.340> really

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
that into consideration I mean really

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.610 
that into consideration I mean really
there's<00:02:58.760> there's<00:02:59.360> no<00:02:59.480> real<00:02:59.690> argument<00:03:00.349> for

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
there's there's no real argument for

light<00:05:21.090> is<00:05:21.120> not<00:05:21.270> Super<00:05:21.599> Saiyan<00:05:21.779> God<00:05:21.870> Super

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.999 
Saiyan but super saiyan god that's what
I<00:05:23.849> think<00:05:24.150> because<00:05:24.449> this<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:25.050> blue<00:05:25.229> aura<00:05:25.500> yeah

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
I think because this the blue aura yeah

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.800 
I think because this the blue aura yeah
because<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:26.339> blue<00:05:26.430> aura<00:05:26.669> was<00:05:27.330> there<00:05:27.569> when

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
because the blue aura was there when

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.480 
because the blue aura was there when
Goku<00:05:28.139> became<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.529> Super<00:05:28.830> Saiyan<00:05:28.860> God<00:05:29.159> first

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
Goku became a Super Saiyan God first

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.089 
Goku became a Super Saiyan God first
time<00:05:29.699> first<00:05:30.330> time<00:05:30.509> Super<00:05:31.139> Saiyan<00:05:31.319> God<00:05:31.529> which

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
time first time Super Saiyan God which

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.920 
time first time Super Saiyan God which
is<00:05:32.129> kind<00:05:32.430> of<00:05:32.490> weird<00:05:32.639> because<00:05:32.909> when<00:05:33.479> it<00:05:33.690> first

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
is kind of weird because when it first

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.180 
is kind of weird because when it first
happened<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.349> did<00:05:34.500> think<00:05:34.740> it<00:05:34.830> was<00:05:34.889> kind<00:05:35.069> of

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
happened I did think it was kind of

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.159 
happened I did think it was kind of
weird<00:05:35.400> that<00:05:35.520> blue<00:05:35.849> aura<00:05:36.210> was<00:05:36.479> surrounding<00:05:37.020> him

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
weird that blue aura was surrounding him

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.749 
weird that blue aura was surrounding him
when<00:05:37.620> he<00:05:37.710> was<00:05:37.800> transforming<00:05:38.460> but<00:05:38.669> then

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
when he was transforming but then

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.240 
when he was transforming but then
afterward<00:05:39.120> was<00:05:39.300> red<00:05:39.479> or<00:05:39.659> so<00:05:40.289> so<00:05:40.560> I<00:05:40.680> guess<00:05:40.979> the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
afterward was red or so so I guess the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.680 
afterward was red or so so I guess the
question<00:05:41.279> after<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.969> is<00:05:42.089> this<00:05:42.240> ben<00:05:42.419> de<00:05:42.539> why

surprise me because we already know that
goku<00:05:49.379> becomes<00:05:49.650> super<00:05:49.949> saiyan<00:05:50.129> god<00:05:50.310> in<00:05:50.789> battle

goku becomes super saiyan god in battle

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.550 
goku becomes super saiyan god in battle
of<00:05:51.150> gods<00:05:51.300> we<00:05:51.810> already<00:05:52.020> know<00:05:52.139> that<00:05:52.169> that's

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
of gods we already know that that's

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.769 
of gods we already know that that's
already<00:05:52.740> in<00:05:52.949> the<00:05:53.039> movie<00:05:53.669> so<00:05:53.939> there's<00:05:54.479> no<00:05:54.569> point

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
already in the movie so there's no point

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.990 
already in the movie so there's no point
in<00:05:54.990> like<00:05:55.169> not<00:05:55.409> teasing<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:55.889> for<00:05:56.279> him<00:05:56.460> but<00:05:56.939> for

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
in like not teasing that for him but for

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.540 
in like not teasing that for him but for
magida<00:05:57.419> we<00:05:57.900> just<00:05:58.469> see<00:05:58.589> him<00:05:58.770> walking<00:05:58.979> with<00:05:59.219> goku

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
magida we just see him walking with goku

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.029 
magida we just see him walking with goku
so<00:05:59.939> it's<00:06:00.330> possible<00:06:00.509> that<00:06:00.870> it<00:06:01.169> could<00:06:01.589> only<00:06:01.830> be

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
so it's possible that it could only be

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.029 
so it's possible that it could only be
goku<00:06:02.520> but<00:06:02.759> I<00:06:02.939> mean<00:06:03.569> Goku<00:06:03.990> Vegeta<00:06:04.589> has<00:06:04.919> to

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039
