about it had to go up go on to another
foundation<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.560> do<00:01:14.950> really<00:01:15.190> like<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.730> only

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
foundation I do really like it the only

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.940 
foundation I do really like it the only
problem<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.450> packaging<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:17.170> bad

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
problem is that the packaging is so bad

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.590 
problem is that the packaging is so bad
like<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.400> can<00:01:18.580> see<00:01:18.790> how<00:01:19.000> Bobby<00:01:19.360> is<00:01:19.600> gone<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
like you can see how Bobby is gone and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.540 
like you can see how Bobby is gone and
so<00:01:23.050> that's<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.470> bit<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.680> shame<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:23.890> like<00:01:24.220> way

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
so that's a bit of shame and like way

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.920 
so that's a bit of shame and like way
too<00:01:24.610> much<00:01:24.820> product<00:01:25.060> comes<00:01:25.330> out<00:01:25.510> so<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.750> probably

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
too much product comes out so I probably

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.540 
too much product comes out so I probably
wasted<00:01:26.500> loathe<00:01:26.680> that's<00:01:26.890> why<00:01:26.980> I've<00:01:27.070> run<00:01:27.280> out<00:01:27.310> so

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
wasted loathe that's why I've run out so

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.210 
wasted loathe that's why I've run out so
quickly<00:01:27.760> but<00:01:28.660> part<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.470> packaging<00:01:29.890> the
