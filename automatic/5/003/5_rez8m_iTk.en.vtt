jammer<00:00:17.359> typically<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.539> spread-spectrum<00:00:19.260> and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
jammer typically is spread-spectrum and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
jammer typically is spread-spectrum and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
therefore blocks all signals across all

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.760 
therefore blocks all signals across all
bands<00:00:23.420> but<00:00:24.420> if<00:00:24.690> you're<00:00:24.960> actually<00:00:25.410> going<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
carrier band and is only going to block

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.540 
carrier band and is only going to block
calls<00:00:33.449> from<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.140> carrier<00:00:34.770> otherwise<00:00:35.250> it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
calls from that carrier otherwise it's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.509 
calls from that carrier otherwise it's
going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.789> look<00:00:35.879> awfully<00:00:36.359> suspicious<00:00:37.519> also

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
going to look awfully suspicious also

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.079 
going to look awfully suspicious also
you<00:00:38.579> only<00:00:38.760> want<00:00:39.359> to<00:00:39.569> block<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:40.219> 3G<00:00:41.219> portions

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
you only want to block the 3G portions

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.869 
you only want to block the 3G portions
of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.539> signal<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.190> that's<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.729> so

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
of the signal and that's because it's so

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.069 
of the signal and that's because it's so
much<00:00:45.030> easier<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.719> hack<00:00:46.229> 1x<00:00:47.100> band<00:00:47.699> signals<00:00:48.449> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
much easier to hack 1x band signals so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.200 
much easier to hack 1x band signals so
the<00:00:49.859> way<00:00:49.979> it<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.159> typically<00:00:50.549> work<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.089> you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the way it would typically work is you

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.899 
the way it would typically work is you
deploy<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> scrambler<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:53.100> would<00:00:53.370> block

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
deploy the scrambler that would block

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.049 
deploy the scrambler that would block
the<00:00:54.359> 3G<00:00:55.170> signals<00:00:55.679> for<00:00:55.979> the<00:00:56.100> specific<00:00:56.579> carrier

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the 3G signals for the specific carrier

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.799 
the 3G signals for the specific carrier
that<00:00:57.179> the<00:00:57.299> person<00:00:57.569> was<00:00:57.749> using<00:00:58.049> and<00:00:58.609> then<00:00:59.809> you'd

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that the person was using and then you'd

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
that the person was using and then you'd
use<00:01:01.049> a<00:01:01.079> device<00:01:01.589> that<00:01:01.889> attaches<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.429> two<00:01:03.030> large

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
use a device that attaches to two large

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.260 
use a device that attaches to two large
antennas<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.190> takes<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> internal

antennas one that takes the internal

antennas one that takes the internal
signals<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.960> nearby<00:01:07.440> signals<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.369> does

signals or the nearby signals and does
the<00:01:09.240> One<00:01:09.420> X<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.230> that<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.560> strong<00:01:11.190> enough

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the One X and one that is strong enough

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.530 
the One X and one that is strong enough
to<00:01:11.850> bypass<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:12.870> 3G<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.370> that<00:01:14.550> it<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.880> talk<00:01:15.120> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to bypass the 3G so that it can talk to

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.100 
especially since I have built this one
into<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.260> device<00:02:07.260> that<00:02:07.729> was<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.789> box<00:02:09.209> for<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> Cisco

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
into a device that was a box for a Cisco

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.890 
into a device that was a box for a Cisco
product<00:02:10.849> so<00:02:11.849> if<00:02:11.940> somebody<00:02:12.209> found<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:12.780> their

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
product so if somebody found it in their

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.520 
product so if somebody found it in their
network<00:02:13.260> they'd<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.219> more<00:02:14.370> likely<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.790> call<00:02:14.969> IT

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
network they'd be more likely to call IT

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.670 
network they'd be more likely to call IT
than<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.769> police<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:18.560> basic

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
than the police so a basic

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.399 
than the police so a basic
using<00:02:20.519> these<00:02:20.849> kinds<00:02:21.269> of<00:02:21.299> techniques<00:02:21.689> you<00:02:22.260> can

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
using these kinds of techniques you can

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.490 
using these kinds of techniques you can
eavesdrop<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.219> calls<00:02:23.849> pretty<00:02:24.269> easily<00:02:24.540> SMS

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
eavesdrop on calls pretty easily SMS

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.699 
eavesdrop on calls pretty easily SMS
messages<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.370> even<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:28.109> apps<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.560> are

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
messages and even the apps that are

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.349 
messages and even the apps that are
running<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.159> background<00:02:29.189> because<00:02:30.120> when

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
running in the background because when

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.720 
running in the background because when
one<00:02:30.689> X<00:02:30.930> data<00:02:31.290> goes<00:02:31.590> by<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.519> also

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
one X data goes by it is also

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.349 
one X data goes by it is also
unencrypted<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:34.159> so<00:02:35.159> all<00:02:35.519> of<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.969> things

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
unencrypted and so all of the things

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.020 
unencrypted and so all of the things
that<00:02:36.450> are<00:02:36.599> going<00:02:36.840> by<00:02:36.959> checking<00:02:37.379> for<00:02:37.709> email<00:02:38.219> via

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that are going by checking for email via

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.330 
that are going by checking for email via
pop<00:02:39.359> are<00:02:39.719> just<00:02:40.079> going<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.349> send<00:02:40.590> your<00:02:40.859> username

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
pop are just going to send your username

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.899 
pop are just going to send your username
and<00:02:41.459> password<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:42.090> clear<00:02:42.359> text<00:02:42.750> over<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.019> pop

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
and password and clear text over the pop

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.610 
and password and clear text over the pop
that<00:02:44.909> may<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:45.269> be<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.510> case<00:02:45.719> if<00:02:46.019> your<00:02:46.319> pop

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that may not be the case if your pop

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.599 
that may not be the case if your pop
account<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.219> enabled<00:02:47.730> with<00:02:48.560> SSH<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:50.250> most

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
account is enabled with SSH but most

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.390 
account is enabled with SSH but most
peoples<00:02:51.030> are<00:02:51.269> not<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.379> it's<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.859> great<00:02:53.159> way<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
peoples are not so it's a great way to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.649 
peoples are not so it's a great way to
get<00:02:54.000> usernames<00:02:54.599> passwords<00:02:55.400> contacts<00:02:56.659> text

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
get usernames passwords contacts text

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.960 
get usernames passwords contacts text
messages<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.650> any<00:02:59.099> of<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.400> kind<00:02:59.639> of<00:02:59.730> data
