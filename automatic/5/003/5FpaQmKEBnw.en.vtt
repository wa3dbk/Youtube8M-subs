00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
different than when I first started I

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.849 
different than when I first started I
think<00:03:45.599> that<00:03:45.719> would<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:45.989> quite<00:03:46.260> well<00:03:46.469> about<00:03:46.739> it

think that would be quite well about it

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.860 
think that would be quite well about it
right<00:03:47.010> now<00:03:47.040> but<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.790> just<00:03:47.909> need<00:03:48.389> to<00:03:48.510> sometimes
