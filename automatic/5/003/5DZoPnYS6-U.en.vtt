00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
finished washing up and when I was out

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.339 
finished washing up and when I was out
on<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.889> ride<00:00:11.099> my<00:00:11.340> CV<00:00:11.670> stopped<00:00:11.940> working<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:13.049> I

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
on the ride my CV stopped working so I

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.600 
on the ride my CV stopped working so I
was<00:00:13.440> getting<00:00:13.620> ready<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.860> troubleshoot<00:00:14.490> it

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
was getting ready to troubleshoot it

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.589 
was getting ready to troubleshoot it
figure<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:14.910> what's<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.269> on

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
figure out what's going on

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.000 
figure out what's going on
and<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.139> thought<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.379> shooting<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.830> quick

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and I thought about shooting a quick

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.070 
and I thought about shooting a quick
video<00:00:17.340> showing<00:00:17.400> my<00:00:18.150> thoughts<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
video showing my thoughts on the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.349 
video showing my thoughts on the
placement<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.619> CB<00:00:19.949> why<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.820> put<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.180> where<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
placement of a CB why I put it where I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.120 
placement of a CB why I put it where I
did<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.689> Wrangler<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.590> rock<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> have

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
did on my Wrangler and the rock I have

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
did on my Wrangler and the rock I have
mounted<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> my<00:00:25.230> other<00:00:25.380> friends<00:00:25.560> have

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
mounted on so my other friends have

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.099 
mounted on so my other friends have
fooled<00:00:25.920> by<00:00:26.010> force<00:00:26.430> some<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.849> them<00:00:26.970> put<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.779> CB

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
fooled by force some of them put the CB

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.769 
fooled by force some of them put the CB
on<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> top<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.710> dashboard<00:00:29.570> they'll<00:00:30.570> put

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
on the top of the dashboard they'll put

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.120 
on the top of the dashboard they'll put
it<00:00:30.900> under<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> dashboard<00:00:31.769> or<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
it under the dashboard or get on the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.620 
it under the dashboard or get on the
driver<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> passenger<00:00:32.880> side<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> put<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
driver the passenger side to put on the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.690 
driver the passenger side to put on the
centre<00:00:33.840> console<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.530> thought<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.489> putting

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
centre console I thought about putting

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.520 
centre console I thought about putting
it<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> dashboard<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.170> didn't

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it on the dashboard is that I didn't

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.840 
it on the dashboard is that I didn't
want<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> exposed<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> Sun<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> time

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
want it exposed to the Sun all the time

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
want it exposed to the Sun all the time
I<00:00:39.059> mean<00:00:39.390> you've<00:00:39.570> got<00:00:39.719> electronic<00:00:40.079> chenille<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
I mean you've got electronic chenille it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.350 
I mean you've got electronic chenille it
gets<00:00:40.770> hot<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.160> time<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> Sun

know I didn't thought it might wear it
out<00:00:49.110> quicker<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.850> didn't<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> down

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
out quicker I didn't want to put it down

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.869 
out quicker I didn't want to put it down
here<00:00:51.780> underneath<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.559> console<00:00:53.430> pretty<00:00:53.760> much

I<00:00:53.969> didn't<00:00:54.149> want<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.719> C<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.989> mounted<00:00:55.440> anywhere

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I didn't want the C be mounted anywhere

below any of the factory electronics

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
below any of the factory electronics
reason<00:00:59.280> being<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.699> I've<00:00:59.820> been<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.059> some<00:01:00.149> deep

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
reason being is I've been in some deep

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.930 
reason being is I've been in some deep
water<00:01:00.539> before<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> been<00:01:02.129> shifting<00:01:02.489> gears<00:01:02.789> in

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
water before and been shifting gears in

water before and been shifting gears in
the<00:01:03.030> puddle<00:01:03.329> water<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.559> didn't<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:04.949> C

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the puddle water and I didn't want my C

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.240 
the puddle water and I didn't want my C
be<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.430> low<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:07.070> just<00:01:08.070> trying<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
be that low so you know just trying to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.609 
be that low so you know just trying to
save<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:08.460> electronics<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> decided<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.470> want

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
save my electronics so I decided I want

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
save my electronics so I decided I want
to<00:01:10.650> go<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.860> high<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.880> still<00:01:12.240> don't<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.479> an

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to go up high and I still don't have an

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
to go up high and I still don't have an
insight<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> complete<00:01:13.740> cage<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.280> goes<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
insight or a complete cage that goes you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
insight or a complete cage that goes you
know<00:01:15.409> replaces<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> front<00:01:16.740> bars<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
know replaces the front bars and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.660 
know replaces the front bars and
encloses<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.390> windshield<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.490> trying

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
encloses the windshield so I was trying

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.950 
encloses the windshield so I was trying
to<00:01:20.759> find<00:01:20.970> something<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.360> could<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.840> up

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to find something that could get it up

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
to find something that could get it up
high<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.830> came<00:01:23.009> across<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.310> company<00:01:23.759> called

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
high and I came across a company called

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.679 
high and I came across a company called
CB<00:01:24.299> RAC<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.810> CB<00:01:25.710> RAC<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.280> word<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> that's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
CB RAC and CB RAC is one word and that's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.929 
CB RAC and CB RAC is one word and that's
a<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.049> inexpensive<00:01:28.290> unit<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.520> think

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
a really inexpensive unit it's I think

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.200 
a really inexpensive unit it's I think
it<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.150> $99<00:01:30.869> shipped<00:01:31.460> they<00:01:32.460> carry<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> lifetime

self-tapping screws go in through the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.380 
self-tapping screws go in through the
roll<00:02:21.280> bar<00:02:21.490> or<00:02:21.610> whatever<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
back here it also has a slot if you want

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.180 
back here it also has a slot if you want
to<00:02:25.510> use<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.690> pipe<00:02:26.170> plan<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:26.920> use<00:02:27.070> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
to use a pipe plan so I just use the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.740 
to use a pipe plan so I just use the
pipe<00:02:27.370> clamp<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:29.200> attach<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.860> top<00:02:30.580> portion<00:02:30.910> of

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
pipe clamp to attach the top portion of

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.040 
pipe clamp to attach the top portion of
the<00:02:31.930> channel<00:02:33.210> then<00:02:34.210> just<00:02:34.690> figure<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:34.930> where

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
the channel then just figure out where

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.350 
the channel then just figure out where
you<00:02:35.140> want<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.680> mount<00:02:35.770> your<00:02:35.890> CB<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:37.000> mounted

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
you want to mount your CB and I mounted

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.670 
you want to mount your CB and I mounted
it<00:02:37.450> forward<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.140> would<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:38.380> room<00:02:38.560> to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
it forward so that I would have room to

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.390 
it forward so that I would have room to
put<00:02:38.830> something<00:02:39.100> else<00:02:39.220> back<00:02:39.460> here<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:42.280> it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
put something else back here and then it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.390 
put something else back here and then it
attaches<00:02:42.700> with<00:02:43.260> six<00:02:44.260> nuts<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.710> bolts<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.160> go

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
attaches with six nuts and bolts that go

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.120 
attaches with six nuts and bolts that go
through<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.850> channel<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.920> there<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.010> have

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
through the channel and there you have

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.910 
through the channel and there you have
it's<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.310> real<00:02:48.459> simple<00:02:48.610> system<00:02:49.680> keeps<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.830> up

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
it's a real simple system keeps it up

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.270 
it's a real simple system keeps it up
out<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.250> water<00:02:52.560> provides<00:02:53.560> shade<00:02:53.890> for<00:02:54.190> it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
out of the water provides shade for it

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.449 
out of the water provides shade for it
and<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.810> very<00:02:56.350> easy<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.650> access<00:02:56.860> for<00:02:57.280> both

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
and it's very easy to access for both

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.610 
and it's very easy to access for both
the<00:02:57.640> passenger<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.390> driver<00:02:58.630> if<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.470> need

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
wondering what that radio I got in there

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.690 
wondering what that radio I got in there
it's<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.489> Cobra<00:03:04.480> 25<00:03:05.370> panic<00:03:06.370> buttons<00:03:06.640> just

it's just a Cobra 25 panic buttons just
something<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.030> picked<00:03:07.180> up<00:03:07.300> at<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.510> flight<00:03:08.440> school

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
something I picked up at a flight school

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.310 
something I picked up at a flight school
but<00:03:09.640> doesn't<00:03:10.330> really<00:03:10.450> do<00:03:10.600> anything<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.020> just

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320

but doesn't really do anything I just
thought<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.530> was<00:03:11.590> kind<00:03:11.709> of<00:03:11.800> neat<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.010> have<00:03:12.190> on

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
thought it was kind of neat to have on
