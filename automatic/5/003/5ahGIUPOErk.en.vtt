00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello my dear friends of youtube them 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.020
 speaks jgc chuy with a new video 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.639
 What will he do about those 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.679
 pokemon that made them a lot 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.469
 lazy hurry or I do not know why so 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.900
 ugly without creativity almost a mention of 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 mother x it's clear that not only 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.119
 I talk about his physical form a little bit 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 of its statistics and movements in the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.029
 position number 5 we find this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 pokemon called chancey yes that's right 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.250
 chang and first of all it 's a blowjob 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.469
 just see your delayed eyes 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
 mental by the way my regards to all 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.090
 people with physical illnesses or 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.190
 I do not intend to offend 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.020
 in the least if someone feels 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.780
 offended my most sincere apologies 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.789
 well I press on with the video one more time 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.710
 I am sorry if I offend any person 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.930
 besides that he has a handyman what 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.969
 more useless I do not even think I can 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.890
 touching your feet despite that can 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.770
 use them to fight the movement 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.870
 double slap by god does not hurt 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.000
 nothing besides that his statistics of 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.430
 combat are crap except for the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.870
 hp and its evolution and pre-evolution are 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.270
 equal of pendejas 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.490
 which is to get is not worth it to me 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.130
 criterion but good is not in a place 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.710
 higher because he has a lot of hp and can 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.830
 be useful in position number 4 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.830
 we found this pokemon called 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.080
 Buffet yes, it's a buffet 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.480
 characteristic of this pokemon at least 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.350
 in the series is your typical sonidito wow 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 feet 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.760
 many will say this useless does not know how to do 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.740
 more than reflecting attacks should be the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.720
 number one as they are right or the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.940
 would not have been because there is much more 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 useless that this bastard your attacks 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.930
 they reflect the damage with double 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.240
 power so it is powerful in the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.190
 right hands the problem is your face 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.400
 of stupid who can not learn more 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.920
 attacks that you gain by evolving and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.160
 their statistics although they are not high are 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.380
 decent as his defense and hp in the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.570
 position number 3 the bronze medal 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.210
 of uselessness is for this pokemon 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.660
 called beat or yes it is 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.820
 let's see what I can say simply 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.040
 buy a chewing gum that they like the most and 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.970
 Grape taste chew on it and when 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.030
 do not want to see it is 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.040
 have you captured a dit or is it what you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.470
 happened to the creator of this grape chewing gum 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.870
 in the end his only attack is transformation 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.240
 which can serve you except for the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.670
 reason that although it copies the attacks of 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.950
 his opponent does it with only 5 pp as 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.200
 maximum which leaves you at a disadvantage in 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.570
 a long battle and its statistics are 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.060
 relatively low to my liking is not very 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.280
 good pokemon except you can raise 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.380
 with the iess simpaticÃ³n xd 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.110
 there are those who take advantage of it but not 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.360
 it is very useful to say in the position 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.490
 number 2 the silver medal of the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.920
 uselessness is for this pokemon called 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.650
 magic art yes that's right 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.380
 magic art a surprise for many who 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.420
 They must think what's wrong with you and 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.209
 this pokemon does not even clean up 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.640
 the clear ass that should have the 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.800
 gold or something else but its evolution will guide 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.170
 Two saves him besides that look at his little face 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.140
 of asshole encourages you to give him money and 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.760
 you think this crazy man wants to kill me for 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.820
 what you give all your money 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.530
 that's how he learns only three attacks 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.630
 splash tackle and whip but as 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.270
 I said and plows saves it then 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.670
 just at level 20 and it's worth the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.830
 effort well we have come to the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.420
 unhappy first place winner of the 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.060
 gold medal of uselessness in 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.830
 pokemon the pokemon known as zebras 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.780
 that's it, you're going, they 'll tell me, it's more useful 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.580
 that magic art at least he can 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.710
 learn eggs movements and their 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.050
 Mirotic evolution far exceeds 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.000
 guide two and they are right but 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.310
 will get fevas is harder than 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.440
 magic art is more difficult to evolve 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.540
 to mirotic it is very difficult to learn 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.910
 egg movements and above all is a 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.250
 Chinese copy of magic up or what arguments 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.680
 in their favor they have regard to that is 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.990
 magic in times of hunger and mirotic a 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.670
 homosexual cattle or not 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.340
 magicard was not saved with what the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.470
 piracy in short thank you very much for
