00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.439
 welcome to pre season we always 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.990
 We are looking for an opportunity to update and improve 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.089
 your impressions of the game this year we 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.349
 let's develop the role of support we introduce 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.809
 changes for foresters 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.050
 and improve the whole course of the game in the gorge 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.109
 summoners we really need your 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.869
 reviews to make season 2014 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.000
 even better, we believe that every player 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.890
 deserves the opportunity to influence the game 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.140
 at any time regardless of the role and 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.869
 positions some players often 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.470
 lag behind fellow end of game first 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.900
 all this support and foresters 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.790
 for starters let's talk about winning support 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.070
 over the nexus is expensive 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.200
 struggle for a review on the map for some 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.570
 players often support turned around 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.550
 shortage of gold on the subject and to 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.320
 put an end to this we introduce new 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.200
 elements that will change strategy 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.940
 reviews and share responsibility 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.760
 there will be new items giving a review 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.590
 we called them accessories they are free 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.310
 and stored in a new inventory cell 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.199
 each of them works in its own way 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.710
 exposes the totem cuts off the enemy 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.770
 totems 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.719
 or reveal the area on the map to players 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.909
 no need to spend gold on accessories 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.979
 so everyone will be able to participate in 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.509
 fight for review besides 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.640
 players can no longer simultaneously 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.270
 set more than a certain number 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.369
 totems we want players to do 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.439
 weighted decision sets from m and 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.289
 in this case, the reviewer should 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.789
 carry all team members 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.859
 making it easier for support players to work with 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.109
 totems we also provided them with new 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.359
 sources of income with talent and 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.369
 items some items will 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.880
 give players support extra 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.829
 gold 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.429
 their owners will be easier to achieve 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.560
 their goals the end of the match the champions will start 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.180
 a little different gain experience so you 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.280
 it will be easier to get senior level 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.620
 this will allow players to pair lines 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.480
 free to navigate the map without depriving 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.660
 their ability to grow on a par with 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.490
 teams finally we want players 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.950
 support felt in a group 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.050
 Combat no less useful than inflicting 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.420
 great magic damage or powerful tanks 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.130
 now with the growth of strength and skills will 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.370
 strengthen primarily useful 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.770
 properties of support spells as 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.500
 character development its gain and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.330
 weakening will become more effective 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.420
 support players will be able to experience progress 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.040
 peculiar to other roles 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.959
 move on to the foresters of the third season 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.420
 those who succeeded 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.400
 helpful skills support foresters 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.500
 relying mainly on high damage 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.540
 were not so successful we found 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.489
 several new ways to ease them 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.500
 a life 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.540
 we added one camp for each 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.080
 hand it diversifies the route 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.300
 foresters and increase their income besides 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.890
 there will be new items that will strengthen 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.790
 any style of play whether it's killing 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.739
 monsters or ambush on enemy lines 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.959
 we also introduce level for neutral 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.600
 monsters that will grow with an average 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.970
 player level this will help foresters not 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.180
 falling behind mates getting more 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.650
 experience and gold for the kill 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.600
 high-level monsters foresters 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.610
 get the opportunity to earn more 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.519
 gold and experience that will give them a chance to collect 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.920
 powerful items so no matter what 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.760
 style of play you prefer you 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.650
 can not be dismissed 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.870
 so we discussed the change affecting 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.300
 a certain role besides them we 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.120
 try to improve the global course of the game 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.370
 new camps are not the only 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.800
 change on the map we also went through 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.400
 garden shears on some lips 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.620
 Summoner Gorge it helped 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.599
 eliminate confusion with installing totems 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.560
 and also solved the issue with visibility in 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.560
 parts of bottlenecks 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.549
 to reduce the global effect of 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.650
 rapid destruction of the towers we change 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.360
 rewards for them 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.090
 bring more gold to players 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.060
 directly destroy them but less 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.099
 the rest of the team the destruction of the inhibitor 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.750
 will make not all your minions stronger 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.970
 but only those that come by 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.500
 appropriate line this will allow 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.870
 team lost inhibitor 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.860
 focus on the counterattack without spending 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.780
 defense time all three lines finally 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.489
 dragon reward will grow over 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.579
 match letting you get more 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.100
 gold and experience we want to fight for 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.750
 the dragon did not die down even at the end of the game 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.610
 while now in the final stage 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.039
 dragon few people interested 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.139
 we hope that all this combined with 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.180
 other high-level changes 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.550
 make the next season more dynamic and 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.979
 more interesting is all that you see in this 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.960
 video only the tip of the iceberg full 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.940
 change information include about 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.919
