00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.490 

one<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.210> things<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.840> banjo<00:00:10.080> that

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
one of the things about the banjo that

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.610 
one of the things about the banjo that
makes<00:00:10.679> me<00:00:10.889> like<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.840> it's<00:00:12.840> probably<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.469> it's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
makes me like it it's probably that it's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.560 
makes me like it it's probably that it's
a<00:00:13.679> very<00:00:13.889> mechanical<00:00:14.639> instrument<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.299> got<00:00:15.450> all

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
a very mechanical instrument you got all

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.450 
a very mechanical instrument you got all
these<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.839> nuts<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.470> tighten<00:00:16.680> up<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.340> you

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
these little nuts to tighten up and you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.609 
these little nuts to tighten up and you
can<00:00:17.640> adjust<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:18.840> sorts<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.410> little

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
can adjust the all sorts of little

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.830 
can adjust the all sorts of little
things<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.000> things<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.359> find<00:00:21.570> myself

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
things one of the things I find myself

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.679 
things one of the things I find myself
doing<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.470> lot<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.920> adjusting<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.789> placement

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
doing a lot is adjusting the placement

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.009 
doing a lot is adjusting the placement
of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.960> bridge<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> banjo<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.330> bridge

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
of the bridge and on a banjo the bridge

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.689 
of the bridge and on a banjo the bridge
just<00:00:28.349> sits<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> string<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.640> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
just sits here on the string so you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.429 
just sits here on the string so you
slide<00:00:30.090> around<00:00:30.480> put<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.869> different<00:00:31.019> places

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
slide around put it in different places

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.430 
slide around put it in different places
the<00:00:32.130> most<00:00:32.369> critical<00:00:32.910> place<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.450> your<00:00:33.780> banjo<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the most critical place on your banjo is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200 
the most critical place on your banjo is
always<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.340> third<00:00:35.550> string<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
always going to be the third string I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.430 
always going to be the third string I
don't<00:00:36.360> know<00:00:36.420> why<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.230> third

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
don't know why that is but the third

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.790 
don't know why that is but the third
string<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.040> most<00:00:38.219> sensitive<00:00:39.620> if<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
string is the most sensitive if the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290 
string is the most sensitive if the
third<00:00:41.010> string<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> bridge<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> then

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
third string if the bridge and then

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.880 
third string if the bridge and then
right<00:00:42.540> place<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.379> tuned<00:00:43.649> right

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
right place or if it's not tuned right

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.529 
right place or if it's not tuned right
it<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.070> sticks<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.910> sore<00:00:45.210> thumb

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
it just sticks out like a sore thumb

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.390 
it just sticks out like a sore thumb
this<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:45.989> isn't<00:00:46.140> right

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.320 

I<00:00:50.650> turned<00:00:51.650> mine<00:00:51.890> by<00:00:52.130> here

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
I turned mine by here

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:24.030 
I turned mine by here
space<00:00:54.900> that<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.190> string<00:00:56.520> sounds<00:00:56.880> about<00:00:57.060> right

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.650 

now<00:01:25.040> if<00:01:25.340> my<00:01:25.790> bridge<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:26.150> in<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.300> right<00:01:26.480> place

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
now if my bridge is in the right place

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.510 
now if my bridge is in the right place
we're<00:01:26.930> not<00:01:27.080> fret<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.530> third<00:01:27.740> string<00:01:28.070> on<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
we're not fret the third string on the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.210 
we're not fret the third string on the
second<00:01:28.910> fret<00:01:28.940> it's<00:01:29.180> gonna<00:01:29.330> sound<00:01:29.570> good

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.700 

that<00:01:36.220> sounds<00:01:36.490> pretty<00:01:36.610> good<00:01:36.990> way<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.020> tell<00:01:38.380> is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
that sounds pretty good way to tell is

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.500 
that sounds pretty good way to tell is
to<00:01:38.890> go<00:01:39.070> from<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.580> nut<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.120> this<00:01:40.240> case

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
to go from the nut and in this case

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.870 
to go from the nut and in this case
where<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.780> have<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:40.990> capo<00:01:41.440> here<00:01:41.800> I'm<00:01:42.040> hauling<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
where I have a capo here I'm hauling the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.570 
where I have a capo here I'm hauling the
nut<00:01:43.120> my<00:01:43.600> first<00:01:44.260> fret<00:01:44.680> of<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.950> strings<00:01:45.280> passed

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
nut my first fret of the strings passed

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.560 
nut my first fret of the strings passed
across<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:46.750> go<00:01:46.960> from<00:01:47.229> there<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.010> 12th

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
across so I go from there to the 12th

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.880 
across so I go from there to the 12th
fret<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.869> then<00:01:50.350> I<00:01:50.500> pull<00:01:50.800> a<00:01:52.680> harmonic<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.800> what

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
fret and then I pull a harmonic is what

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.020 
fret and then I pull a harmonic is what
they<00:01:54.009> call<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:54.369> where<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:54.640> just<00:01:54.790> barely

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
they call this where you just barely

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.210 
they call this where you just barely
touch<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.479> string<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.710> get<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.890> little<00:01:57.040> tune

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
touch the string you get a little tune

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.060 
touch the string you get a little tune
if<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.119> harmonic<00:01:58.840> sounds<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.410> same<00:01:59.650> way<00:01:59.890> it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
if that harmonic sounds the same way it

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.190 
if that harmonic sounds the same way it
sounds<00:02:00.460> when<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.640> fret<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.210> at<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:01.479> twelfth

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
sounds when you fret it at that twelfth

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.160 
sounds when you fret it at that twelfth
fret

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
fret

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.109 
fret
it's<00:02:05.170> harmonic<00:02:05.710> that's<00:02:05.979> Freddie<00:02:06.280> harmonic

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119

it's harmonic that's Freddie harmonic
credit<00:02:07.570> that's<00:02:07.780> right<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.619> tell<00:02:08.830> it's

I find myself moving my bridge around a
lot<00:02:19.750> lately<00:02:20.200> because<00:02:20.650> I'll<00:02:21.040> go<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.310> play

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
lot lately because I'll go to play

something I think that's them right i
play<00:02:23.530> with<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.709> bridge<00:02:23.950> until<00:02:24.190> i<00:02:24.280> get<00:02:24.340> it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
play with the bridge until i get it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.310 
play with the bridge until i get it
right<00:02:24.550> when<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:25.450> right<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.840> right<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.260> I

right when it's right it's right and I

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.530 
right when it's right it's right and I
know<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.620> when<00:02:26.769> it's<00:02:26.920> not<00:02:27.070> right<00:02:27.400> it's<00:02:27.880> stands

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.750 
know it when it's not right it's stands
out<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.200> stops<00:02:29.530> me<00:02:29.739> from<00:02:29.769> playing<00:02:30.100> makes

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
out and it stops me from playing makes

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.170 
out and it stops me from playing makes
me<00:02:30.910> really<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:33.430> one<00:02:33.610> sounds<00:02:33.730> pretty<00:02:34.030> good

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
me really this one sounds pretty good

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.540 
me really this one sounds pretty good
and<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:34.989> by<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.200> way<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:35.860> tuned<00:02:36.340> in

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
and it's by the way this is not tuned in

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.030 
and it's by the way this is not tuned in
standard<00:02:37.540> G<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:37.900> probably<00:02:38.320> pretty<00:02:38.470> close<00:02:38.799> to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
standard G it's probably pretty close to

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.759 
standard G it's probably pretty close to
if<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.430> keep<00:02:39.700> out<00:02:39.940> your<00:02:39.970> banjo<00:02:40.720> at<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.560> first

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
if you keep out your banjo at the first

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.190 
if you keep out your banjo at the first
fret<00:02:42.100> it'd<00:02:42.370> probably<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:43.209> instead<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.959> G

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
fret it'd probably be a instead of G

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.670 
fret it'd probably be a instead of G
which<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.650> where<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.700> an<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:47.350> because<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
which is where this is an is because I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.250 
which is where this is an is because I
think<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.980> sounds<00:02:48.250> better

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:27.600 

so<00:02:52.260> with<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.250> said

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.160 

that<00:03:28.610> song<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.180> song<00:03:29.480> called<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:29.990> will

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
that song is a song called we will

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.380 
that song is a song called we will
understand<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.830> better<00:03:30.860> by<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.310> by<00:03:31.580> trying<00:03:32.270> to

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
understand it better by and by trying to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.540 
understand it better by and by trying to
remember<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.840> words<00:03:33.080> in<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.920> long<00:03:34.100> time<00:03:34.340> since

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
remember the words in a long time since

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.330 
remember the words in a long time since
I<00:03:34.670> sang<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.120> I'll<00:03:35.210> go<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.510> get<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.720> hymnal<00:03:35.990> and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.860 
I sang and I'll go to get a hymnal and
find<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.520> and<00:03:37.640> sing<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:37.940> for<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.300> fact<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.810> think
