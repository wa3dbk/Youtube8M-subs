00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
this is why there is balding possible

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.050

there's so much stress on the hair

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.910

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
now why do people do that I've come to a

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.590 
now why do people do that I've come to a
conclusion

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
conclusion

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.399 
conclusion
I<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:01.770> people<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:03.869> sorts<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
I think people you know do all sorts of

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.190 
I think people you know do all sorts of
things<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> hairs<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.930> will<00:02:06.990> look

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
things of the hairs so that it will look

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.430 
things of the hairs so that it will look
straight<00:02:07.860> coming<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> scalp<00:02:09.450> because

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
straight coming out of the scalp because

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.710 
straight coming out of the scalp because
for<00:02:10.920> some<00:02:11.190> reason<00:02:11.239> this<00:02:12.239> is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
for some reason this is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.590 
for some reason this is
thieves<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.500> better<00:02:13.880> because<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.120> closer<00:02:15.390> to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
thieves is better because it's closer to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.360 
thieves is better because it's closer to
white<00:02:16.490> than<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.010> just

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
white than this so you have to just

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.710 
white than this so you have to just
learn<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.820> accept<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.350> have<00:02:22.380> maps

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
learn you accept that you have maps

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.710 
learn you accept that you have maps

thing

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
thing

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.980 
thing
I<00:03:08.340> definitely<00:03:09.320> think<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:12.030> know<00:03:12.150> giving

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
I definitely think that you know giving

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.020 
I definitely think that you know giving
a<00:03:13.080> little<00:03:13.260> bit<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.070> length<00:03:14.340> Department

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
a little bit and the length Department

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.300 
a little bit and the length Department
is<00:03:15.180> worth<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.840> long<00:03:15.930> run<00:03:16.350> because<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
is worth it in the long run because the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.210 
is worth it in the long run because the
hair<00:03:17.550> can<00:03:17.880> get<00:03:18.209> long<00:03:18.620> there<00:03:19.620> isn't<00:03:20.010> going<00:03:20.160> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
hair can get long there isn't going to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.850 
hair can get long there isn't going to
be<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.660> my<00:03:21.660> hair<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:21.989> too<00:03:22.170> heavy<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.530> my

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
be that my hair is too heavy for my

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.520 
be that my hair is too heavy for my
roots<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:23.670> as<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.840> see<00:03:25.140> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
roots because as you can see the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.370 
roots because as you can see the
dreadlocks<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.459> thick<00:03:27.360> if<00:03:27.660> they<00:03:28.050> want<00:03:28.290> to

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
dreadlocks can be thick if they want to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.170 
dreadlocks can be thick if they want to
be<00:03:28.760> quite<00:03:29.760> thick<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.709> they<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:33.060> know

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
be quite thick and they can you know

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.570 
be quite thick and they can you know
there's<00:03:33.390> no<00:03:33.570> weight<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.140> them<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:35.220> there's<00:03:35.430> no

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
there's no weight to them so there's no

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.610 
there's no weight to them so there's no
stress<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> roots<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:38.120> mean<00:03:39.410> maybe<00:03:40.410> it

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
stress on the roots so I mean maybe it

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.140 
stress on the roots so I mean maybe it
takes<00:03:40.860> longer<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.310> grow<00:03:41.519> but<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.730> think<00:03:41.970> it's

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
takes longer to grow but I think it's

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.670 
takes longer to grow but I think it's
worth<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.780> long<00:03:42.959> run<00:03:43.350> because<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.650> can

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
worth it in the long run because you can

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.420 
worth it in the long run because you can
just<00:03:43.980> keep<00:03:44.130> your<00:03:44.370> hair<00:03:44.630> alright<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:46.620> let<00:03:47.400> me
