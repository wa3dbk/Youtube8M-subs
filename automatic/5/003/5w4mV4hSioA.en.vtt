turn Avignon all right the one thing you
could<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.450> help<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.230> along<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
could do is help it along just kind of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.360 
could do is help it along just kind of
swish<00:00:50.940> those<00:00:51.239> berries<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.900> this<00:00:52.280> what<00:00:53.280> we're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
swish those berries like this what we're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.049 
swish those berries like this what we're
trying<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.790> is<00:00:53.910> cook<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.870> berries<00:00:55.260> because

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
trying to do is cook the berries because

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.660 
trying to do is cook the berries because
raspberries<00:00:57.320> don't<00:00:58.320> need<00:00:58.680> additional<00:00:59.040> pectin

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
raspberries don't need additional pectin

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.880 
raspberries don't need additional pectin
because<00:00:59.940> there's<00:01:00.120> natural<00:01:00.660> pectin<00:01:01.230> which<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
because there's natural pectin which is

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.479 
because there's natural pectin which is
a<00:01:01.920> thickening<00:01:02.430> agent<00:01:03.259> so<00:01:04.259> Abbi<00:01:04.440> you<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.949> how

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
a thickening agent so Abbi you see how

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.880 
a thickening agent so Abbi you see how
it's<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.970> how<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.960> raspberries<00:01:07.619> are

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it's all how the raspberries are

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
it's all how the raspberries are
breaking<00:01:08.550> down<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.030> liquid<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.080> it's

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
breaking down now it's liquid and it's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.219 
breaking down now it's liquid and it's
simmering<00:01:10.680> plus<00:01:11.280> basically<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> sugar<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
simmering plus basically the sugar that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.219 
simmering plus basically the sugar that
we<00:01:13.320> added<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.970> cooking<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:15.840> kind

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
we added to it it is cooking down kind

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.630 
we added to it it is cooking down kind
of<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.560> cook<00:01:16.770> candy<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.520> when

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
of like how you cook candy right so when

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.570 
of like how you cook candy right so when
you<00:01:17.729> cook<00:01:17.940> sugar<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:19.440> hardens<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.280> gets

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you cook sugar it it hardens and gets

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.180 
you cook sugar it it hardens and gets
thicker<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.450> different<00:01:22.110> stages<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.800> we<00:01:22.920> don't

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
thicker in different stages so we don't

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.930 
thicker in different stages so we don't
want<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.940> sugar<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.420> cook<00:01:24.660> so<00:01:25.410> much<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:26.610> we

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
want the sugar to cook so much that we

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.930 
want the sugar to cook so much that we
can't<00:01:27.360> use<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.080> jam<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:29.250> Abbey's<00:01:29.520> -<00:01:29.670> Natalie

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
can't use the jam so Abbey's - Natalie

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.700 
can't use the jam so Abbey's - Natalie
reduce<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> heat<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:30.899> we're<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.229> keep

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
reduce the heat so now we're gonna keep

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.320 
reduce the heat so now we're gonna keep
an<00:01:31.860> eye<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.039> it<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.369> about<00:01:32.640> 10<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.940> 15<00:01:33.240> minutes

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
an eye on it for about 10 to 15 minutes

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.999 
an eye on it for about 10 to 15 minutes
we're<00:01:33.539> gonna<00:01:33.630> check<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.080> every<00:01:34.530> five<00:01:34.800> minutes

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
we're gonna check it every five minutes

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.880 
we're gonna check it every five minutes
or<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.429> to<00:01:36.210> make<00:01:36.240> sure<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:37.050> it's<00:01:37.259> getting

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
or so to make sure that it's getting

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.820 
or so to make sure that it's getting
thick<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.310> not<00:01:38.340> too<00:01:38.490> thick<00:01:38.759> too<00:01:39.149> fast

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
thick but not too thick too fast

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.560 
thick but not too thick too fast
so<00:01:41.830> let's<00:01:42.010> cook<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.400> little<00:01:42.520> bit<00:01:42.640> longer<00:01:42.730> the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
so let's cook a little bit longer the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.350 
so let's cook a little bit longer the
jam<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:44.110> much<00:01:44.890> thicker<00:01:45.160> it's<00:01:45.400> dripping<00:01:45.880> much

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
jam is much thicker it's dripping much

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.010 
jam is much thicker it's dripping much
slower<00:01:46.750> now<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.860> seems<00:01:48.490> like<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:49.690> still

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
slower now it seems like it is still

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.500 
slower now it seems like it is still
very<00:01:50.500> runny<00:01:50.920> but<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.400> will<00:01:51.580> thicken<00:01:52.150> as<00:01:52.480> it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
very runny but it will thicken as it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.360 
very runny but it will thicken as it
cools<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.020> thing<00:01:53.200> with<00:01:53.380> Jam<00:01:53.620> is<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:54.220> could

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
cools on the thing with Jam is you could

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.730 
cools on the thing with Jam is you could
easily<00:01:54.580> overcook<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.450> because<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:56.560> know<00:01:56.680> you

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
easily overcook it because you know you

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.520 
easily overcook it because you know you
see<00:01:56.980> it<00:01:57.010> dripping<00:01:57.550> off<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.820> spoon<00:01:58.450> but<00:01:59.140> you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
see it dripping off the spoon but you

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.160 
see it dripping off the spoon but you
overcook<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.670> will<00:02:00.880> cool<00:02:01.240> completely<00:02:01.570> hard

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
overcook it it will cool completely hard

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.380 
overcook it it will cool completely hard
and<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:02.770> won't<00:02:02.950> be<00:02:03.040> able<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.340> spread<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.640> so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
and you won't be able to spread it so

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.790 
and you won't be able to spread it so
the<00:02:04.540> key<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.930> is<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:05.890> want<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:07.210> it's

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
the key is is you want it when it's

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.719 
the key is is you want it when it's
consistency<00:02:08.800> where<00:02:09.100> it's<00:02:09.190> just<00:02:09.310> slowly

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
consistency where it's just slowly

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.100 
consistency where it's just slowly
dripping<00:02:10.479> off<00:02:11.400> now<00:02:12.400> some<00:02:12.610> people<00:02:12.730> like<00:02:12.910> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
dripping off now some people like to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.840 
dripping off now some people like to
strain<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.320> seeds<00:02:14.500> out<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:15.070> their<00:02:15.190> jam<00:02:15.400> or

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
strain the seeds out of their jam or

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.030 
strain the seeds out of their jam or
even<00:02:16.180> blend<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.200> food<00:02:17.380> processor<00:02:17.890> or<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
even blend it in a food processor or a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.010 
even blend it in a food processor or a
blender<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.900> know

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
blender and you can do that but you know

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:30.620 
blender and you can do that but you know
the<00:02:20.620> seeds<00:02:20.890> are<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.100> great<00:02:21.370> source<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:22.060> fiber

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.870 

yeah<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.810> think<00:02:31.930> we<00:02:32.290> should<00:02:32.530> eat<00:02:32.800> some<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.640> bread

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
yeah I think we should eat some of bread

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:43.140 
yeah I think we should eat some of bread
maybe<00:02:34.300> I'll<00:02:34.480> try<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.750> ladies
