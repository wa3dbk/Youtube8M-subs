to<00:00:01.170> make<00:00:01.319> cottage<00:00:01.620> cheese<00:00:01.800> we<00:00:02.070> start<00:00:02.399> in<00:00:02.550> the

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
to make cottage cheese we start in the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.510 
to make cottage cheese we start in the
same<00:00:02.909> way<00:00:03.120> that<00:00:03.330> we<00:00:03.480> have<00:00:03.750> with<00:00:04.080> the

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
same way that we have with the

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.829 
same way that we have with the
mozzarella<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.819> it's<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.120> kind<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.420> basic

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
mozzarella and it's a kind of the basic

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.990 
mozzarella and it's a kind of the basic
beginning<00:00:07.529> for<00:00:07.710> all<00:00:07.740> cheese<00:00:08.189> we're<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:08.940> to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
beginning for all cheese we're going to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.060 
beginning for all cheese we're going to
take<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> milk<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.750> heat<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.290> 70<00:00:10.740> degrees

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
take the milk and heat it to 70 degrees

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.509 
take the milk and heat it to 70 degrees
and<00:00:11.690> once<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.559> doesn't<00:00:14.460> take

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and once we have that it doesn't take

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.369 
and once we have that it doesn't take
very<00:00:14.580> long<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.240> not<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:15.750> just<00:00:15.809> about<00:00:16.170> room

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
very long it's not it's just about room

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.290 
very long it's not it's just about room
temperature<00:00:16.880> then<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.119> will<00:00:18.330> add<00:00:18.770> a<00:00:20.150> half<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
temperature then we will add a half a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.590 
temperature then we will add a half a
cup<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.630> water<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.910> while<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.210> milk<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
cup of water and while the milk is

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.730 
cup of water and while the milk is
warming<00:00:25.019> we're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> dissolve<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
warming we're going to dissolve a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.220 
warming we're going to dissolve a
quarter<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.519> tablet<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> rennet<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.720> then

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
quarter of a tablet of rennet and then

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
quarter of a tablet of rennet and then
we'll<00:00:28.349> mix<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.980> along<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.400> our

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
we'll mix that in along with our

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.279 
we'll mix that in along with our
buttermilk<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.359> allow<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.900> culture

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
buttermilk and allow that to culture

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
buttermilk and allow that to culture
overnight<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> culture<00:00:32.880> going

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
overnight you get the culture going

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.180 
overnight you get the culture going
we're<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> mix<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.290> our<00:00:34.500> dissolved

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
we're just going to mix in our dissolved

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.280 
we're just going to mix in our dissolved
rennet<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.380> let's<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> Ram<00:00:38.190> real<00:00:38.520> wall

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
rennet and let's go to Ram real wall

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.979 
rennet and let's go to Ram real wall
distribute<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.379> evenly<00:00:40.500> through<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> milk

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
distribute it evenly through the milk

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.819 
distribute it evenly through the milk
and<00:00:42.989> then<00:00:43.140> we're<00:00:43.260> also<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> add<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and then we're also going to add a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.220 
and then we're also going to add a
quarter<00:00:44.250> cup<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.789> buttermilk<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
quarter cup of buttermilk now this is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
quarter cup of buttermilk now this is
buttermilk<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.059> made<00:00:48.059> earlier<00:00:56.300> give<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
buttermilk that I made earlier give that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.029 
buttermilk that I made earlier give that
a<00:00:57.570> good<00:00:57.809> whisk<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.500> we're<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.859> put

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
a good whisk and then we're going to put

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
a good whisk and then we're going to put
the<00:00:59.129> lid<00:00:59.280> on<00:01:01.940> if<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.149> using<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> want

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the lid on if you're using if you want

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.810 
the lid on if you're using if you want
to<00:01:04.049> culture<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> milk<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> something<00:01:05.670> other

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
to culture the milk and something other

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.340 
to culture the milk and something other
than<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> pan<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> watch<00:01:07.110> more

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
than the pan I don't like to watch more

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.539 
than the pan I don't like to watch more
than<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> usually<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
than one thing so I usually do it in the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
than one thing so I usually do it in the
pan<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.210> use<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.659> next<00:01:09.869> day

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pan that I'm going to use the next day

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
pan that I'm going to use the next day
but<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.010> did<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.430> something<00:01:11.610> else

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
but if you did do it in something else

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.070 
but if you did do it in something else
you<00:01:11.939> could<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.270> cover<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> towel

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you could just cover it with a towel

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
you could just cover it with a towel
we're<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> cover<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.220> let<00:01:14.700> this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we're going to cover that and let this

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.060 
we're going to cover that and let this
sit<00:01:15.090> overnight<00:01:15.390> until<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> forms<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.920> nice

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
sit overnight until it forms a nice

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.560 
sit overnight until it forms a nice
solid<00:01:17.490> curd<00:01:17.729> which<00:01:17.970> we'll<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
solid curd which we'll see in the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.330 
solid curd which we'll see in the
morning<00:01:18.720> our<00:01:19.140> cottage<00:01:19.470> cheese<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.009> has<00:01:20.159> been

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
morning our cottage cheese this has been

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
morning our cottage cheese this has been
sitting<00:01:20.549> overnight<00:01:21.200> hearing<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.470> can

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
sitting overnight hearing and you can

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.590 
sitting overnight hearing and you can
see<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> really<00:01:23.880> nice<00:01:24.119> edge

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
see that we have a really nice edge

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.620 
see that we have a really nice edge
going<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.549> that<00:01:26.549> shows<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.000> occurred<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
going here that shows that occurred is

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
going here that shows that occurred is
nicely<00:01:28.380> set<00:01:28.770> we're<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
nicely set we're going to just do the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.960 
nicely set we're going to just do the
basic<00:01:30.030> technique<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.659> we've<00:01:30.810> done<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
basic technique that we've done with the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.090 
basic technique that we've done with the
mozzarella<00:01:33.380> same<00:01:34.380> thing<00:01:34.590> we'll<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.860> some

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
mozzarella same thing we'll do some

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.300 
mozzarella same thing we'll do some
cream<00:01:35.280> cheese<00:01:36.350> any<00:01:37.350> cheese<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.710> make<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.189> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
cream cheese any cheese you make if you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.580 
cream cheese any cheese you make if you
ever<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:38.820> trying<00:01:39.270> trying<00:01:40.079> your<00:01:40.320> hand<00:01:40.470> at

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
ever get into trying trying your hand at

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
ever get into trying trying your hand at
hard<00:01:40.890> cheeses<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> same<00:01:42.299> technique

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
hard cheeses this is the same technique

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
hard cheeses this is the same technique
you<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.200> take<00:01:43.619> your<00:01:43.799> knife<00:01:43.950> slide<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> tip

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
you just take your knife slide the tip

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.200 
you just take your knife slide the tip
down<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.930> side<00:01:46.460> pull<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.490> along<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> bottom

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
down one side pull it along the bottom

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.859 
down one side pull it along the bottom
all<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.630> way<00:01:49.079> up<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> other<00:01:49.680> side<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
all the way up to the other side and

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.819 
all the way up to the other side and
then<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> same<00:01:52.409> thing<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> other

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
then you do the same thing in the other

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.490 
then you do the same thing in the other
direction<00:01:53.100> forming<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.909> thrid<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
direction forming a thrid you do that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.550 
direction forming a thrid you do that
about<00:01:55.649> 1/2<00:01:56.070> inch<00:01:56.369> line<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.969> break<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.049> curd<00:01:58.350> up

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
about 1/2 inch line to break the curd up

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.820 
about 1/2 inch line to break the curd up
into<00:01:58.950> smaller<00:01:59.280> pieces<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.850> allows<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.509> way

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
into smaller pieces and allows the way

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:11.530 
into smaller pieces and allows the way
to<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:02.540> be<00:02:02.570> pulled<00:02:02.960> out<00:02:10.270> there<00:02:11.270> we<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.510> our

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
to to be pulled out there we have our

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.800 
to to be pulled out there we have our
Kurd<00:02:12.530> nicely<00:02:13.190> cut<00:02:13.460> we're<00:02:13.670> going<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.970> begin<00:02:14.390> to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
Kurd nicely cut we're going to begin to

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.470 
Kurd nicely cut we're going to begin to
warm<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.680> Kurd<00:02:16.160> up<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> temperature<00:02:17.360> of

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
warm this Kurd up to a temperature of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.510 
warm this Kurd up to a temperature of
110<00:02:18.140> degrees<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.530> then<00:02:18.860> we'll<00:02:18.980> hold<00:02:19.220> that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
110 degrees and then we'll hold that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.850 
110 degrees and then we'll hold that
temperature<00:02:20.090> for<00:02:20.600> 20<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.050> 30<00:02:21.080> minutes<00:02:21.410> until

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
temperature for 20 to 30 minutes until

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.100 
temperature for 20 to 30 minutes until
that<00:02:22.130> Kurd<00:02:22.580> starts<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.000> pull<00:02:23.240> away<00:02:23.270> into<00:02:23.900> nice

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
that Kurd starts to pull away into nice

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.260 
that Kurd starts to pull away into nice
tight<00:02:24.440> little<00:02:24.650> pieces<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.940> we'll<00:02:26.090> see<00:02:26.240> that

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
tight little pieces so we'll see that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.210 
tight little pieces so we'll see that
now<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.690> next<00:02:26.720> step<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.260> our<00:02:27.350> cottage<00:02:27.950> cheese

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
now the next step in our cottage cheese

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.350 
now the next step in our cottage cheese
is<00:02:28.460> we're<00:02:28.670> going<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.090> let<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.080> curd<00:02:31.040> drain<00:02:31.580> for

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
is we're going to let the curd drain for

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.090 
is we're going to let the curd drain for
two<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.020> three<00:02:33.230> minutes<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.680> I'm<00:02:33.770> just<00:02:33.980> going

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
two to three minutes so I'm just going

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.790 
two to three minutes so I'm just going
to<00:02:34.130> pour<00:02:34.930> etre<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.080> into<00:02:36.290> my<00:02:36.410> colander

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
to pour etre it into my colander

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.280 
to pour etre it into my colander
this.language<00:02:37.160> cheesecloth<00:02:37.820> as<00:02:38.450> always<00:02:39.140> I'm

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290

this.language cheesecloth as always I'm
going<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.500> catch<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.920> way<00:02:40.040> because<00:02:40.460> I<00:02:40.580> want<00:02:40.700> to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
going to catch the way because I want to

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.440 
going to catch the way because I want to
use<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.330> make<00:02:41.510> ricotta<00:02:43.180> I'm<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.330> going

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450

use that to make ricotta I'm just going
to<00:02:44.480> pour<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.930> right<00:02:45.110> through<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:48.160> then

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
to pour that right through and then

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.890 
to pour that right through and then
we're<00:02:49.310> going<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.460> let<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.700> drain<00:02:50.150> for<00:02:50.600> a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.650 
we're going to let that drain for a
couple<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.500> minutes<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.730> majority<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.240> the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
couple of minutes so the majority of the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.540 
couple of minutes so the majority of the
standing<00:02:54.440> way<00:02:54.560> comes<00:02:54.920> out<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.310> then<00:02:55.430> we're

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
standing way comes out and then we're

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.850 
standing way comes out and then we're
going<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:56.140> dunk<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.380> some<00:02:57.560> water<00:02:57.740> and

going to dunk it in some water and
that'll<00:02:58.220> be<00:02:58.310> our<00:02:58.340> next<00:02:58.580> step

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
that'll be our next step

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.770 
that'll be our next step
alright<00:03:00.290> now<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.470> our<00:03:01.120> cheese<00:03:02.120> has<00:03:02.330> drained

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
alright now that our cheese has drained

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.600 
alright now that our cheese has drained

water here so see I'm just pressing that

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.010 
water here so see I'm just pressing that
out<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:56.080> then<00:03:57.090> I'm<00:03:58.090> going<00:03:58.270> to<00:03:58.330> put<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.630> back<00:03:58.810> in

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
out and then I'm going to put it back in

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.250 
out and then I'm going to put it back in
the<00:03:59.110> water<00:03:59.320> open<00:03:59.680> it<00:04:00.040> up<00:04:00.630> stir<00:04:01.630> it<00:04:01.750> around<00:04:01.840> so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
the water open it up stir it around so

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.830 
the water open it up stir it around so
that<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.530> cold<00:04:02.830> water<00:04:03.480> mixes<00:04:04.480> in<00:04:04.630> there<00:04:04.810> a

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
that that cold water mixes in there a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.350 
that that cold water mixes in there a
little<00:04:05.050> bit<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:06.550> I<00:04:06.820> don't<00:04:06.970> know<00:04:07.030> if<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.210> can

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
little bit and I don't know if you can

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.910 
little bit and I don't know if you can
see<00:04:07.570> this<00:04:07.720> here<00:04:07.930> but<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.320> is<00:04:08.440> starting<00:04:08.770> to

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
see this here but it is starting to

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.540 
see this here but it is starting to
tighten<00:04:09.310> up<00:04:09.370> even<00:04:09.700> more<00:04:11.070> by<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.130> time<00:04:12.220> we're

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
tighten up even more by the time we're

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.950 
tighten up even more by the time we're
done<00:04:12.580> it<00:04:12.910> should<00:04:13.060> be<00:04:13.210> in<00:04:13.300> those<00:04:13.390> nice<00:04:13.660> little

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
done it should be in those nice little

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.729 
done it should be in those nice little
cottage<00:04:14.680> cheese<00:04:15.220> curds<00:04:15.910> that<00:04:16.120> we're<00:04:16.269> used<00:04:16.450> to

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.760 

we<00:04:20.739> stand<00:04:21.489> out<00:04:22.260> we're<00:04:23.260> just<00:04:23.290> going<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.560> keep

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
we stand out we're just going to keep

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.420 
we stand out we're just going to keep
doing<00:04:23.950> this

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
doing this

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.840 
doing this
two<00:04:24.580> or<00:04:24.730> three<00:04:24.760> minutes<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:26.400> then<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.610> next

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
two or three minutes and then the next

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.520 
two or three minutes and then the next
step<00:04:27.970> will<00:04:28.090> be<00:04:28.240> doing<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.570> same<00:04:28.600> thing<00:04:29.170> except

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
step will be doing the same thing except

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.290 
step will be doing the same thing except
we're<00:04:29.650> going<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.860> do<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.100> in<00:04:30.220> ice<00:04:30.490> water<00:04:30.640> here's

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
we're going to do it in ice water here's

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.930 
we're going to do it in ice water here's
the<00:04:31.480> ice<00:04:31.630> water<00:04:31.990> I've<00:04:32.400> pressed<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.610> drained

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
the ice water I've pressed and drained

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.090 
the ice water I've pressed and drained
the<00:04:34.510> curd<00:04:34.720> in<00:04:34.900> cold<00:04:35.169> water<00:04:35.440> for<00:04:35.710> two<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.919> three

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
the curd in cold water for two to three

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.590 
the curd in cold water for two to three
minutes<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.460> what<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.760> translates<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.390> is

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
minutes and what that translates to is

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.110 
minutes and what that translates to is
about<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.840> half<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.169> dozen<00:04:38.320> times<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:39.120> dunking

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
about a half a dozen times of dunking

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.100 
about a half a dozen times of dunking
the<00:04:40.240> bag<00:04:41.190> stirring<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:42.460> squeezing<00:04:43.210> so<00:04:43.810> we're

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
the bag stirring and squeezing so we're

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.960 
the bag stirring and squeezing so we're
going<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.290> do<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.500> same<00:04:44.680> thing<00:04:44.950> here<00:04:45.370> except

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
going to do the same thing here except

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.909 
going to do the same thing here except
we're<00:04:46.090> doing<00:04:46.240> any<00:04:46.450> ice<00:04:46.630> water<00:04:46.960> we're<00:04:47.710> going<00:04:47.860> to

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
we're doing any ice water we're going to

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.230 
we're doing any ice water we're going to
dunk<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.410> ice<00:04:50.410> water<00:04:50.970> stir<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.000> around

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
dunk it in the ice water stir it around

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.270 
dunk it in the ice water stir it around
so<00:04:52.660> if<00:04:52.720> that<00:04:52.840> cold<00:04:53.110> water<00:04:53.290> gets<00:04:53.620> in<00:04:53.770> all<00:04:53.950> mixed

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
so if that cold water gets in all mixed

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.510 
so if that cold water gets in all mixed
in<00:04:54.400> through<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.730> curd<00:04:54.940> there<00:04:56.220> gather<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:57.460> up

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
in through the curd there gather it up

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.960 
in through the curd there gather it up
again<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.380> then<00:04:59.380> squeeze<00:04:59.919> it<00:04:59.950> out<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.550> again

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
again and then squeeze it out and again

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.610 
again and then squeeze it out and again
two<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.360> three<00:05:01.570> minutes<00:05:01.900> about<00:05:02.080> half<00:05:02.350> a<00:05:02.440> dozen

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
two to three minutes about half a dozen

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.270 
two to three minutes about half a dozen
times<00:05:02.950> of<00:05:03.190> doing<00:05:03.310> this<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:04.950> then<00:05:05.950> we'll<00:05:06.160> do

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
times of doing this and then we'll do

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.590 
times of doing this and then we'll do
our<00:05:06.310> next<00:05:06.669> step<00:05:08.340> what<00:05:09.340> I've<00:05:09.430> done<00:05:09.580> here<00:05:09.910> is<00:05:10.150> I

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
our next step what I've done here is I

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.470 
our next step what I've done here is I
after<00:05:11.169> I<00:05:11.200> did<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.160> curd<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.640> ice<00:05:12.760> water<00:05:13.120> I

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
after I did the curd in the ice water I

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.960 
after I did the curd in the ice water I
just<00:05:13.780> took<00:05:14.200> that<00:05:14.260> bag<00:05:14.620> up<00:05:14.890> and<00:05:15.160> squeezed<00:05:15.669> and

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
just took that bag up and squeezed and

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.880 
just took that bag up and squeezed and
squeezed<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.270> squeezed<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:16.900> as<00:05:17.110> tightly<00:05:17.590> as<00:05:17.800> I

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
squeezed and squeezed it as tightly as I

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.190 
squeezed and squeezed it as tightly as I
could<00:05:18.100> until<00:05:18.340> no<00:05:18.730> more<00:05:18.940> liquid<00:05:19.600> drained<00:05:20.020> out

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
could until no more liquid drained out

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.960 
could until no more liquid drained out
so<00:05:20.440> this<00:05:20.590> is<00:05:20.650> what's<00:05:20.980> left<00:05:21.070> this<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.580> my<00:05:21.730> curd

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
so this is what's left this is my curd

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.490 
so this is what's left this is my curd
and<00:05:22.480> I'm<00:05:22.540> just<00:05:22.660> going<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:22.840> roll<00:05:23.200> that<00:05:23.440> right

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
and I'm just going to roll that right

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.580 
and I'm just going to roll that right
out<00:05:23.830> of<00:05:23.980> the<00:05:24.160> cheesecloth<00:05:24.550> like<00:05:24.940> that<00:05:25.590> into

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
out of the cheesecloth like that into

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.550 
out of the cheesecloth like that into
this<00:05:26.710> bowl<00:05:26.980> and<00:05:28.200> we're<00:05:29.200> going<00:05:29.320> to<00:05:29.350> add<00:05:29.530> a

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
this bowl and we're going to add a

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.400 
this bowl and we're going to add a
little<00:05:29.770> bit<00:05:29.860> of<00:05:30.040> salt<00:05:31.020> most<00:05:32.020> people<00:05:32.290> don't

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
little bit of salt most people don't

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.140 
little bit of salt most people don't
realize<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:33.040> but<00:05:33.130> all<00:05:33.310> of<00:05:33.520> these<00:05:33.669> products

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
realize it but all of these products

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.770 
realize it but all of these products
that<00:05:34.180> you<00:05:34.330> buy<00:05:34.360> commercially<00:05:35.110> all<00:05:35.290> have

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
that you buy commercially all have

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.200 
that you buy commercially all have
of<00:05:35.840> salt<00:05:36.680> in<00:05:36.860> them<00:05:37.010> so<00:05:37.160> I<00:05:37.220> put<00:05:37.430> in<00:05:37.520> a<00:05:37.610> teaspoon

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
of salt in them so I put in a teaspoon

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.879 
of salt in them so I put in a teaspoon
of<00:05:38.300> sea<00:05:38.540> salt<00:05:38.570> and<00:05:40.150> going<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.210> mix<00:05:41.330> that<00:05:41.570> around

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
of sea salt and going to mix that around

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.390 
of sea salt and going to mix that around
if<00:05:42.889> you<00:05:43.240> are<00:05:44.240> concerned<00:05:44.600> about<00:05:44.780> salt<00:05:45.400> you

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
if you are concerned about salt you

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.659 
if you are concerned about salt you
certainly<00:05:46.910> don't<00:05:47.030> have<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.300> add<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:48.669> but

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
certainly don't have to add that but

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.670 
certainly don't have to add that but
before<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:50.270> make<00:05:50.900> a<00:05:50.960> decision<00:05:51.470> I<00:05:51.560> would

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680
