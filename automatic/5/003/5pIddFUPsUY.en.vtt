00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.910
 how to make french manicure beats 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.740
 white lacquer preferably with a thin brush 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.539
 stained free nail plate 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.580
 further taken in several layers 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.400
 applied lacquer for french manicure 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.579
 it uses stencils 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.950
 if there is no confidence in the hands clearly 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.050
 cause the line to the same 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.230
 several layers of lacquer dried too 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.270
 time passes and of course you can go to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
 Salon do this can do sit 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.280
 card minutes yourself 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.370
 But when there are such cases when 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.289
 very quickly how to do a manicure there 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.430
 special whitening pencil for 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.550
 french manicure 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.579
 it is a kind of magic wand and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.210
 plus of this pencil is that 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.239
 French manicure 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.729
 you make literally one minute without 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.130
 I put special efforts and skills on 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.900
 nails protective under lacquer and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.549
 two in one glossy finish 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.619
 two layers and more to aesthetically and 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.979
 looked more beautiful skin around the nail 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.430
 it's like now such a couple of years when 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.600
 skin of hands looks drier i 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.990
 took advantage 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.549
 our cuticle care cream 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.140
 Now I take a pencil I want to draw 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.360
 note that the pencil cap has 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.549
 peculiar form of such a pointed 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.590
 it is not by chance before 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.570
 you can just use a pencil 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.070
 to remove 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.710
 maybe some sort of dust will flow thread 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.490
 chance that there will be something that is here 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.159
 for this is 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.430
 pencil cap should always be 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.220
 well sharpened before applying 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.880
 pencil under the nail 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.890
 wet it in water and directly 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 put on the nail plate behind 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.360
 good draw under the nail 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.620
 further back with the match because the effect is already 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.930
 immediately visible we wet well 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:29.110
 pencil and draw 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:31.290
 under the nails to so do it at all 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.290
 nails 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.640
 you appearance will have nails after 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.090
 use whitening pencil 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.780
 the only thing left on the skin 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.950
 excess pencil but remove it all 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.680
 either wet disc or just two 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.220
 times wash your hands or skin 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.500
 the remains are removed while doing the pencil under 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.310
 nails given as white so 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.319
 pencil is also suitable for medium nails 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.430
 lengths and for long nails for more 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.099
 short nails 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.079
 the main advantage as I said 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.109
 what pencil french manicure 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.540
 done quickly but there are so small 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.510
 don't say something negative 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.150
 I'll tell you a little nuance French 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.840
 manicure created with whitening 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.950
 a pencil 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.379
 this he has no longevity on 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.819
 sheets of plain words, we can go on 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.430
 5 days 7 days 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.139
 Well, of course the pencil is literally 2 days 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.109
 but if you use a pencil 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:55.590
 constantly you of course whiten the nail 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:58.019
 plate and the result will seem 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.730
 longer so i recommend 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.989
 surprise everyone in such a pencil 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.980
 observe the rule to use 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.549
 pencil and of course in addition to 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.480
 pencil, take yourself any more varnish 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.579
 it is for french manicure either 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.060
 protective under lacquer and glossy 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.940
 covered 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.060
 two in one is not just a nail 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.310
 the plate on top remained let's say 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.480
 without attention to have looked Monica 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.480
 really complete
