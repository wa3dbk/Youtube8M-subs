aurora<00:00:31.250> now<00:00:32.250> normally<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> cannot<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.210> this

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
aurora now normally you cannot do this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.620 
aurora now normally you cannot do this
but<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.530> its<00:00:35.430> otherwise<00:00:35.730> technically

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
but as its otherwise technically

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.930 
but as its otherwise technically
impossible<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.500> I've<00:00:38.399> used<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.910> few

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
impossible to get here I've used a few

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.470 
impossible to get here I've used a few
but<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.809> few<00:00:40.230> console<00:00:40.739> commands<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.239> cheat

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
but a few console commands to to cheat

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.799 
but a few console commands to to cheat
essentially<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> reason<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.629> show

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
essentially and the reason is to show

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.330 
essentially and the reason is to show
you<00:00:45.870> guys<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.090> known<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.660> ruin

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
you guys this this is known as the ruin

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.060 
you guys this this is known as the ruin
now<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.489> remember<00:00:50.789> from<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.320> intro<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
now if you remember from the intro to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.819 
now if you remember from the intro to
subnautica<00:00:53.870> aurora<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.410> entering<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
subnautica aurora was just entering the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.970 
subnautica aurora was just entering the
atmosphere<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.699> something<00:00:57.120> shot<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.780> down

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
atmosphere when something shot it down

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
atmosphere when something shot it down
and<00:00:58.980> interestingly<00:01:00.620> we<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.890> these<00:01:02.690> ruins

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and interestingly we have these ruins

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.979 
and interestingly we have these ruins
here

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
here

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.120 
here
now<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:07.720> said<00:01:07.990> what<00:01:08.440> this<00:01:08.590> means<00:01:08.890> in<00:01:09.100> terms

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
now really said what this means in terms

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.550 
now really said what this means in terms
of<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.520> game<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:12.450> looks<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.540> me<00:01:13.720> like<00:01:13.750> we

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
of the game but looks to me like we

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.040 
of the game but looks to me like we
might<00:01:14.770> not<00:01:14.950> be<00:01:15.130> alone<00:01:15.460> on<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:15.790> planet<00:01:16.050> these

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
might not be alone on this planet these

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.330 
might not be alone on this planet these
are<00:01:17.470> some<00:01:18.040> interesting<00:01:19.110> structures<00:01:20.340> they

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
are some interesting structures they

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.399 
are some interesting structures they
could<00:01:21.610> be<00:01:21.759> perfectly<00:01:22.150> natural<00:01:22.300> they<00:01:23.200> could

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
could be perfectly natural they could

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.060 
could be perfectly natural they could
not<00:01:23.590> be<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.330> something<00:01:25.680> shot<00:01:26.680> down<00:01:26.890> the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
not be but something shot down the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.109 
not be but something shot down the
Aurora<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:30.100> as<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.490> can't<00:01:30.670> only<00:01:30.820> get<00:01:31.030> here

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
Aurora so as you can't only get here

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.149 
Aurora so as you can't only get here
this<00:01:31.300> deep<00:01:31.630> within<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.170> radiation<00:01:32.710> belt<00:01:32.920> of

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
this deep within the radiation belt of

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.270 
this deep within the radiation belt of
the<00:01:33.970> Aurora<00:01:34.210> itself<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:35.020> had<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.800> use<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:35.950> console

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
the Aurora itself I had to use a console

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.609 
the Aurora itself I had to use a console
command<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.729> ignore<00:01:36.970> radiation<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.690> also

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
command to ignore radiation and also

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.029 
command to ignore radiation and also
give<00:01:38.740> myself<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:39.130> boost<00:01:39.490> for<00:01:39.729> no<00:01:39.910> damage<00:01:41.039> but

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
give myself a boost for no damage but

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.310 
give myself a boost for no damage but
yeah<00:01:42.220> I<00:01:42.460> thought<00:01:42.759> that's<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.080> nice

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
yeah I thought that's a this is a nice

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.680 
yeah I thought that's a this is a nice
thing<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.710> ever<00:01:44.800> look<00:01:44.979> at<00:01:45.070> as<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> last<00:01:45.539> kind<00:01:46.539> of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
much subnautica I can show you at the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.270 
much subnautica I can show you at the
moment<00:02:43.209> it's<00:02:43.360> still<00:02:44.200> an<00:02:44.440> alford<00:02:44.860> still<00:02:45.160> in

moment it's still an alford still in

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.759 
moment it's still an alford still in
development<00:02:45.400> they're<00:02:46.299> still<00:02:46.660> adding<00:02:47.320> content

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
development they're still adding content

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.039 
development they're still adding content
and<00:02:48.609> I'm<00:02:48.760> sure<00:02:48.970> there<00:02:49.209> are<00:02:49.239> things<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.870> have

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
and I'm sure there are things I have

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.130 
and I'm sure there are things I have
missed<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.620> game

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
missed in this game

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.180 
missed in this game
there<00:02:52.069> are<00:02:52.250> places<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.790> haven't<00:02:53.090> been

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
technologies I've not built but I think

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.460 
technologies I've not built but I think
right<00:02:59.030> now<00:02:59.060> this<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.750> good<00:02:59.930> place<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.140> call

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
right now this is a good place to call

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.309 
right now this is a good place to call

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
to subnautica and we've not seen

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.180 
to subnautica and we've not seen
anything<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.820> has<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:28.850> final<00:03:29.239> treat<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.950> as<00:03:31.160> a

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.659 
know where which is actually slightly
more<00:05:49.260> terrifying<00:05:49.710> than<00:05:49.800> I'd<00:05:50.010> intended<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.639> to

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
more terrifying than I'd intended it to

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.070 
more terrifying than I'd intended it to
be

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.170 

it's<00:05:54.680> not<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:55.129> biggest<00:05:55.370> monster<00:05:55.639> they've<00:05:56.030> got

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180

to include in the game it's not even the

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.779 
to include in the game it's not even the
second-biggest<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.599> believe<00:06:00.280> but<00:06:01.280> it<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.460> quite

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
second-biggest I believe but it is quite

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.570 
second-biggest I believe but it is quite
terrifying<00:06:02.330> and<00:06:02.599> it<00:06:02.690> does<00:06:03.009> really<00:06:04.009> like<00:06:04.280> to

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.029 
attack I fortunately didn't get a very
good<00:06:07.250> look<00:06:07.610> at<00:06:07.729> it

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039
