00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
party well in the first place Apple

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.959 
party well in the first place Apple
chose<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.860> ahead<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.309> Bluetooth<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
chose to go ahead with Bluetooth for it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.760 
chose to go ahead with Bluetooth for it
though<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> similar<00:00:55.140> functionality

Apple<00:01:11.189> has<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> lot<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:11.939> options<00:01:12.390> like

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
Apple has a lot more options like

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
Apple has a lot more options like
locating<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> exit<00:01:13.770> position<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> iOS

if<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.130> want<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> learn<00:01:17.549> more<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.360> put<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
if you want to learn more I will put a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.960 
if you want to learn more I will put a
link<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.110> below<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.830> button<00:01:20.189> so

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
link right below the like button so

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.340 
link right below the like button so
again<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.780> was<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.020> late<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
again what is that was so late to the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
again what is that was so late to the
party<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:23.009> guess<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.509> market

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
party I guess it's because the market

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410 
party I guess it's because the market
wasn't<00:01:25.320> ready<00:01:25.770> yet<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.280> lot<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> bank<00:01:27.000> stores

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
wasn't ready yet a lot of bank stores

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
wasn't ready yet a lot of bank stores
and<00:01:27.689> restaurants<00:01:27.840> were<00:01:28.350> only<00:01:28.590> experimenting

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and restaurants were only experimenting

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.490 
and restaurants were only experimenting
with<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> technology<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.290> now

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
with the technology but people are now

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.170 
with the technology but people are now
getting<00:01:31.710> used<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> idea<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.850> connecting

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
getting used to the idea of connecting

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630 
getting used to the idea of connecting
their<00:01:33.540> iPhone<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.140> other<00:01:34.290> devices<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.430> use

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
their iPhone to other devices or the use

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.270 
their iPhone to other devices or the use
of<00:01:35.670> NFC<00:01:36.229> lots<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.350> big<00:01:37.560> companies<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
of NFC lots of big companies have to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.710 
of NFC lots of big companies have to
adapt<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.759> I've<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.509> useful

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
adapt and I've see for it to be useful

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.810 
adapt and I've see for it to be useful
but<00:01:40.409> big<00:01:40.650> companies<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.100> Best<00:01:41.490> Buy<00:01:41.640> or

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but big companies like Best Buy or

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.569 
but big companies like Best Buy or
7-eleven<00:01:42.479> stop<00:01:43.290> supporting<00:01:43.619> NFC<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
7-eleven stop supporting NFC because it

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.580 
7-eleven stop supporting NFC because it
was<00:01:44.759> too<00:01:44.939> expensive<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.630> customers<00:01:46.290> didn't

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
was too expensive and customers didn't
