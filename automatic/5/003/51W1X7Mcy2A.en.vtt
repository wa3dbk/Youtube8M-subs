he is being offered he doesn't like the
money<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.840> i<00:00:54.870> guess<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.350> WBO<00:00:56.070> i<00:00:57.109> had<00:00:58.109> no<00:00:58.260> choice

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
money so i guess the WBO i had no choice

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000 
money so i guess the WBO i had no choice
but<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.859> set<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> purse<00:00:59.579> bid<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:01.010> they're
