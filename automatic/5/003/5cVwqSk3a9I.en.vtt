00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 a libya pleasure I like what we are going to 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.140
 do now 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.130
 the difference between a restorer of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.130
 dried and a gladiator 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.820
 the treaty is purely concentrated 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.770
 only slows the drying to be well 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.920
 sure you can mix it with 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.109
 the acrylics and the glaze too but 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.970
 it is an emulsion plus a restorer 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.310
 then I use it with just a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.199
 little more water and I make my frostings 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 my glazed paintings to be able to do 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.189
 fake imitations finishes and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.050
 I usually use it to the restorer 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.180
 mixing it with some acrylic then 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.940
 in small quantity and great coach as 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 patina to water that nice because 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.129
 times when one wants to skate action 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.660
 quickly quickly falls out of the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.550
 retarders to recorders and the other one is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.200
 the glaze the paintings look 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 hunter also in little amount by 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 example to do moving promotions for 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.219
 make a free one also use it and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.590
 it has a beard and it is very good mix 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.750
 all water is not water always 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.760
 we mix with lectern with acrylics 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 decorative acrylics and good in this 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.960
 case or dark color 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.330
 very well then we go to the difference 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.979
 between the gladiator and retarded Mexicans 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.229
 attention the glaze I use it to make 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.180
 all my fake gladiator finishes like 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.220
 they see him milky carlos more liquid is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.680
 an emulsion and has repairing drying 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.590
 with which I mix it with the acrylics 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.210
 and in this case it's a paint gray 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.190
 finally I put 50 percent for 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.350
 make a more transparent painting the 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.380
 which adds a little water yes 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.729
 perfect and I leave this consistency of 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.409
 drinkable yogurt I already gave it a finish in 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.290
 yellow so that it now stands out 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.840
 just what is in the marble of the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.850
 center that is a yellow antico 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.530
 remember that I always put applied a 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.500
 little bit of water on the surface 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.259
 before applying the already glazed paint 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.320
 that in this case we have said is with 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.500
 gray glaze and a little water and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.390
 applied in every way this is going to 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.399
 logically give a depth in this 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.019
 case what we are inviting that is a 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.899
 manual look at the intensity that it has 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.050
 but with the glaze transparency and 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.920
 this very useful element the marine sponge 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.819
 already moistened right away I can recover 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.220
 what is down for just the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.250
 mix that I made of criticism or flu 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.820
 paint with the glaze 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.580
 let's move on to the other just 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.310
 it's just a drying challenger is a lot 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.070
 more concentrated therefore we can not 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.430
 add too much to what is more 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:46.270
 viscous and what I do is use it as 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.030
 if it were a patina the base is already given 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.600
 in shellac and gold glitter in this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.040
 case in the case of the wood is silver 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.819
 I apply on the surface and what I do 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.249
 is to withdraw 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.319
 with a rag in this case the delay of 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:06.889
 Repeated drying must be put in a few 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.360
 quantities and in this I'm going to use it as 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:12.320
 patina 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.600
 and he recovered quickly with a washcloth 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.720
 golden and looks like a patina 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.980
 just patinated is not so intense 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.860
 I say what little amount because 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.690
 just in the paintings they paint 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.600
 put at the base the surface of the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.590
 terrifying and then apply the color to 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.110
 make grade to make funds moved 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.440
 and they can not use too much for 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.959
 just not destroy or change the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.440
 acrylic features that are 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.440
 using 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.020
 I follow this edge here because it puts a 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.290
 little bit more acrylic was already 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:54.590
 being too light and I go back 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.049
 to mop if this dries is that 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.750
 I doubt that's why it's called drying retardation 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.680
 we can connect 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.599
 the rag 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.599
 and withdraw even more 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.799
 5 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.260
 and here is the result you have a background 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.900
 which is more serious is gold be it glitter 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.630
 gilded with rubber what is in this case 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.139
 It is silver and the difference as city 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.490
 totally gives a touch so it goes down a 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.340
 little to the golden one who does not like it that much 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.530
 golden but it is very nice thank you 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.650
 that is, I loved it on youtube, it's all 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.050
 step by step the tips with the idea 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.910
 full we appreciate the fight gonzÃ¡lez 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.760
 varela that taught us how to do this 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.590
 project with the eternal materials a 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.990
