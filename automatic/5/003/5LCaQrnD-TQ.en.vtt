00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.790
 Looks nice, cool map switch-off 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.590

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:32.480
 this light machine gun does not have a 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.310
 I worry a lot about this drug 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.070
 But it's good, we're the first one there. 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.870
