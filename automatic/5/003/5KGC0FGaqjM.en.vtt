00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.930
 good morning guys and girls welcome 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.849
 to a new blog video today I want 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.799
 tell you what I bought in the 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.619
 White rebates you already know that they tend 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.299
 start a little bit before the others and 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.910
 well I always leave the first 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.779
 day so that they do not take away the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.759
 things that I like picked up two bikinis 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.060
 to wear without strapless that are the 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.930
 that more then more I use this with stamping 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.330
 of flowers 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.000
 and this one with a palm print and a 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.490
 fuchsia tie that I love since I'm 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.710
 watching on the beach giving it around the world 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.810
 I get dark then I also take some 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.060
 finger shelf and well sandals 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.940
 ataditas that are the ones that came later 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.190
 with some cute little stones and then 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.210
 some a little more different with a 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.150
 bit 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.980
 these tacks or a few things and 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.410
 browns that is a color that summer 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.840
 It is very flattering when we put on 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.640
 brownies is much better what they have 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.050
 picked up these oxford shoes that to 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.660
 the best in summer I will not use them 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.770
 so much but more so every 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.190
 September-October that has an area 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.530
 golden in the metallic zone that are 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.560
 very cool yes I love what I wanted 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.350
 have bought me in the coral belt 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.670
 but I found one that I liked and 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.220
 that will adapt to what I wanted 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.350
 because I found one that weighed a lot 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.720
 and good for me it was not nothing 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.490
 comfortable so I fucked this red when 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.410
 I the house I found the surprise of 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.270
 that he had a pink song but hey 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.409
 they are things that happen and I think that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.210
 three euros 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.610
 for me I can stay 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.380
 I also took this belt which is a 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.930
 little more different I think that also 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.150
 a little more for for the winter to 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.600
 wear them in a black dress or with a 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.510
 blouse 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.530
 I think it will be pretty cool 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.420
 also how is 50% worth it 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.460
 being in the store friend of with my 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.320
 friend patrick told me I bought 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.299
 some jeans because they are what they 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.520
 it is the garment that most alive and the group 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.409
 has a race even though I have 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.750
 several shorts, well, I decided to buy 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.490
 our things in little broken media that 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.860
 if my grandmother sees them will say I 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.400
 have cheated the cool men that I 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.069
 I do not know how to premiere with this shirt 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.500
 navy style that curiously I did not have 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.560
 none of suspenders and the truth is that 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.030
 It is very comfortable and very flattering too 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.490
 I bought this shirt a little more 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.500
 to dress with this pattern in front 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.160
 and behind black also the color 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.580
 black 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.370
 I find it very flattering the truth is 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.890
 I'm wearing it a lot and then alessio 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.440
 pretty with this colored skirt is like this 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.810
 more fluorine and more striking and what 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.940
 rewrite as well as handkerchief type 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.150
 I was hesitating between taking this help 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:55.120
 It is in a handkerchief type payment but I do not 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.700
 convince I like it and I did not just see 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.980
 so I did not decide on this one with this 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.670
 blouse I thought it was a blouse 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.380
 well with fabric more I do not know more different to 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.170
 what I then found myself so 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.090
 is the time it changes I do not like it and it 's that 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.900
 I do not like it but it's not what I wanted 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.300
 plus 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.530
 so an excuse to go back to the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.410
 store 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.450
 and good as far as dresses and for 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.850
 finish this dress that is different to 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.410
 everything I have like that with an envelope 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.540
 manga and a bit wider to 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.810
 take them with a belt at times that I 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.790
 it seemed quite original and then the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.849
 dress that I like that is this 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.540
 of stripes I have one similar but good 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.569
 does not have this neckline or this in 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.030
 this part of the back with the zipper 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.340
 so very tight and very cool I hope 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.390
 that you liked it and well I already 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.340
 you will tell that you have bought 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.349
 I do not rule out that when 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.540
 again change the blouse I take something 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.579
 more I will tell you and good happy week 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.590
 and to enjoy the holidays those that 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.590
 you have a little kiss and I see you
