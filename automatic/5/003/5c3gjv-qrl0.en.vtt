which was one of the most popular
projects<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> entire<00:00:40.350> year<00:00:40.860> thank<00:00:41.160> you

so much Carmen I love your ideas I did
something<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.190> week<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.579> rarely<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.510> made<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
something this week I rarely do I made a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
something this week I rarely do I made a
bunch<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.230> prototypes<00:00:47.129> these<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:47.940> my<00:00:48.030> earlier

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
bunch of prototypes these are my earlier

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.139 
bunch of prototypes these are my earlier
attempts<00:00:49.050> leading<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.280> final<00:00:50.730> version

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
attempts leading up to the final version

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.939 
attempts leading up to the final version
that<00:00:51.180> works<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:51.899> well<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that works out really well so if you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.500 
that works out really well so if you
download<00:00:53.070> my<00:00:53.460> free<00:00:53.640> plans<00:00:54.000> they'll<00:00:54.329> look

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
download my free plans they'll look

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
download my free plans they'll look
something<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> make<00:00:56.129> your

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
something like this and if you make your

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.369 
something like this and if you make your
cuts<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.789> accurately<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.629> possible<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
cuts as accurately as possible you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.779 
cuts as accurately as possible you
should<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.649> pretty<00:00:58.859> good<00:00:59.039> results<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
should have pretty good results but the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.430 
should have pretty good results but the
best<00:00:59.940> part<00:01:00.180> about<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.510> project<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
best part about this project is that it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770 
best part about this project is that it
takes<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> tiniest<00:01:02.789> bit<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> scrap

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
takes just the tiniest bit of scrap

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.990 
takes just the tiniest bit of scrap
lumber<00:01:03.989> start<00:01:04.890> by<00:01:05.040> roughly<00:01:05.400> cutting<00:01:05.820> out

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000

piece a little bit thinner and I want to
try<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.659> taper<00:02:34.139> this<00:02:34.650> top<00:02:35.010> section<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.819> a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.170 

I<00:02:50.410> found<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.370> best<00:02:51.520> way<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.700> put<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.000> all

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
I found it the best way to put this all

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.420 
I found it the best way to put this all
together<00:02:52.300> is<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.930> glue<00:02:53.170> up<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.530> shelf<00:02:53.890> first

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
together is to glue up the shelf first

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.970 
together is to glue up the shelf first
let<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.060> dry<00:02:55.450> before<00:02:55.960> putting<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.650> top

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
let that dry before putting on this top

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.280 
let that dry before putting on this top
piece<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.610> other<00:02:57.790> thing<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.180> found<00:02:58.210> it<00:02:58.720> helpful

piece the other thing I found it helpful
is<00:02:59.470> when<00:02:59.920> lining<00:03:00.460> this<00:03:00.640> up<00:03:01.260> line<00:03:02.260> up<00:03:02.290> this

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
is when lining this up line up this

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.270 
is when lining this up line up this

bottom piece to this bottom piece then

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.220 
bottom piece to this bottom piece then
you<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:06.520> plenty<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.880> room<00:03:07.210> to<00:03:07.240> cut<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.930> top

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
you have plenty of room to cut the top

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.500 
you have plenty of room to cut the top
down<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.040> position<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.760> piece<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.390> is

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.460 

and<00:03:25.910> I'll<00:03:26.060> give<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.330> about<00:03:26.540> an<00:03:26.660> hour<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.170> dry

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
and I'll give that about an hour to dry

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.750 
and I'll give that about an hour to dry
well<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.780> now<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:32.960> can<00:03:33.140> glue<00:03:33.290> this<00:03:33.590> piece<00:03:33.950> in<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
well so now I can glue this piece in and

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.790 
well so now I can glue this piece in and
if<00:03:35.240> it's<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.540> little<00:03:35.660> bit<00:03:35.840> too<00:03:36.080> tight<00:03:36.380> from<00:03:36.650> the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
if it's a little bit too tight from the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.470 
if it's a little bit too tight from the
way<00:03:36.890> you've<00:03:37.070> clamped<00:03:37.520> this<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:38.090> shave<00:03:38.450> a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
way you've clamped this just shave a

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.960 
way you've clamped this just shave a
little<00:03:38.720> bit<00:03:38.990> off<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.500> here<00:03:39.950> by<00:03:40.100> sanding<00:03:40.760> it

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
little bit off of here by sanding it

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.600 
little bit off of here by sanding it
this<00:03:41.450> time<00:03:41.720> this<00:03:41.930> one<00:03:42.140> seems<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.560> fit<00:03:43.010> just

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
this time this one seems to fit just

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.630 
this time this one seems to fit just
snug<00:03:44.120> enough<00:03:44.440> one<00:03:45.440> thing<00:03:45.680> also<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.280> wanted<00:03:46.580> to

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
snug enough one thing also I wanted to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.570 
snug enough one thing also I wanted to
point<00:03:46.730> out<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.330> that<00:03:47.360> when<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:47.840> cut<00:03:48.380> this<00:03:49.100> piece

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
point out is that when I cut this piece

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.280 
point out is that when I cut this piece
here<00:03:50.300> I<00:03:50.480> cut<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.560> at<00:03:51.710> this<00:03:52.130> angle<00:03:53.050> what<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.080> want

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
here I cut it at this angle what I want

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.930 
here I cut it at this angle what I want
to<00:03:54.350> do<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:55.070> found<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.400> works<00:03:55.520> out<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.790> lot

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
to do is I found it works out a lot

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.180 
to do is I found it works out a lot
better<00:03:56.240> if<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.570> flip<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:56.990> around<00:03:57.080> where<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.860> goes

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
better if I flip it around where it goes

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.700 
better if I flip it around where it goes
this<00:03:58.820> way<00:03:59.260> in<00:04:00.400> like<00:04:01.400> that<00:04:02.050> then<00:04:03.050> what<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.560> need

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
this way in like that then what you need

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.250 
this way in like that then what you need
to<00:04:03.830> do<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.640> play<00:04:05.060> around<00:04:05.240> with<00:04:05.630> the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
to do is just play around with the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.640 
to do is just play around with the
opening<00:04:06.890> on<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.310> side<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.870> opening<00:04:09.290> on<00:04:09.410> this

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
side and the distance between these two

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.490 
side and the distance between these two
you<00:04:15.230> want<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.920> piece<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.610> line<00:04:17.090> up<00:04:17.450> with<00:04:17.810> this

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
you want this piece to line up with this

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.300 
you want this piece to line up with this
piece<00:04:18.920> as<00:04:19.160> it<00:04:19.400> comes<00:04:19.670> around<00:04:19.880> top<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.860> found

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
piece as it comes around top and I found

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.090 
piece as it comes around top and I found
that<00:04:22.760> if<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.330> have<00:04:23.480> a<00:04:23.510> large<00:04:23.990> opening<00:04:24.590> on<00:04:24.770> this

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
that if you have a large opening on this

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.910 
that if you have a large opening on this
side<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:26.180> smaller<00:04:26.720> opening<00:04:27.290> on<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.620> side

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
side and a smaller opening on this side

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.400 
side and a smaller opening on this side
sometimes<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.850> helps<00:04:29.180> as<00:04:29.630> long<00:04:30.140> as<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:30.320> have

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
sometimes that helps as long as you have

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.550 
sometimes that helps as long as you have
a<00:04:30.440> fairly<00:04:30.920> snug<00:04:31.030> fit<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.540> piece<00:04:32.990> you

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
a fairly snug fit to this piece you

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.410 
a fairly snug fit to this piece you
could<00:04:33.740> just<00:04:33.890> kind<00:04:34.070> of<00:04:34.250> play<00:04:34.550> around<00:04:34.850> with<00:04:35.150> it

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
could just kind of play around with it

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.980 
could just kind of play around with it
and<00:04:35.630> get<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.170> to<00:04:36.200> fit<00:04:36.590> before<00:04:37.220> gluing<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.700> in

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
and get it to fit before gluing it in

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.840 
and get it to fit before gluing it in
regular<00:04:38.990> wood<00:04:39.560> glue<00:04:39.770> give<00:04:40.010> me<00:04:40.160> plenty<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.580> time

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
regular wood glue give me plenty of time

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:51.200 
regular wood glue give me plenty of time
to<00:04:40.990> position<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.320> before<00:04:42.920> it<00:04:43.040> dries

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.720 

I'll<00:04:51.660> just<00:04:51.900> keep<00:04:52.080> positioning<00:04:52.770> this<00:04:52.920> until<00:04:53.550> it

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
I'll just keep positioning this until it

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.190 
I'll just keep positioning this until it
sounds<00:04:54.060> good

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.570 

sometimes<00:04:58.200> you<00:04:58.320> get<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.590> sound<00:04:58.890> but<00:04:59.490> you

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
sometimes you get the sound but you
