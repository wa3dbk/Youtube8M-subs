00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
operating the swell pedals which you see

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.470 
operating the swell pedals which you see
here<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.830> give<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.069> an<00:02:35.160> example<00:02:35.550> if<00:02:36.209> I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
here I just give you an example if I

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.020 
here I just give you an example if I
engage<00:02:36.810> some<00:02:37.560> stops<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.730> play<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.330> chord

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.150 

that's<00:02:43.030> what<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.450> shutters<00:02:43.959> open<00:02:44.260> if<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.800> shut

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that's what the shutters open if I shut

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.690 
that's what the shutters open if I shut
them<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:46.030> effect<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.780> quite<00:02:46.930> different

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
them the effect is quite different

00:02:47.700 --> 00:03:00.120 
them the effect is quite different

music on the organ is by voice leading

music on the organ is by voice leading
the<00:03:22.270> connecting<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.260> one<00:03:23.560> note<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.760> other

the connecting of one note to the other

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.500 
the connecting of one note to the other
yes<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.950> very<00:03:27.100> possible<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:28.150> sit<00:03:28.360> here

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
yes so it's very possible to sit here

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.680 
yes so it's very possible to sit here
and<00:03:28.630> play<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.960> organ<00:03:29.170> all<00:03:29.940> detached<00:03:30.940> which<00:03:31.510> I

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
and play the organ all detached which I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.180 
and play the organ all detached which I
think<00:03:31.930> would<00:03:32.050> be<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.200> great<00:03:32.380> mistake<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:33.100> you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
think would be a great mistake if you

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:43.520 
think would be a great mistake if you
went<00:03:40.350> right<00:03:41.350> or<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:42.430> use<00:03:42.640> voice<00:03:42.970> leading

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
went right or you use voice leading

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.690 
went right or you use voice leading
hopefully<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> part<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.190> is<00:03:45.340> something

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
hopefully a part of that is something

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.090 
hopefully a part of that is something
that<00:03:46.270> we<00:03:46.420> know<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.810> called<00:03:47.080> tensionless<00:03:47.680> key

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
that we know is called tensionless key

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
just by voice leading the difference is

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.280 
just by voice leading the difference is
something<00:04:00.220> else<00:04:00.490> by<00:04:00.640> connecting<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.360> one<00:04:01.660> note

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290
