00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
hairstyle it's kind of like a bun but

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.810 
hairstyle it's kind of like a bun but
instead<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.500> just<00:00:26.800> a<00:00:26.890> normal<00:00:27.250> button<00:00:27.430> it'll<00:00:27.730> be

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
instead of just a normal button it'll be

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.940 
instead of just a normal button it'll be
in<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.030> shape<00:00:28.240> of<00:00:28.360> a<00:00:28.480> big<00:00:28.690> bow<00:00:28.930> and<00:00:29.260> I<00:00:29.590> think<00:00:29.860> it

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
in the shape of a big bow and I think it

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.240 
in the shape of a big bow and I think it
looks<00:00:30.130> really<00:00:30.310> cute<00:00:30.700> so<00:00:31.540> for<00:00:32.320> this<00:00:32.500> I<00:00:32.800> think<00:00:33.190> it

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
looks really cute so for this I think it

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.460 
looks really cute so for this I think it
works<00:00:33.430> best<00:00:33.670> if<00:00:33.820> you<00:00:33.940> have<00:00:34.090> straight<00:00:34.480> hair<00:00:34.510> so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
works best if you have straight hair so

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.440 
works best if you have straight hair so
if<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:35.710> have<00:00:35.830> naturally<00:00:36.370> curly<00:00:36.730> hair<00:00:36.760> you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
might want to straighten it before doing

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
might want to straighten it before doing
it<00:00:38.950> so<00:00:39.850> for<00:00:40.690> this<00:00:40.900> braid<00:00:41.350> you'll<00:00:41.620> need<00:00:41.830> flat

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.920 

you<00:01:25.520> want<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.760> make<00:01:25.880> sure<00:01:25.910> there's<00:01:26.240> no<00:01:26.450> bumps

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
there may be a few doing the ponytail so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.740 
there may be a few doing the ponytail so
you<00:01:30.890> might<00:01:31.100> want<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.400> use<00:01:31.640> water<00:01:31.940> if<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.540> want

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
you might want to use water if you want

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:42.149 
you might want to use water if you want
to<00:01:33.130> make<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.310> smooth

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.240 

so<00:01:42.700> once<00:01:42.880> we've<00:01:43.090> been<00:01:43.210> doing<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:44.020> turn<00:01:44.979> into

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
so once we've been doing that turn into

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.289 
so once we've been doing that turn into
a<00:01:45.280> ponytail<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.770> start<00:01:48.430> doing<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.939> normal

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
a ponytail so you start doing the normal

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.830 
a ponytail so you start doing the normal
way<00:01:50.970> when<00:01:51.970> you're<00:01:52.090> going<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.360> do<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.630> last

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
way when you're going to do the last

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.480 
way when you're going to do the last
loop<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:54.369> stop<00:01:54.729> half<00:01:55.119> way<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.250> this

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
loop you stop half way like this so this

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.940 
loop you stop half way like this so this
part<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:00.939> going<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.149> be<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.450> loops<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:02.560> you

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
part is going to be the loops so you

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.969 
part is going to be the loops so you
split<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.700> two<00:02:03.970> pieces<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.780> may<00:02:05.619> want<00:02:05.860> it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
split it in two pieces you may want it

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.950 
split it in two pieces you may want it
if<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.220> want<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.759> bigger<00:02:07.119> loop<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.780> can

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
if you want a bigger loop so you can

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.160 
if you want a bigger loop so you can
take<00:02:08.349> more<00:02:08.590> hair<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.099> if<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:10.630> want<00:02:10.840> smaller

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
take more hair but if you want smaller

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.140 
take more hair but if you want smaller
loops<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:12.160> can<00:02:12.190> make<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.700> smaller

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
loops you can make it smaller

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.539 
loops you can make it smaller
let's<00:02:13.540> take<00:02:13.720> less<00:02:13.989> hair<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.890> once<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.459> have

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
let's take less hair so once you have

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.699 
let's take less hair so once you have
your<00:02:15.670> two<00:02:15.849> pieces<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.140> take<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.500> hair<00:02:20.620> at

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
your two pieces so you take the hair at

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.960 
your two pieces so you take the hair at
the<00:02:20.769> back<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.010> comb<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:26.220> like<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.430> to

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
the back and you comb it like this to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.280 
the back and you comb it like this to
make<00:02:28.150> sure<00:02:28.299> there's<00:02:28.510> no<00:02:28.630> flyaways<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.170> may

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
make sure there's no flyaways you may

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.770 
make sure there's no flyaways you may
want<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.530> use<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.709> bit<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:29.980> water<00:02:30.280> or<00:02:33.780> hairspray

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
want to use a bit of water or hairspray

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.300 
want to use a bit of water or hairspray
it<00:02:34.900> depends<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.530> then<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.739> take<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.040> hair

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
it depends and then you take the hair

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:51.750 
it depends and then you take the hair
and<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:43.180> go<00:02:43.329> over<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:49.709> then<00:02:50.709> with<00:02:51.640> the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
and you go over this and then with the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.759 
and you go over this and then with the
hair<00:02:51.970> that's<00:02:52.180> here<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.959> split<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.350> into<00:02:53.440> two

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
hair that's here you split it into two

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.670 
hair that's here you split it into two
pieces<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:55.930> piece<00:02:56.200> will<00:02:56.380> go<00:02:56.530> around

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
pieces and this piece will go around

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.949 
pieces and this piece will go around
this<00:02:56.890> way<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:58.180> piece<00:02:58.480> will<00:02:58.660> go<00:02:58.780> around

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
this way and this piece will go around

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:08.819 
this way and this piece will go around
that<00:02:59.170> way<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.569> hair<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:08.350> put<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.709> out

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
that way with the hair you put it out
