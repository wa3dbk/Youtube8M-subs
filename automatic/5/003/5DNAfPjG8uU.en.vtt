00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.870
 here we did a three-time analysis 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.219
 weeks at regular protein levels 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 at 20 percent 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.590
 the cancer grows steadily if then 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.119
 let's pass the dose to 5 percent 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 the cancer stops going back to 20 for 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 one hundred 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.449
 then the cancer resumes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.660
 activate and deactivate the development of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.140
 cancer with nutrition 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.120
 in this case with proteins with le 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.520
 proteins we could raise lower it 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.200
 cancer development 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.200
 this opened up different scenarios 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.750
 here is another explanatory image 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:00.539
 when they administered the proteins in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 the less the cancer did not grow is 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.790
 how to put a seed in the ground not 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 grows until you add some 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.909
 fertilizer or water in this 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 case although the seed of the cancer was 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.560
 genetically present it did not grow 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560
 without proteins 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.090
 then after nine weeks when we thought 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.920
 that the cancer was eradicated we are 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.829
 moved back to 20 percent of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.829
 protein and cancer regrow
