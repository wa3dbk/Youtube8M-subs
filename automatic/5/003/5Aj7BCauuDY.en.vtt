hi<00:00:00.570> everyone<00:00:00.900> I'm<00:00:01.319> making<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.709> video

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hi everyone I'm making this video

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.579 
hi everyone I'm making this video
because<00:00:02.639> someone<00:00:03.090> on<00:00:03.360> an<00:00:03.750> tech<00:00:03.959> forums<00:00:04.440> was

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
because someone on an tech forums was

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.099 
because someone on an tech forums was
wondering<00:00:04.920> if<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.819> 600<00:00:06.359> megahertz<00:00:06.629> spinning

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
wondering if a 600 megahertz spinning

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.430 
wondering if a 600 megahertz spinning
three<00:00:07.410> would<00:00:07.620> be<00:00:07.649> enough<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:09.440> reasonably

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
three would be enough to reasonably

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.100 
three would be enough to reasonably

which<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.740> know<00:00:19.859> probably

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
which is going to be you know probably

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.490 
which is going to be you know probably
about<00:00:20.910> 30<00:00:21.180> percent<00:00:21.359> faster<00:00:21.630> than<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> 600

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500

a g-force 2 video card and we're gonna

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.700 
a g-force 2 video card and we're gonna
start<00:00:30.779> off<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.140> trying<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.590> watch<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.149> 240p

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
start off by trying to watch a 240p

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.709 
start off by trying to watch a 240p
YouTube<00:00:34.710> video<00:00:35.010> windowed<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
YouTube video windowed and this is that

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.340 
YouTube video windowed and this is that
a<00:00:36.980> screen<00:00:37.980> resolution<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.579> 720p<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:40.110> let's<00:00:40.260> see

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
a screen resolution is 720p so let's see

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.439 
a screen resolution is 720p so let's see
how<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.590> goes

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.290 

so<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> CPU<00:00:49.320> usage<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.280> around<00:00:50.579> 90%

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.560 

sometimes<00:00:54.300> spiking<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> about<00:00:56.359> close<00:00:57.359> to<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
sometimes spiking up to about close to a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.209 
sometimes spiking up to about close to a
hundred<00:00:58.019> but<00:00:58.229> it<00:00:58.530> doesn't<00:00:58.829> seem<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:58.979> we're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
hundred but it doesn't seem like we're

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.709 
hundred but it doesn't seem like we're
dropping<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.670> many<00:00:59.879> frames<00:01:02.390> now<00:01:03.390> let's<00:01:03.539> try

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
dropping that many frames now let's try

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.070 
dropping that many frames now let's try
going<00:01:03.870> fullscreen<00:01:05.750> yeah<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:06.930> we're

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
going fullscreen yeah now we're

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.779 
going fullscreen yeah now we're
definitely<00:01:07.409> dropping<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:07.890> frames<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.610> it's

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
definitely dropping some frames but it's

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:09.859 
definitely dropping some frames but it's
hard<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:08.970> tell<00:01:09.149> because<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.509> video<00:01:09.720> quality

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
hard to tell because the video quality

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.399 
hard to tell because the video quality
so<00:01:10.200> bad<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> first<00:01:10.740> place

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.649 

it<00:01:15.890> looks<00:01:16.070> like<00:01:16.219> I<00:01:16.369> should<00:01:16.399> usage<00:01:16.999> was<00:01:17.270> similar

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
it looks like I should usage was similar

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:30.809 
it looks like I should usage was similar
now<00:01:18.649> let's<00:01:18.799> try<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.340> video<00:01:19.939> in<00:01:20.359> 360p<00:01:25.810> windowed

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.539 

now<00:01:31.819> we're<00:01:32.649> spiking<00:01:33.649> at<00:01:33.770> 100%<00:01:34.399> CPU<00:01:34.549> usage

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
now we're spiking at 100% CPU usage

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.529 
now we're spiking at 100% CPU usage
doesn't<00:01:37.549> look<00:01:37.670> like<00:01:37.789> we're<00:01:37.909> dropping<00:01:38.090> too

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
doesn't look like we're dropping too

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.139 
doesn't look like we're dropping too
many<00:01:38.689> fans<00:01:38.929> but<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:39.229> got<00:01:39.380> dropping<00:01:39.740> frames<00:01:40.149> and

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
many fans but we got dropping frames and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.849 
many fans but we got dropping frames and
I<00:01:41.209> have<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.390> feeling<00:01:41.509> if<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:41.810> go<00:01:41.929> fullscreen

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:51.600 

now<00:01:45.859> we're<00:01:46.009> down<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.310> pretty<00:01:46.490> low<00:01:46.729> framerate

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.929 

and<00:01:54.069> CPU<00:01:55.069> should<00:01:55.099> just<00:01:55.459> still<00:01:55.610> haven't<00:01:55.879> heard

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
and CPU should just still haven't heard

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.160 
and CPU should just still haven't heard
something<00:01:58.479> let's<00:01:59.479> see<00:01:59.629> if<00:01:59.689> we<00:01:59.750> can<00:01:59.899> find<00:02:00.049> a

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
something let's see if we can find a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.580 
something let's see if we can find a
480p<00:02:03.170> video<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:08.019> know<00:02:09.019> I'm<00:02:09.200> picking<00:02:09.440> all<00:02:09.560> the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
480p video I know I'm picking all the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:18.680 
480p video I know I'm picking all the
YouTube<00:02:10.009> means<00:02:10.819> here

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.710 

of<00:02:19.080> course<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:19.410> have<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.620> watch<00:02:19.800> ahead<00:02:23.720> so

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
of course we have to watch ahead so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.360 
of course we have to watch ahead so
basically<00:02:25.110> cliffnotes<00:02:25.440> seems<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.100> be<00:02:26.220> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
basically cliffnotes seems to be that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.210 
basically cliffnotes seems to be that
you'll<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.180> able<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.390> watch<00:02:27.510> 240p<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.890> windowed

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
you'll be able to watch 240p in windowed

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.840 
you'll be able to watch 240p in windowed
mode<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:31.040> probably<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:32.280> much<00:02:32.490> more<00:02:32.670> than

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
mode and probably not much more than

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.460 
mode and probably not much more than
that<00:02:32.910> if<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.180> don't<00:02:33.390> enjoy<00:02:33.570> watching<00:02:33.960> lots<00:02:34.320> of

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
that if you don't enjoy watching lots of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.810 
that if you don't enjoy watching lots of
stuttering<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.070> about<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.430> three

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
stuttering and this is about like three

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.560 
stuttering and this is about like three
frames<00:02:39.120> per<00:02:39.300> second<00:02:39.600> sometimes<00:02:41.420> wow<00:02:42.420> this

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
frames per second sometimes wow this

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.100 
frames per second sometimes wow this
might<00:02:43.140> not<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.350> PG<00:02:43.710> anymore<00:02:47.510> alright<00:02:48.510> finally

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
might not be PG anymore alright finally

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.610 
might not be PG anymore alright finally
got<00:02:49.260> there<00:02:50.720> yeah<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:51.900> dropping<00:02:52.290> frames<00:02:52.440> like

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
got there yeah it's dropping frames like

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.540 
got there yeah it's dropping frames like
crazy<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.130> I'm<00:02:53.610> 360<00:02:54.360> P<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.370> gonna

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
crazy just I'm 360 P so I'm not gonna

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.690 
crazy just I'm 360 P so I'm not gonna
bother<00:02:56.760> going<00:02:57.060> up<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.360> 480p<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:58.580> think<00:02:59.580> those

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
bother going up to 480p I think those

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.490 
bother going up to 480p I think those
other<00:02:59.880> videos<00:03:00.240> even<00:03:00.420> though<00:03:00.540> they<00:03:00.720> were<00:03:00.780> 360p

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
other videos even though they were 360p

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.040 
other videos even though they were 360p
they<00:03:01.710> were<00:03:01.820> actually<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.880> lower<00:03:03.090> bitrate<00:03:04.340> so

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
they were actually a lower bitrate so

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.960
