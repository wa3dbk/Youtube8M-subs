00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300
 - but also 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.450

 a person who does not know jesús

 we do not know what a half city center is 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.120
 It is very effective 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.089
 I found it inspiring I thought 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.679
 nice 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.779
 for the memory in some moments 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.779
 I stayed for nine years in the group 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.579
 It was an enriching experience in many ways 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.969
 I did 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.019
 great and good friends 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.939
 i the experience of working 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.989
 to make the message known 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.369
 of salvation 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.539
 It was also very beautiful 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.279
 I wish long life to the aforementioned report 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.289
 the ministry they have taken 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.789
 God bless you so much you can do is keep doing great things 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:56.859
 although weak I think talent help others get closer to the throne 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.979
 I found this concert very funny because 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.739
 see the young people singing celeste 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.959
 with a thousand young people 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.009
 important 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.769
 he really does not get it 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.569
 the record is at the moment that I was also singing with the group 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.319
 now that they love each other and wished him to continue to be a talent to god that since 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.969
 the only thing that goes 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.539
 allow me to continue this ministry 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.169
 especially to find 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.489
 that policy how to do it by exposing 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.559
 the example 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.159
 in a statement 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.979
 in every word that she is delighted 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.079
 and above all to reach the hearts of other people 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.379
 or what is worse was the future museum but its virtue a pulse 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.179
 us as a sector 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:49.579
 to the question of if you need it
