00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
middle section and then this outer

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.649 
middle section and then this outer
section<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.159> we're<00:01:59.940> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.119> start<00:02:00.479> with

guys have sort of tenderness through to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.990 
guys have sort of tenderness through to
these<00:02:40.720> Achilles<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.470> already<00:02:42.070> said<00:02:42.280> Walters<00:02:42.730> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
these Achilles I already said Walters is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.180 
these Achilles I already said Walters is
beneficial<00:02:43.570> on<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.050> way<00:02:44.170> down<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.740> then<00:02:44.920> very

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
beneficial on the way down and then very

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.720 
beneficial on the way down and then very
quickly<00:02:45.400> will<00:02:45.940> shift<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.650> middle<00:02:47.950> so

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
quickly will shift this to the middle so

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.600 
quickly will shift this to the middle so
same<00:02:49.180> thing<00:02:49.210> point

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
same thing point

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.880 
same thing point
so<00:02:51.610> get<00:02:52.360> ready<00:02:52.570> girls<00:02:52.960> controlling<00:02:53.530> pressure

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
so get ready girls controlling pressure

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.680 
so get ready girls controlling pressure
so<00:02:54.190> she<00:02:54.250> needs<00:02:54.610> more<00:02:54.820> patience<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.360> can<00:02:55.480> push

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
so she needs more patience you can push

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.920 
so she needs more patience you can push
up<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:57.160> maybe<00:02:57.370> give<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.700> yes<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.030> another<00:02:58.390> and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
up and maybe give it yes you another and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.760 
up and maybe give it yes you another and
and<00:02:59.710> then<00:02:59.890> slowly<00:03:00.190> roll<00:03:00.520> through<00:03:00.820> boy<00:03:01.780> so

and then slowly roll through boy so

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.170 
and then slowly roll through boy so
you're<00:03:02.920> learning<00:03:03.040> about<00:03:03.250> your<00:03:03.460> map<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.850> points

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
you're learning about your map of points

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.300 
you're learning about your map of points
at<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.360> same<00:03:04.540> time<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.500> again<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.070> roll

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
at the same time so again you can roll

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.220 
at the same time so again you can roll
right<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.730> way<00:03:06.850> through<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.420> then<00:03:07.660> we'll<00:03:08.110> do

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
right the way through and then we'll do

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.570 
right the way through and then we'll do
this<00:03:08.410> inside<00:03:10.830> straight<00:03:11.830> on<00:03:12.040> may<00:03:12.190> be<00:03:12.250> headed

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
this inside straight on may be headed

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.490 
this inside straight on may be headed
gastro<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.240> that<00:03:13.360> people<00:03:13.540> tear<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.230> so

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
gastro is the one that people tear so so

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.800 
gastro is the one that people tear so so
look<00:03:14.950> after<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.310> guys<00:03:15.460> it's<00:03:15.790> runners<00:03:16.120> trigger

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
look after it guys it's runners trigger

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.590 
look after it guys it's runners trigger
points<00:03:17.290> slow<00:03:17.680> control<00:03:18.370> pressure<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:19.270> you're

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
points slow control pressure and you're

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.710 
points slow control pressure and you're
going<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.780> run<00:03:19.990> that<00:03:20.200> through<00:03:20.310> okay<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.090> you
