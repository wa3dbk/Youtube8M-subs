00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.549
 and the interest that 34 years ago is an artist you will find besides 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:06.830
 soon your way of truth if I lie 3 but for now you 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.269
 content to listen to the first single of his album Picardy syndrome 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269
 sport that is no other than a fetus ecology and his personality 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.630
 disparaged as an artist or acrobat 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.109
 that in fact I started with cinema and then very quickly 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.039
 I needed to make music of two describes the reins of singing 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.920
 also to fill all so many ideas that bypassed actress so that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.870
 it was important to me being able to be the creation of being able to move forward 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.590
 also artistically so that's why she has advanced on albums of 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.469
 the driverless year think about the third album and then at the same time 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.940
 I made movies and theater and that's what does not balance in fact 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 here is an excerpt from his single just 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.630
 but it's true that he looks very balanced 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.030
 the music itself brings you something that the cinema you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.100
 bring page - cinema pedals to get into the shoes of a character who 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.930
 picked up 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.490
 and it's true that in the music as I was able to really let go 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.230
 take are - list but let's go to what I'm really so that's 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.410
 another facet of my personality and that's it allowed me to be hit 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.880
 very complete in what I proposed optical 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.210
 he specifies that he will have 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.299
 the race was very hard for me I think I was three months 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.050
 it was the mistake 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.050
 I spent three months every day 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.730
 I go there she worked 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
 find the color is a second from the album 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.850
 it was a second house for three months more than five days and 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.130
 nights sometimes when we're at half-time 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.000
 but it's not always democracy cncd split up from 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 perfect its normal look it's time to put in all the time it will do 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.900
 the album before I was in a man's jacket with a Marseille diet and 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.070
 I wanted something more for 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.810
 the two over 18 years of more magical as well as as I have hair 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.090
 long that I have a side like his bohemian in life I just wanted 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.060
 to accentuate it ap in that in the clip is in the pics of the cover 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.479
 and in the press photos that I present 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.479
 and I wanted to white clerck 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.669
 it's very clear indeed that and for all that is white clear keegan 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.249
 elisa goes to her designer who does not get stuck picked her dress and 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.609
 that's where all white is 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.829
 I really like working to be alone live with the creators or 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.719
 the stylists I was lucky to some newlyweds to meet 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.689
 a designer of wedding dresses to all who had a crazy energy that 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.819
 had understood my personality well and that was very sensitive that's what 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.509
 I did 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.789
 so I made an appointment with her and then yesterday and I talked with a few 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.869
 jews listen to the music and then right away she had an idea of ​​this 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.680
 large unstructured skirt 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.209
 laughs it's true that it's also good to have someone who is another point 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.939
 on you and who thinks you differently and who makes you take 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.500
 the problem problem is that she tries fell a little when I dance 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.240
 and when I move for TVs 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.950
 it should be tightened a little here paris the length and the very beautiful 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.010
 deal but I do not want to put myself on heels because like during the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.240
 delay them and the young broadcasts danced I swear to you - the standard ifrs 5 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.019
 Following presented the wishes of the feet in the carpet at the last broadcast 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.919
 my dad he thought I was going to die but finally that's when 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.390
 the workforce is built 32 points like his head if I'm las vegas because it 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.279
 it's another pair of recuperators right away tonight the map what m 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.000
 Interested before anything else yesterday 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.209
 these chances human relations is what we can bring you his 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.049
 now that the chosen dress that human relationships are much more 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.049
 time is accurate balance sheets then 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:47.219
 in the end I regret everything and I regret nothing 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.939
 I regret nothing because that's what I did when I was going to do 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.370
 I did with the bus and I thought I wanted to 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.190
 and both with the passing time is a 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.520
 and the maturity the decline also to have started it would be a little slow bit 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.300
 differently we are artists so everything is perfectible of the economy at 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.400
 unsatisfied nose and at the same time so much better that's what makes me want 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.540
 to continue 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.219
 keep doing things to change thinking about the next album
