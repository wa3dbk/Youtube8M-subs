00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 I have something to tell you friends 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
 in 20 years you will be more disappointed in 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.849
 what you did not do instead of that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.740
 So you did what did 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 you will do 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.139
 what would you die tomorrow what 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.980
 regrets 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.449
 would you have today what is 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.279
 you would want to do immediately 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.330
 if you die tomorrow what is it 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.119
 you really want to do 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.500
 something you've always had 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.800
 want to do but you never have 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.239
 done if you can answer that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.500
 question 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.170
 that's fine if you can answer 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 to this question is that you are 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.790
 not yet a loser so if I have 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.399
 something to tell you everything 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.280
 simply did not go on to do the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.120
 turn of the board it is simply 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.460
 take action 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.289
 do not waste time friends it's 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 find tomorrow it's because I'm you 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.440
 wish but will find himself tomorrow he will 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.800
 you happen something wrong I 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.030
 find tomorrow 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.260
 I could not do what 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:08.300
 you could do yesterday so move on to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:12.500
 the action the friends and know that 80 17% 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.750
 people before the end of their lives have 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.850
 regrets 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.960
 and as I just said they do not have 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.000
 regrets about what they did 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.390
 that they have regrets about what they 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.210
 have not done but unfortunately 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.640
 as they approach death we 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.190
 could do much and so are like 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.040
 blocked they are as imprisoned are 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.310
 prisoners are imprisoned in front of them 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.670
 even so really friends to move on to 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.540
 the action 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.770
 the reality is that you're going 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.290
 not regret for the things you 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.430
 did you possibly go to have some 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.580
 remorse but their death is nothing 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.860
 compared to regret so go on to 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.080
 the action and lived as if you were going 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.090
 to die tomorrow in a week in a 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.729
 month as if you know when you 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.229
 are you going to die it will really boost you 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.619
 it 's really motivated to go to 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.690
 the action 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.119
 and to really become the person that 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.250
 you want to be to really do the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.229
 things you want to do and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.000
