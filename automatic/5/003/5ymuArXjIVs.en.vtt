00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
welcome to my video today I'm going to

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.209 
welcome to my video today I'm going to
show<00:00:06.319> how<00:00:06.770> to<00:00:07.279> make<00:00:07.910> an<00:00:08.059> enemy<00:00:08.210> tower<00:00:09.040> you<00:00:10.040> can

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
show how to make an enemy tower you can

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.660 
show how to make an enemy tower you can
see<00:00:10.430> this<00:00:10.610> prefab<00:00:11.120> here<00:00:11.510> it<00:00:11.809> has<00:00:12.110> a<00:00:12.620> just<00:00:13.490> made

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
see this prefab here it has a just made

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.900 
see this prefab here it has a just made
of<00:00:13.790> a<00:00:13.880> cube<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:14.599> it<00:00:14.840> has<00:00:15.049> a<00:00:15.469> turret<00:00:15.920> which<00:00:16.250> is<00:00:16.610> a

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
of a cube and it has a turret which is a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.499 
of a cube and it has a turret which is a
little<00:00:17.180> cylinder<00:00:17.599> attached<00:00:17.930> to<00:00:18.230> it<00:00:18.349> and<00:00:19.509> this

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
little cylinder attached to it and this

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.659 
little cylinder attached to it and this
tower<00:00:20.779> shoots<00:00:22.149> little<00:00:23.149> sphere<00:00:23.480> bullets<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:24.669> I

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
tower shoots little sphere bullets and I

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.580 
tower shoots little sphere bullets and I
have<00:00:25.939> created<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.660> new<00:00:26.689> script<00:00:27.140> which<00:00:27.290> I<00:00:27.439> will

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
have created a new script which I will

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.860 
have created a new script which I will
show<00:00:27.770> today<00:00:28.130> called<00:00:29.230> destroy<00:00:30.230> off-screen<00:00:30.770> and

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:31.870 
show today called destroy off-screen and

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.190 
show today called destroy off-screen and
let's<00:00:32.870> take<00:00:33.079> a<00:00:33.110> look<00:00:33.380> at<00:00:33.559> what<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.340> towers<00:00:34.730> do

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
let's take a look at what the towers do

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.350 
let's take a look at what the towers do
and<00:00:36.200> how<00:00:36.500> they<00:00:36.680> can<00:00:36.740> look<00:00:37.190> at<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.580> ship

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
and how they can look at the ship

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.340 
and how they can look at the ship
wherever<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:38.870> fly<00:00:39.020> around<00:00:40.810> so<00:00:41.810> we<00:00:41.960> still<00:00:42.170> have

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
wherever I fly around so we still have

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.530 
wherever I fly around so we still have
the<00:00:42.470> drones<00:00:42.740> flying<00:00:43.160> around<00:00:46.060> and<00:00:47.060> there<00:00:47.420> are

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
the drones flying around and there are

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.280 
the drones flying around and there are
some<00:00:47.780> invisible<00:00:48.230> lines<00:00:48.470> around<00:00:48.860> here<00:00:49.100> too<00:00:49.280> so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
some invisible lines around here too so

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.510 
some invisible lines around here too so
could<00:00:51.290> be<00:00:51.410> careful<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:51.860> watch<00:00:52.010> out<00:00:52.190> for<00:00:52.250> those

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
could be careful and watch out for those

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.290 
could be careful and watch out for those
so<00:00:53.480> anyway<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.790> tower<00:00:55.790> shoot<00:00:56.150> bullets

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
so anyway the the tower shoot bullets

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.390 
so anyway the the tower shoot bullets
they<00:00:56.840> collide<00:00:57.500> with<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.829> ship<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.220> they<00:00:58.340> do

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
they collide with the ship and they do

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.539 
they collide with the ship and they do
damage<00:00:58.700> I<00:01:00.160> cannot<00:01:01.160> shoot<00:01:01.489> down<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.090> tower<00:01:02.329> now

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
damage I cannot shoot down the tower now

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.850 
damage I cannot shoot down the tower now
I<00:01:04.549> have<00:01:05.149> to<00:01:05.329> decide<00:01:05.689> still<00:01:06.200> if<00:01:06.380> I'm<00:01:06.530> gonna<00:01:06.710> go

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
I have to decide still if I'm gonna go

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.240 
I have to decide still if I'm gonna go
with<00:01:07.040> hit<00:01:07.310> points<00:01:07.729> or<00:01:07.880> just<00:01:07.909> number<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.900> shots

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
with hit points or just number of shots

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.550 
with hit points or just number of shots
so<00:01:10.250> that's<00:01:10.430> in<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.790> future<00:01:11.180> for<00:01:11.540> through<00:01:12.409> this

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
so that's in the future for through this

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.550 
so that's in the future for through this
game<00:01:13.360> but<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:14.479> can<00:01:14.659> see<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.110> towers

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
game but you can see that the towers

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.100 
game but you can see that the towers
they<00:01:16.250> track<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.030> position<00:01:17.180> at<00:01:17.600> wherever<00:01:17.810> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
they track the position at wherever the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.719 
they track the position at wherever the
ship<00:01:18.350> goes<00:01:18.610> using<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.760> look<00:01:20.030> at<00:01:20.240> function<00:01:20.750> and

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
ship goes using the look at function and

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.390 
ship goes using the look at function and
I<00:01:22.729> also<00:01:23.350> mentioned<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.440> destroy<00:01:24.830> off-screen

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
I also mentioned the destroy off-screen

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.440 
I also mentioned the destroy off-screen
script<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.510> basically<00:01:27.320> took<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:27.860> code

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
script and I basically took the code

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.539 
script and I basically took the code
from<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:32.200> drones<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.680> are<00:01:33.860> formed

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
from the drones that are formed

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.880 
from the drones that are formed
off-screen<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:37.790> can<00:01:37.970> see<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:38.210> over<00:01:38.299> here<00:01:38.600> now

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
off-screen you can see it over here now

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.289 
off-screen you can see it over here now
they<00:01:39.890> start<00:01:40.400> as<00:01:41.170> has<00:01:42.170> appeared<00:01:42.590> equals<00:01:42.890> false

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
they start as has appeared equals false

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.890 
they start as has appeared equals false
so<00:01:44.299> that<00:01:44.740> as<00:01:45.740> soon<00:01:45.950> as<00:01:46.040> they<00:01:46.159> come<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.490> screen

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
so that as soon as they come on screen

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.500 
so that as soon as they come on screen
they<00:01:47.900> are<00:01:48.380> marked<00:01:48.860> has<00:01:49.400> appeared<00:01:49.880> equals<00:01:50.180> true

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
they are marked has appeared equals true

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.420 
they are marked has appeared equals true
and<00:01:50.810> then<00:01:51.140> if<00:01:51.260> they<00:01:51.409> go<00:01:51.530> off<00:01:51.560> screen<00:01:52.070> again

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
and then if they go off screen again

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.090 
and then if they go off screen again
they're<00:01:52.640> destroyed<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:54.170> took<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.680> code<00:01:54.890> out

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
they're destroyed so I took the code out

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.010 
they're destroyed so I took the code out
of<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.400> drone<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.000> make<00:01:56.150> made<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.689> separate

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
of the drone and make made it a separate

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.490 
of the drone and make made it a separate
script<00:01:57.290> because<00:01:58.220> now<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.490> have<00:01:58.820> everything

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
script because now I have everything

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.760 
script because now I have everything
that<00:02:00.500> needs<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.860> follow<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.470> didn't<00:02:03.650> want

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
that needs to follow and I didn't want

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.950 
that needs to follow and I didn't want
to<00:02:03.950> copy<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:04.970> paste<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.330> code<00:02:05.509> into<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.840> whole

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
to copy and paste the code into a whole

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.410 
to copy and paste the code into a whole
bunch<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.290> different<00:02:06.409> scripts<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.580> for

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
bunch of different scripts so for

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.389 
bunch of different scripts so for
example<00:02:08.840> bullet<00:02:09.080> one<00:02:09.259> has<00:02:09.769> destroyed

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
example bullet one has destroyed

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.289 
example bullet one has destroyed
off-screen<00:02:11.329> bullet<00:02:12.290> two<00:02:12.469> does<00:02:12.709> also<00:02:13.299> the

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
off-screen bullet two does also the

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:14.670 
off-screen bullet two does also the
drill

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
drill

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.869 
drill
have<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.670> drone<00:02:15.909> has<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.560> mines

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
have the drone has it the mines

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.610 
have the drone has it the mines
everybody<00:02:18.879> has<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.510> even<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> power-ups<00:02:20.379> need

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
everybody has it even the power-ups need

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.830 
everybody has it even the power-ups need
it<00:02:23.939> so<00:02:24.939> let<00:02:25.629> us<00:02:25.930> go<00:02:26.290> over<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.909> script<00:02:28.420> for

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
it so let us go over to the script for

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.789 
it so let us go over to the script for
the<00:02:29.049> enemy<00:02:29.379> tower<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:31.480> pretty<00:02:31.810> simple<00:02:32.409> it

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
the enemy tower it's pretty simple it

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.240 
the enemy tower it's pretty simple it
just<00:02:33.069> needs<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.900> come<00:02:34.900> down<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.349> screen<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.129> it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
just needs to come down the screen so it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.270 
just needs to come down the screen so it
has<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.430> tower<00:02:36.760> speed<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:38.049> has<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.349> weight<00:02:38.889> shoot

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
has a tower speed it has a weight shoot

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.099 
has a tower speed it has a weight shoot
for<00:02:39.700> how<00:02:39.849> often<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.359> can<00:02:40.540> shoot<00:02:40.810> bullets

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.210 

basically<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:45.700> looks<00:02:46.269> at<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.780> ship<00:02:47.349> by<00:02:47.739> this

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
basically it looks at the ship by this

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.420 
basically it looks at the ship by this
transform<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.419> look<00:02:49.599> at<00:02:49.780> function<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.590> I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
transform that look at function and I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.170 
transform that look at function and I
have<00:02:51.669> ship<00:02:52.030> ship<00:02:52.659> position<00:02:53.169> as<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:54.180> global

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
have ship ship position as a global

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.869 
have ship ship position as a global
variable<00:02:55.419> a<00:02:55.780> static<00:02:56.139> variable<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.919> then

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
variable a static variable and then

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.039 
variable a static variable and then
every<00:02:58.150> time<00:02:58.359> I<00:02:58.480> shoots<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.049> creates<00:02:59.829> a<00:03:00.099> clone

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
every time I shoots it creates a clone

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.599 
every time I shoots it creates a clone
instantiating<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.290> projectile<00:03:02.889> that<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.519> have

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
instantiating the projectile that I have

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.569 
instantiating the projectile that I have
assigned<00:03:03.909> and<00:03:04.299> then<00:03:05.169> because<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.069> want<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
assigned and then because I want the

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.309 
assigned and then because I want the
bullet<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.849> appear<00:03:07.419> just<00:03:07.689> in<00:03:07.840> front<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.169> the

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
bullet to appear just in front of the

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.119 
bullet to appear just in front of the
gun<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:09.000> translate<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> bullet<00:03:10.419> forward<00:03:11.129> and

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
gun I translate the bullet forward and

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.949 
gun I translate the bullet forward and
depending<00:03:12.519> on<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.819> size<00:03:13.299> of<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.599> 3d<00:03:13.930> model

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
depending on the size of the 3d model

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.289 
depending on the size of the 3d model
later<00:03:14.439> on<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:15.430> will<00:03:15.639> need<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.790> be<00:03:15.939> changed

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
later on this will need to be changed

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.599 
later on this will need to be changed
but<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.989> boy<00:03:17.139> appears<00:03:17.560> just<00:03:17.799> in<00:03:17.980> front<00:03:18.219> of<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
but the boy appears just in front of the

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.520 
but the boy appears just in front of the
gun<00:03:19.239> right<00:03:19.449> now<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:21.280> tower<00:03:21.790> bullets<00:03:22.530> very

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
gun right now the tower bullets very

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.240 
gun right now the tower bullets very
simple<00:03:24.010> they<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:24.819> get<00:03:25.629> moved<00:03:25.900> forward<00:03:26.680> at

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
simple they just get moved forward at

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.960 
simple they just get moved forward at
speed<00:03:27.849> times<00:03:28.329> time<00:03:28.629> at<00:03:28.989> Delta<00:03:29.349> time<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.979> then

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
speed times time at Delta time and then

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.780 
speed times time at Delta time and then
when<00:03:31.180> they<00:03:31.530> collide<00:03:32.530> with<00:03:32.739> something<00:03:32.790> it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
when they collide with something it

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.059 
when they collide with something it
checks<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.239> tag<00:03:34.599> if<00:03:34.989> it's<00:03:35.229> the<00:03:35.379> player<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
checks the tag if it's the player the

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.979 
checks the tag if it's the player the
bullet<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.549> destroyed<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:38.139> that's<00:03:38.500> about<00:03:38.739> it

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
bullet is destroyed and that's about it

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.920 
bullet is destroyed and that's about it
now<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.049> wave<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:43.060> yeah<00:03:43.689> I've<00:03:43.780> already

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
now the wave see yeah I've already

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.629 
now the wave see yeah I've already
showed<00:03:44.199> destroy<00:03:44.590> off-screen<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.370> we're<00:03:45.519> good

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
showed destroy off-screen so we're good

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.789 
showed destroy off-screen so we're good
there<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:47.019> wave<00:03:47.879> had<00:03:48.879> a<00:03:49.439> variable<00:03:50.439> called

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
there the wave had a variable called

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.890 
there the wave had a variable called
next<00:03:51.129> wave<00:03:51.340> which<00:03:51.909> when<00:03:52.239> there<00:03:52.389> was<00:03:52.540> only<00:03:52.629> the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
next wave which when there was only the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.890 
next wave which when there was only the
drone<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:54.579> was<00:03:54.699> just<00:03:54.939> a<00:03:55.120> single<00:03:55.449> variable<00:03:55.870> and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
drone it was just a single variable and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.749 
drone it was just a single variable and
now<00:03:56.139> that<00:03:56.349> I<00:03:56.379> have<00:03:56.530> multiple<00:03:56.949> enemies<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.579> want

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:57.759 
now that I have multiple enemies I want

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.339 
now that I have multiple enemies I want
to<00:03:57.819> control<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.180> different<00:03:58.419> timers<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:59.319> I

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
to control the different timers so I

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.179 
to control the different timers so I
made<00:03:59.979> a<00:04:00.269> float<00:04:01.269> array<00:04:01.569> out<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.930> those<00:04:02.159> so<00:04:03.159> I

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
made a float array out of those so I

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.909 
made a float array out of those so I
have<00:04:03.489> both<00:04:03.729> the<00:04:04.030> enemy<00:04:04.449> weight<00:04:04.659> and<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.620> next

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
have both the enemy weight and the next

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:12.300 
have both the enemy weight and the next
wave<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:08.019> basically<00:04:09.389> when<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:12.099> next

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
wave so this is basically when the next

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.069 
wave so this is basically when the next
wave<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.699> when<00:04:12.909> that<00:04:13.299> unit<00:04:13.659> can<00:04:13.810> come<00:04:13.959> out

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
wave is when that unit can come out

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.259 
wave is when that unit can come out
again<00:04:14.349> and<00:04:14.620> when<00:04:14.919> it<00:04:15.040> comes<00:04:15.220> out<00:04:15.430> how<00:04:16.030> much

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
again and when it comes out how much

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.420 
again and when it comes out how much
longer<00:04:16.539> has<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.959> wait<00:04:17.139> before<00:04:17.349> it<00:04:17.620> can<00:04:17.919> come

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
longer has to wait before it can come

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.930 
longer has to wait before it can come
out<00:04:18.549> again<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.019> declare<00:04:20.739> these<00:04:20.919> similar<00:04:21.459> to

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
out again so I declare these similar to

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.779 
out again so I declare these similar to
how<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.180> did<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.719> bullets<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.950> ship<00:04:24.219> script

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
how I did the bullets in the ship script

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.210 
how I did the bullets in the ship script
so

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
so

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.370 
so
I<00:04:26.250> like<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.330> format<00:04:27.750> I'm<00:04:27.930> gonna<00:04:28.080> go<00:04:28.260> with

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
I like that format I'm gonna go with

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.530 
I like that format I'm gonna go with
that
