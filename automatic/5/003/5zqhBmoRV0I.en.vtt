00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.400
 A) Yes 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.460
 and already back in the workshop we have 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.190
 picked up our sheet notice what they 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 I will explain in this case we can not 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.680
 be putting the piece of metal in the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.470
 water and take it out and dry it I'm going to 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.570
 explain why because if we do what 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.600
 that we can dry the outside of the sheet 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.100
 but we are going to get water inside the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.980
 sheet and then that later we will 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.340
 damage the are the metal block where 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 we are working and it is oxidized then 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.930
 unfortunately we have to put it or the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.940
 easiest way to cool a workpiece is 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.100
 throwing it to the floor you throw it to the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.810
 floor that if you are careful because here 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.670
 in the workshop sometimes it happens that you have to 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.250
 say do not grab the piece that is in the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.570
 floor for sure that's that's normal that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 a person come walking and see 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.410
 something lying on the floor because it tends to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.750
 to take it and then lift it in 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.310
 this case when they see a vital piece in 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.440
 the floor not going to grab him sane 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.140
 if it's hot then once 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.979
 she is cold is still hot not 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.740
 Do this 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.090
 then once it 's cold, let's go 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.990
 to start doing what 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.700
 with a pointed hammer you should have a 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.719
 edge in the back is what they 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.880
 I was commenting 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.380
 of the file with the part also hammer 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.280
 I'm going to show you something to look here 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.320
 momentico une lima grande 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.299
 if you want the hammer and you 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.100
 come hey look does not have the edge he said 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.820
 matilde in the program simply 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.340
 they took their hammer they put it like that and they 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.300
 they're going to be a fixed in the back 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.800
 with the file with someone because they're going to 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.330
 create a little edge to the king is 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.649
 important because if the hammer does not 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.509
 has that that sharp line then 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.320
 will create the texture that we 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.959
 we want to give us the feeling of 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.850
 that we are in the presence of a sheet of 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.370
 metal but that is the closest thing 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.720
 possible to a natural leaf that that's what 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.650
 nice these projects just like the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:26.760
 flowers the flowers over let's do 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.080
 the same with the lime ok 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.510
 we put our limited here and now 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.209
 we have more or less an edge that we're going 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.739
 to do and this is cold let's do 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.720
 let's give him moves with the 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.530
 hammer let's try to hammer 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.530
 outside 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.379
 line girl line 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.420
 there I have question matti and we can 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.549
 do from one side of the other if you can 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.260
 doing from one side of the other the problem is 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.510
 that when we do it from the other side 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.439
 after picking it up if we do it on 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.599
 these highs will erase the texture that 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.930
 have on the other side then here 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.930
 we follow 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.720
 and here we go hammering 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.350
 although there is the texture that took 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.040
 the sheet 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.390
 do not come home 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.100
 Now we must pick up again 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.100
 let's take our blowtorch 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.690
 remember that when we are working 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.400
 in the workshop be very careful with what 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.379
 which is the part of the torch the part of 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.180
 the acids of the tools that 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.739
 may cause some that can 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.780
 hurt anyone especially if 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.849
 we have children at home they should be fine 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.190
 pending is not telling the children there 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.290
 people who can not touch that we are not going to 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.720
 explain to children because they do not 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.099
 they can touch the tools 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.480
 he simply explains, look, let's go, 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.590
 you can grab the torch because you can 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.750
 be that the mouth of the torch is 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.370
 hot and you're going to burn is hot 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.739
 you're going to burn and mom does not want you 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.510
 It hurts the same with the hammers 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.109
 with all the pieces that are sharp 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.810
 because definitely a prohibit something 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.370
 it's like that more striking will go to touch it 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.260
 to see what the tool is about 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.170
 then preferable that I explained to 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.389
 no problems when 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.430
 here we already remember remember what they 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.900
 I said let's take our piece not the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.940
 they can get wet 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.100
 let's wait here a minute while 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.780
 we wait for it to cool down to be 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.120
 cool our sheet I really want 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.830
 thank all the blessings all 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.690
 the beautiful messages that send us to 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.750
 through real social networks 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.050
 that we receive beautiful mail every day 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.280
 with people with different stories 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.259
 is telling us that they have learned 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.479
 many nice things people that we 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.949
 they send the photo of their pieces and really 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.599
 that is very rewarding for us 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.030
 because we know that we are reaching them 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.979
 you can communicate to 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.690
 phone they see on screen or horita 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.639
 via email through 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.400
 from our instagram that leaves matilde 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.229
 goldsmithing and I want to take advantage of 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.060
 the opportunity to thank the 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.070
 mister ricardo tours well to the whole team 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.259
 beautiful of fundy express by all 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.460
 collaboration that all of us 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.570
 days every time we're going to make a 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.880
 delivery of truth material that 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.949
 you many thanks then here 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.840
 let's see, I'm going to play like that, quickie 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.180
 remember not to do this 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.550
 what will I do again the same 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.300
 procedure of taking my little daughter and I'm going to 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.300
 start hammering 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.599
 it's important I want to tell you not to 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.699
 scare if the sheet is taking a 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.490
 curvature because that means that 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.970
 all that is the external part of the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.759
 leaf goes and goes like that widening 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.409
 the metal is accessing it is expanding and 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.110
 then of course as it is folded 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.300
 here and it has like one is stressed 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.909
 in that in that case the metal and there is a 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.550
 fold then she tends to open 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:04.520
 sideways what you are saying 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.440
 apart from making a statement you can 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.569
 I made many necklaces with 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.729
 leaves here several leaves by hanging on a 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.289
 chain in one opportunity I had to do 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.400
 a brides headdress with pure leaves 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.919
 little girls 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.360
 It was a lot of work but really 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:22.130
 It was was very well interesting because 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.919
 it's a cool job a job 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.159
 well fine nice then here I go 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.289
 again to pick up the piece to return 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.810
 again to the procedure of giving it with 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.160
 the hammer to make the texture 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:39.880
 of what is the part of the needle 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.930
 deep good as again blowtorch 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.930
 we are going to pick 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.710
 while we are still here 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.510
 picking up our sheet let's go to a cut 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.280
 commercial do not take off from the screen 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.550
 that we are back with more of our 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.550
 leaves 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:04.860
 two
