00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 how is it done 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.110
 in the world over 500 billion lego parts 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.830
 that's enough to give everyone 70 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.220
 pieces and 50 million parts are in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.189
 florid legolande 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.930
 but to make up the building details 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.919
 people and spaceships 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.579
 need and skill and imagination and since 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.579
 it's done 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.579
 washington 8 am 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:45.020
 don't be afraid the congress building don't attack 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.210
 these shoes belong to jason miller 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.390
 one of the creators of the model is legal and 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.600
 at the big man ahead is troublesome 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.720
 day park constantly add new 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.120
 models and that means jason creates 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.120
 up to 50 new samples every year 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.950
 luckily lego for jason dream job 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.650
 took when i was a kid i had 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.560
 lego sets i built huge ones of them 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.400
 dioramas thailand 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.930
 this is recruiting wild west sheriff's prison 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.360
 he was very cool to play 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.560
 imagine that gangsters break out 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.400
 prisons are exciting 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.340
 just great however today he has 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.780
 unusual task 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.900
 most model makers start with 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.360
 something big and reduce it but 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:52.380
 Jason takes the league mini figure and 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.380
 increases it 30 times to start with us 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.290
 helps determine the proportions of the ultimate 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.860
 figures program is only a tool 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.780
 sleep I need it just to help we 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.590
 rely on your imagination and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.390
 creation 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.050
 go with someone who hurt the evil better 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.050
 starting point 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.120
 when it comes to building a model 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.450
 Jason works with the same standard 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.210
 details as any player in the league only 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.210
 in his box 150 thousand items 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.740
 he starts the foundation for the feet and 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.810
 creates legs and the left is important 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.640
 remember 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.980
 overlap bricks and I 'll start building 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.920
 one line here another here and it turns out 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.959
 very solid on the prototype takes 32 hours 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.000
 but he is not strong enough yet 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.440
 endure the most destructive power 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.440
 nature children 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.390
 yes he is now I am building a real model 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.510
 she she that I plant every detail glue with I 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.260
 I take a bottle of glue and stick 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.569
 every tiny piece of brick for 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.920
 brick in nothing missing 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.310
 and this is no ordinary glue league has developed 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.659
 a special polymer that melts plastic 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.319
 turning individual parts into one 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.709
 strong blog 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.049
 one wrong move and it trains 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.849
 back way no evidence when changing part i 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.849
 I can not tear it and Dacians 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.140
 polymer is strong enough to resist 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.480
 in front of children's fingers 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.840
 but even the strongest glue does not protect 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.030
 hurricane park sculpture 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.060
 she florida accounts for more hurricanes 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.310
 than to any other us state 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.560
 Therefore, the figure of Jason strengthened 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.680
 steel about groan which fix 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.680
 bolted 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.920
 the base blocks are so big that they are difficult 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.540
 make and together happiness with jason 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.540
 there is a suitable tool 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.990
 and u have a new creation almost ready 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.040
 join the park 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.620
 of the 15 thousand other models here are 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.690
 all from giant domini dragons 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.570
 cities model of the most famous 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:26.640
 attractions of america including 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:29.310
 new york florida and vegas or such 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.660
 and to satisfy the most 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.210
 demanding visitors 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.500
 Jason and other workers are checking 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.150
 to be respected every detail 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.040
 came up with to build a building in this 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.870
 mining where we send the team 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.680
 designers to the place we want 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.500
 play back 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.919
 they take pictures of everything, even stormy aha 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.919
 garbage 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.570
 this park is a real miracle which 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.180
 amazing imagination and thanks to such 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.970
 to builders like jason he constantly 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.460
 growing every day I am amazed that you can 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.740
 make lekku nothing is impossible 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.990
 it's great while your imagination 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.270
 work at the court and is capable of anything 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.990
 The program is announced at Cyrillic studios.
