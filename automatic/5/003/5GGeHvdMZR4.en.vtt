silicon sort of shock protection sleeves

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.690 
silicon sort of shock protection sleeves
you<00:02:46.330> can<00:02:46.590> once<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.740> put<00:02:47.890> your<00:02:48.040> hard<00:02:48.220> drive<00:02:48.520> in

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
you can once you put your hard drive in

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.180 
you can once you put your hard drive in
here<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.080> put<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.320> sleeve<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.350> and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
here you can put a sleeve on like so and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.790 
here you can put a sleeve on like so and
it<00:02:54.460> gives<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.760> some<00:02:54.910> shock<00:02:55.180> protection<00:02:55.800> still

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
it gives it some shock protection still

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.230 
it gives it some shock protection still
