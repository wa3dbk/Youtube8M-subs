00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:22.410
 I wonder Nane' like Hodai to grunt Line 1 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.810
 Two departures 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.099
 that's all 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.099
 Then we will assemble 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:35.770
 This would be that I was able Yes 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.260
 I'm Air Wolf, it's bombing ray 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.140
 People who responded to Air Wolf are probably good old people 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 Yes i want to england completely 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.239
 For example Well this is guard ring I'd looked like a Te Nakane 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.829
 It's like a public feeling . 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.940
 Where are you going 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.559
 Pretty parentheses Likes 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:06.290
 Well if let's described with roses sleep par 2 it so far is pretty interesting 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:10.250
 First of all, it's a part of the wing, and it's shaped like a shuriken 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:15.080
 There is a projection on the part here , so the hole is 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.840
 The middle part here and four after this helicopter 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.300
 I will do something 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.790
 After things like tires 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.290
 It is variously used likely Toka or buy high fever Oh pinch feeling 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.280
 Hmmm 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 It's like an all-you-can-eat guy stuck to Miyane Ana 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.800
 Both of these things are a lifetime 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:43.530
 Well, it's a wooden frame and the hole is here 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.540
 Here is one piece next The guard ring part and the skirt ring part have a thick shaft here 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.510
 Keep up 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.190
 Daniel is 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.810
 here 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.980
 The thin shaft is flowing here The next part is the buttocks 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.920
 Good 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:04.510
 Here it becomes thick Sik 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:08.420
 There is a thin axis here, and it is open here while in the sail village 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:14.000
 And here it is good 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:18.260
 This is also easy to use and its origin is slow to thick axis 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.840
 I axis is two and a threaded hole 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.900
 This is the last part of the body 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.290
 After It is a narrow part of the head of the left and right 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.470
 road 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.910
 Butt 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:38.530
 Back This is all the thick trunk 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:42.090
 It's like this, but it also feels like that face 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.090
 Let od do it this way 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.069
 Yes you can use it for your head part 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.140
 We think that we want to compare secret next 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.650
 Janto 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.159
 i secret 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.909
 The secret basically splashes on this part 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:05.130
 Only the color is different Blue is only red 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.580
 Has become the ne feathers like is the secret It is after 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.080
 I can not help 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.460
 This is that 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.840
 I think it would be in many cases there one part when out one Flip open Well 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.310
 Do not forget the sound parts up in the direction of the normal hard and I think what is different do this in the normal 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.950
 I searched for something 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:30.099
 It looks like it was broken if you look at it well 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:36.340
 Yes there is also a turn, but I felt that I touched it in various ways 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:39.340
 I think that it is the most important characters that have that part in this live ammunition 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.490
 What is important here 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.760
 This cat letter 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.250
 The source parts 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.350
 This is this 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.830
 I this here is the say the male of thin axis at Osu here is thick shaft 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:59.000
 I think that source parts can be used already 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:02.540
 So I think this is a good pattern no matter how many pieces up to 1000 times 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.940
 Part of this face to the LDP 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.590
 I think I can use it 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.300
 I Rutte male hole for the various direction to the end of the female This is probably 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.590
 It is easy to use 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:18.019
 If you want to buy a lot and make a custom, maybe you have a turn 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.209
 I think it would be nice to have a large amount 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.209
 So also let's hope you because the next Bye Bye
