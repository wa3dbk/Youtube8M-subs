hi guys this is the demonstration on how

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.130 
hi guys this is the demonstration on how
to<00:00:03.090> use<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.659> slope<00:00:04.580> 305<00:00:05.580> needle<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.870> nouveau

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to use a slope 305 needle in the nouveau

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.709 
to use a slope 305 needle in the nouveau
contour<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:08.189> do<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> eyeliner<00:00:08.719> for

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
contour to do the eyeliner for

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.419 
contour to do the eyeliner for
demonstration<00:00:10.290> purposes<00:00:10.710> I'm<00:00:10.889> going<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.219> use

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
demonstration purposes I'm going to use

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.120 
demonstration purposes I'm going to use
this<00:00:11.670> slanted<00:00:12.570> makeup<00:00:13.049> brush<00:00:13.290> which

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
this slanted makeup brush which

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.439 
this slanted makeup brush which
resembles<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.599> needle<00:00:17.090> when<00:00:18.090> you're<00:00:18.210> doing

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
resembles the needle when you're doing

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.090 
resembles the needle when you're doing
eyeliner<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.350> remember<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
eyeliner you have to remember that the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.660 
eyeliner you have to remember that the
skin<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.460> very<00:00:20.490> loose<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:22.279> wrinkled<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.609> you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
skin is very loose and wrinkled so you

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.310 
skin is very loose and wrinkled so you
have<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> make<00:00:24.180> sure<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.869> color<00:00:25.109> in

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
have to make sure you get that color in

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
going over the tissue many times when

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.959 
going over the tissue many times when
you're<00:00:30.990> itching<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> skin<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.669> use

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.830 
you're itching in the skin you can use
the<00:00:33.930> needle<00:00:34.110> upright<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.090> like

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the needle upright just like this like

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.799 
the needle upright just like this like
you<00:00:36.989> would<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.879> draw<00:00:38.879> or<00:00:39.300> make<00:00:40.020> circles<00:00:44.809> hair

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you would just draw or make circles hair

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.979 
you would just draw or make circles hair
strokes<00:00:46.940> you'd<00:00:47.940> even<00:00:48.090> make<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.600> circles

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
strokes you'd even make little circles

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.360 
strokes you'd even make little circles
with<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.289> needle<00:00:50.270> tight<00:00:51.270> circles<00:00:52.129> but<00:00:53.129> when

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
with this needle tight circles but when

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.060 
with this needle tight circles but when
you're<00:00:53.489> filling<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> eyeliner<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:55.710> need

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
you're filling in the eyeliner you need

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.840 
you're filling in the eyeliner you need
to<00:00:56.489> tilt<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.270> angle<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:59.250> may

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to tilt your angle a little bit may

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.049 
to tilt your angle a little bit may
about<00:01:00.090> 30<00:01:00.300> degrees<00:01:00.949> or<00:01:01.949> 40<00:01:02.280> degrees<00:01:02.609> 45

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
about 30 degrees or 40 degrees 45

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.660 
about 30 degrees or 40 degrees 45
degrees<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.260> must<00:01:04.530> work<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.400> kind

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
degrees and you must work with this kind

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.649 
degrees and you must work with this kind
of<00:01:05.760> motion<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> skin<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.420> color

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
of motion in the skin this way the color

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
of motion in the skin this way the color
is<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.200> into<00:01:10.560> skin<00:01:10.830> by<00:01:11.040> pushing<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:13.860> make

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
is going into skin by pushing it to make

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.039 
is going into skin by pushing it to make
a<00:01:14.010> snagging<00:01:15.170> type<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> friction

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:29.620 

the<00:01:21.590> movement<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.490> way<00:01:28.330> this<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.479> the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the movement is this way this is the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.460 
the movement is this way this is the
speed<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.590> work<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.130> around<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:31.939> speed

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
speed that I work to around the speed

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.710 
speed that I work to around the speed
making<00:01:33.470> circular<00:01:33.770> movements<00:01:34.460> I'm<00:01:35.450> not

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
making circular movements I'm not

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.469 
making circular movements I'm not
working<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.170> way<00:01:36.580> or<00:01:37.580> going<00:01:37.850> back<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.240> forth

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
working this way or going back and forth

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.590 
working this way or going back and forth
this<00:01:38.689> way<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:39.369> tilt<00:01:40.369> my<00:01:40.460> needle<00:01:40.850> down<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.330> I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
this way I tilt my needle down and I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.789 
this way I tilt my needle down and I
work<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:41.960> way<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.720> let's<00:01:47.899> say<00:01:48.200> you're<00:01:48.619> going

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
work this way so let's say you're going

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.370 
work this way so let's say you're going
to<00:01:48.890> do<00:01:49.039> an<00:01:49.159> eyeliner<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:50.630> want<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.869> first<00:01:51.080> make

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
to do an eyeliner you want to first make

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:00.700 
to do an eyeliner you want to first make
a<00:01:52.310> pattern<00:01:52.759> on<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.840> skin

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.070 

so<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.430> your<00:02:01.520> template

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
I always bring it out a little here to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.410 
I always bring it out a little here to
make<00:02:13.380> sure<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.560> give<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.070> eye<00:02:14.100> nice<00:02:14.910> almond

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
look so you want to etch this pattern

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520 
look so you want to etch this pattern
into<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> skin<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.720> don't<00:02:24.900> lose<00:02:25.200> it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
into the skin so you don't lose it
