figure out how to change it two miles
per<00:01:38.610> hour<00:01:38.760> because<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.080> gauges<00:01:40.440> are<00:01:40.650> in

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
per hour because it's the gauges are in

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.990 
per hour because it's the gauges are in
kilometers<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.550> don't<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
kilometers and I don't know the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.660 
kilometers and I don't know the
conversion<00:01:42.680> another<00:01:43.680> thing<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.190> these<00:01:44.490> are

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
conversion another thing is these are

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.430 
conversion another thing is these are
aluminum<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.180> instead<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.480> steel<00:01:45.870> on<00:01:46.140> my

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
aluminum now instead of steel on my

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.800 
aluminum now instead of steel on my
black<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:46.950> these<00:01:47.250> were<00:01:47.400> steel<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.480> they<00:01:48.510> went

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
black one these were steel so they went

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.490 
black one these were steel so they went
to<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.900> minimum

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to a minimum

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.220 
to a minimum
the<00:01:49.710> shifter<00:01:50.130> itself<00:01:50.280> doesn't<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.300> what

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
the shifter itself doesn't have the what

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.780 
the shifter itself doesn't have the what
