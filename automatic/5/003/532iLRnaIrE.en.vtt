00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
they do one of the things that I think

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.009 
they do one of the things that I think
is<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.609> most<00:04:00.760> important<00:04:01.329> thing<00:04:01.450> in<00:04:01.629> a<00:04:01.690> reining

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
is the most important thing in a reining

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.589 
is the most important thing in a reining
horse<00:04:02.140> because<00:04:02.590> they<00:04:02.799> carry<00:04:03.069> themselves<00:04:03.599> and

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
horse because they carry themselves and

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.970 
horse because they carry themselves and
what<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.750> mean<00:04:04.989> by<00:04:05.049> that<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.590> that<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.859> don't

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
what I mean by that is that you don't

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.800 
what I mean by that is that you don't
have<00:04:06.159> to<00:04:06.310> frame<00:04:06.549> them<00:04:06.730> up<00:04:06.909> you<00:04:07.450> don't<00:04:07.569> have<00:04:07.690> to

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
have to frame them up you don't have to

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.020 
have to frame them up you don't have to
spend<00:04:08.140> 90%<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.980> your<00:04:09.069> time<00:04:09.129> checking<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
spend 90% of your time checking and

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.430 
spend 90% of your time checking and
lumpen<00:04:10.329> and<00:04:10.569> getting<00:04:11.409> to<00:04:11.890> lope<00:04:12.099> slow

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
lumpen and getting to lope slow

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.420 
lumpen and getting to lope slow
realizing<00:04:14.440> these<00:04:14.530> were<00:04:14.590> some<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.190> best

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
realizing these were some of the best

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.150 
realizing these were some of the best
Colts<00:04:15.940> they<00:04:16.120> had<00:04:16.269> ever<00:04:16.479> laid<00:04:16.750> eyes<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:17.160> Jesse
