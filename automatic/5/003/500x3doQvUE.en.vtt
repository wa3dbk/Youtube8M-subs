 Look, I 'm already with needle 3 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.330

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.300
 working on your double, you see that 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.900

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.340
 between your fingers why are you going to do 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:35.420

 My problem is to give a detail in fact. 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.010
 this career made line she goes 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.820
 demarcate the end of yours from the bottom of the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.530
 your 62 libero of your slipper nÃ© 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.489
 and will mark the beginning of the body of the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.280
 tootsy 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.649
 Okay, so here's the next, come on. 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.629
 hold this movie at any point not 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.859
 You need to worry about nothing, is not it? 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.589

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.159
 seeing you have two 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.110
 then take the joint passes again between the 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:18.380
 my fingers slipped away without a problem 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.370
 It happens again, but the two are now 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 password 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.380
 now I go there and stuck with a 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.390
 I learned there is wind 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.880
 How I'm going to work is with the high point. 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.410
 It's what I'm going to do the next I go 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.660

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.120
 from the point that I'm going to use it's okay 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.730
 now it's the turn of the high point then 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.240

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:51.290

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.540

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.820
 Remember that thing from behind and through 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.460

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.220
 forward then you will pass the needle 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.350
