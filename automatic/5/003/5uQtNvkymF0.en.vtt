00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.650

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.050

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.150
 we know you'll be a partner x 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:42.370
 athletic finish being a one year 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:45.850
 impressive movement from the use 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.920
 special the guarani country in portugal will 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.040
 be a special end because it was not 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.960
 on the floor was in 11 indicated population 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.330
 degree for me and to try to enjoy 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.900
 enjoy the maximum as final 1 arrives 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:02.100
 every day and so is enjoy ee 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.100
 chicken is the most important 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.580
 Luna said playing as we know 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.810
 play the same way we have played 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.040
 in previous games 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.350
 We know it's going to be a very 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.850
 hard yesterday was a team we 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.649
 surprised at the beginning of the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.509
 determined season is to surprise until 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.850
 now that it's a very compact type 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.939
 mÃºltipa strong a strong team 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.830
 mentally has a coach who will 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.330
 instilling the boys his 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.399
 experience and to and in its strength within 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.209
 field so I have no doubt if it happens 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.539
 in a good game game slant a team 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.539
 pretty strong 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.080
 I think a final is always 50 50 always 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.190
 It is always difficult to say who will win the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.220
 our experience with them have been more 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.860
 or less we have won more games but this 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:13.080
 Do not want to say anything, an ending is 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:14.489
 different are pressure is part of the game 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.930
 football professional 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.120
 pressure is part of the game in the real 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.459
 madrid says he was always at home at 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.080
 win and so it's good I like 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.680
 playing the competition like to feel 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.680
 option because it does no researcher 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:41.190
 positive moment of the hungary in the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.500
 passion of illusion and that's why we 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.239
 players feel that we are very 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.060
 near grave 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.160
 some if any football history in the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
 history of the real madrid gives in history 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.030
 of all the players and so we are 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.540
 one step is to get it going to be difficult but 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.540
 I guess so 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.140
 is a trophy that for 12 years we have been looking for 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.000
 real madrid seeks the tenth already much 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.990
 time we feel this from the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.160
 The first day we walked in a bit 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.740
 sense of positive pressure to win 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.730
 the 'champions' law and we arrived we are 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.440
 one step is because you will not 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.900
 winning was always a dream I wanted 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.070
 was to win the 'champions' mpu and I think 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.850
 we are one step as said 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.850
 it 's a dream to win the plate 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.620
 of the players ' big finals 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:45.650
 raise this beautiful trophy that was 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:49.250
 champagne and now I live, not only I want 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.010
 able to play in order to win 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.630
 so it is a unique and very 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.710
 special is the same as all 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:02.620
 journalists dream about the tenth and are 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.620
 all injured and so we will win
