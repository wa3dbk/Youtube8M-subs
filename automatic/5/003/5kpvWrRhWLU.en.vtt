him if he is going to heaven or hell how

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.839 
him if he is going to heaven or hell how
we<00:00:23.340> portrayed<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> story<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.849> projector

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
we portrayed the story was a projector

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.540 
we portrayed the story was a projector
projecting<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.750> silhouette<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> live

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
projecting a silhouette on to a live

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.170 
projecting a silhouette on to a live
alley<00:00:30.480> wall<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.130> silhouette<00:00:32.520> interacts

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
alley wall and this silhouette interacts

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.209 
alley wall and this silhouette interacts
with<00:00:33.360> its<00:00:33.630> surroundings<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:35.010> makes

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
with its surroundings but what makes

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.220 
with its surroundings but what makes
this<00:00:35.399> unique<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.660> camera<00:00:37.200> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this unique is that the camera is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.340 
this unique is that the camera is
attached<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> projector<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.570> wild

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
attached to the projector it's this wild

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.830 
attached to the projector it's this wild
wild<00:00:40.680> effect<00:00:41.370> wherever<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.239> projector<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
wild effect wherever the projector is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.580 
wild effect wherever the projector is
pointing<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:44.160> camera<00:00:44.210> follows<00:00:45.210> also<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.500> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
pointing the camera follows also so it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.970 
pointing the camera follows also so it
almost<00:00:46.739> looks<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.910> silhouette<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
almost looks as if the silhouette is

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.549 
almost looks as if the silhouette is
interacting<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.210> constantly<00:00:51.210> shifting

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
interacting with a constantly shifting

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
interacting with a constantly shifting
morphine<00:00:52.559> environment<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.789> changing

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
morphine environment it's changing

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.920 
morphine environment it's changing
around<00:00:54.719> him<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> yet<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.520> time<00:00:56.930> precisely

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
around him and yet it's time precisely

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.500 
around him and yet it's time precisely
in<00:00:58.680> order<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.100> fill<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.059> had<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> film

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
in order to fill this you had to film

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.260 
in order to fill this you had to film
the<00:01:00.629> entire<00:01:00.690> film<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.320> five<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.859> six<00:01:02.039> times

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
the entire film like five or six times

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.240 
the entire film like five or six times
because<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.719> many<00:01:03.930> layers<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
because there are so many layers to the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.240 
because there are so many layers to the
film<00:01:05.630> we<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.780> done<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> shadows<00:01:07.950> right

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
film we are done with the shadows right

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.120 
film we are done with the shadows right
