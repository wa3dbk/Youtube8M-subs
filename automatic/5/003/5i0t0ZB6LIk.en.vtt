kind of long judging from what's on
there<00:03:23.390> maybe<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:24.380> don't<00:03:25.370> know<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.550> three<00:03:25.820> foot

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
that's ps2 360 and ps3 and I wonder what

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.190 
that's ps2 360 and ps3 and I wonder what
other<00:03:38.090> stuff<00:03:38.330> I<00:03:38.450> can<00:03:38.540> get<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.720> work<00:03:38.840> with<00:03:39.080> there

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
other stuff I can get to work with there

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.440 
other stuff I can get to work with there
probably<00:03:39.440> nothing<00:03:40.090> probably<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.209> what<00:03:41.330> it

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
probably nothing probably just what it

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.540 
probably nothing probably just what it
says<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:41.900> I<00:03:41.989> wonder<00:03:42.230> if<00:03:42.290> stuff<00:03:43.160> can<00:03:43.340> work<00:03:43.519> just

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
says but I wonder if stuff can work just

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.640 
says but I wonder if stuff can work just
by<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:43.910> nature<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.450> signals<00:03:45.140> or<00:03:45.350> what<00:03:45.500> have

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
by the nature of signals or what have

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.820 
by the nature of signals or what have
you

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.740 
you

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
oh yeah suppose I should you seen it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.900 
oh yeah suppose I should you seen it
yeah<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:50.930> got<00:03:51.080> these<00:03:51.380> things<00:03:51.709> from<00:03:52.489> China

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
yeah I got these things from China

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.670 
yeah I got these things from China
well<00:03:53.360> a<00:03:54.290> little<00:03:55.540> actually<00:03:56.540> better<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:57.200> show

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
well a little actually better to show

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.440 
well a little actually better to show
you<00:03:58.060> yeah<00:04:00.220> things<00:04:01.220> they're<00:04:01.820> not<00:04:01.940> bad<00:04:02.209> oh

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450

you yeah things they're not bad oh
speaking<00:04:03.290> of<00:04:03.890> weird<00:04:04.850> shiny<00:04:05.180> stuff<00:04:05.510> here's<00:04:05.720> my

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
speaking of weird shiny stuff here's my

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.400 
speaking of weird shiny stuff here's my
weird<00:04:06.350> Chinese

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.850 

p3<00:04:10.480> controller<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:11.930> actually<00:04:12.290> DualShock<00:04:12.830> 3

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
p3 controller it's actually DualShock 3

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.720 
p3 controller it's actually DualShock 3
it<00:04:13.580> has<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.790> weird<00:04:14.180> ass<00:04:14.420> buttons<00:04:14.960> and<00:04:15.830> it

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
it has a weird ass buttons and it

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.790 
it has a weird ass buttons and it
actually<00:04:17.330> works<00:04:17.570> really<00:04:17.720> nice<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.440> only

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 
actually works really nice the only

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.729 
actually works really nice the only
thing<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.280> weird<00:04:19.610> is<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.690> analog<00:04:21.050> feel<00:04:21.380> nice

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
thing is weird is the analog feel nice

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.250 
thing is weird is the analog feel nice
everything<00:04:22.160> feels<00:04:22.550> nice<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.180> M<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.840> analog

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
everything feels nice the M the analog

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.790 
everything feels nice the M the analog
is<00:04:24.670> um<00:04:25.670> has<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.330> really<00:04:26.810> big<00:04:26.990> dead<00:04:27.230> spot<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:27.770> you

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
is um has a really big dead spot so you

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.380 
is um has a really big dead spot so you
would<00:04:28.040> go<00:04:28.130> up<00:04:28.160> here<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.760> would<00:04:28.880> turn<00:04:29.060> and

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
would go up here and you would turn and

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.750 
would go up here and you would turn and
it<00:04:29.480> would<00:04:29.710> like<00:04:30.710> let's<00:04:30.920> say<00:04:31.040> there's<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.310> radial

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
it would like let's say there's a radial

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.970 
it would like let's say there's a radial
dial<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:33.110> would<00:04:33.230> go<00:04:33.350> up<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.860> would

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
dial and you would go up and you would

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.200 
dial and you would go up and you would
turn<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.460> right<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.850> there<00:04:34.970> would<00:04:35.090> go

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
turn to the right and there would go

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.300 
turn to the right and there would go
only<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:35.600> little<00:04:35.780> bit<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.290> then<00:04:36.890> when<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.160> get

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
only a little bit and then when you get

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.420 
only a little bit and then when you get
right<00:04:37.820> down<00:04:38.030> here<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.480> goes<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.950> upper

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
right down here it goes to the upper

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.340 
right down here it goes to the upper
right<00:04:40.610> diagonal<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.210> it's<00:04:41.360> almost<00:04:41.540> digital

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
right diagonal so it's almost digital

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.600 
right diagonal so it's almost digital
and<00:04:43.600> actually<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:45.740> really<00:04:46.190> sucks<00:04:46.490> for

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
and actually that really sucks for

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.640 
and actually that really sucks for
first-person<00:04:47.210> shooters<00:04:47.570> this<00:04:48.080> is<00:04:48.260> not<00:04:48.440> good

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
first-person shooters this is not good

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.230 
first-person shooters this is not good
for<00:04:48.680> FPS<00:04:49.100> but<00:04:50.620> this<00:04:51.620> was<00:04:51.800> like<00:04:52.010> 11<00:04:52.520> dollars<00:04:52.700> and

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
for FPS but this was like 11 dollars and

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.450 
for FPS but this was like 11 dollars and
this<00:04:53.840> would<00:04:54.050> be<00:04:54.200> excellent<00:04:54.860> for<00:04:55.130> fighting

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
this would be excellent for fighting

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.060 
this would be excellent for fighting
games<00:04:55.490> because<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.150> huge<00:04:56.450> dead<00:04:56.750> zones

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
games because of the huge dead zones

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.490 
games because of the huge dead zones
it's<00:04:58.070> more<00:04:58.400> digital<00:04:58.760> so<00:04:58.940> you<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.810> can<00:04:59.840> perform

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
it's more digital so you you can perform

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.780 
it's more digital so you you can perform
moves<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.730> lot<00:05:02.030> better<00:05:02.330> because<00:05:03.550> it's<00:05:04.550> not

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
moves a lot better because it's not

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.180 
moves a lot better because it's not
constantly<00:05:05.570> registering<00:05:06.170> directions<00:05:07.010> it's

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
constantly registering directions it's

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.580 
constantly registering directions it's
just<00:05:07.490> it's<00:05:08.150> almost<00:05:08.300> just<00:05:08.750> eight<00:05:09.410> directions

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
just it's almost just eight directions

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.750 
just it's almost just eight directions
with<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.070> little<00:05:10.370> bit<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.490> leeway<00:05:10.730> so<00:05:12.370> yes<00:05:13.370> I

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
with a little bit of leeway so yes I

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.470 
with a little bit of leeway so yes I
will<00:05:14.420> be<00:05:15.190> doing<00:05:16.190> a<00:05:16.280> video<00:05:16.460> probably<00:05:17.300> a

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
will be doing a video probably a

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.850 
will be doing a video probably a
separate<00:05:17.900> video<00:05:18.020> since<00:05:18.350> this<00:05:18.470> has<00:05:18.620> gone<00:05:18.800> on

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
separate video since this has gone on

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.830 
separate video since this has gone on
for<00:05:19.130> five<00:05:19.340> minutes<00:05:19.550> I'll<00:05:20.270> be<00:05:20.510> doing<00:05:20.780> a

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
for five minutes I'll be doing a

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.780 
for five minutes I'll be doing a
separate<00:05:21.200> video<00:05:21.410> of<00:05:21.890> me<00:05:22.070> testing<00:05:22.580> this<00:05:22.730> thing

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
separate video of me testing this thing

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.060 
separate video of me testing this thing
out<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.890> a<00:05:24.890> couple<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.460> ps3<00:05:26.000> games<00:05:26.740> so<00:05:27.740> look

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
out on a couple of ps3 games so look

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.830 
out on a couple of ps3 games so look
forward<00:05:28.400> to<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:30.160> and<00:05:31.160> there's<00:05:31.370> all<00:05:31.580> my

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
forward to that and there's all my

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.340 
forward to that and there's all my
systems<00:05:34.330> weird<00:05:35.330> stuff<00:05:35.630> flying<00:05:35.840> about<00:05:36.110> so

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
systems weird stuff flying about so

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.950 
systems weird stuff flying about so
there<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:36.590> go<00:05:38.140> I'm<00:05:39.140> a<00:05:40.030> I'm<00:05:41.030> a<00:05:41.210> try<00:05:41.420> the<00:05:41.480> ps2

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
there you go I'm a I'm a try the ps2

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.660 
there you go I'm a I'm a try the ps2
controller<00:05:42.140> in<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.500> ps3<00:05:42.920> because<00:05:43.280> ps2

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
controller in the ps3 because ps2

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.880 
controller in the ps3 because ps2
controllers<00:05:44.090> are<00:05:44.210> nice<00:05:44.540> I<00:05:44.900> may<00:05:45.440> get<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.620> really

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
controllers are nice I may get a really

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.800 
controllers are nice I may get a really
nice<00:05:46.100> ps2<00:05:46.640> controller<00:05:46.820> just<00:05:47.180> use<00:05:47.480> of<00:05:47.660> that

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
nice ps2 controller just use of that

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.650 
nice ps2 controller just use of that
instead<00:05:48.410> I<00:05:49.400> think<00:05:50.000> those<00:05:50.300> are<00:05:50.510> actually

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
instead I think those are actually

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.700 
instead I think those are actually
better<00:05:51.170> than<00:05:51.500> some<00:05:51.830> ps3<00:05:52.250> controllers<00:05:53.650> and<00:05:54.650> the

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
better than some ps3 controllers and the

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.030 
better than some ps3 controllers and the
360<00:05:55.130> controller<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.850> ps3<00:05:56.060> amps<00:05:56.510> if<00:05:57.320> that

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
360 controller and ps3 amps if that

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.810 
360 controller and ps3 amps if that
works<00:05:58.460> well<00:05:58.910> that<00:05:59.300> is<00:06:00.250> totally<00:06:01.250> cheating<00:06:01.730> and

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
works well that is totally cheating and

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.880 
works well that is totally cheating and
I'm<00:06:01.910> going<00:06:02.240> to<00:06:02.360> be<00:06:02.480> using<00:06:02.840> that<00:06:03.020> on<00:06:03.200> dust<00:06:03.500> and

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
I'm going to be using that on dust and

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.490 
I'm going to be using that on dust and
see<00:06:04.580> how<00:06:04.730> well<00:06:04.970> that<00:06:05.000> like<00:06:05.300> dust<00:06:05.570> for<00:06:06.320> one

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
see how well that like dust for one

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.020 
see how well that like dust for one
three<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:06.950> just<00:06:07.100> totally<00:06:07.490> read<00:06:07.700> people

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
three and just totally read people

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.390 
three and just totally read people
because<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.420> 360<00:06:08.930> controller<00:06:09.020> is<00:06:09.590> much

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
because the 360 controller is much

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.020 
because the 360 controller is much
better<00:06:11.230> this<00:06:12.230> is<00:06:12.410> my<00:06:12.560> halo<00:06:12.860> 4<00:06:13.130> controller<00:06:13.790> with

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
better this is my halo 4 controller with

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.780 
better this is my halo 4 controller with
a<00:06:14.060> silicon<00:06:14.510> thing<00:06:14.780> on<00:06:14.930> here<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.310> I<00:06:16.310> replaced

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
a silicon thing on here and I replaced

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.340 
a silicon thing on here and I replaced
the<00:06:16.970> back<00:06:17.120> of<00:06:17.300> it<00:06:17.450> because<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:17.870> back<00:06:18.020> broke

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
the back of it because the back broke

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.370 
the back of it because the back broke
and<00:06:18.740> I<00:06:19.460> replaced<00:06:20.000> the<00:06:20.300> thumb<00:06:20.780> stick<00:06:21.050> with

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
and I replaced the thumb stick with

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.160 
and I replaced the thumb stick with
clear<00:06:22.160> thumb<00:06:22.460> stick

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
clear thumb stick

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.510 
clear thumb stick
those<00:06:24.170> might<00:06:25.040> as<00:06:25.130> well<00:06:25.250> do<00:06:25.400> a<00:06:25.430> little

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
those might as well do a little

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.380 
those might as well do a little
show-and-tell<00:06:27.340> here's<00:06:28.340> my<00:06:28.640> custom

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
show-and-tell here's my custom

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.010 
show-and-tell here's my custom
controller<00:06:29.840> I<00:06:29.930> did<00:06:30.730> it<00:06:31.730> it<00:06:32.600> said<00:06:32.810> the<00:06:32.840> old

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
controller I did it it said the old

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.750 
controller I did it it said the old
controller<00:06:33.380> I<00:06:33.470> just<00:06:33.770> kind<00:06:33.920> of<00:06:33.980> remodel<00:06:34.370> I

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
controller I just kind of remodel I

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:42.070 
controller I just kind of remodel I
guess<00:06:35.090> with<00:06:35.420> a<00:06:36.100> clear<00:06:39.970> unclear<00:06:40.970> shell<00:06:41.510> has<00:06:42.050> a

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
guess with a clear unclear shell has a

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.560 
guess with a clear unclear shell has a
really<00:06:42.710> crappy<00:06:43.010> d-pad<00:06:43.490> on<00:06:43.520> it<00:06:43.820> I<00:06:43.910> do<00:06:43.970> not<00:06:44.210> use

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
really crappy d-pad on it I do not use

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.990 
really crappy d-pad on it I do not use
these<00:06:44.810> things<00:06:44.990> anymore<00:06:45.760> but<00:06:46.760> it's<00:06:46.880> really

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
these things anymore but it's really

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.020 
these things anymore but it's really
cool<00:06:47.180> to<00:06:47.360> have<00:06:47.450> around<00:06:47.690> I<00:06:48.340> only<00:06:49.340> use<00:06:49.580> the<00:06:49.820> ones

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
cool to have around I only use the ones

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.980 
cool to have around I only use the ones
with<00:06:50.240> the<00:06:50.270> transforming<00:06:50.900> d-pad<00:06:52.630> this<00:06:53.630> I<00:06:53.810> use

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990
