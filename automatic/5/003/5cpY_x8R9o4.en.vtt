00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 yes that's actually happening samsung 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.339
 introduced the new galaxy note 5 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.930
 unfortunately does not come first 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.519
 Germany, of course, we'll take a look 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.210
 despite man is a pretty cool 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.890
 smartphone so that 905 57 inches 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800
 The housing is a little smaller than the case 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.439
 predecessor the display triggers in ketch the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.640
 on should be so super sharp again 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.920
 you can also see it here directly 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.590
 we have a pre-production model here 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.090
 hands-on means this is not here yet 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.700
 everything final software and hardware 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.550
 But it's already working 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.110
 liquid the sp named pin of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.120
 emergency, of course, also optimized 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.540
 But the most important new feature is that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.789
 He might shoot out so much 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.570
 easier to handle 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.670
 Of course we have one again 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.700
 homebutton and we have and that is so 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.219
 a small design feature at note 5 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.000
 a slightly curved glassy one 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.670
 back 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.859
 You can see that from profile right here 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.570
 nice that samsung thought here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.100
 how could you do such a xxl 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.400
 smartphone a bit more handy 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.040
 shape and accordingly the back 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.540
 one has also noticed directly 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.979
 if you hold it in your hand he lies 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.729
 a little bit more natural 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.340
 I still want to contribute that 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.689
 I can imagine difficult 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.840
 at the camera if you look around here 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.330
 There was very little done 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.619
 according to the keynote we have the best 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.810
 image stabilizer and otherwise 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.310
 continue megapixel and lightning in 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.229
 same design 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.600
 I betray nothing about the process 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.720
 but we have a modern one again 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.630
 exactly accor similar to the galaxy s 6 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.039
 and of course he supports lte 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.289
 up to category 9 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.270
 Samsung attaches great importance to this 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.289
 Of course, again on the battery and 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.360
 we do not just have one this time 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.979
 big battery is connected by cable 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.579
 is fast load but also by 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.000
 induction 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:03.789
 because inductive almost charge that is 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.950
 now the big thing at 0 5 and should 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.509
 it is thus confused even without cables 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.739
 namely just by lying on 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.739
 a surface load faster
