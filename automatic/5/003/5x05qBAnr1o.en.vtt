00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.990
 seeing how all there warner and gameplay and 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 gums and other strong gaming world 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.830
 this one diligently let out on one and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.440
 same engine a bunch of games in which 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.060
 only the scenery company glu changes 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 no exception 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.619
 having such things behind me 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.990
 contract killers robocop recently 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.079
 gash shooter for the second world war 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.759
 frontline commando and in addition encroached 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.279
 on saint and added to her 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.349
 terminator track record which 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.369
 much more interesting for us 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.830
 seen enough 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.880
 already with might and main as the bravo fought the Americans in 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.370
 forties 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.720
 and the feeling is that besides them there 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.880
 no one fought at all 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.040
 but we will bypass this heresy with a side and 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.650
 go to the near future where under 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.940
 led by the conor himself 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.880
 let's go save humanity from 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.440
 ill-fated skyneta channel filed of 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.820
 presents a video review of the game and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 terminator genesis harsh whether john i'm not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.620
 in vain in the introduction made a digression to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.170
 other games of the company because they are all ardent 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.909
 representatives of the genre shooting gallery and this time 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.789
 exception did not happen too 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.420
 what are the advantages of the genre on the mobile convenient 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.939
 shoot 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.159
 This is definitely what the disadvantages are losing 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.590
 count most of the game by location 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.929
 Persian moves himself places themselves 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.539
 a candle through the card, that is, except shooting 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.399
 there is not enough fun for us to play 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.229
 unless of course this shoot 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.819
 cool sketches stunning 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.389
 the picture then it looks all of course 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.950
 cool but annoying damn fast I'm 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:34.139
 I know only one playable 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.969
 cheese subgenre is sniper topics 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.799
 here actually on the drum 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.380
 movement important to correctly aim 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.060
 breathless contract killer on this 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.670
 great leaves however as 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 terminator when missions are comfortable passing 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 With a sniper in hand or the same 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.240
 mission mean play only 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.579
 sniper but here's a machine gun or 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.689
 send to iron hail / from shotgun 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.700
 there is a completely different topic and so 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.070
 imperceptibly to ourselves we found out 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.290
 Achilles heel of the game 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.570
 Minato in general as the previous series 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.450
 company games in related format this 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.880
 neutered with gameplay yes you shoot 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.790
 it's up to you the story is told but the gameplay 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.040
 somehow past you alas leaves and this is a shooting range 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.230
 there is it but let's intently and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.630
 look at what is in the game 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.750
 not really a bad storyline 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.850
 will you start escaping from captivity finish well 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.010
 the date by the conor himself is definitely not 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.350
 relive the main goal finish 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.660
 finally this war whose history is known 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.420
 all the good stuff film keter this yet 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.640
 even more immersion in the plot help 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.300
 scripted scenes various screensavers 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.250
 least play 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.470
 Yes, and in general, the graphics here are on top 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.200
 level but you can understand us 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.270
 deliberately clamped into frames of scenes and from 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.730
 drawing these very scenes is not 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.040
 work here you sorry not open world in 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.380
 toilet visuals special effects 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.239
 different and be not in with the visual side 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.739
 in short for this game you can absolutely not 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.200
 worry others what 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.269
 performance and that's it 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.120
 virtues unfortunately end 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.680
 we can say that on the plot appearance 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.810
 the game leaves after all 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.660
 long training will send you 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.140
 do the same thing over many 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.299
 o'clock 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.220
 the game is divided into zones in each of 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.799
 which several missions usually 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.350
 different then at the time of war and with a sniper 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.019
 cover then just destroy and at the same time 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.910
 only the decorations change even 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.610
 Diversity of enemies do not have to wait 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.220
 Brighten up the picture a little 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.049
 purchasing upgrades and changing weapons each 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.090
 trunk we can improve on several 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.220
 indicators and during the battle to not 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.829
 wait for recharge quickly change it and 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.930
 continue to fire however for each 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.420
 specific game situation one way or another 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.700
 the weapon will be better and generally cooler 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.560
 just different gadgets like a bomb 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.900
 pulsed rocket discharges which 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.790
 safely bought for donat immediately 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.459
 sets guarantees us comfortable and 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.130
 the passage of this creation but it 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.380
 OK, we'll understand and forgive, but how 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.010
 forgive another mockery of 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.670
 by the players 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.010
 not only that tutu.ru 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.560
 over short as yet for each set 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.750
 guzzle energy which of course gives 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.190
 goals with time or with a level or 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.139
 further you know troubles very difficult 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.700
 to sum up this game I will not 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.769
 dissemble if I say that I am very 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.600
 I liked to fight here with a sniper 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.160
 on the other side of the corner there is a simulator 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.440
 hunt there this moment of shooting 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.540
 implemented more interesting and simple 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.139
 passing levels on the rampage with a gun 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.840
 at the ready 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.120
 This is the same type of dullness that do not deliver 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.370
 no pleasure here probably on 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.550
 lover if you like kira 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.620
 terminator will go bang if not then not 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.080
 I recommend to try but it is pure 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.300
 subjective opinion beautifully filed 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.490
 but this is only the gloss of the fans of the series 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.950
 I won't find anything for myself here either 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.470
 the plot though is but do not expect from it 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.110
 twists and turns only out of respect for the film and 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.690
 Attempts to reanimate the topic 5 points from 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.510
 Seven seems to me a terminator on sega 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.729
 much more interesting she sim was all with you 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.990
 Kinat see and our other videos on 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.990
 channel see you soon
