00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
and because I am maybe I'm not sure if I

want to I want to go a little bit high

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.479 
want to I want to go a little bit high
in<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.970> trophy<00:03:21.299> count<00:03:21.950> because<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.010> don't<00:03:23.250> not

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
in the trophy count because I don't not

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.810 
in the trophy count because I don't not
sure<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.209> have<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.750> put<00:03:25.370> this<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.610> good

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
sure if I have to put this is good

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.580 
sure if I have to put this is good
everything<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.269> do<00:03:27.420> so<00:03:27.540> all<00:03:27.690> those<00:03:27.810> only<00:03:28.049> 14

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
everything to do so all those only 14

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.069 
everything to do so all those only 14
trophies<00:03:28.799> it's<00:03:29.220> say<00:03:29.459> it's<00:03:30.030> better<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.420> win<00:03:30.570> 14

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
trophies it's say it's better to win 14

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.120 
trophies it's say it's better to win 14
then<00:03:31.260> lose<00:03:31.470> 23<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.310> guess<00:03:32.610> so<00:03:33.239> also<00:03:34.200> level<00:03:34.440> up<00:03:34.530> 29

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
then lose 23 I guess so also level up 29

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.870 
then lose 23 I guess so also level up 29
that's<00:03:35.160> nice<00:03:35.579> we<00:03:36.269> are<00:03:36.450> close<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:38.549> getting

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
that's nice we are close to to getting

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.430 
that's nice we are close to to getting
the<00:03:39.180> fifty<00:03:39.540> percent<00:03:39.780> as<00:03:39.900> well<00:03:40.049> but<00:03:40.170> we<00:03:40.290> still

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
the fifty percent as well but we still

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.890 
the fifty percent as well but we still
need<00:03:40.500> some<00:03:40.799> resources<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:42.000> want<00:03:42.540> them<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.780> go

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
need some resources so I want them to go

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.449 
need some resources so I want them to go
to<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.140> gold<00:03:43.440> storage<00:03:43.860> but<00:03:44.130> they<00:03:44.250> are<00:03:44.310> not

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
to the gold storage but they are not

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.350 
to the gold storage but they are not
going<00:03:44.700> down

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
going down

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.360 
going down
I<00:03:46.480> wanted<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.230> go<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.410> go<00:03:47.680> story<00:03:47.950> they<00:03:48.100> will<00:03:48.220> go

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
I wanted to go to go story they will go

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.220 
I wanted to go to go story they will go
to<00:03:48.400> go<00:03:48.820> so<00:03:49.000> which<00:03:49.120> offers<00:03:49.450> at<00:03:49.630> least<00:03:49.780> collector

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
to go so which offers at least collector

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.150 
to go so which offers at least collector
I<00:03:50.380> guess<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:51.610> there<00:03:51.850> they<00:03:52.000> go<00:03:52.590> got<00:03:53.590> some<00:03:53.830> arches

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
I guess so there they go got some arches

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.890 
I guess so there they go got some arches
on<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.400> inside<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:54.970> they're<00:03:55.570> all<00:03:55.720> being

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
on the inside and they're all being

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.060 
on the inside and they're all being
