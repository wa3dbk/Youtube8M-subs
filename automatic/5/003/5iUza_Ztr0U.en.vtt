00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 I will tell you about my method 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.960
 personal blow- dry doubs then 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.340
 Normally what I do after I 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.200
 wash the hair I dry them at 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.269
 hair dryer and I want 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.670
 curls or something smooth I 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.650
 take my straightener to mow hd and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.619
 here I go clear dishes there is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.410
 happy it works great except that even the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.570
 best straightener in the world is too hot 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 for hair and that age and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.630
 spikes a little damaged by dint of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.240
 do that so I found a solution 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.859
 I alternate with my jug technique 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 China that I call the blow - dry of where 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 so less heat more protection 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.399
 so certainly for loops it's a 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 little bit more complicated but precisely 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.590
 when I want lily it is perfect the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.329
 first step of my soft brushing and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 the protection that I start with 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.610
 keyyo plouffe blood rail express premium 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.530
 redken hours that also applies 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.219
 well on dry hair than in their 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.649
 wet hair 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.570
 because there is no precise humidity 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.969
 to do this a beautiful blow-dry 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.600
 so we spread all over the hair 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.309
 it will protect from the heat and it's going 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 facilitate blow drying the second step 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.900
 to stand of the good product that is a small 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.970
 a little less hot franck a straightener it is 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.880
 this is the heating brush of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.049
 philips called procare shine 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.939
 so she has been around since the year 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.280
 last in pro caire quite short there they 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.229
 have added small accessories with 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.509
 ceramide and inuh ion balance 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.340
 like that the hair is even more 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.990
 shiny and softer you have 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.640
 several month accessories for a 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.380
 blow dry I just use the brush 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.150
 heating and after I'm going to decorate 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.680
 a little bit you'll see so here I 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.119
 I just dried my hair and I 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 what I call home then you 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 go laugh for a lot for me 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.740
 it's the key so that is to say that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.960
 I have volume in some places but 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.430
 not to others that it leaves in a sense 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.630
 it goes in the other loop could 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.640
 go out like that I know there are some 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.380
 tufts more imposing aerial but 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.360
 I do not like it because I do not like it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 very beautiful not well shaped it varies 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.729
 no there is frizzy hair that 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.100
 leave 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.430
 I do not like so I turn on my little 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.250
 brush procare buns and I'm going to 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.620
 simply styling with caused a 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.060
 normal brush actually 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.670
 except that you'll see it's really going 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 very smooth and well put in shape and that 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.180
 will blow a blow without having a 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.680
 crazy heat it's a heat of a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.990
 in his hair what is largely 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.820
 lower by the heat of a straightener the 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.260
 second stage is usually completed 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.060
 when I'm in a hurry I stop there 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.640
 because I find it very smooth well 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.740
 shiny there is more the aspect all fouta of the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.620
 volume there not the form in short it's a 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.030
 little homogeneous as I like but if you 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.050
 want it to be really perfect see 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.000
 that my spikes 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.140
 we can we can ignore we can give 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.850
 of movement if we want 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.890
 I like it from time to time when 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.080
 so there is some that we do we took this 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.910
 little accessory I push up the kidnaps and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.620
 I just warm it up I take it 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.030
 with the fingers it does not burn me and I 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.580
 take that brush then what 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.700
 I like it that watching 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.680
 pimples so you can make yourself an iron to 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.750
 curl soft because it heats 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.460
 always less to make a bouquet 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.690
 normal so the same as the other you 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.810
 clip and it holds 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.260
 and you put to heat and there we can do 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.260
 peaks 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.320
 gillis and I made my little point you 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.250
 see I gave a little movement 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.400
 it's not wrong but here are these headdresses and 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.200
 I finish with a little mist 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.820
 frustrating to give a little bit of 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.030
 brilliant now that was happening some 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.950
 very beautiful thing very American all 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.740
 the day and it comes to us so 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:57.730
 is called the cat in flash +30 mist 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:04:00.580
 rekem and so here is the final blow dry 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.890
 so that's the method I use in 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.000
 alternating with my classic brushing 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.620
 which remains effective which remains great but 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.360
 a bit aggressive for the hair 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.600
 there it remains a blow dry 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.430
 it's always a good result I know 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.570
 for curly hair that thing 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.400
 will not work so that's why 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.870
 I call it a beautiful xingdou at the same 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.280
 time is for girls who have a 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.410
 nature of hair that lend themselves to it 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.690
 but here it is softer and less 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.520
 hot for the hair and we come to 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.930
 preserve a little bit it's tip so 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.640
 alternately I think it's a 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.010
 very good solution so I you 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.500
 recalls the three important things one 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.630
 finally has the protection with pilot claude 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.820
 rail express premium hours for the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.600
 styling it's the blower brush 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.580
 croker shine new version of 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.580
 philips and finally for the chan 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.870
 in the end it's the cat in flash haze 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.230
 +32 redken and ben voila and go now 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.230
 It's your turn
