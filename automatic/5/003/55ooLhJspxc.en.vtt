00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.500
 the tool they are looking at is the 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.110
 combat cuqui the key but was a 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.590
 tool launched a year ago and is 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.900
 a cuc read apparently oriented to 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.840
 military market the sheet has a thickness 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.960
 of 4.6 millimeters why is it 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.760
 maybe the lightest of its kind among 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.980
 the particular characteristics of this 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.710
 covers this in which they have endowed 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.540
 a guard that is a very characteristic 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.320
 own of combat knives 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.530
 they kept designing the handle of it 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.050
 make 2 a weight as light as 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.080
 they just saw and in the design of the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.080
 general sheet catches my attention that 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.710
 although it has the fall of the cuqui 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.380
 the tip remains almost aligned with 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.100
 the axis therefore even though it is a 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.939
 covers is useful to press which is 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.549
 supports in the guard that allows to move away 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.200
 edge hand in the pulsed work 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.210
 between the particular things of this 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.409
 car and I think it's the only one 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.520
 all that press 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.189
 what is useful to turn it into a spear 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.770
 It has a particularity that I like and 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.490
 is that although it has very little 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.609
 fall they kept the cuckoo's shoulder what 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.469
 which is very useful for hitting and 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.840
 use it for the most 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.490
 traditional in the field although the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.179
 combat techniques of the burkas 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.310
 advocaat putting just one blow on the 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.280
 head of the opponent and move on 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.770
 modern combat techniques 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.590
 propose using the cuqui as a 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.079
 knife cutting and not cutting 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.390
 simply by the speed of the 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.599
 tool thing that is cookie can 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.719
 do with a lot of versatility because 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:09.200
 that the contact surface with the 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:11.750
 objective is curved on the edge what 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.280
 makes perfect to cut unlike 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.769
 of most cutris that I've 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.569
 presented the cover with which the 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.629
 meet the fight I was going is 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.120
 quite respectable has a surface 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.350
 of mole to use it on the platform 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.740
 is 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.620
 and it has a rigid insert inside 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.440
 to preserve the aesthetic integrity 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.900
 of the knife of course is a cover 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.400
 hanging and grabbing with relative 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.830
 knife safety I think that 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.870
 undoubtedly the combat cuqui of 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.450
 caiber compared to other knives 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.080
 combat has better benefits 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.200
 with greater length of sheet and a balance 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.540
 that allows a spectrum of use a lot 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.370
 wider than the other knives of 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.620
 combat though and I do not think 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.080
 wrong is short enough 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.960
 compared to other cookies of 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.690
 combat the cooklin and kmart combat is a 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.610
 addition more to the great comparison of 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.090
 cookies that I am prepared many 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.090
 Thank you
