a<00:00:19.350> little<00:00:19.500> chat<00:00:19.770> about<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> direction<00:00:20.369> is

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
a little chat about the direction is

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.490 
a little chat about the direction is
going<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.270> if<00:00:21.420> you're<00:00:21.779> somehow<00:00:21.990> watching<00:00:22.410> this

i start a new separate account for
season<00:00:57.120> 3<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.570> season<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.530> use<00:00:58.680> my

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
season 3 in season two I just use my

normal xbox account which worked fine by

could<00:01:01.350> create<00:01:01.680> problems<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.160> some<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
could create problems for some of the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
could create problems for some of the
other<00:01:02.789> potential<00:01:03.239> changes<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.809> example<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
other potential changes for example if I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
other potential changes for example if I
stipulated<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.369> match<00:01:05.610> coins<00:01:05.939> could<00:01:06.150> be

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
stipulated that match coins could be

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.969 
stipulated that match coins could be
used<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> buy<00:01:06.689> packs<00:01:07.020> I'd<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> hard<00:01:07.799> time

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
used to buy packs I'd have a hard time

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950 
used to buy packs I'd have a hard time
separating<00:01:08.250> free<00:01:08.909> pack<00:01:09.119> project<00:01:09.479> match<00:01:09.630> coins

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
separating free pack project match coins

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.660 
separating free pack project match coins
out<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.439> own<00:01:10.590> match<00:01:10.860> point<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
out from my own match point right so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.429 
out from my own match point right so
maybe<00:01:12.090> having<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> separate<00:01:12.840> account<00:01:12.900> would<00:01:13.260> be

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
maybe having a separate account would be

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
maybe having a separate account would be
a<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.770> idea<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.340> maybe<00:01:14.430> bringing<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
a good idea or maybe bringing the use of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
a good idea or maybe bringing the use of
coins<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:15.750> things<00:01:16.020> over<00:01:16.320> complicate<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
coins into things over complicate and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.010 
coins into things over complicate and
kind<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.220> negates<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.850> free<00:01:18.240> part<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
kind of negates the free part of the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.690 
kind of negates the free part of the
name<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.560> problem<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.070> would<00:01:20.280> still<00:01:20.520> have

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
name the problem is I would still have

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.130 
name the problem is I would still have
my<00:01:20.880> own<00:01:21.030> account<00:01:21.360> which<00:01:21.600> would<00:01:21.780> still<00:01:21.990> have

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
my own account which would still have

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
my own account which would still have
free<00:01:22.350> packs<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.920> each<00:01:23.070> week<00:01:23.310> I'd<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.580> opening

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
contracts and fitness items and so on

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.520 
contracts and fitness items and so on
again<00:02:51.580> I'm<00:02:51.790> not<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.270> massive<00:02:52.720> fan<00:02:52.990> of<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.320> idea

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
again I'm not a massive fan of this idea

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.170 
again I'm not a massive fan of this idea
because<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.340> think<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.610> just<00:02:54.640> probably

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
because it just I think it just probably

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.120 
because it just I think it just probably
just<00:02:55.510> gets<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.900> way<00:02:55.990> but<00:02:56.530> it's<00:02:56.980> been

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
just gets in the way but it's been

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.400 
just gets in the way but it's been
mentioned<00:02:57.340> before<00:02:57.550> lastly<00:02:58.390> loan<00:02:58.690> players<00:02:59.080> now

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
mentioned before lastly loan players now

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.020 
mentioned before lastly loan players now
I<00:02:59.620> made<00:02:59.920> use<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.340> loan<00:03:00.460> players<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.910> EA

I made use of the loan players that EA

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the super deluxe edition I think of some

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
legends to get us off to a strong start

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.490 
legends to get us off to a strong start
but<00:03:09.820> what<00:03:10.120> about<00:03:10.450> players<00:03:10.720> from<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.050> catalog

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
but what about players from the catalog

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.290 
but what about players from the catalog
if<00:03:11.680> someone<00:03:12.220> appeared<00:03:12.550> in<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.790> EA<00:03:12.940> sports

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
seasoned fries probably not that far off

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.449 
seasoned fries probably not that far off
if<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.350> have<00:03:23.500> any<00:03:23.680> others<00:03:23.980> please<00:03:24.010> let<00:03:24.370> me

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.870 
know in the comments in my head right
now<00:03:26.110> I'm<00:03:26.530> thinking<00:03:26.800> of<00:03:27.100> keeping<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.670> series

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
now I'm thinking of keeping the series

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.850 
now I'm thinking of keeping the series
on<00:03:28.209> my<00:03:28.390> own<00:03:28.630> account<00:03:29.020> because<00:03:29.380> I'd<00:03:29.500> find<00:03:29.770> it

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
on my own account because I'd find it

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.560 
on my own account because I'd find it
annoying<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.489> open<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.910> good<00:03:31.030> player<00:03:31.270> on<00:03:31.450> my

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
annoying to open a good player on my

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.090 
annoying to open a good player on my
personal<00:03:31.989> account<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.380> they're<00:03:32.470> not<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
personal account and they're not the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.680 
personal account and they're not the
free<00:03:33.310> pet<00:03:33.489> project<00:03:33.790> account<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.209> vice<00:03:34.390> versa

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
free pet project account and vice versa

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.479 
free pet project account and vice versa
so<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.200> also<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:35.680> want<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:36.070> keep<00:03:36.190> things

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
so I also just want to keep things

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.699 
so I also just want to keep things
simple<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.239> was<00:03:37.450> gonna<00:03:37.600> just<00:03:37.959> play<00:03:38.230> seasons

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
simple so I was gonna just play seasons

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.350 
simple so I was gonna just play seasons
as<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:38.980> allows<00:03:39.160> me<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.489> track<00:03:39.700> progress<00:03:39.910> very

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
as it allows me to track progress very

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.360 
as it allows me to track progress very
very<00:03:40.690> easily<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.590> think<00:03:41.800> loan<00:03:41.950> players<00:03:42.190> are

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
very easily and I think loan players are

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.520 
very easily and I think loan players are
cool<00:03:42.580> but<00:03:42.940> actually<00:03:43.660> buying<00:03:43.930> players<00:03:44.230> might

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
cool but actually buying players might

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.590 
cool but actually buying players might
be<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> bit<00:03:44.890> too<00:03:45.130> much<00:03:45.370> as<00:03:45.610> we<00:03:46.000> were<00:03:46.060> discarding

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
be a bit too much as we were discarding

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.690 
be a bit too much as we were discarding
etc<00:03:47.170> our<00:03:47.290> last<00:03:47.769> season<00:03:48.070> worked<00:03:48.250> well<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:48.670> I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
etc our last season worked well and I

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.610 
etc our last season worked well and I
think<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:49.060> may<00:03:49.300> be<00:03:49.360> partly<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.200> because<00:03:50.320> of

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
think I may be partly just because of

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.620 
think I may be partly just because of
the<00:03:50.650> simplicity<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.970> don't<00:03:52.420> want<00:03:52.540> to

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
the simplicity of it so I don't want to

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.810 
the simplicity of it so I don't want to
stray<00:03:52.959> too<00:03:52.989> far<00:03:53.320> from<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.890> format<00:03:54.430> but<00:03:54.580> we<00:03:54.700> do

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
stray too far from that format but we do

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.310 
stray too far from that format but we do
need<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.030> mix<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.300> up<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.390> bit<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.110> I'm<00:03:56.290> thinking

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
need to mix it up a bit so I'm thinking

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.190 
need to mix it up a bit so I'm thinking
keep<00:03:57.130> it<00:03:57.250> on<00:03:57.340> my<00:03:57.519> account<00:03:57.690> seasons<00:03:58.690> only<00:03:58.870> to

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
keep it on my account seasons only to

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.990 
keep it on my account seasons only to
make<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.470> easy<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.890> track<00:04:00.100> progress<00:04:00.340> keep<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
make it easy to track progress keep the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.850 
make it easy to track progress keep the
season<00:04:01.360> bonuses<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.900> spend<00:04:02.140> on<00:04:02.290> packs<00:04:02.500> but<00:04:02.680> not

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
season bonuses to spend on packs but not

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.590 
season bonuses to spend on packs but not
match<00:04:03.010> wins<00:04:03.280> because<00:04:03.400> it's<00:04:03.610> just<00:04:03.670> a<00:04:03.820> bit<00:04:03.940> over

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
match wins because it's just a bit over

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.300 
match wins because it's just a bit over
the<00:04:04.720> top<00:04:04.750> bit<00:04:05.110> too<00:04:05.260> much<00:04:05.380> management<00:04:05.890> just<00:04:06.220> the
