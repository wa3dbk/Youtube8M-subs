00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.509
 popular american blogger justin and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.860
 he gave permission to translate his video 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.960
 comparison of iphone 5s 5 and 5 which was 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:23.850
 translated especially for you by my 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:25.320
 voice go this video was created 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.810
 especially for those who think 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.970
 updated and music terkina 5s or 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.980
 general buyers 5 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.610
 if you have never used an iphone 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.860
 so let's start with and hardware 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 iphone 5s installed 7 processor 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.219
 which is built on 64-bit 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.760
 architecture 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.430
 you iphone 5 and 5 installed a6 processor 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.850
 not a single gigabyte of RAM for everybody 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.850
 iphone 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.010
 the outside will work the fives nothing 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.010
 different has changed only the nest for 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.760
 flashes and the home button and 5 weight as well 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.560
 five made of aluminum case 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.100
 Unibike that is from one whole 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.860
 a piece of aluminum and 5 made from one 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.870
 solid piece of polycarbonate which 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.510
 It is in the hand as cool as 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.410
 aluminum but still it is more sustainable 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.770
 to scratch 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.790
 the weight of the iphone 5s and the top five is 112 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.850
 gram again and is 132 grams 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.590
 which is as much as 20 grams more 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.540
 form factor of all iphone is the same if 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.300
 you look at the different test groups in 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.460
 On the Internet, you will know that iphone 5 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.420
 really more scratch resistant 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.360
 than the aluminum iphone 5s or 5 5 come 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.170
 come to us for a drink and the colors you are blue yellow 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.380
 pink white and green came again with 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.960
 us you are gold and cosmic gray 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.240
 which I really like but now 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.970
 let's compare the test scores of these 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.390
 Three iphone went and the first we will have 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.180
 test 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.430
 geekbench all data specifications 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.310
 phones I voiced you the beginning of the video 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:11.170
 I can only tell you that at 5s and 5c 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.390
 installed aes70 . 1 on iphone 5 7.0 and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.580
 Immediately see that I finished this 5 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.310
 benchmark is twice as fast as his 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.709
 competitor and indicators east tech 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.080
 because they are so great that you 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.480
 iphone was not like this before and it is very 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.000
 big leap even in the system is not 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.160
 felt in principle revealing again 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.940
 and fives they gave me almost 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.269
 the same 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.940
 need to think that the top five do not know faster 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.130
 like you but it seems to me that 5 is faster and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.290
 this confirms the test and which 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.690
 now see on the screen because 5 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.060
 started much faster than the five and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.790
 the next test we will have is the name 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.260
 3dmark I have never seen this test but 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.629
 she is 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.569
 justin and loves him and so let's 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.890
 let's see what the results will be these 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.340
 smartphones in this test 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.489
 3d mark is a test of graphics and we see that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.829
 5s already finished and scored 14 thousand points 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:09.540
 and again and five scored 5 700 points 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.599
 but now we will test the browser 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.209
 Safaris on these three smartphones and 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.060
 let's see how much 5s will be faster than 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.319
 five and 5 and how much better it will be 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.569
 circling page 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.760
 both smartphones are connected to and one and that 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.599
 the same wifi network and click on the icon 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.720
 twitter and we see that we have 5 with a card 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.120
 was foreseen earlier ahead and he 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.340
 loaded for a split second faster 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.379
 not playing a big role now 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.329
 simultaneously fried kung youtube not 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.819
 see that 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.549
 5s loaded earlier and about loaded the page 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.980
 also earlier and now we will run completely 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.829
 unfamiliar to me knox site which 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.680
 booted before of course on 5s and 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.629
 progruzilsya site also earlier and water 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.629
 of course the five came and let's 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.430
 two smartphones simultaneously run 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.739
 google.com and we see that it is not at all 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.319
 traded antique light say boot 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.720
 at 5s anyway a little faster well 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.459
 now nhl site and we see that 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.419
 he loaded up much he 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.269
 faster by 5s we already understand that 5 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.139
 quite a bit over 5 and 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.410
 the top five 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.720
 you test scores you browsers and 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.620
 because we have no reason to continue 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.070
 this test 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.650
 but now compare the camera iphone 5 5s 5c 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.470
 you 5 i blow off the base and the double lady 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.180
 flash and the matrix also expanded to 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.780
 aperture 2.2 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.550
 iphone 5 5 cameras are absolutely identical 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.450
 son of eight like 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.850
 and its recording capabilities in the 1080p train 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.120
 and you see now comparative pictures 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.280
 from the cameras of these three smartphones and me 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.800
 it seems that she again seo photo 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.500
 everything turns out worse because there 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.470
 In general, a lot of white and there is not 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.900
 enough contrast we see that on 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.600
 iphone 5 and iphone 5 photo lightly 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.290
 oiled it again with a big angle 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.530
 review 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.380
 or he took a picture like that but still there 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.650
 photos are much better and much 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.600
 to detail 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.850
 but now we see how iphone 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.410
 5s take clear pictures compared to 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.750
 its competitors 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.510
 but now a small comparative video 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.130
 test and we see that on the iphone 5s much 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.680
 better stabilization than on his 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.150
 competitors that is on the previous iphone 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.150
 5 iphone 5 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.020
 Well, that's all about this test. 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.600
 expected defeated iphone 5s on the second 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.840
 the place is probably all the same iphone 5 because 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.900
 that you are not very cool and resist the body 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.520
 to scratch and last place 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.620
 last year's iphone 5c mist minister 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.450
 let's like also to buy 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.910
 new fan fiction in the clip on advertising if you 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.040
 want and also leave comments 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.380
 soon we will launch a new website which 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.630
 will be very cool I should be throwing 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.090
 a couple of articles and you can read and in 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.700
 group vkontakte and also go to this 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.590
 the site also through was in contact and all 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.920
 good luck and all the while swami was agestar 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.920
 until
