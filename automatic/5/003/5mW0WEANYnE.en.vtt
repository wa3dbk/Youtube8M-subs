00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
mobile devices so we have here the taps

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.749 
mobile devices so we have here the taps
trip<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:13.139> very<00:00:13.290> sittin<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.280> look<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.580> feel

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
is very like pearl for desktop so it's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
is very like pearl for desktop so it's
we've<00:00:17.010> optimized<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:17.850> mobile<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:18.300> very

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
we've optimized it for mobile it's very

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.320 
we've optimized it for mobile it's very
fast<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.170> very<00:00:19.380> slick<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.820> some<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
fast it's very slick the some of the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.720 
fast it's very slick the some of the
other<00:00:21.990> innovations<00:00:22.170> come<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> form<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
other innovations come with the form the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
other innovations come with the form the
form<00:00:24.029> factor<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> phone<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.500> because<00:00:25.800> it's

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
form factor of the phone so because it's

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130 
form factor of the phone so because it's
a<00:00:26.160> smaller<00:00:26.310> screen<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:27.420> approach<00:00:27.689> taps<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
a smaller screen we approach taps a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.570 
a smaller screen we approach taps a
little<00:00:28.349> differently<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.220> actually<00:00:29.340> have

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
little differently so we actually have

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.880 
little differently so we actually have
tabs<00:00:29.820> available<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.230> stack<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.650> cards<00:00:33.890> we
