00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.180
 because chameleons change color 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.130
 the chameleon's chameleon capacity is 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.049
 proverbial its color changes are 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.610
 they find among the metamorphoses more 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.889
 known of how many are made in the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.599
 nature there is no single answer 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.039
 to this question then the changes of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.080
 color that these reptiles experience 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.850
 they are situational and obey 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.920
 different stimuli that have to do 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.869
 with camouflage the regulation of the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.330
 temperature and communication with their 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.460
 similar the first of these causes is 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.470
 the best known the ability to adopt 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.690
 the exact tone of the environment allows the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
 chameleon go unnoticed so much for their 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
 dams as by their predators the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.210
 changes in room temperature too 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.770
 they provoke their color changes on 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.990
 chameleon dresses in dark tones 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 when it's cold to absorb more heat 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.460
 solar and opt for light tones to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.110
 reflect the light and cool the color 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.180
 also fulfills a relationship function 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 social for example to intimidate a 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.110
 enemy showing strident colors 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.970
 as to indicate the heat season 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.980
 passing the females from the dark brown to 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.620
 the orange 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.210
 but how do they get it with some 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.250
 special skin cells that 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.409
 They contain three types of pigments are 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.720
 chromatophores with yellow pigments and 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.880
 red guano forums with guanina 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.409
 crystalline and colorless substance that 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.259
 It reflects the blue light 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.509
 incandescent and the melano forums with 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.250
 melanin that regulate the brightness 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.080
 hormones that secrete the body's 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.420
 Chameleon regulate the distribution of 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.460
 these pigments if the bed yellow 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.130
 this forum is combined with blue light 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.259
 reflected by the guano pores the skin 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.780
 dyes green ideal to hide between 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.030
 the leaves if they are combined are the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.920
 red with blue the tonality obtained 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.500
 is the abode to hide among the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.030
 fruits if any of the chromatophores are 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.160
 yellow ink the color 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.410
 obtained is the brown to pass 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.030
 unnoticed on a trunk the 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.070
 melano forums contribute to the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.259
 different shades of brightness and 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.360
 darkness of the same color tones 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.100
 reddish and orange are achieved without 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.259
 intervention of the good forums the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.420
 result is a wonderful palette of 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.990
 colors and a prodigious weapon for the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.990
 survival
