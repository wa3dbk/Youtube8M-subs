00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629 

flaps<00:00:00.840> are<00:00:01.110> very<00:00:01.350> useful<00:00:01.920> when<00:00:02.100> used

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
flaps are very useful when used

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.940 
flaps are very useful when used
correctly<00:00:03.060> but<00:00:03.870> how<00:00:04.020> do<00:00:04.080> you<00:00:04.319> use<00:00:04.529> them

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
correctly but how do you use them

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.140 
correctly but how do you use them
correctly<00:00:10.280> extending<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> flaps<00:00:11.700> will<00:00:11.969> add

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
correctly extending the flaps will add

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.419 
correctly extending the flaps will add
more<00:00:12.480> curvature<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.290> create<00:00:13.860> more<00:00:14.099> surface

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
more curvature and create more surface

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.240 
more curvature and create more surface
for<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> plane's<00:00:15.599> wings<00:00:15.929> these<00:00:16.590> two<00:00:16.800> factors

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
for a plane's wings these two factors

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.939 
for a plane's wings these two factors
will<00:00:17.699> add<00:00:17.940> more<00:00:18.270> lift<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.050> wings<00:00:19.289> which

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
will add more lift to the wings which

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.040 
will add more lift to the wings which
makes<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.430> possible<00:00:20.640> for<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.240> plane<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.810> stay

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
makes it possible for the plane to stay

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.980 
makes it possible for the plane to stay
in<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> air<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.769> low<00:00:23.010> speeds<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:24.330> planes<00:00:24.750> with

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
in the air at low speeds on planes with

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.320 
in the air at low speeds on planes with
jet<00:00:25.380> engines<00:00:25.859> flaps<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.580> sometimes<00:00:27.060> also

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
jet engines flaps are sometimes also

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200 
jet engines flaps are sometimes also
purposely<00:00:28.080> meant<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.769> create<00:00:28.980> more<00:00:29.340> drag<00:00:29.670> so

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
purposely meant to create more drag so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.669 
purposely meant to create more drag so
the<00:00:30.390> engines<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:30.929> running<00:00:31.230> faster<00:00:31.650> than

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the engines are running faster than

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.490 
the engines are running faster than
actually<00:00:32.279> necessary<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.090> approach<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:34.230> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
actually necessary on approach this is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530 
actually necessary on approach this is
so<00:00:34.739> when<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> pilot<00:00:35.250> decides<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.030> go<00:00:36.180> round

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
so when the pilot decides to go round

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.930 
so when the pilot decides to go round
the<00:00:36.809> engines<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.920> providing<00:00:38.550> all<00:00:38.700> their

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the engines will be providing all their

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.450 
the engines will be providing all their
power<00:00:39.149> within<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.050> few<00:00:40.079> seconds<00:00:40.800> rather

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
power within just a few seconds rather

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.930 
power within just a few seconds rather
than<00:00:41.610> maybe<00:00:42.059> ten<00:00:42.420> or<00:00:42.629> even<00:00:42.660> more<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.940> because

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
than maybe ten or even more but because

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.209 
than maybe ten or even more but because
the<00:00:45.300> flaps<00:00:45.539> add<00:00:45.840> drag<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.469> extended<00:00:46.710> position

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the flaps add drag in extended position

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.180 
the flaps add drag in extended position
they<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.090> generally<00:00:48.780> only<00:00:48.989> used<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.800> takeoff

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
they are generally only used for takeoff

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.299 
they are generally only used for takeoff
approach<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> landing<00:00:51.680> some<00:00:52.680> small<00:00:52.980> planes

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
approach and landing some small planes

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
approach and landing some small planes
like<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.820> Cessna<00:00:54.270> 172<00:00:55.110> actually<00:00:55.949> don't<00:00:56.219> even

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
like the Cessna 172 actually don't even

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.880 
like the Cessna 172 actually don't even
need<00:00:56.789> them<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.239> takeoff<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.440> most<00:00:58.590> other

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
need them to takeoff but for most other

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.490 
need them to takeoff but for most other
planes<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.489> simple<00:01:00.120> rule<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> handle<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.140> avoid

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
planes a simple rule to handle to avoid

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.880 
planes a simple rule to handle to avoid
calculations<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.600> use<00:01:03.600> flap<00:01:03.930> setting<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
calculations is use flap setting one and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.420 
calculations is use flap setting one and
two<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.339> takeoff<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> experiment<00:01:08.070> on

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
two on takeoff you can experiment on

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
two on takeoff you can experiment on
your<00:01:08.549> own<00:01:08.610> which<00:01:09.240> works<00:01:09.540> better<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.140> what

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
your own which works better in what

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.230 
your own which works better in what
conditions<00:01:10.920> when<00:01:11.580> you're<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> short

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
conditions when you're on the short

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.410 
conditions when you're on the short
runway<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.979> many<00:01:14.189> headwinds<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
runway or there's not many headwinds you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.260 
runway or there's not many headwinds you
might<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> use<00:01:16.200> flip<00:01:16.500> setting<00:01:16.830> -

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
might want to use flip setting -

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
might want to use flip setting -
especially<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.299> bigger<00:01:18.600> planes<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.259> longer

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
especially on bigger planes on longer

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.060 
especially on bigger planes on longer
runways<00:01:20.460> setting<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.420> will<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:22.259> approach

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
runways setting one will do an approach

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.730 
runways setting one will do an approach
it<00:01:23.310> gets<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.759> difficult<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:25.200> plane<00:01:25.470> has

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it gets more difficult if your plane has

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.280 
it gets more difficult if your plane has
lots<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.159> flap<00:01:26.400> settings<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.450> many<00:01:27.869> Boeing

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
lots of flap settings like many Boeing

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
lots of flap settings like many Boeing
planes<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.770> example<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.670> might<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.150> need

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
planes for example you might not need

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.140 
planes for example you might not need
full<00:01:30.630> flaps<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.200> landing<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.579> second-to-last

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
full flaps on landing the second-to-last

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.270 
full flaps on landing the second-to-last
setting<00:01:33.750> might<00:01:33.990> work<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.470> many<00:01:34.680> conditions

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
setting might work in many conditions

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.359 
setting might work in many conditions
but<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.090> again<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.630> short<00:01:36.930> runways<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:37.920> when

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
but then again for short runways or when

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.030 
but then again for short runways or when
you're<00:01:38.520> using<00:01:38.759> lower<00:01:39.119> approach<00:01:39.600> beats<00:01:40.040> using

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you're using lower approach beats using

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
you're using lower approach beats using
the<00:01:41.159> full<00:01:41.369> flap<00:01:41.670> setting<00:01:41.909> probably<00:01:42.840> won't<00:01:43.079> arm

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
the full flap setting probably won't arm

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.100 
the full flap setting probably won't arm
if<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.520> plane<00:01:44.759> has<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.450> few<00:01:45.689> settings

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
if the plane has just a few settings

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.770 
if the plane has just a few settings
like<00:01:46.860> many<00:01:47.189> Airbus<00:01:47.640> planes<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.180> many<00:01:48.420> smaller

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
like many Airbus planes and many smaller

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.080 
planes for example the highest flap
setting<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.509> often<00:01:51.899> required<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:53.090> course

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
setting is often required of course

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.450

there<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.689> exceptions<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.860> in

there are exceptions to this but in

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.010 
there are exceptions to this but in
flight<00:01:56.700> care<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.600> used<00:01:57.780> as
