00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
Quattro and not by much but it does

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.150 
Quattro and not by much but it does
enough<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.400> make<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:58.880> much<00:02:58.910> wider<00:02:59.680> um<00:03:00.680> I

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
enough to make it that much wider um I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.190 
enough to make it that much wider um I
was<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:02.060> looking<00:03:02.390> at<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.840> only<00:03:02.990> bad

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
was just looking at it the only bad

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.740 
was just looking at it the only bad
thing<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.650> saw<00:03:03.830> about<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.130> board<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:05.570> your

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
thing that I saw about the board is your

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.860 
thing that I saw about the board is your
right<00:03:05.900> there<00:03:06.650> between<00:03:07.490> my<00:03:07.820> fingers<00:03:07.880> there's<00:03:08.810> a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
right there between my fingers there's a

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.570 
right there between my fingers there's a
little<00:03:08.959> dent<00:03:09.260> but<00:03:09.890> that's<00:03:10.100> just<00:03:10.250> from<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
little dent but that's just from the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.640 
little dent but that's just from the
would<00:03:10.760> end<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.600> probably<00:03:11.810> take<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.050> lot<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.500> lot

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
would end you probably take a lot a lot

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.220
