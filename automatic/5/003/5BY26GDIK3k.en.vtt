start<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.090> two<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.809> bring<00:00:55.410> both

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
start out with two here and bring both

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
start out with two here and bring both
pieces<00:00:55.920> together<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:57.030> usually<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
pieces together in one usually with a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.450 
pieces together in one usually with a
couple<00:00:58.199> seed<00:00:58.410> beads<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> side<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.340> it's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
couple seed beads on the side so it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
couple seed beads on the side so it's
comfortable<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> don't<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> lot

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
comfortable and then you don't see a lot

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.020 
comfortable and then you don't see a lot
of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> wire<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:02.340> gonna<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.789> just

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
of the wire what I'm gonna do is just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.100 
of the wire what I'm gonna do is just
feed<00:01:03.269> on<00:01:03.300> beads<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.899> random<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> smaller

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
feed on beads at random the smaller

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
feed on beads at random the smaller
beads<00:01:07.350> towards<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.800> front<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.190> face<00:01:08.370> will

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
beads towards the front of the face will

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.499 
beads towards the front of the face will
make<00:01:08.730> it<00:01:08.910> better<00:01:10.100> fit<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.400> front<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.360> I'm

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
make it better fit at the front and I'm

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.399 
make it better fit at the front and I'm
going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.840> using<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.640> toggle<00:01:18.020> for<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> clasp

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
going to be using a toggle for the clasp

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.289 
going to be using a toggle for the clasp
closure<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:22.520> watches<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> lot<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.850> times<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
closure and watches a lot of times the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
closure and watches a lot of times the
hardest<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.810> watch<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.320> getting<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
hardest thing for watch is getting the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.460 
hardest thing for watch is getting the
correct<00:01:26.340> fit<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.020> thing<00:01:28.259> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
correct fit that is one thing that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.200 
correct fit that is one thing that
washes<00:01:29.009> people<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.400> usually<00:01:29.579> particular

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
washes people are usually particular

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940 
washes people are usually particular
about<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.140> much<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:31.710> they're<00:01:31.829> making

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
about not as much so when they're making

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.260 
about not as much so when they're making
bracelets<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.759> watches<00:01:33.150> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
bracelets but with watches you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.460 
bracelets but with watches you
definitely<00:01:33.659> want<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> make<00:01:33.930> sure<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.350> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
definitely want to make sure that you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.730 
definitely want to make sure that you
have<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.670> fit<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:36.869> watch<00:01:37.079> face<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
have a good fit for your watch face and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.530 
have a good fit for your watch face and
that<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.369> exactly<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> want

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that it's exactly the way that you want

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.910 
that it's exactly the way that you want
it<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.110> people<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.470> their<00:01:40.619> watches

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it to be some people like their watches

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
it to be some people like their watches
in<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> bracelet<00:01:41.430> style<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:42.600> people<00:01:42.869> would

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
in a bracelet style some people would

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.830 
in a bracelet style some people would
rather<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.649> them<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:45.030> tight<00:01:45.360> fitting

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
rather have them in a tight fitting

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
rather have them in a tight fitting
style<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.500> way<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.740> not<00:01:47.009> move

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
style so that way they do not move

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.670

I've taken it back into one strand you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.700 
I've taken it back into one strand you
can<00:02:23.600> keep<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.080> where<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.320> can<00:02:24.440> take<00:02:24.470> it

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
back into one I'm taking this back into

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.840 
back into one I'm taking this back into
that<00:02:27.140> single<00:02:27.560> strand<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.460> I'm<00:02:28.520> going<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.730> make

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
that single strand so I'm going to make

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.160 
that single strand so I'm going to make
sure<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.060> my<00:02:29.300> sides<00:02:29.600> match<00:02:29.870> in<00:02:30.110> length<00:02:35.170> and

sure that my sides match in length and
then<00:02:36.320> when<00:02:36.530> they<00:02:36.650> match<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.130> length<00:02:37.400> I'm<00:02:37.580> going

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
then when they match in length I'm going

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:46.350 
then when they match in length I'm going
to<00:02:37.790> bring<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.030> back<00:02:38.060> into<00:02:38.360> one<00:02:44.110> after<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.140> bring
