00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.090
 for the two previous news and for my 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.580
 voice since everyone will see big one 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.490
 congestion here and that is not normal so 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.800

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.599

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.189

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.349
 owner of this news not since it has 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.839

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.940

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.410
 screen or maybe in the source of 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.329
 description because it has been filtered and not 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.030

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.710

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.769

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.950
 of the description then 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.140

 we do not know the truth of truthfulness 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.940
