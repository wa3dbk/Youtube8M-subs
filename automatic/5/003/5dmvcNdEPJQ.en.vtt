00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.820 
this you could probably add the same
amount<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> applesauce<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.229> make

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
apple sauce muffins because it's the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.140 
apple sauce muffins because it's the
same<00:01:15.119> consistency<00:01:15.810> same<00:01:16.350> everything<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.280> don't
