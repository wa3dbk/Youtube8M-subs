00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.689
 so today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.950
 true secret for fo also so polka dot 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.250
 every day I receive requests 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.689
 as well on facebook as in life 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.570
 everyday in the room 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.680
 or even 100 times super physics 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.300
 people who start and who tell me 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.579
 and writhing is not a tip to me 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.340
 give to progress faster on what 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.600
 is the real secret is so I 'm 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.910
 quite amused with this question and that's 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260
 why do I make a video today 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.580
 for me the real secret is 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.290
 continue and never give up 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.200
 so it's always easy to start 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.500
 bodybuilding to make a month two 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.660
 month 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.680
 and then to stop that it's really the 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.920
 easier and it's a pretty good case 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.080
 frequent but the hardest and so change 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.390
 really gives it is to continue and 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.500
 never stopped to train that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.090
 this is the first point the first true 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.310
 this retiree we really never let go 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.229
 and the second secret that allows 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.970
 really to progress in addition to not 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.799
 never let go is to understand what 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.100
 you make to understand how 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:22.600
 runs the training so not good 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.600
 I saw a student here in Montreal and he 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.060
 told me web before you jean standards 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.469
 and programs I was doing a week 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.149
 super 7 one week series 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.679
 degressive because I saw that I 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.380
 will not know and I did not understand 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.229
 how do you move forward and therefore 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.719
 thanks to my coaching services and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.350

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.729
 learn to do one's own 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.310
 of training he could understand 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.889
 how did it work and how 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.679
 build a progression on the medium 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:52.869
 and long term and so while providing 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.520
 so by beating down we never 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.079
 never stops he could understand 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.310
 how it worked and puts everything in 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.049
 place to progress 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.560
 so that's for sure it's easier to 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.569
 progress to continue when we know this 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.170
