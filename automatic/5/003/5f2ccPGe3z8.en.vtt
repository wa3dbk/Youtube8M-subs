00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.930
 I visited a video game store that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.020
 cheaper and has more variety or 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.969
 goes with a store of this type that the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.989
 New York, and then you get a 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.550
 little more expensive but for many 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.930
 Can you see what's going on in there? 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 first hand 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.789
 so I decided to go there then to visit from there 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.620

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.530

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.890
 I was very well taken care of so it's kind of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.869
 informal business in this can 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.329
 I really liked the validity of the guys is 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.009

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.240
