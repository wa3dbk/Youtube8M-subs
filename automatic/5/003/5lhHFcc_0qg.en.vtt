not quite not quite what I like to hear
a<00:01:54.789> way<00:01:55.539> to<00:01:55.600> improve<00:01:55.929> that<00:01:55.990> within<00:01:56.500> standard

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
a way to improve that within standard

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.620 
a way to improve that within standard
tuning<00:01:57.369> is<00:01:57.609> you<00:01:57.909> can<00:01:58.060> wrap<00:01:58.210> your<00:01:58.390> thumb<00:01:58.600> around

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
tuning is you can wrap your thumb around

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.749 
tuning is you can wrap your thumb around
to<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.259> second<00:01:59.590> fret<00:01:59.829> on<00:02:00.039> that<00:02:00.280> low<00:02:00.399> string

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
to the second fret on that low string

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.859 
to the second fret on that low string
and<00:02:01.000> play<00:02:01.149> an<00:02:01.210> f-sharp<00:02:02.579> sounds<00:02:03.579> better<00:02:03.729> but<00:02:04.090> to

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869

may<00:04:30.690> need<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.020> retune<00:04:31.440> all<00:04:32.010> right

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
may need to retune all right

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.790 
may need to retune all right
so<00:04:32.640> now<00:04:32.820> we're<00:04:33.000> ready<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.510> move<00:04:33.720> on<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.380> another

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
so now we're ready to move on to another

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.220 
so now we're ready to move on to another
really<00:04:35.520> great<00:04:35.700> alternate<00:04:36.330> tuning<00:04:36.690> called

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
really great alternate tuning called

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.770 
really great alternate tuning called
dadgad<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.640> reason<00:04:38.910> it's<00:04:39.060> called<00:04:39.090> dadgad

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
dadgad and the reason it's called dadgad

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.840 
dadgad and the reason it's called dadgad
is<00:04:39.990> that's<00:04:40.650> what<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.070> strings<00:04:41.340> are<00:04:41.610> that

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
is that's what the strings are that

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.160 
is that's what the strings are that
you're<00:04:41.970> going<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.150> tune<00:04:42.300> down<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:43.170> da<00:04:43.890> d-dad

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
you're going to tune down to so da d-dad

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.540 
you're going to tune down to so da d-dad
we've<00:04:46.170> already<00:04:46.320> got<00:04:46.560> D<00:04:46.980> a<00:04:47.370> D<00:04:48.860> then<00:04:49.860> we<00:04:50.010> got<00:04:50.190> GAD

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
we've already got D a D then we got GAD

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.990 
we've already got D a D then we got GAD
G<00:04:51.330> which<00:04:51.840> we<00:04:51.990> already<00:04:52.260> have<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.860> then<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.820> B

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
G which we already have and then the B

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.960 
G which we already have and then the B
string<00:04:54.300> gets<00:04:54.480> changed<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.350> an<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.940> E

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
string gets changed to an a and the E

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.580 
string gets changed to an a and the E
string<00:04:57.390> gets<00:04:57.540> changed<00:04:57.870> for<00:04:57.960> D<00:04:58.140> so<00:04:58.170> I'm<00:04:58.470> gonna

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
string gets changed for D so I'm gonna

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:07.999 
string gets changed for D so I'm gonna
do<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.890> right<00:04:59.040> now

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.640 

all<00:05:08.520> right<00:05:08.699> so<00:05:08.909> now<00:05:09.029> that<00:05:09.119> we're<00:05:09.330> in<00:05:09.360> dadgad<00:05:09.990> we

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
all right so now that we're in dadgad we

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.049 
all right so now that we're in dadgad we
can<00:05:10.830> do<00:05:10.949> some<00:05:11.189> things<00:05:11.219> that<00:05:11.550> are<00:05:11.669> kind<00:05:11.879> of

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:12.059 
can do some things that are kind of

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:14.929 
can do some things that are kind of
similar<00:05:12.449> to<00:05:12.479> drop<00:05:12.990> D<00:05:13.259> and<00:05:13.559> they<00:05:13.949> sound<00:05:14.279> in<00:05:14.580> my

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:14.939 
similar to drop D and they sound in my

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.689 
similar to drop D and they sound in my
opinion<00:05:15.330> even<00:05:15.629> cooler<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.169> dadgad<00:05:16.559> so<00:05:17.279> the

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
opinion even cooler and dadgad so the

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:18.859 
opinion even cooler and dadgad so the
first<00:05:17.909> thing<00:05:18.029> that<00:05:18.119> we're<00:05:18.210> going<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.360> do<00:05:18.509> is

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:18.869 
first thing that we're going to do is

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:20.899 
first thing that we're going to do is
we're<00:05:19.229> going<00:05:19.259> to<00:05:19.409> do<00:05:19.589> another<00:05:19.979> power<00:05:20.430> chord

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
we're going to do another power chord

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.359 
we're going to do another power chord
and<00:05:21.180> you<00:05:21.629> can<00:05:21.809> use<00:05:22.110> your<00:05:22.680> index<00:05:22.979> finger<00:05:23.339> just

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:23.369 
and you can use your index finger just

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:25.579 
and you can use your index finger just
like<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.759> did<00:05:23.909> before<00:05:24.050> but<00:05:25.050> this<00:05:25.199> time<00:05:25.439> you're

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:25.589 
like you did before but this time you're

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.350 
like you did before but this time you're
going<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.770> let<00:05:26.129> make<00:05:26.430> sure<00:05:26.789> that<00:05:27.029> you<00:05:27.149> let

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
going to let make sure that you let

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.040 
going to let make sure that you let
these<00:05:27.960> three<00:05:28.409> top<00:05:28.830> strings<00:05:29.339> ring<00:05:30.300> out<00:05:30.599> so

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
these three top strings ring out so

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.730 
these three top strings ring out so
it'll<00:05:31.619> sound<00:05:31.860> like<00:05:32.219> this

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
it'll sound like this

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.049 
it'll sound like this
which<00:05:34.740> i<00:05:34.889> think<00:05:35.129> is<00:05:35.189> a<00:05:35.219> beautiful<00:05:35.580> beautiful

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:36.059 
which i think is a beautiful beautiful

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:38.420 
which i think is a beautiful beautiful
sound<00:05:36.509> and<00:05:36.869> it's<00:05:37.379> much<00:05:37.559> easier<00:05:37.919> to<00:05:37.949> get<00:05:38.159> this

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
sound and it's much easier to get this

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.510 
sound and it's much easier to get this
particular<00:05:39.330> chord<00:05:39.719> in<00:05:39.960> this<00:05:40.229> tuning<00:05:40.710> then<00:05:41.249> if

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
particular chord in this tuning then if

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.450 
particular chord in this tuning then if
you<00:05:41.610> were<00:05:41.699> in<00:05:41.789> standard<00:05:42.149> tuning<00:05:43.249> that's<00:05:44.249> my

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
you were in standard tuning that's my

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.399 
you were in standard tuning that's my
favorite<00:05:44.879> one<00:05:45.059> of<00:05:45.089> all<00:05:45.270> oh<00:05:47.839> I<00:05:48.839> love<00:05:49.139> that<00:05:49.169> one

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
favorite one of all oh I love that one

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.980 
favorite one of all oh I love that one
too<00:05:51.860> so<00:05:52.860> you<00:05:53.729> may<00:05:53.909> have<00:05:54.029> a<00:05:54.120> hard<00:05:54.300> time<00:05:54.599> if

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
too so you may have a hard time if

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.779 
too so you may have a hard time if
you're<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.139> starting<00:05:55.469> out<00:05:55.740> doing<00:05:56.339> that<00:05:56.580> with

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
you're just starting out doing that with

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.209 
you're just starting out doing that with
just<00:05:56.939> your<00:05:57.149> finger<00:05:57.479> your<00:05:57.809> one<00:05:58.169> finger<00:05:58.649> so<00:05:59.099> if

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
just your finger your one finger so if

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.730 
just your finger your one finger so if
you<00:05:59.309> like<00:05:59.610> you<00:06:00.389> can<00:06:00.659> pretend<00:06:01.409> that<00:06:01.529> you're

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
you like you can pretend that you're

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.799 
you like you can pretend that you're
doing<00:06:01.919> an<00:06:02.009> a<00:06:02.129> chord<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:02.729> use<00:06:03.330> your<00:06:03.479> second

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:03.809 
doing an a chord and use your second

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.049 
doing an a chord and use your second
third<00:06:03.930> and<00:06:03.959> fourth<00:06:04.289> fingers<00:06:04.469> and<00:06:04.919> just<00:06:05.849> put

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:06.059 
third and fourth fingers and just put

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:07.939 
third and fourth fingers and just put
them<00:06:06.240> on<00:06:06.509> these<00:06:06.779> lowest<00:06:07.050> three<00:06:07.439> strings<00:06:07.740> it's

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
them on these lowest three strings it's

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.970 
them on these lowest three strings it's
a<00:06:08.039> lot<00:06:08.219> easier

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
a lot easier

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.810 
a lot easier
take<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.490> little<00:06:10.640> bit<00:06:10.760> more<00:06:10.910> control

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.300

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
all right you can play around with that

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:40.239 
all right you can play around with that
you<00:06:18.460> can<00:06:18.580> also<00:06:18.730> play<00:06:19.030> these<00:06:19.180> chords<00:06:19.390> up<00:06:19.570> here

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:43.579 

so<00:06:41.249> that's<00:06:41.429> some<00:06:41.609> fun<00:06:41.789> with<00:06:41.939> dad<00:06:42.119> dad<00:06:42.589> another

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:46.079 
thing that you can do an experiment with

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:48.709 
thing that you can do an experiment with
is<00:06:46.319> just<00:06:46.829> using<00:06:47.069> one<00:06:47.459> finger<00:06:47.759> on<00:06:48.089> one<00:06:48.359> string

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:48.719 
is just using one finger on one string

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:50.179 
is just using one finger on one string
and<00:06:48.869> move<00:06:49.049> it<00:06:49.199> around<00:06:49.289> all<00:06:49.709> different<00:06:50.009> kinds

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:50.189 
and move it around all different kinds

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.069 
and move it around all different kinds
of<00:06:50.279> fred's<00:06:50.489> and<00:06:50.699> see<00:06:50.819> what<00:06:50.969> it<00:06:51.059> sounds<00:06:51.179> like<00:06:51.359> so

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:52.079 
of fred's and see what it sounds like so

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:54.289 
of fred's and see what it sounds like so
here<00:06:52.289> I'm<00:06:52.439> going<00:06:52.589> to<00:06:52.679> try<00:06:52.879> using<00:06:53.879> my<00:06:54.089> middle

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:54.299 
here I'm going to try using my middle

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:58.069 
here I'm going to try using my middle
finger<00:06:54.719> on<00:06:54.959> the<00:06:55.409> g<00:06:55.679> string<00:06:55.709> and<00:06:56.929> just<00:06:57.929> play
