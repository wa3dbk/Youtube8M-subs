00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.390 

remember<00:00:03.350> when<00:00:03.470> I<00:00:03.530> said<00:00:03.740> earlier<00:00:03.770> you<00:00:04.070> need<00:00:04.370> a

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:04.400 
remember when I said earlier you need a

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.950 
remember when I said earlier you need a
aluminum<00:00:04.970> cocaine<00:00:05.569> that<00:00:05.779> sounded<00:00:06.140> weird

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
aluminum cocaine that sounded weird

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.070 
aluminum cocaine that sounded weird
you're<00:00:08.440> gonna<00:00:08.530> replicate<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.910> former<00:00:10.300> we

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
you're gonna replicate the former we

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.299 
you're gonna replicate the former we
something<00:00:11.380> about<00:00:11.590> that<00:00:11.770> same<00:00:12.010> thickness

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
something about that same thickness

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.670 
something about that same thickness
it'll<00:00:13.120> show<00:00:13.300> if<00:00:13.600> the<00:00:13.960> cool<00:00:14.110> is<00:00:14.260> going<00:00:14.469> to<00:00:14.559> fit

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
it'll show if the cool is going to fit

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.900 
it'll show if the cool is going to fit
down<00:00:14.830> the<00:00:15.040> gap<00:00:15.190> because<00:00:15.400> it's<00:00:15.549> gonna<00:00:15.670> have<00:00:15.880> to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
down the gap because it's gonna have to

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.450 
down the gap because it's gonna have to
go<00:00:16.059> on<00:00:16.539> that<00:00:16.750> former<00:00:17.350> so<00:00:17.950> it's<00:00:18.039> not<00:00:18.130> just<00:00:18.190> the

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
go on that former so it's not just the

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.270 
go on that former so it's not just the
cool<00:00:18.670> part<00:00:18.940> I<00:00:19.000> wrapped<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:20.289> this<00:00:20.710> isn't<00:00:21.220> a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
cool part I wrapped but this isn't a

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.220 
cool part I wrapped but this isn't a
really<00:00:21.550> coke<00:00:21.789> can<00:00:22.060> I<00:00:22.330> guess<00:00:22.600> what<00:00:22.720> company

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
really coke can I guess what company

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.300 
really coke can I guess what company
that<00:00:23.410> is<00:00:23.560> it's<00:00:24.189> not<00:00:24.279> coke<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.830> it<00:00:26.949> works<00:00:27.099> it's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
that is it's not coke but it works it's

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.640 
that is it's not coke but it works it's
aluminum

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
aluminum

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.410 
aluminum
and<00:00:28.860> that's<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.610> I<00:00:29.730> said<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.000> might<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.150> brass

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and that's like I said it might be brass

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.120 
and that's like I said it might be brass
I<00:00:30.780> don't<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.530> doesn't<00:00:31.770> really<00:00:31.860> matter

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
I don't know it doesn't really matter

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.910 
I don't know it doesn't really matter
just<00:00:32.460> want<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> similar<00:00:33.780> thickness<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
just want a similar thickness you know a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310 
just want a similar thickness you know a
little<00:00:35.370> similar<00:00:35.700> thickness<00:00:36.080> to<00:00:37.080> make<00:00:37.200> sure

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
little similar thickness to make sure

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.099 
little similar thickness to make sure
it's<00:00:37.470> gonna<00:00:37.620> fit<00:00:37.740> in<00:00:38.100> there

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:39.109 
it's gonna fit in there

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.540 
it's gonna fit in there
it's<00:00:39.260> going<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.499> go<00:00:39.620> wrap<00:00:39.859> around<00:00:40.159> the<00:00:40.339> outer

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
it's going to go wrap around the outer

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.590 
it's going to go wrap around the outer
edge

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.970 

and<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.410> got<00:00:45.560> to<00:00:45.680> check<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:46.280> down<00:00:46.430> in<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.670> gap

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.710 

I'll<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.520> placing<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:51.000> both<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
I'll be placing them both down in the

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.610 
I'll be placing them both down in the
gap<00:00:51.900> tightening<00:00:52.740> the<00:00:53.600> aluminum<00:00:54.600> around<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
gap tightening the aluminum around the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.690 
gap tightening the aluminum around the
copper<00:00:55.830> and<00:00:56.730> making<00:00:57.060> sure<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.840> fit

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
copper and making sure it's going to fit

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.430 
copper and making sure it's going to fit
with<00:00:59.700> some<00:00:59.940> hover<00:01:00.120> room<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.320> isn't

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
with some hover room now there isn't

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.090 
with some hover room now there isn't
much<00:01:01.650> of<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.860> room<00:01:02.040> at<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> Tioga<00:01:02.850> pole<00:01:03.090> part

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
much of a room at the Tioga pole part

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
much of a room at the Tioga pole part
because<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.370> coal<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.420> bit<00:01:06.600> too

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
because the coal is a little bit too

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.450 
because the coal is a little bit too
small<00:01:07.410> I'm<00:01:07.710> gonna<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> make<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.280> Baker

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
small I'm gonna have to make it Baker

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
small I'm gonna have to make it Baker
next<00:01:08.670> time<00:01:08.910> but<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> make<00:01:10.140> sure

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
next time but I do need to make sure

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.160 
next time but I do need to make sure
that<00:01:10.670> I'll<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.820> room<00:01:11.910> on<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.210> outer<00:01:12.390> part<00:01:12.840> as

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that I'll have room on the outer part as

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
that I'll have room on the outer part as
well<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.890> looks<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.370> a<00:01:14.460> tidal<00:01:14.760> line<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.180> some

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
well it looks like a tidal line but some

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.580 
well it looks like a tidal line but some
speakers<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.810> bottom<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.229> too<00:01:16.440> tight

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
speakers the bottom it's not too tight

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160 
speakers the bottom it's not too tight
now<00:01:16.920> pine<00:01:17.160> tie<00:01:17.340> bar<00:01:17.550> is<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.270> tie<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> line<00:01:18.900> but

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
now pine tie bar is a tie the line but

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.770 
now pine tie bar is a tie the line but
I'm<00:01:19.560> gonna<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.370> bit<00:01:20.630> tricky<00:01:21.630> but

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
I'm gonna be a little bit tricky but

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.550 
I'm gonna be a little bit tricky but
bear<00:01:22.050> with<00:01:22.080> me

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.139 

okay

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
okay

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.730 
okay
we<00:01:26.600> got<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.960> uh

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.530 

we<00:01:30.040> got<00:01:30.190> masking<00:01:30.550> tape<00:01:30.700> around<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.180> hold<00:01:31.360> it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
we got masking tape around it to hold it

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.230 
we got masking tape around it to hold it
and<00:01:31.930> it's<00:01:32.800> not<00:01:32.980> the<00:01:33.100> way<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.490> voice<00:01:34.000> call

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
and it's not the way that the voice call

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.110 
and it's not the way that the voice call
would<00:01:34.960> be<00:01:34.990> connected<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.560> former<00:01:36.120> because

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
would be connected to the former because

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.580 
would be connected to the former because
this<00:01:37.300> is<00:01:37.450> representing<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.020> former<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.470> it's

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
this is representing the former and it's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.930 
this is representing the former and it's
on<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> outside<00:01:39.190> rather<00:01:39.460> than<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:39.790> inner

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
on the outside rather than the inner

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.960 
on the outside rather than the inner
side<00:01:40.210> but<00:01:40.480> it's<00:01:40.600> still<00:01:40.750> taking<00:01:41.170> up<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:42.790> the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
side but it's still taking up about the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.850 
side but it's still taking up about the
same<00:01:44.100> diameter<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:47.080> it<00:01:47.140> lets<00:01:47.290> me<00:01:47.470> hold<00:01:47.650> onto

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
same diameter and it lets me hold onto

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.719 
same diameter and it lets me hold onto
it<00:01:48.100> easier<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.990> situate<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.590> there<00:01:50.770> as<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.640> can

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
it easier to situate it there as you can

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.490 
it easier to situate it there as you can
see

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
see

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.170 
see
it<00:01:53.920> has<00:01:54.100> hover

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
it has hover

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.950 
it has hover
but<00:01:56.600> it's<00:01:56.750> just<00:01:56.900> not

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
but it's just not

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.450 
but it's just not
enough<00:01:59.680> it<00:02:00.670> will<00:02:00.850> scrape<00:02:01.120> eventually

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
enough it will scrape eventually

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.700 
enough it will scrape eventually
with<00:02:04.060> because<00:02:04.420> even<00:02:04.840> though<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.170> Colemans<00:02:05.560> up

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
with because even though the Colemans up

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.410 
with because even though the Colemans up
and<00:02:05.860> down<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.130> also<00:02:06.280> has<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.550> slight<00:02:07.060> wobble

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
and down it also has a slight wobble

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.030 
and down it also has a slight wobble
side-to-side<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.440> want<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.710> take<00:02:08.860> into

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
side-to-side and you want to take into

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.790 
side-to-side and you want to take into
account<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:11.410> you're<00:02:11.560> when<00:02:11.770> you're

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
account that when you're when you're

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.960 
account that when you're when you're
wrapping<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.550> call<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.030> real<00:02:13.180> call<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:14.290> now

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
wrapping the call the real call so now

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.339 
wrapping the call the real call so now
let's<00:02:15.970> look<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.360> problem

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.259 

you<00:02:19.799> see<00:02:19.980> those<00:02:20.129> black<00:02:20.340> marks<00:02:20.370> up<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.939> on<00:02:21.090> it

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
you see those black marks up it on it

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.589 
you see those black marks up it on it
it's<00:02:21.749> it's<00:02:22.109> under<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.709> tape<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.249> wound<00:02:24.030> one

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
it's it's under the tape a wound one

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.160 
it's it's under the tape a wound one
wide<00:02:25.079> plus<00:02:26.180> up<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.510> about<00:02:27.989> here

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
wide plus up to about here

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.460 
wide plus up to about here
that's<00:02:30.770> one<00:02:30.980> wound<00:02:31.460> around<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.140> they're

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
that's one wound around and then they're

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.850 
that's one wound around and then they're
almost<00:02:33.890> about<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.610> half<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.090> way<00:02:35.270> again<00:02:35.860> and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
almost about a half of the way again and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.190 
almost about a half of the way again and
that<00:02:37.069> might<00:02:37.280> be<00:02:37.430> too<00:02:37.610> much<00:02:37.790> I'm<00:02:38.569> just<00:02:38.810> thinking

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
that might be too much I'm just thinking

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.900 
that might be too much I'm just thinking
I'm<00:02:39.319> using<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.890> lot<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:41.709> estimation<00:02:42.709> because<00:02:43.700> I

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
I'm using a lot of estimation because I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.400 
I'm using a lot of estimation because I
know<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.270> Coles<00:02:44.450> gotta<00:02:44.660> come<00:02:44.810> wider<00:02:45.050> and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
know that the Coles gotta come wider and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.770 
know that the Coles gotta come wider and
I<00:02:45.500> know<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.010> does<00:02:46.160> not<00:02:46.370> take<00:02:46.610> much<00:02:46.880> tape

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
I know that it does not take much tape

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.360 
I know that it does not take much tape
to<00:02:48.050> make<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.230> difference<00:02:48.770> when<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.070> wrap<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
to make a difference when you wrap the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.790 
to make a difference when you wrap the
second<00:02:49.760> coil<00:02:49.990> so<00:02:50.990> I'm<00:02:51.050> kind<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.320> scared<00:02:51.560> if<00:02:51.709> it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
second coil so I'm kind of scared if it

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.199 
second coil so I'm kind of scared if it
gets<00:02:51.950> too<00:02:52.130> much<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.459> won't<00:02:52.610> fit<00:02:52.820> in<00:02:52.910> there<00:02:53.060> this

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
gets too much it won't fit in there this

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.970 
gets too much it won't fit in there this
will<00:02:53.420> fit<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.990> it's<00:02:54.080> got<00:02:54.230> just<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.530> little<00:02:54.800> room

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
will fit and it's got just a little room

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.190 
will fit and it's got just a little room
before<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.310> hits<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.520> front<00:02:55.790> plate<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:56.300> I'm

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
before it hits the front plate so I'm

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.110 
before it hits the front plate so I'm
just<00:02:57.440> gonna<00:02:57.560> make<00:02:57.739> my<00:02:57.980> guess<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.880> can't

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
just gonna make my guess and I can't

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.309 
just gonna make my guess and I can't
really<00:02:59.239> help<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.600> if<00:02:59.690> it's<00:02:59.810> round

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
really help it if it's round

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.080 
really help it if it's round
I'll<00:03:00.410> know<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:00.800> by<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.920> time<00:03:01.040> it's<00:03:01.340> done<00:03:01.489> all

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
I'll know what by the time it's done all

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.540 
I'll know what by the time it's done all
you<00:03:02.270> can<00:03:02.420> do<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.660> redo<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.230> guess<00:03:03.440> unless<00:03:04.370> you

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
you can do is redo it I guess unless you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.949 
you can do is redo it I guess unless you
have<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> lathe<00:03:05.000> then<00:03:05.420> that's<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.690> whole<00:03:05.720> nother

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
have a lathe then that's a whole nother

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.020 
have a lathe then that's a whole nother
story<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.470> can<00:03:06.650> lathe<00:03:06.800> down<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.400> tempo<00:03:07.910> you

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
story you can lathe down the tempo you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.840 
story you can lathe down the tempo you
can<00:03:08.150> read<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.420> tempo<00:03:09.310> get<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.430> shaved<00:03:10.670> down<00:03:10.790> a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
can read the tempo get it shaved down a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.110 
can read the tempo get it shaved down a
little<00:03:11.120> bit<00:03:11.330> or<00:03:12.290> show<00:03:12.739> down<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.130> front<00:03:13.850> plate

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
little bit or show down the front plate

one<00:03:14.780> or<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.019> other<00:03:15.170> but<00:03:15.730> let's<00:03:16.730> let's<00:03:17.090> try<00:03:17.360> to

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
one or the other but let's let's try to

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.840 
one or the other but let's let's try to
avoid<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.959> okay<00:03:18.320> been<00:03:19.130> there<00:03:19.400> done<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:19.640> I

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
avoid that okay been there done that I

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.620 
avoid that okay been there done that I
don't<00:03:20.030> want<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.330> again<00:03:21.430> for<00:03:22.430> now<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.970> can<00:03:23.510> make

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
don't want to again for now I can make

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.420 
don't want to again for now I can make
my<00:03:23.690> estimated<00:03:24.200> guess<00:03:24.440> on<00:03:24.650> how<00:03:24.800> much<00:03:25.010> larger<00:03:25.220> I

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
my estimated guess on how much larger I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.170 
my estimated guess on how much larger I
need<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:26.780> wrap<00:03:26.930> this<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:27.440> never<00:03:27.739> much

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
need to wrap this and it's never much

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.340 
need to wrap this and it's never much
sometimes<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.480> this<00:03:29.570> little<00:03:29.870> as<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.050> half

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
sometimes it's this little as a half

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.340 
sometimes it's this little as a half
inch<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.769> an<00:03:31.040> inch<00:03:31.250> or<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.610> did<00:03:32.000> about<00:03:32.350> seven

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
inch to an inch or so I did about seven

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.569 
inch to an inch or so I did about seven
or<00:03:33.440> eight<00:03:33.500> inches<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.130> I'm<00:03:34.190> thinking<00:03:34.489> of

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
or eight inches and I'm thinking of

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.819 
or eight inches and I'm thinking of
pulling<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.970> backs<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.530> it's<00:03:36.530> just<00:03:36.680> gonna

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
pulling it backs and it's just gonna

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.910 
pulling it backs and it's just gonna
take<00:03:36.950> some<00:03:36.980> thought<00:03:37.280> for<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.549> little<00:03:37.760> while

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
take some thought for a little while

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.089 
take some thought for a little while
back<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.130> here<00:03:40.310> again

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.600 

it's<00:03:44.549> gonna<00:03:44.909> be<00:03:45.090> ready<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.420> wrap

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.590 

he's<00:03:48.120> split<00:03:48.510> on<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:50.430> starts<00:03:50.820> off<00:03:50.970> small<00:03:51.150> and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
he's split on it it starts off small and

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.260 
he's split on it it starts off small and
it's<00:03:51.990> getting<00:03:52.230> wider<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:53.270> showed<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.420> before

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
it's getting wider I showed you before

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.570 
it's getting wider I showed you before
it<00:03:56.660> has<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.080> be

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
it has to be

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.940 
it has to be
compressed<00:03:59.240> and<00:03:59.900> because<00:04:00.410> when<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.620> wrap<00:04:00.770> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
compressed and because when you wrap the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.170

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
much I just did with my fingers the coal

wine<00:04:05.270> my<00:04:05.510> wine<00:04:05.720> just<00:04:06.110> tightens<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.800> down<00:04:06.980> on<00:04:07.220> it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750

gonna<00:04:08.750> be<00:04:08.990> really<00:04:09.230> close<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.860> don't<00:04:10.010> want<00:04:10.160> to

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
gonna be really close you don't want to

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.740 
gonna be really close you don't want to
be<00:04:10.340> exactly<00:04:10.790> as<00:04:10.940> thin<00:04:11.150> as<00:04:11.270> that<00:04:11.510> right<00:04:11.720> there

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
be exactly as thin as that right there

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.070 
be exactly as thin as that right there
because<00:04:14.750> it'd<00:04:15.020> be<00:04:15.140> really<00:04:15.290> hard<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.680> align<00:04:17.080> you

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
because it'd be really hard to align you

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.720 
because it'd be really hard to align you
want<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.350> be<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.739> little<00:04:18.769> bit<00:04:19.459> thicker

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730

want to be just a little bit thicker
when<00:04:20.209> it's<00:04:20.359> done

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
when it's done

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.460 
when it's done
I'll<00:04:21.880> show<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.150> what<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:22.449> looks<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:22.840> and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
I'll show you what it looks like and

I'll show you what it looks like and
I'll<00:04:23.710> show<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:25.360> it'll<00:04:25.539> fit<00:04:25.810> down<00:04:25.960> into

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
I'll show you that it'll fit down into

I'll show you that it'll fit down into
the<00:04:26.789> whole<00:04:27.789> piece<00:04:28.199> I've<00:04:29.199> arrived<00:04:29.710> between<00:04:29.919> the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
the whole piece I've arrived between the

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.920 
the whole piece I've arrived between the
puppies<00:04:30.970> in<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> front<00:04:31.570> flight<00:04:31.750> just

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
puppies in the front flight just

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.390 
puppies in the front flight just
perfectly

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
perfectly

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.610 
perfectly
I<00:04:33.780> thought<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:34.840> would<00:04:34.990> show<00:04:35.140> a<00:04:35.170> little<00:04:35.320> more<00:04:35.500> of

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
I thought I would show a little more of

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.530 
I thought I would show a little more of
my<00:04:35.680> hate<00:04:35.890> care<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.220> them<00:04:36.370> right<00:04:36.520> now<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.910> took

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
my hate care of them right now I took

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.130 
my hate care of them right now I took
the<00:04:37.870> top<00:04:38.050> off<00:04:38.320> on<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.690> well<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.720> got<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:40.990> so

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
the top off on it and well I got it so

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.030 
the top off on it and well I got it so
dark<00:04:42.540> exposures<00:04:43.540> down<00:04:43.750> because<00:04:44.140> you<00:04:44.620> turn<00:04:44.800> one

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
dark exposures down because you turn one

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.780 
dark exposures down because you turn one
of<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.220> bulbs<00:04:45.520> on<00:04:45.700> here<00:04:47.730> there<00:04:48.730> we<00:04:48.820> go

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
of the bulbs on here there we go

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.230 
of the bulbs on here there we go
that's<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.600> 150<00:04:52.140> watt<00:04:52.320> bulb

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:04.300 

here's<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.840> 500

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.890 

and<00:05:05.310> then<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.550> other<00:05:05.730> 500

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.730 

but<00:05:09.470> it's<00:05:09.650> on<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.890> resistor<00:05:11.230> not<00:05:12.230> as<00:05:12.380> Bryant

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
but it's on the resistor not as Bryant

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.080 
but it's on the resistor not as Bryant
is<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:13.010> that's<00:05:13.130> where<00:05:13.430> it's<00:05:13.580> 80<00:05:13.790> Watts

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
is it that's where it's 80 Watts

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.500 
is it that's where it's 80 Watts
election<00:05:14.840> but<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:15.920> can<00:05:16.070> bypass<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:17.180> make<00:05:17.330> it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
election but I can bypass it to make it

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.260 
election but I can bypass it to make it
100<00:05:18.380> I<00:05:18.620> mean<00:05:19.490> 500<00:05:21.670> all<00:05:22.670> right<00:05:22.820> about<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.150> get

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
100 I mean 500 all right about to get

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.890 
100 I mean 500 all right about to get
this<00:05:23.420> sucker<00:05:23.630> in<00:05:23.900> get<00:05:24.500> it<00:05:24.620> up<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.860> temperature
