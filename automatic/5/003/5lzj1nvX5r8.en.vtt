update series I wanted to talk a little
bit<00:00:07.109> about<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:08.960> mechanics<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.559> my<00:00:10.769> setup<00:00:11.519> here

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
bit about the mechanics of my setup here

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.320 
bit about the mechanics of my setup here
so<00:00:12.799> I've<00:00:13.799> tried<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.099> automate<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:14.969> much<00:00:15.030> as

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
so I've tried to automate as much as

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.760 
so I've tried to automate as much as
possible<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.080> operation<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.650> these

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
possible the operation of these

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.470 
possible the operation of these
barbarians<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.640> I'll<00:00:17.760> show<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> exactly

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
barbarians and I'll show you exactly

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.439 
barbarians and I'll show you exactly
what<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.779> mean<00:00:18.990> by<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.560> basically<00:00:20.240> if<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
what I mean by that but basically if I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.929 
what I mean by that but basically if I
go<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.840> clean<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> glass<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.730> feed

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
go in and clean the glass and and I feed

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.170 
go in and clean the glass and and I feed
the<00:00:24.060> geckos<00:00:24.420> every<00:00:25.140> other<00:00:25.230> night<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.619> so

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
the geckos every other night or so

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.339 
the geckos every other night or so
that's<00:00:27.180> about<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.779> maintenance<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.289> do

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that's about all the maintenance I do

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.320 
that's about all the maintenance I do
that<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> trimming<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> plants<00:00:30.150> when<00:00:30.240> they

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
that and trimming the plants when they

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.049 
that and trimming the plants when they
get<00:00:30.480> too<00:00:30.599> crazy

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
get too crazy

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
get too crazy
everything<00:00:33.059> from<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.899> watering<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
everything from the watering to the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.090 
everything from the watering to the
lighting<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.270> automated<00:00:36.829> it's<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:37.980> on

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
lighting is all automated it's all on

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.979 
lighting is all automated it's all on
the<00:00:38.190> timer<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> thought<00:00:39.690> I'd<00:00:39.809> give<00:00:39.960> you

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the timer and so I thought I'd give you

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.690 
the timer and so I thought I'd give you
guys<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> good<00:00:40.680> shot<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.960> what<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.430> setup<00:00:44.430> really

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
guys a good shot at what my setup really

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.080 
guys a good shot at what my setup really
looks<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.420> makes<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> tick<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:47.090> first

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
looks like what makes it tick so first

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.850 
looks like what makes it tick so first
off<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.510> guess<00:00:48.750> before<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
off I guess before I get into it I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.630 
off I guess before I get into it I
should<00:00:50.100> say<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.180> obviously<00:00:51.750> built

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
should say that this is obviously built

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.689 
should say that this is obviously built
in<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.730> closet<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.199> had<00:00:55.410> an<00:00:55.500> extra<00:00:55.739> closet<00:00:56.160> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
in a closet so I had an extra closet in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.310 
in a closet so I had an extra closet in
my<00:00:56.879> room<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.690> use<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> room

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
my room I don't really use it as a room

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.139 
my room I don't really use it as a room
it's<00:00:58.500> more<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> den<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.910> know<00:00:59.969> my

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it's more like a den you know my

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.319 
it's more like a den you know my
computer<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.629> stuff<00:01:00.870> over<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.270> is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
computer and stuff over here so this is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
computer and stuff over here so this is
what<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> stare<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.439> bored<00:01:04.700> so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
what I stare at when I get bored so

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.280 
what I stare at when I get bored so
let's<00:01:05.850> talk<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.810> I've<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.260> here

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
let's talk about what I've got in here

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.130 
let's talk about what I've got in here
so<00:01:07.770> first<00:01:08.040> off<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.210> did<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> ran<00:01:09.990> an

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so first off what I did was I ran an

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160 
so first off what I did was I ran an
electrical<00:01:10.650> outlet<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> inside<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
electrical outlet to the inside of the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.250 
electrical outlet to the inside of the
closet<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.500 

you<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.340> around<00:01:20.610> electrical<00:01:20.970> outlet<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
you see around electrical outlet to the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.860 
you see around electrical outlet to the
inside<00:01:21.870> of<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.050> closet<00:01:22.760> right<00:01:23.760> there<00:01:24.030> alright

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
inside of the closet right there alright

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.150 
inside of the closet right there alright
and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:26.160> I've<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> Zilla<00:01:26.850> power<00:01:27.180> center

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
and then I've got a Zilla power center

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.610 
and then I've got a Zilla power center
timer<00:01:29.240> set<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.860> my<00:01:31.860> lights<00:01:32.840> my<00:01:33.840> pump<00:01:34.230> which

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
timer set up for my lights my pump which

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.700 
timer set up for my lights my pump which
is<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.160> same<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.580> my<00:01:35.700> lights<00:01:36.290> my<00:01:37.290> fogger

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
is on the same as my lights my fogger

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.410 
is on the same as my lights my fogger
I'll<00:01:38.280> talk<00:01:38.520> about<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.120> minute

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
I'll talk about that in a minute

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.170 
I'll talk about that in a minute
and<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.590> misting<00:01:40.950> system<00:01:41.870> okay<00:01:43.010> now<00:01:44.180> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and my misting system okay now the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.000 
and my misting system okay now the
misting<00:01:45.570> system<00:01:45.900> has<00:01:46.050> its<00:01:46.230> own<00:01:46.380> timeline

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
misting system has its own timeline

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.320 
misting system has its own timeline
that's<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:48.050> mr.<00:01:49.050> king<00:01:49.230> misting<00:01:49.620> system<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:51.180> on

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
that's a mr. king misting system it's on

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.960 
that's a mr. king misting system it's on
its<00:01:51.479> own<00:01:51.690> separate<00:01:52.229> timer<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.550> Zilla

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
its own separate timer so that Zilla

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.430 
its own separate timer so that Zilla
timer<00:01:54.270> back<00:01:54.510> there<00:01:54.690> what<00:01:54.870> that<00:01:54.900> does<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.410> that

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
timer back there what that does is that

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.130 
timer back there what that does is that
actually<00:01:55.770> has<00:01:56.250> two<00:01:56.910> timer<00:01:57.510> wheels<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
actually has two timer wheels on it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.320 
actually has two timer wheels on it
can't<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.310> second<00:01:59.700> one<00:01:59.820> but

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
can't really see the the second one but

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.810 
can't really see the the second one but
controls<00:02:00.750> day/night<00:02:01.260> and<00:02:01.580> then<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.670> has<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
controls day/night and then it has a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.250 
controls day/night and then it has a
second<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.720> can<00:02:03.870> control<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
second one that you can control a

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.750 
second one that you can control a
variety<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> functions<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.610> what<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
variety of functions with and what I

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.730 
variety of functions with and what I
have<00:02:05.970> on<00:02:06.150> that<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:07.260> my<00:02:07.410> fogger

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
have on that one is I have my fogger

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.530 
have on that one is I have my fogger
come<00:02:08.070> on<00:02:08.220> about<00:02:08.460> three<00:02:08.729> or<00:02:08.820> four<00:02:09.000> times<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.510> day

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
come on about three or four times a day

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.490 
come on about three or four times a day
and<00:02:09.990> I<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.560> adjust<00:02:11.070> that<00:02:11.160> ever<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.820> slightly

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
and I just adjust that ever so slightly

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.720 
and I just adjust that ever so slightly
during<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.680> year<00:02:13.890> say<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> winter<00:02:14.610> when

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
during the year say in the winter when

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.280 
during the year say in the winter when
it<00:02:14.820> gets<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.000> little<00:02:15.090> dryer<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> fogger<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
it gets a little dryer on the fogger a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.490 
it gets a little dryer on the fogger a
little<00:02:16.530> bit<00:02:16.650> more<00:02:16.800> things<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.340> nature

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
little bit more things of that nature

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.540 
little bit more things of that nature
the<00:02:19.500> lights<00:02:19.890> are<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:21.080> 12<00:02:22.080> hour<00:02:22.290> on<00:02:22.650> 12<00:02:23.370> hour

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the lights are on a 12 hour on 12 hour

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.820 
the lights are on a 12 hour on 12 hour
off<00:02:23.850> time<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.830> what<00:02:25.830> I've<00:02:25.920> got<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.420> four<00:02:27.830> t8

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
off time and what I've got is four t8

off time and what I've got is four t8
bulbs<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.610> there<00:02:30.410> 260<00:02:31.410> 700<00:02:31.980> k<00:02:32.510> 250<00:02:33.510> 700<00:02:34.080> K

eventually<00:02:35.970> I'll<00:02:36.090> probably<00:02:36.330> look<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:37.080> them

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
eventually I'll probably look all them

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.650 
eventually I'll probably look all them
all<00:02:37.350> out<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.850> 6700<00:02:38.850> K<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.209> just<00:02:39.390> have<00:02:39.510> not<00:02:39.600> a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
all out to 6700 K but I just have not a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.660 
all out to 6700 K but I just have not a
chance<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.980> or<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.250> desire<00:02:41.550> to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
spend the money on it not that it's a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.920 
spend the money on it not that it's a
lot<00:02:42.989> but<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.950> know<00:02:44.540> I've<00:02:45.540> been<00:02:45.570> spending

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
lot but you know I've been spending

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.250 
lot but you know I've been spending
about<00:02:45.989> my<00:02:46.170> aquariums<00:02:47.930> system<00:02:48.930> itself

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
about my aquariums system itself

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.020 
about my aquariums system itself
obviously<00:02:49.920> I've<00:02:49.980> got<00:02:50.130> two<00:02:50.370> misting<00:02:50.850> nozzles

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
obviously I've got two misting nozzles

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.210 
here if you're not familiar with mr.
king<00:02:54.360> misting<00:02:54.720> systems<00:02:55.140> they're<00:02:55.890> very

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
king misting systems they're very

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.340 
king misting systems they're very
articulate<00:02:56.790> nozzles<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.570> can<00:02:57.870> point<00:02:58.110> them<00:02:58.290> in

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
articulate nozzles you can point them in

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.479 
articulate nozzles you can point them in
any<00:02:58.560> direction<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:59.100> want<00:02:59.220> we<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.300> aim<00:03:00.510> them

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
any direction you want we can aim them

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.300 
any direction you want we can aim them
keep<00:03:02.489> them<00:03:02.640> away<00:03:02.850> from<00:03:03.000> your<00:03:03.150> glass<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> on<00:03:05.040> and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
keep them away from your glass so on and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.300 
keep them away from your glass so on and
these<00:03:05.400> are<00:03:05.690> they<00:03:06.690> call<00:03:06.900> zero<00:03:07.290> drip<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.190> has

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
these are they call zero drip so it has

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.130 
these are they call zero drip so it has
a<00:03:08.340> release<00:03:08.700> valve<00:03:08.970> down<00:03:09.390> by<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.630> pump<00:03:09.930> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
a release valve down by the pump and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.509 
a release valve down by the pump and
when<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.290> get<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.709> I'll<00:03:10.920> talk<00:03:11.190> about<00:03:11.220> that

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
when I get to that I'll talk about that

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.190 
when I get to that I'll talk about that
a<00:03:11.580> little<00:03:11.730> bit<00:03:11.940> more<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.239> basically<00:03:12.720> keeps

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
a little bit more but basically keeps

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.410 
a little bit more but basically keeps
the<00:03:13.410> turns<00:03:14.370> off<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.640> pressure<00:03:14.850> right<00:03:15.150> away<00:03:15.360> so

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
the turns off the pressure right away so

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.550 
the turns off the pressure right away so
that<00:03:15.750> these<00:03:15.840> nozzles<00:03:16.110> do

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
that these nozzles do

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.770 
that these nozzles do
drip<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.069> lot<00:03:17.250> after<00:03:17.970> you're<00:03:18.060> done<00:03:18.150> watering<00:03:18.450> so

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
drip a lot after you're done watering so

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.960 
drip a lot after you're done watering so
it<00:03:18.840> makes<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.410> for<00:03:19.560> pretty<00:03:19.739> precise<00:03:20.520> watering

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
it makes it for pretty precise watering

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.809 
it makes it for pretty precise watering
conditions<00:03:22.160> all<00:03:23.160> right<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.560> fogger<00:03:25.560> itself<00:03:26.130> is

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
conditions all right so fogger itself is

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.500 
conditions all right so fogger itself is
actually<00:03:27.390> run<00:03:27.660> up<00:03:27.930> these<00:03:28.170> two<00:03:28.470> pipes<00:03:28.739> here

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
actually run up these two pipes here

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.300 
actually run up these two pipes here
just<00:03:30.510> above<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:31.260> planning<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.739> covering<00:03:32.010> that

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
just above I'm planning on covering that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.710 
just above I'm planning on covering that
with<00:03:32.489> my<00:03:32.670> hood<00:03:32.880> if<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.090> ever<00:03:33.180> get<00:03:33.360> around<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
with my hood if I ever get around to

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.160 
with my hood if I ever get around to
making<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:35.519> can<00:03:35.640> see<00:03:35.819> I've<00:03:35.970> got

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
making it but you can see I've got

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.059 
making it but you can see I've got
valves<00:03:37.170> there<00:03:37.500> where<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.739> can<00:03:37.920> actually

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
valves there where I can actually

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.339 
valves there where I can actually
control<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:39.390> amount<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.720> fog<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.200> can

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
control the amount of fog so I can

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.930 
control the amount of fog so I can
balance<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.800> out<00:03:40.920> because<00:03:41.220> obviously<00:03:41.489> when<00:03:41.849> it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
balance it out because obviously when it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.570 
balance it out because obviously when it
comes<00:03:42.090> across<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:42.599> pipe<00:03:42.860> one<00:03:43.860> tank<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.310> apt

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
comes across this pipe one tank is apt

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.000 
comes across this pipe one tank is apt
to<00:03:44.760> get<00:03:44.849> more<00:03:45.060> fun<00:03:45.360> than<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.720> other<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.800> I've

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
to get more fun than the other so I've

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.979 
to get more fun than the other so I've
got<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> little<00:03:47.400> valve<00:03:47.670> there<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.269> right<00:03:48.870> now

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
got a little valve there and right now

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.090 
got a little valve there and right now
they're<00:03:49.140> pretty<00:03:49.260> balanced<00:03:49.650> but<00:03:49.799> when<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:49.950> have

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
they're pretty balanced but when I have

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.289 
they're pretty balanced but when I have
the<00:03:50.220> third<00:03:50.370> one<00:03:50.580> let's<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.850> two<00:03:50.940> make<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> big

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
the third one let's you two make a big

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.820 
the third one let's you two make a big
difference<00:03:51.450> I'll<00:03:51.989> be<00:03:52.140> able<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.380> control<00:03:52.650> that

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
difference I'll be able to control that

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.190 
difference I'll be able to control that
better<00:03:53.959> right<00:03:56.510> just<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.660> know<00:03:57.780> for

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
better right just so you know for

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.830 
better right just so you know for
watering<00:03:58.940> actually<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.120> drainage<00:04:00.480> layer

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
watering actually have a drainage layer

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.880 
watering actually have a drainage layer
in<00:04:01.170> there<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.239> I've<00:04:03.239> got<00:04:03.540> my<00:04:03.810> timing<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.739> my

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
in there and I've got my timing on my

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.380 
in there and I've got my timing on my
watering<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.459> amount<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.849> water<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.239> I'm

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
watering in the amount of water that I'm

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.830 
watering in the amount of water that I'm
doing<00:04:07.610> setup<00:04:08.610> so<00:04:08.849> that<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.150> soil<00:04:09.330> is<00:04:09.630> moist

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
doing setup so that the soil is moist

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.589 
doing setup so that the soil is moist
and<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:11.430> never<00:04:11.640> really<00:04:12.000> exceeds<00:04:12.390> that

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
and that it never really exceeds that

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.910 
and that it never really exceeds that
water<00:04:12.870> line<00:04:13.140> right<00:04:13.170> there<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.650> there's<00:04:13.739> always

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
water line right there so there's always

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.380 
water line right there so there's always
water<00:04:14.220> available<00:04:14.610> but<00:04:14.790> there's<00:04:14.940> never<00:04:15.060> enough

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
water available but there's never enough

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.719 
water available but there's never enough
water<00:04:15.599> that<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.840> need<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.109> drain<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.609> unless<00:04:17.609> I

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
water that I need to drain it unless I

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.280 
water that I need to drain it unless I
make<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.910> mistake<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.419> water<00:04:18.630> too<00:04:18.780> much<00:04:18.930> I've

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
make a mistake and I water too much I've

pump right there which is a diaphragm
pump<00:05:14.490> yeah<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:15.090> can<00:05:15.240> actually<00:05:15.360> run<00:05:15.720> that

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
pump yeah you can actually run that

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.590 
pump yeah you can actually run that
thing<00:05:16.050> dry<00:05:16.289> for<00:05:16.530> hours<00:05:16.830> on<00:05:16.950> end<00:05:17.010> so<00:05:17.460> even<00:05:18.450> if<00:05:18.539> I

of the scientific connection that I have

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.820 
of the scientific connection that I have
it's<00:06:21.360> a<00:06:21.449> ninety<00:06:21.750> degree<00:06:21.870> connection<00:06:22.500> on<00:06:22.650> that

screen<00:06:25.319> and<00:06:25.620> comes<00:06:26.099> down<00:06:27.110> and<00:06:28.110> what<00:06:28.409> do<00:06:28.800> is

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:33.469 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.839 

turn<00:06:34.469> that<00:06:34.680> on<00:06:34.889> there's<00:06:35.099> a<00:06:35.190> nice<00:06:35.340> blue<00:06:35.610> light

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
turn that on there's a nice blue light

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.260 
turn that on there's a nice blue light
to<00:06:36.240> let<00:06:36.360> me<00:06:36.509> know<00:06:36.539> that<00:06:36.690> it's<00:06:36.960> going<00:06:37.139> on<00:06:38.270> and

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
to let me know that it's going on and

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.350 
to let me know that it's going on and
you<00:06:39.810> can<00:06:39.990> sit<00:06:40.169> here<00:06:40.289> and<00:06:40.409> you<00:06:40.469> can<00:06:40.650> see<00:06:40.860> that<00:06:41.360> we

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
you can sit here and you can see that we

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.200 
you can sit here and you can see that we
get<00:06:42.479> some<00:06:42.690> nice<00:06:42.900> flow<00:06:43.319> of<00:06:43.800> mist<00:06:44.190> which<00:06:45.029> will

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
get some nice flow of mist which will

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.820 
get some nice flow of mist which will
eventually<00:06:45.360> kind<00:06:45.719> of<00:06:45.870> fill<00:06:46.080> up<00:06:46.110> about<00:06:46.500> halfway

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
eventually kind of fill up about halfway

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.499 
eventually kind of fill up about halfway
on<00:06:47.099> this<00:06:47.340> tank<00:06:48.050> as<00:06:49.050> well<00:06:49.469> on<00:06:49.680> the<00:06:49.770> other<00:06:49.830> tank

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
on this tank as well on the other tank

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.870 
on this tank as well on the other tank
this<00:06:51.509> is<00:06:51.659> how<00:06:51.810> I<00:06:51.840> maintain<00:06:52.349> my<00:06:52.400> mic<00:06:53.400> humidity

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
this is how I maintain my mic humidity

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.050 
this is how I maintain my mic humidity
without<00:06:54.180> what<00:06:54.419> over<00:06:54.719> watering<00:06:55.110> too<00:06:55.380> much

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
without what over watering too much

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.129 
without what over watering too much
since<00:06:57.060> there's<00:06:57.210> a<00:06:57.240> crested<00:06:57.539> geckos<00:06:57.840> in<00:06:57.960> here

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
since there's a crested geckos in here

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.490 
since there's a crested geckos in here
they<00:06:58.259> tend<00:06:58.710> to<00:06:58.800> like<00:06:58.949> the<00:06:59.069> humidity

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
they tend to like the humidity

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.570 
they tend to like the humidity
they<00:07:01.500> say<00:07:01.650> somewhere<00:07:01.949> between<00:07:02.099> anywhere

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
they say somewhere between anywhere

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.240 
they say somewhere between anywhere
between<00:07:02.699> 50<00:07:03.300> and<00:07:03.469> 75<00:07:04.469> is<00:07:04.800> really<00:07:05.099> ideal

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
between 50 and 75 is really ideal

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.640 
between 50 and 75 is really ideal
anything<00:07:05.879> more<00:07:06.060> than<00:07:06.210> that<00:07:06.360> long-term<00:07:06.930> you

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
anything more than that long-term you

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.320 
anything more than that long-term you
know<00:07:07.800> obviously<00:07:08.400> the<00:07:08.580> reptiles<00:07:08.969> that<00:07:09.120> can

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
know obviously the reptiles that can

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.209 
know obviously the reptiles that can
develop<00:07:09.539> respiratory<00:07:10.379> problems<00:07:10.830> things<00:07:11.099> of

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:11.219 
develop respiratory problems things of

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:13.760 
develop respiratory problems things of
that<00:07:11.310> nature<00:07:11.840> if<00:07:12.840> the<00:07:12.930> humidity<00:07:13.139> is<00:07:13.379> too<00:07:13.440> high

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
that nature if the humidity is too high

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.719 
that nature if the humidity is too high
for<00:07:13.800> them<00:07:14.219> so<00:07:14.699> this<00:07:15.659> tends<00:07:15.960> to<00:07:16.490> even<00:07:17.490> it<00:07:17.610> out

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
for them so this tends to even it out

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.269 
for them so this tends to even it out
from<00:07:18.029> the<00:07:18.150> morning<00:07:18.509> waterings<00:07:18.960> I<00:07:19.199> water<00:07:19.590> every

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:20.279 
from the morning waterings I water every

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:23.240 
from the morning waterings I water every
other<00:07:20.400> day<00:07:21.020> except<00:07:22.020> on<00:07:22.110> the<00:07:22.229> weekends<00:07:22.710> I<00:07:22.800> let

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
other day except on the weekends I let

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.499 
other day except on the weekends I let
everything<00:07:23.430> dry<00:07:23.639> out<00:07:23.819> on<00:07:23.940> the<00:07:24.000> weekends<00:07:24.330> but<00:07:24.479> I

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509 
everything dry out on the weekends but I

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:26.310 
everything dry out on the weekends but I
fog<00:07:24.870> every<00:07:25.259> day

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.320 
fog every day

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.000 
fog every day
regular<00:07:26.770> basis<00:07:27.190> and<00:07:27.760> that<00:07:28.650> really<00:07:29.650> tends<00:07:29.860> to

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.010 
regular basis and that really tends to

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:36.150 
regular basis and that really tends to
last<00:07:30.220> a<00:07:30.370> couple<00:07:30.400> of<00:07:30.760> months<00:07:34.740> it<00:07:35.740> really<00:07:35.950> tends

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 
last a couple of months it really tends

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.610 
last a couple of months it really tends
to<00:07:36.280> last<00:07:36.460> a<00:07:36.610> couple<00:07:36.640> of<00:07:36.940> months<00:07:37.210> so<00:07:38.140> I<00:07:38.170> don't<00:07:38.500> I

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620 
to last a couple of months so I don't I

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.870 
to last a couple of months so I don't I
don't<00:07:38.680> change<00:07:38.950> it<00:07:39.100> that<00:07:39.220> off<00:07:39.370> when<00:07:39.580> I<00:07:39.640> clean<00:07:39.850> it

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:39.880 
don't change it that off when I clean it

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.610 
don't change it that off when I clean it
every<00:07:40.120> time<00:07:40.270> I<00:07:40.330> change<00:07:40.660> it<00:07:40.810> but<00:07:40.960> than<00:07:41.440> that

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620 
every time I change it but than that

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.360 
every time I change it but than that
that<00:07:42.010> is<00:07:42.190> the<00:07:42.610> automation<00:07:43.000> of<00:07:43.270> my<00:07:43.360> system<00:07:43.780> so<00:07:44.370> I

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.370 
that is the automation of my system so I

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.710 
that is the automation of my system so I
