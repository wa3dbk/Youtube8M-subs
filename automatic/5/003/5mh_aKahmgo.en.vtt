00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 to 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.010
 of youtube for all the people who 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.480
 they run out of gas that they get to 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.010
 to be without absolute gasoline that is 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.600
 turn off the motorcycle and no longer walk then 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.220
 I 'm going to give you a piece of information so that 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.349
 solve the problem quickly when 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.600
 you give him new gas and that 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.640
 come and see that she is drowned to take 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.960
 what bogado we will see the following video 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.250
 the piece that causes her to be drowned is 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.250
 it's where the gas goes well 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.440
 down then when he chokes 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.750
 and that we are going to go out to new 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.760
 you take certain certain air bubbles 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.960
 air that can not lower the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.130
 new gasoline again down 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.100
 so what we have to do is 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.100
 touch it is this move from here 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.250
 so that it starts to start 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.360
 the bubbles come out they do not look at each other 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.040
 very good but when I have stayed 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.530
 thrown in gasoline if the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 bubbles then so much is the movement 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.850
 what we are giving him walking 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 that all the bubbles come out here 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 as the soda sprite of the bubbles that 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.380
 they start to come out to then exactly 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 the same way, all of them start to come out 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.550
 the bubbles with the movement because of 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.190
 this way we force gasoline 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.490
 new to come down this hose and the 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.780
 air over here to be expelled not 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.570
 then in this way it is as 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.000
 gas bubbles come out here and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.630
 well then they are going to be up 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.420
 not so the vacuum of the tank then already 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.830
 it's like the bike starts again not me 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.690
 I have stayed if I share a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.539
 experience I've been lying 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.400
 number of times and quickly I'm not going to 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.650
 this hose that starts to move her 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.370
 and since all the bubbles come out as 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.190
 I commented to them because he pumped gasoline 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.820
 fireman here until everything opens 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.820
 all the bubbles 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.920
 and that's how the bike starts not then 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.420
 this gives all this type is for all 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.280
 people who 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.569
 Well what happened to them and they do not know 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.390
 how to repair minimal details of this 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.830
 motorbike well I'm sharing friends I hope 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.270
 that can give him thumbs up too 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.650
 that they can give you in sharing then for 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.840
 that allow me to continue growing as 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.680
 youtube then up to the next friends 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.680
