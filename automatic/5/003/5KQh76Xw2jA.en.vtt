 6 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.110
 in this video we will see the volume of water that escapes that we received from the 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.799
 tank 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.799
 with the aim of being able to live their consumption of making reasonable use 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.279
 the first step will be to cite scratching on entering the water so you can not enter 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.279
 the system 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.810
 then valerÃ³n lassad not be or show off the highest unemployment for the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.810
 tank 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.000
 in our case we have a double download system 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.200
 6 liters to cut the quick liters so it is reported 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.899
 then we will mark a weak renders 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.310
 of those that are not deleted 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.310
 the water level increased the slate 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.670
 now they will be buttons short face conare the tank will be emptied but as 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670
 before in our bay of pasaia it will not be refilled 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.870
 we will be the ones who must the cistern subtracts the signal previously 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.570
 brand 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.200
 let's look at volumes that we go there in this way we recognize the volume of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 water consumed in each discharge corp 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 it is important not to forget to write down that volume 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.210
 then the mere volume of the fourth discharge will proceed in the same way 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.090
 to measure in it until roma now we will pass note of the red discharge 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.460
 with what will not be emptied to fisterra and we will fill it again is the brand very 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.420
 well the pain 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 finish 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
 as before we will take note of the volume of water consumed 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.819
 Finally, we must not forget that the water tap in Monterrey is not 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.819
 the cistern 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.969
 to reduce water consumption here are a couple of recommendations 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.469
 using the download button swept the mind when necessary and in the 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.559
 case of not having a system of l'esquerra contemplated full bottles 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:40.299
 of water or sand in such a way that each time we remove the chain the volume 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.839
 who occupied the botiga well the volume of water run the boxes
