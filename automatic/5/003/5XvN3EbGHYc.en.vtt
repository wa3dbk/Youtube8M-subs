from<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:17.670> they<00:00:17.789> were<00:00:17.850> doing<00:00:18.060> when<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.660> you

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
from what they were doing when the you

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.450 
from what they were doing when the you
know<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> old<00:00:19.380> coaching<00:00:19.800> staff<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.250> there

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
know the old coaching staff was there

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.540 
know the old coaching staff was there
you<00:00:21.119> know<00:00:21.150> they<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.630> personnel<00:00:22.550> we've

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
you know they have that personnel we've

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.759 
you know they have that personnel we've
played<00:00:23.760> backs<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.180> them<00:00:24.390> before<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:25.019> think

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
played backs like them before I think

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859 
played backs like them before I think
the<00:00:25.920> guy<00:00:26.039> from<00:00:26.279> Boise<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.849> similar<00:00:27.359> probably

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the guy from Boise is similar probably

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.109 
the guy from Boise is similar probably
not<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.109> much<00:00:28.140> juice<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.670> bigger<00:00:29.880> guy

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
not as much juice as this the bigger guy

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.840 
not as much juice as this the bigger guy
has<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> kid<00:00:32.189> from<00:00:32.340> San<00:00:32.550> Diego<00:00:32.759> State

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
has I think the kid from San Diego State

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.220 
has I think the kid from San Diego State
last<00:00:33.180> year<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.450> pretty<00:00:33.660> good<00:00:33.780> too<00:00:33.840> he's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
last year is pretty good too he's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.100 
last year is pretty good too he's
probably<00:00:34.410> comparable<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.070> number<00:00:35.309> 20<00:00:36.110> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
probably comparable the number 20 so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.299 
probably comparable the number 20 so
we've<00:00:37.260> played<00:00:37.469> backs<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.890> them<00:00:38.100> Notre

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
we've played backs like them Notre

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.720 
we've played backs like them Notre
Dame's<00:00:38.579> backs<00:00:38.879> or<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:41.340> always

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
Dame's backs or like then so you always

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760 
Dame's backs or like then so you always
got<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.000> tell<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.600> guys<00:00:42.750> you're<00:00:43.020> gonna<00:00:43.140> pound

ball<00:00:57.199> run<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.410> pass<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.890> probably<00:00:59.190> look

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
ball run and pass will probably look

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.830 
ball run and pass will probably look
about<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> same<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> look<00:01:00.690> at

yards to me it's about points and got to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.060 
yards to me it's about points and got to
make<00:02:20.630> plays<00:02:20.660> when<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.140> opportunity<00:02:21.500> arises

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
make plays when the opportunity arises

and<00:02:22.520> yeah<00:02:22.790> they're<00:02:22.970> big<00:02:23.240> but<00:02:23.480> can't<00:02:23.840> change

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
and yeah they're big but can't change

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.890 
and yeah they're big but can't change
that<00:02:24.350> what<00:02:24.530> we<00:02:24.650> can<00:02:24.800> change<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.360> our<00:02:26.360> technique

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
that what we can change is our technique

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.750 
that what we can change is our technique
being<00:02:27.140> really<00:02:27.440> low<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.650> our<00:02:28.250> calls<00:02:28.520> being

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
being really low and our calls being

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.880 
being really low and our calls being
really<00:02:29.060> simple<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.630> flying<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.380> ball<00:02:30.590> and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
really simple and flying to the ball and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.410 
really simple and flying to the ball and
that's<00:02:31.160> our<00:02:31.340> focus<00:02:31.550> not<00:02:31.910> how<00:02:32.030> big<00:02:32.240> they<00:02:32.390> are

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
play-action stuff when you're playing it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.730 
play-action stuff when you're playing it
downhill<00:02:52.340> running<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.940> my<00:02:53.180> guess<00:02:53.440> guys<00:02:54.440> on<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
downhill running to my guess guys on the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.860 
downhill running to my guess guys on the
on<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.040> corners<00:02:55.459> really<00:02:56.120> rely<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.570> them<00:02:56.840> to

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
on the corners really rely on them to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.690 
on the corners really rely on them to
take<00:02:57.770> care<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.010> business<00:02:58.070> out<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.550> their<00:02:58.670> own

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
take care of business out on their own

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.870 
take care of business out on their own
it's<00:02:59.240> hard<00:02:59.450> because<00:02:59.720> if<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.470> blitz<00:03:00.800> it<00:03:01.010> and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
it's hard because if you blitz it and

long time how are you guys preparing for
that<00:04:53.760> being<00:04:54.390> on<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.630> field<00:04:54.780> for<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.080> long<00:04:55.290> time

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.980 
that being on the field for a long time
well<00:04:56.400> we<00:04:56.670> will<00:04:56.880> be<00:04:57.030> on<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.390> field<00:04:57.570> for<00:04:57.960> a

well we will be on the field for a

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.660 
well we will be on the field for a
longer<00:04:58.290> time<00:04:58.470> but<00:04:58.890> I'll<00:04:59.010> bet<00:04:59.160> sir<00:04:59.340> we<00:04:59.460> play<00:04:59.640> a

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
longer time but I'll bet sir we play a

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.250 
longer time but I'll bet sir we play a
lot<00:04:59.910> less<00:05:00.150> plays<00:05:00.450> because<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> lot<00:05:01.050> of<00:05:01.080> that

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
lot less plays because a lot of that

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.720 
lot less plays because a lot of that
time<00:05:01.440> they're<00:05:01.680> standing<00:05:02.040> in<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.250> huddle<00:05:02.430> and

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
time they're standing in a huddle and

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.970 
time they're standing in a huddle and
that's<00:05:02.940> good<00:05:03.180> for<00:05:03.390> us<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:03.840> our<00:05:04.560> offense

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
that's good for us and our offense

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.670 
that's good for us and our offense
scores<00:05:05.280> fast<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:05.940> we<00:05:06.210> will<00:05:06.900> play<00:05:07.110> less<00:05:07.380> place

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
scores fast so we will play less place

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.250 
scores fast so we will play less place
unless<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.970> know<00:05:09.090> we<00:05:09.450> just<00:05:09.630> don't<00:05:09.900> control

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
unless you know we just don't control

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.540 
unless you know we just don't control
the<00:05:10.350> ball<00:05:10.500> or<00:05:10.680> turn<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:10.860> over<00:05:11.070> but<00:05:11.340> i<00:05:11.370> would

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
the ball or turn it over but i would

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.090 
the ball or turn it over but i would
expect<00:05:11.790> my<00:05:12.330> guess<00:05:12.570> 60<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.290> 70<00:05:13.770> which<00:05:13.950> is<00:05:14.070> a

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
expect my guess 60 to 70 which is a

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.760 
expect my guess 60 to 70 which is a
drastic<00:05:14.580> that<00:05:14.910> be<00:05:15.090> like<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.300> game<00:05:15.570> last<00:05:15.810> year<00:05:15.990> do

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
and say the IPF but it's fun when you

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.670 
and say the IPF but it's fun when you
play<00:05:41.790> a<00:05:41.970> ball<00:05:42.210> control<00:05:42.630> team<00:05:42.900> like<00:05:43.110> this<00:05:43.290> skill

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
play a ball control team like this skill

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.560 
play a ball control team like this skill
positions<00:05:44.070> always<00:05:44.310> key<00:05:44.520> know<00:05:44.730> that<00:05:44.910> but<00:05:45.090> you

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
positions always key know that but you

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.870 
positions always key know that but you
know<00:05:45.600> against<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.620> ball<00:05:46.800> control<00:05:47.160> upon<00:05:47.460> as<00:05:47.700> it

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
know against the ball control upon as it

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.150 
know against the ball control upon as it
even<00:05:48.210> heightened<00:05:48.630> because<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.230> yeah<00:05:50.130> I

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
even heightened because of it yeah I

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.490 
even heightened because of it yeah I
think<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:50.760> I<00:05:50.790> mean<00:05:50.940> Phil<00:05:51.600> position<00:05:52.050> is<00:05:52.200> always

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
think so I mean Phil position is always

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.230 
think so I mean Phil position is always
crucial<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:53.250> thing<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.550> I<00:05:53.580> look<00:05:53.820> at<00:05:53.940> is<00:05:54.120> I

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
crucial the thing that I look at is I

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.670 
crucial the thing that I look at is I
think<00:05:54.300> they're<00:05:54.630> really<00:05:54.840> good<00:05:55.169> in<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.470> blue

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
think they're really good in the blue

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.070 
think they're really good in the blue
zone<00:05:55.890> and<00:05:56.150> they're<00:05:57.150> really<00:05:57.570> good<00:05:57.660> on<00:05:57.870> defense

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
zone and they're really good on defense

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.720 
zone and they're really good on defense
in<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:58.530> blue<00:05:58.710> zone<00:05:58.919> and<00:05:59.070> so<00:05:59.160> points<00:05:59.520> are<00:05:59.610> going

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
in the blue zone and so points are going

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.700
