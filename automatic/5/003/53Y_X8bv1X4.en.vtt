00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.189
 This one was here at an auction 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.150
 offered in the auction catalog it said 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:16.320
 ecomode central germany around 1760 news 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.810
 bonn and proudly missing before four 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.850
 ball feet body with three conversations 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.369
 drawers and dice brand with them 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.560
 on the sides warn rectangular band 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.960
 Asia as a striped one 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.320
 Cover plate with elaborate 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.149
 inlay estimated price 2200 bis 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.120
 2,650 euros 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.540
 it has not gone away with the option 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.230
 but after sale then has one 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.710
 Private customer purchased for 1900 euros 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.129
 I had to get here now 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 restore 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:57.050
 Unfortunately, this alleged eco fashion 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:04.500
 no barocco mode but one 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:06.680
 one can say but an assembly 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 probably two 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.119
 different dressers namely 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.939
 once parts of a treetop and part 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.290
 one at four per mode or maybe 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.119
 also or something similar 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.070
 that of course very annoying because 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.290
 are certainly 1900 euro way too much 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.659
 Now you can not necessarily always 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.450
 the auction house a reproachful doing 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.329
 also an art historian and a car 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.060
 I can tell big story of everything 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.320
 have an idea art historians go yes 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.860
 also quite different than for example 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.880
 a restorer of art historians times 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.979
 a complete morocco fashion restored 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.259
 he also wants with a completely different one 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.700
 sichtweise approach to such a case 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.909
 the art historian looks so on rather 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.360
 at first glance a plate with 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.450
 elaborate battery 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:13.110
 one sees profil afford baroque with 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.350
 Wooden furniture attached 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.400
 a really barefoot with continuous 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.040
 wooden dowel and the or is distributed and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.980
 here the drawers base too 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.110
 wooden nails and also succeed the rear 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.170
 also share a stylistically fitting 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.420
 fogging and inside 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.450
 everywhere all drawers baroque 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.120
 locks you look at the times 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.070
 dresser from the back then here too 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.019
 clear transverse widened back wall and 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.730
 pushed bird tracks are visible 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.200
 Look at the community now 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.959
 Someone he turns on then you see 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.420
 here in front doubt that the platform 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.310
 all not gezinken are behind yes 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.250
 not at the front but just simple 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.230
 nailed 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.390
 So we are in drawers it looks 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.530
 he is already on fire 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.630
 all drawers what on glued pieces 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.920
 such transactions are in the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.650
 underbody see here 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 whether he is his bird that are old pieces 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.020
 this there's wood nails available 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.570
 this one gets on on a 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.370
 others also still old wooden nails 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.990
 but they have no function because 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.870
 namely everywhere by nails too 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.570
 have been smashed on the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.970
 on the other hand, they are always missing those 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.950
 wooden nails there is so sawn arm 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.060
 of course, everything and only 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.140
 been nailed down 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.930
 Look at the drawer now 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.280
 from them 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.470
 not only the wallpaper we actually 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.900
 not so old is when brain from the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.450
 He really does that, he really does 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.790
 amateurish because we have over here 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.360
 actually only a baroque bar here 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.620
 above below also between long ago 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.959
 wood initiated or even some 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.630
 but only pieces of the initiated 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.760
 so long ago we have wood 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.130
 So no reasonable at all 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.080
 All pokÃ©mon have reasonable lightning 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.180
 Of course, this word is just right here 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.470
 Wood is usually made up of several layers 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.750
 built up 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:33.450
 so that is also durable so is 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.729
 Of course the whole thing really is not in 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.229
 order 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.850
 one of these rhombic studies is easy going 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.729
 and was out 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.510
 it was hand what also comes to light 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:51.240
 Of course, that's really nothing where 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.040
 Otherwise from here can thus at 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.590
 Look closely then is the brand tari 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.199
 the plate also not so nice 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:04.380
 because this welded wall is out 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.660
 individual pieces have been put together 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.479
 and he only gives this now 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:14.160
 Rounding the baroque of the baroque market 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:17.100
 ari and the drawer is the 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.160
 matter now really completely out of the 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.680
 angle to from the top or bottom 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.120
 seen whole drawer 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.000
 you look at the sail from her 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.400
 the drawer on then you tremble 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.610
 actually a bit too 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.860
 this whole relining everywhere or 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.310
 the fermentation as they have been said 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.729
 that is not a quality moderately good 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.020
 work the head it was complete 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.150
 taken apart and is the new 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.760
 has been demanded everywhere you can see 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.889
 that it had not been that original 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:56.240
 is that all parts form other times 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.240
 and sizes 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.870
 for me, the material has not before 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:08.669
 sat on a bench but on 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.560
 a dresser with a flat surface of 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:14.820
 Therefore, everything looks very good here too 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.889
 strange from the auction houses 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.870
 of course, they give themselves away 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.630
 no guarantee on what you have in yours 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.820
 catalogs write to the best of our knowledge 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.990
 and certain 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:31.860
 that also means that if you are 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.820
 you can buy furniture pictures at auction 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.930
 come to mind 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.660
 it is actually better 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:41.919
 the objects are the same on the spot 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.800
 to watch because often just above the 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.160
 dresser is first impression already that 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.320
 here's what's wrong with the size 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.039
 because hormones are actually at least 10 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.300
 15 centimeters wide too are now 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:59.380
 maybe also immediately seen that here 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.889
 just everywhere has been lowered in the 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.600
 center 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.009
 and if it becomes a video now 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.750
 probably also recognize that here 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.210
 somehow a kink in the middle is 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.919
 no harmonious rounding sees 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.070
 yes , that's not something 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:14.440
 true and hopefully so felt 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.930
 sometimes you can only go that 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.509
 It's not true that you prefer to distance yourself 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.940
 of it takes only by an exact 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.110
 Examination mostly when you have everything 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.690
 nice that I'm busy then 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.520
 you can see exactly what it is 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.410
 is that there any now 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.210
 has a bad feeling and that valued the 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.570
 big changes have been made 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.570
 are
