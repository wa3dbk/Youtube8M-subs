 proposed coaches of the under-13 category 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.640
 Little 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.619
 I think that is super important 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.520
 happening now in the category 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.170
 base 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.640
 It is with the possibility of people power 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.979
 practice practically together with the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:21.140
 is that such integration is 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:38.710
 very very cool I loved 3 max and lenny 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:46.759
 max and millena work on the two after 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:49.300

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.009

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.140

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.600

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.819
 physical the sequence the athletes so I guess 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.880
 which is a privilege for us teachers 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.890
 It is a privilege for the kids there to 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.929
 we really can live with the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:18.010
 ciro nÃ© 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:18.010
 in a moment I am training after 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.400

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.210
 to 0 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:57.790

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.160
 kids is not too good here is not good 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.980
 I like to run have joy to run. 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.290
 one who is more committed to 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.569
 work more 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.440
 knowing how to listen to the coach loses 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.769
 tactic 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.760
 I play with him straight, it 's all the time. 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.600
 in the field 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.600
 I see him training 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.169
 I see him training there and played this. 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.810
 tried but when it comes on the field it's time 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.229
 to work or think the game 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.389
 get out there and when it hits that to 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.639
 inside has to be more serious know 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:35.070
 What are you talking about after doing 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.070
 game but a good base 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:59.169
 that morning I have the strength of my 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:07.450
 Work I got, man, it 's not. 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:09.870
