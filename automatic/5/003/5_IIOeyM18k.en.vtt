00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
infiniminer so there was a game called a

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.360 
infiniminer so there was a game called a
game<00:02:44.690> called<00:02:44.810> infiniminer<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:46.130> was<00:02:46.250> out

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
game called infiniminer that was out

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.250

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
destroy blocks so voxel base and was

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.860 
destroy blocks so voxel base and was
that<00:02:54.319> mean<00:02:54.470> voxels<00:02:55.370> that's<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:55.870> boxes

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
that mean voxels that's the boxes

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.259 
that mean voxels that's the boxes
basically<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.560> cubes<00:02:57.859> oh<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.430> unit<00:02:58.760> Ryan<00:02:59.000> I

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
somewhere they just hand out boxes to

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.770 
somewhere they just hand out boxes to
random<00:06:10.370> assortment<00:06:10.610> of<00:06:10.789> people<00:06:10.910> which<00:06:11.539> is<00:06:11.570> one

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
random assortment of people which is one

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.610 
random assortment of people which is one
of<00:06:11.810> the<00:06:11.870> things<00:06:12.050> where<00:06:12.260> you<00:06:12.410> know<00:06:12.470> but

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
of the things where you know but

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.920 
of the things where you know but
sampling<00:06:13.100> just<00:06:13.490> a<00:06:13.580> small<00:06:13.940> sample<00:06:14.419> yeah<00:06:14.600> very

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
sampling just a small sample yeah very

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.439 
sampling just a small sample yeah very
small<00:06:15.289> like<00:06:15.680> when<00:06:15.889> say<00:06:16.340> they<00:06:16.940> get<00:06:17.240> one<00:06:17.360> of

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
small like when say they get one of

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:18.550 
small like when say they get one of
these<00:06:17.510> shows<00:06:17.690> to<00:06:17.810> come<00:06:17.930> back<00:06:18.050> on<00:06:18.080> the<00:06:18.260> air<00:06:18.380> and

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
these shows to come back on the air and

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.890 
these shows to come back on the air and
then<00:06:18.860> they<00:06:19.520> say<00:06:19.699> nobody<00:06:19.910> watches<00:06:20.360> it<00:06:20.389> well<00:06:20.690> the

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
then they say nobody watches it well the

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.080 
then they say nobody watches it well the
people<00:06:21.229> that<00:06:21.470> are<00:06:21.680> interested<00:06:22.400> in<00:06:22.729> it<00:06:22.940> or

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
people that are interested in it or

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.420 
people that are interested in it or
probably<00:06:23.960> you<00:06:24.530> know<00:06:24.560> the<00:06:24.860> smaller<00:06:25.099> sci-fi

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
probably you know the smaller sci-fi

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.219 
probably you know the smaller sci-fi
shows<00:06:25.610> probably<00:06:26.120> not<00:06:26.270> everything<00:06:26.630> that'll

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
shows probably not everything that'll

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:28.839 
shows probably not everything that'll
somebody<00:06:27.530> if<00:06:27.590> they<00:06:27.710> have<00:06:27.949> all<00:06:28.190> the<00:06:28.370> data<00:06:28.490> from

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
somebody if they have all the data from

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.540 
somebody if they have all the data from
all<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.090> actual<00:06:29.539> views<00:06:29.780> well<00:06:29.990> I<00:06:30.020> don't<00:06:30.110> know

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550
