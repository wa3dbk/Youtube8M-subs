a<00:00:04.020> way<00:00:04.290> that<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.920> can<00:00:05.069> get<00:00:05.700> files<00:00:06.150> out<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.629> your

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
a way that you can get files out of your

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.740 
a way that you can get files out of your
applications<00:00:07.710> without<00:00:08.490> having<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:09.420> jailbroken

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
applications without having a jailbroken

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.860 
applications without having a jailbroken
device<00:00:10.170> like<00:00:10.920> using<00:00:11.429> ifile<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.450> without

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
device like using ifile and without

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.930 
device like using ifile and without
using<00:00:13.080> ssh<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.429> what<00:00:14.549> you're<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.790> want

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
using ssh so what you're going to want

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.800 
using ssh so what you're going to want
to<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.980> go<00:00:16.980> find<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> IP<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.150> format

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to do is just go find the IP a format

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.019 
to do is just go find the IP a format
that<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.020> want<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.470> your<00:00:19.500> computer<00:00:20.130> copy<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that you want on your computer copy and

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.460 
that you want on your computer copy and
paste<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.420> into<00:00:21.539> another<00:00:21.720> folder<00:00:22.020> I've<00:00:22.289> done

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
paste it into another folder I've done

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.790 
paste it into another folder I've done
that<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:23.039> with<00:00:23.310> IP<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.640> test<00:00:24.350> now<00:00:25.350> you'll<00:00:25.619> come

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
that here with IP a test now you'll come

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.439 
that here with IP a test now you'll come
in<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.160> you'll<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.730> doodle<00:00:27.269> jump

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
in here and you'll have like doodle jump

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.189 
in here and you'll have like doodle jump
I<00:00:27.900> PA<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.769> what<00:00:28.859> we're<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.310> here<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
I PA so what we're going to do here is

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.979 
I PA so what we're going to do here is
rename<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.500> change<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.430> file<00:00:32.700> extension

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
rename it and change the file extension

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.299 
rename it and change the file extension
to<00:00:33.989> dot<00:00:34.170> zip<00:00:34.770> instead<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.520> type<00:00:35.880> EI<00:00:36.770> you<00:00:37.770> zip

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
to dot zip instead of type EI you zip

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.930 
to dot zip instead of type EI you zip
and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:40.640> extract<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.940> it'll

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and then we can extract it and it'll

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.029 
and then we can extract it and it'll
give<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> regular<00:00:45.899> folder<00:00:46.289> you're<00:00:46.920> going

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
give you a regular folder you're going

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.369 
give you a regular folder you're going
to<00:00:47.129> open<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.610> an<00:00:48.450> open<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.780> payload<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to open up that an open up payload and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.450 
to open up that an open up payload and
it'll<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.809> doodle<00:00:51.809> jump<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> dot

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it'll have doodle jump this is the dot

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.229 
it'll have doodle jump this is the dot
app<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.680> into<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.000> try<00:00:57.180> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
app so to get into that if you try to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
app so to get into that if you try to
just<00:00:57.480> open<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.109> say<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.949> not

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
just open it it will say it's not

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.250 
just open it it will say it's not
supported<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.879> architecture<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.020> we

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
supported on this architecture so we

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.439 
supported on this architecture so we
have<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.160> click<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.730> hit

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
have to do is right click on it and hit

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.530 
have to do is right click on it and hit
show<00:01:03.690> package<00:01:03.930> contents<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.210> then<00:01:06.210> you're<00:01:06.390> in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
show package contents and then you're in

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.830 
show package contents and then you're in
here<00:01:07.250> now<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.970> thing<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> I've<00:01:09.390> noticed<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
here now one thing that I've noticed is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.710 
here now one thing that I've noticed is
that<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.110> can't<00:01:10.470> edit<00:01:10.860> these<00:01:11.549> files<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that you can't edit these files if you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.770 
that you can't edit these files if you
try<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> it'll<00:01:13.590> give<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.920> an<00:01:14.070> error<00:01:14.340> message

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
try to it'll give you an error message

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.950 
try to it'll give you an error message
so<00:01:15.780> i<00:01:16.700> have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> feeling<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.270> something<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> do

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so i have a feeling as something to do

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
so i have a feeling as something to do
with<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.500> code<00:01:20.189> signature<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.830> here<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.759> can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
with the code signature and here you can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.170 
with the code signature and here you can
see<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.110> code<00:01:25.860> resources<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.970> as

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
see this is the code resources and as

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580 
see this is the code resources and as
all<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> files<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.439> figure

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
all the files if you can figure

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.020 
all the files if you can figure
something<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.729> lets<00:01:29.909> you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
something out with that that lets you

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.550 
something out with that that lets you
edit<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.600> pretty<00:01:30.840> cool<00:01:31.049> post<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
edit it that's pretty cool post a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.890 
edit it that's pretty cool post a
comment<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.009> something<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.450> can't<00:01:33.479> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
comment or something but you can't it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.350 
comment or something but you can't it
around<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.560> open<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> sound

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
around but you can open up all the sound

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.800 
around but you can open up all the sound
files<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.770> get<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.360> five<00:01:42.360> sound

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
files you can get all the five sound

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.969 
files you can get all the five sound
files<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> game<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:45.200> pictures<00:01:46.200> don't

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
files from the game the pictures don't

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.370 
files from the game the pictures don't
really<00:01:47.700> work<00:01:47.970> I've<00:01:48.720> found<00:01:50.810> they're<00:01:51.810> sort<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380

really work I've found they're sort of
they<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.060> blank<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.270> sounds

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
they are all just blank but the sounds

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.560 
they are all just blank but the sounds
do<00:01:57.509> work<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.670> and<00:02:00.770> some<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.890> them<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.189> work<00:02:02.399> like

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
do work so and some of them do work like

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.469 
do work so and some of them do work like
but<00:02:03.570> most<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.290> them<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> see

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
but most of them don't as you can see

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.990 
but most of them don't as you can see
there's<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.380> couple<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.039> work<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.580> most<00:02:08.819> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
there's a couple that work but most of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.400 
there's a couple that work but most of
them<00:02:09.119> don't<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:11.099> if<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.840> find<00:02:12.840> anything<00:02:13.140> else
