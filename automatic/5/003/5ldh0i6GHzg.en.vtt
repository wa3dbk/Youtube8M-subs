00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.489
 until then also blooming that can be seen well on the side plates 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:05.270
 but can open 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.200
 and then what you try to start this engine it's not like wine 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.849
 4-stroke engine that you can easily penetrate the Corinthians with the ball 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.710
 but you have to keep moving up and down 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.630
 or 4 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.740
 So you can not throw over the moto2 pilots and how is that 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.699
 in Kreuth been explained but 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.580
 you let the corks swing back and forth until one is now 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.439
 Movable joints that made and received inflammation 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.109
 uses 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.690
 among the guests percent 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.320
 but it says it is usually brought through by the new school 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.430
 October 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.670
 because of course, also happen 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.860
 that the engine will go back in the other direction for that we want so soon 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.750
 probably also have seen it before 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.750
 but you have to redirect 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.570
 Price of course the drivers 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.920
 given with these different work 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.080
 so the curious thing is that also attracted percent 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.940
 Throw what you so specifications of the engine the steering wheel 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.360
 is taken out of the holder and then ends then the engine 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.080
 Of course, the percent of this technique must also be mastered that is 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.450
 not so easy down I have a lot of respect for it 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.980
 but if you know and know your machine 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.990
 as in the 7th 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.940
 to start 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.940
 with all the peculiarities there really topic that already ene 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.050
 League this machine is equipped with a roof anyway at that time Vandans 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.050
 October has been flying well with percent 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 during the Gaps on Brunch front and back 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.880
 that's even a traffic engine the word 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.730
 externally given again 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.070
 because percent as good as pictures were but you can of course today 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.560
 Convert many percent that is easy 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.680
 Roters, of course, also ITP through this percent of this hobby 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.610
 had developed the CD 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.610
 or producer we have meanwhile developed all sorts of parts 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.970
 which you need to restore prey and yes his machines 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.650
 from 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.360
 Most notable is the presentation of the band of Glanz man 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.229
 can in principle 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:18.579
 today came free new and you can also a complete tug one 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.629
 complete Lanz Bulldog 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.359
 buy a new lanz-bulldog 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.849
 This is 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.829
 Audi is quite fascinating that 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.109
 Euro and such a format Baumann so really you can so very 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.109
 we look beautiful as a country 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 for the rest 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.350
 and percent are 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.349
 Of course we had to let this point be reached 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 im deeply anchored 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.199
 like a crazy music without cooling Mannheim 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.149
 on the side 2 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:01.149
 her second own Bantle 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.379
 because of fog, Italy could not see Italy again in the wild 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.379
 our performed 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.379
 There is none 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.659
 the car will 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.349
 who and Erfurt 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.609
 this one this 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.849
 In principle, simply because it is easy to use is very very robust 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.590
 five years ago what is here in many cities and whatever is vulnerable about 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.489
 Agriculture and so are the electrical installations with one 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.529
 electrical 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.529
 here you have to or have to deal with one that will 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:39.929
 whether there are problems 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.469
 and that has a supporting role 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.469
 if not the optimist is disappointed he just drives like that 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.089
 the author of this as a supporting band, of course, too 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:54.169
 which took a lot of time 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.239
 at that time like today 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.699
 but as I already said 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.699
 GGP he goes with the machine 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.719
 JP Morgan 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.969
 already that takes about ten minutes now she is of course super 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.969
 the last word is the living room 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.019
 Wittenberg Red 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.019
 Credit Agricole 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.169
 he showed it then the machine is off 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.909
 total are currently at approx 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.349
 the Shadows 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.219
 something special 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.370
 it is
