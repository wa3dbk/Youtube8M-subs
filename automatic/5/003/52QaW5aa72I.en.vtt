00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:43.550
 quotes them then this diagonal 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:01:04.280
 it was in winter that living it gives me the 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:06.200
 chance to end up with renault at 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.759
 from mafate so we finished 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.460
 all of a sudden it gave a little bit of 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:16.670
 lightness in the race and it makes you fall 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:20.570
 a little pressure for me ah well it 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.630
 5th but as far as there are the landscapes the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.700
 difficulties I live in sarthe 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.789
 metropolis so for those who 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.049
 know these super full what the 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:36.619
 culmination it ensures m it makes you 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.009
 nothing to train I have a little 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.920
 coast next to my home that is 30 m 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.140
 so to represent you a little bit 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.100
 challenge that I had put in coming 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.750
 here what then the victory I thought 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.420
 not I thought I'll come I'll 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.129
 do a great hike and then and then 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.459
 we'll see who's actually on the front 

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.640
 of sea 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.890
 it's gone a little fast and then me 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.129
 I like to run fast so I'm 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.539
 taken to the game and then afterwards until they 

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:07.580
 you have texteurs ben it's the same 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.399
 tell where the goods so so here is 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.250
 big I did the first third well 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.500
 rather well placed and then with a 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.599
 good pace after me what I found 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.250
 harder it was a complaint from 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.530
 guerlÃ©dan what the end of marabouts and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.739
 then the plateau because alive where it was 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.099
 really a specific terrain and very 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:32.060
 technique and there I am really not 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:35.209
 live on it and then after a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.620
 well the rest it was the waterfall 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.549
 bravery 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.870
 the tai and all ages had been able to re 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.629
 a recognition of the week 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.659
 last did not listen to him sure anymore and 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:51.230
 then good mafate it was superb 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:55.940
 it was beautiful to get out is that a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.390
 plateau if but hey that's done and 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.159
 then and then bah the end actually we are 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.220
 a little feeling not to see holy 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.260
