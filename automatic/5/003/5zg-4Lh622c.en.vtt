now<00:03:02.150> we're<00:03:02.330> ready<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.659> tight<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.170> shot

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
now we're ready it's tight in the shot

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.460 
now we're ready it's tight in the shot
cords<00:03:03.890> on<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.459> hood<00:03:04.579> cover<00:03:05.019> let's<00:03:06.019> do<00:03:06.260> this

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
cords on the hood cover let's do this

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.170 
cords on the hood cover let's do this
we're<00:03:06.739> going<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.920> start<00:03:07.280> at<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.670> beginning<00:03:07.760> of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
we're going to start at the beginning of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.059 
we're going to start at the beginning of
the<00:03:08.269> shock<00:03:08.510> cord<00:03:08.810> which<00:03:09.500> goes<00:03:09.709> into<00:03:09.950> the

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
the shock cord which goes into the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.860 
the shock cord which goes into the
fabric<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.879> shock<00:03:11.120> cord<00:03:11.390> goes<00:03:11.569> all<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
fabric and the shock cord goes all the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.929 
fabric and the shock cord goes all the
way<00:03:12.019> around<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.530> hood<00:03:12.680> cover<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.640> we'll<00:03:13.730> start

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
way around the hood cover so we'll start

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:20.589 
way around the hood cover so we'll start
to<00:03:14.060> pull<00:03:14.299> this<00:03:19.030> you'll<00:03:20.030> then<00:03:20.239> take<00:03:20.269> the

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
to pull this you'll then take the

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.899 
to pull this you'll then take the
plastic<00:03:21.019> stopper<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:22.159> was<00:03:22.280> located<00:03:22.640> at<00:03:22.819> the

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
plastic stopper it was located at the

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.940 
plastic stopper it was located at the
beginning<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.329> shock<00:03:23.510> cord<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.110> cinch<00:03:24.799> it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
beginning of the shock cord and cinch it

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.789 
beginning of the shock cord and cinch it
down<00:03:25.010> all<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.730> way<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.359> fabric<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.680> you

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
down all the way to the fabric and you

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.580 
down all the way to the fabric and you
want<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.040> get<00:03:31.129> it<00:03:31.220> good<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.400> tight<00:03:32.590> you'll

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
want to get it good and tight you'll

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.069 
want to get it good and tight you'll
then<00:03:33.769> take<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.099> excess<00:03:34.459> cord<00:03:34.900> pull<00:03:35.900> it

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
then take the excess cord pull it

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.780 
then take the excess cord pull it
through<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.680> loop<00:03:36.829> on<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.129> side<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.640> the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
through the loop on the side and the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.129 
through the loop on the side and the
loop<00:03:37.940> at<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.120> top<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:41.209> then<00:03:41.329> we'll<00:03:41.450> then<00:03:41.870> take

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
loop at the top and then we'll then take

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.110 
loop at the top and then we'll then take
all<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.530> slack<00:03:42.859> that's<00:03:43.159> located<00:03:43.579> next<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:44.030> the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
all the slack that's located next to the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:52.710 
all the slack that's located next to the
hook<00:03:44.359> in<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.659> loop<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.680> pull<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:46.129> tight

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.210 

well<00:03:53.720> then<00:03:53.870> cinch<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.470> down<00:03:54.530> using<00:03:54.980> the

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
well then cinch this down using the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.250 
well then cinch this down using the
plastic<00:03:55.670> stopper<00:03:55.909> that<00:03:56.269> was<00:03:56.510> at<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.840> end<00:03:56.870> of

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
plastic stopper that was at the end of

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:09.649 
plastic stopper that was at the end of
the<00:03:57.470> shock<00:03:57.739> cord

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.270 

you<00:04:10.140> may<00:04:10.260> need<00:04:10.409> to<00:04:10.469> repeat<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:10.950> step<00:04:11.189> a

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
you may need to repeat this step a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.589 
you may need to repeat this step a
couple<00:04:11.310> times<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.909> make<00:04:12.060> sure<00:04:12.180> everything<00:04:12.569> is

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
couple times and make sure everything is

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.649 
couple times and make sure everything is
tight<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.489> I'll<00:04:14.489> do<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.790> same<00:04:14.969> process<00:04:15.269> on

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
tight and I'll do the same process on

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.820 
tight and I'll do the same process on
the<00:04:15.780> opposite<00:04:16.169> side<00:04:21.139> now<00:04:22.139> you're<00:04:22.620> going<00:04:22.770> to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
the opposite side now you're going to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.590 
the opposite side now you're going to
end<00:04:22.979> up<00:04:23.100> with<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.310> lot<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.580> excess<00:04:24.030> shock<00:04:24.300> cord

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
end up with a lot of excess shock cord

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.200 
end up with a lot of excess shock cord
and<00:04:24.750> it's<00:04:24.840> important<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.350> make<00:04:25.949> sure<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.340> tie

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
and it's important to make sure you tie

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.760 
and it's important to make sure you tie
this<00:04:27.270> up<00:04:27.660> somehow<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.110> make<00:04:28.349> sure<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.620> doesn't

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
this up somehow to make sure it doesn't

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.980 
this up somehow to make sure it doesn't
fall<00:04:29.070> into<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.370> engine<00:04:29.699> bay<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:30.570> best<00:04:30.810> way<00:04:30.960> to

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
fall into the engine bay the best way to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.890 
fall into the engine bay the best way to
do<00:04:31.259> this<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.669> loop<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.030> back<00:04:33.270> through<00:04:33.660> the

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
do this is to loop it back through the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:43.170 
do this is to loop it back through the
fabric<00:04:34.650> loop<00:04:35.039> from<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.030> head<00:04:36.180> cover

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.060 

we'll<00:04:43.750> take<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.080> back<00:04:44.290> through<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.800> other

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
we'll take it back through the other

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:53.210 
we'll take it back through the other
fabric<00:04:45.430> loop<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.630> tie<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.870> knot

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.860 

this<00:04:53.700> is<00:04:53.850> going<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.030> ensure<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.390> it<00:04:54.690> doesn't

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
this is going to ensure that it doesn't

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.380 
this is going to ensure that it doesn't
hang<00:04:55.140> into<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.500> engine<00:04:55.770> bay<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.640> same<00:04:57.120> thing

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
hang into the engine bay the same thing

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.750 
hang into the engine bay the same thing
on<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.600> opposite<00:04:57.930> side<00:04:58.190> all<00:04:59.190> right<00:04:59.370> let's<00:04:59.610> see

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
on the opposite side all right let's see

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.150 
on the opposite side all right let's see
how<00:04:59.850> it<00:04:59.940> looks<00:05:03.470> last<00:05:04.470> thing<00:05:04.680> you<00:05:04.770> want<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.040> do

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
how it looks last thing you want to do

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.590 
how it looks last thing you want to do
is<00:05:05.310> just<00:05:05.460> make<00:05:05.700> sure<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:06.090> hood<00:05:06.240> cover<00:05:06.420> is

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
is just make sure the hood cover is

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.180 
is just make sure the hood cover is
straight<00:05:06.990> make<00:05:07.290> sure<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:07.590> completely<00:05:07.920> wrap

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
straight make sure it's completely wrap

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.030 
straight make sure it's completely wrap
around<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.580> car<00:05:08.760> hood<00:05:09.620> get<00:05:10.620> out<00:05:10.710> any<00:05:10.920> of
