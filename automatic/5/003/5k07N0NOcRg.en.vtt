00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.429
 good morning guys now I will show you how 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.500
 realized my strobe starting from a 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.440
 simple tutorial the material 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.150
 essential will be simple material 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.920
 electronic that you can recover from 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.070
 old components or even go to 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.500
 buy maximum spending of 3 euros ray 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.529
 maximum it will be necessary to build a base 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.720
 similar to this then the other component 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.530
 essential a led strip like 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.590
 this can be retrieved for example 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 in stores that sell accessories 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
 stick between cars or even on the internet 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 also these you pay on the 10 euros if it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 they are also bigger and more 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.090
 small with different colors these for 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.039
 example groups and then finally the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.420
 container that this is the sanction 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.770
 mind I found this then you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.870
 you can also use something else 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.770
 to make it of wood for example or 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.390
 plastic as you prefer is 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.430
 then quite simple 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 just make two holes to be able to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.049
 place two potentiometers now 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.520
 make the box I think it is 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.890
 quite simple the led strip 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.170
 simply mounted on a piece of 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.180
 plastic to which they were then 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.460
 connected two negative positive cables 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.210
 feeding 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.890
 I think it's time to concentrate 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.280
 on the ticket 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.420
 on the control circuit I purchase 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.830
 now you can see the outline I have 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 made of the circuit 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.860
 overall you see n 556 which is not 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 other than a pairing of 2 years and 5 5 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.189
 5 in the sense that within one there is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.900
 they are two in the upper part yes 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.640
 find the n that is dedicated to 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.310
 power adjustment of the brightness 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 in the lower part instead is the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.390
 timer adjustment in quotes that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.640
 is what we notice as 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.549
 slow down in the impulse 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.060
 bright on the right side instead 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.680
 we find the LEDs and the power amp 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.070
 if you need clarifications you can always 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.930
 a comment or message will happen to me 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 to make the electronic board 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.000
 we will need two thousand cards 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.420
 forio one ie look at the dimensions 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.240
 they are very small 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.310
 and electronic components which then them 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.930
 I'll put a list to retrieve the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.720
 electronic components I have disassembled 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.970
 old cards like this for example is 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.040
 now proceed to disassemble this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.130
 components know here which is a 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.330
 electrolytic capacitor from a micro 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.610
 does the udc is necessary for the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.260
 working and I'll do it 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.160
 I'll just show you how 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.980
 we will need the soldering iron 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.720
 if you have the pump sucks tin 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.769
 what a useful advice 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.739
 use it 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.200
 if you can't do it even without it 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.450
 it is first of all before proceeding 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.330
 you need to understand what the component is from 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.190
 desalle give in this case should 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.780
 be this here or this one here it is 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.489
 here should be this come on 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.970
 in short, we try to see if 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:11.739
 I can and solder this reference should be made 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:16.510
 look has already done the two come off 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.459
 feet and then you find a little move on 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.380
 component to see if you can 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:26.019
 unplug it if you don't have enough 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.680
 simple anyway because it will be enough for you 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:44.049
 simply take the soldering iron e 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:47.160
 we had to pay in a short time we should 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.160
 even manage to take it off 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.690
 here is the soldier's component one 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.810
 once you have prepared the ticket 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.549
 control electronics does not remain that 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.989
 install everything then take the 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.519
 led strip with two cables 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.510
 of the power supply and weld them 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.250
 also like fencing at the circuit 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.609
 electronic 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.750
 then the two potentiometers installed in the 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:16.450
 box 12 will have their respective 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.519
 cables that these as from the screen ne 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.590
 will be connected to the ticket of 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.680
 command and finally does not remain that then from 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.000
 close the whole inserted card 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.310
 with 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.090
 the connected wires remember to 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.800
 prepare a hole for feeding 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.380
 and all that remains is to close everything 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.340
 so we have our social had 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.320
 pushed gently into the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:50.630
 box which as you can see fits 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:54.150
 perfectly few that falls here 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.610
 we finished as you can see now 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.530
 this wishing you could stop with 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.900
 a little glue we will have our cables 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.060
 of power the enhancements of 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.410
 adjustment if you want you can install yourself 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.410
 also of the knobs p
