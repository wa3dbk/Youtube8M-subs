kitchen they move to get out of the cold

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.640 
kitchen they move to get out of the cold
and<00:01:38.420> we<00:01:38.570> go<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.780> warm<00:01:39.050> air<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.440> wintertime

so conservation requests our mission is

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.310 
so conservation requests our mission is
to<00:02:11.350> protect<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.220> connect<00:02:13.020> wildlife<00:02:14.020> and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
to protect and connect wildlife and

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.710 
to protect and connect wildlife and
their<00:02:14.440> habitats<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.520> Northwest<00:02:16.000> and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
their habitats here in the Northwest and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.380 
their habitats here in the Northwest and
so<00:02:17.080> gold<00:02:17.680> Creek<00:02:18.010> came<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.490> mine<00:02:18.700> as<00:02:19.000> an<00:02:19.120> obvious

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
so gold Creek came to mine as an obvious

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.060 
so gold Creek came to mine as an obvious
place<00:02:19.930> where<00:02:20.320> we're<00:02:20.500> able<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.800> tell<00:02:21.040> that

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
place where we're able to tell that

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.180 
place where we're able to tell that
story<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.810> we're<00:02:22.960> hoping<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.410> get<00:02:23.710> out<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.100> that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
story so we're hoping to get out of that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.250 
story so we're hoping to get out of that
pike<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.820> flight<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.930> be<00:02:26.050> able<00:02:26.110> to

a bit of Hope in Banff in Canada they

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.439 
a bit of Hope in Banff in Canada they
actually<00:04:00.650> have<00:04:00.949> shots<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.579> Grizzlies<00:04:02.090> going

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.229 
over the wildlife crossing structures
and<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:06.049> think<00:04:06.290> our<00:04:06.409> job<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.609> do<00:04:07.969> what<00:04:08.120> we

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
and I think our job is is to do what we

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.149 
and I think our job is is to do what we
can<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.540> start<00:04:08.930> restoring<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.439> habitat<00:04:09.919> to

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
can to start restoring the habitat to

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.039 
can to start restoring the habitat to
make<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.459> approaches<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.389> interstate<00:04:11.870> as

make the approaches to the interstate as

make the approaches to the interstate as

are moving through here people were
surprised<00:04:50.300> we<00:04:50.720> had<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.169> kind<00:04:51.380> of<00:04:51.440> wildlife<00:04:51.889> we

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
surprised we had the kind of wildlife we

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.399 
surprised we had the kind of wildlife we
do<00:04:52.190> out<00:04:52.370> there<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:52.940> there's<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.840> certain<00:04:54.229> thing

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
do out there and there's a certain thing

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.260 
do out there and there's a certain thing
of<00:04:54.530> loving<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:54.949> landscape<00:04:55.490> but<00:04:55.520> understanding

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
of loving a landscape but understanding

that<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.479> alive<00:04:56.870> at<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.409> same<00:04:57.620> time<00:04:57.919> there's

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
that it's alive at the same time there's

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.850 
that it's alive at the same time there's
a<00:04:58.400> reason<00:04:58.940> we're<00:04:59.120> protecting<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.810> beyond<00:05:00.650> just

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860

the<00:05:01.099> notion<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.520> it's<00:05:01.729> beautiful<00:05:02.270> and
