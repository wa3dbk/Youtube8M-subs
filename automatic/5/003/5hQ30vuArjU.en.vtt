demonstrating a trigger point release
using<00:00:15.179> two<00:00:15.540> tennis<00:00:15.929> balls<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.010> see

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
using two tennis balls as you can see

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.950 
using two tennis balls as you can see
we've<00:00:17.490> connected<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> text<00:00:18.390> balls<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.720> duct

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
we've connected the text balls with duct

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.170 
we've connected the text balls with duct
tape<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.350> we've<00:00:19.500> joined<00:00:19.619> them<00:00:19.800> together<00:00:20.180> push

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
tape so we've joined them together push

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.640 
tape so we've joined them together push
down<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.570> duct<00:00:21.779> tape<00:00:21.840> allowing<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
down on the duct tape allowing for a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.920 
down on the duct tape allowing for a
little<00:00:22.980> bit<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.220> space<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.730> between<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:24.810> you

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
little bit of space in between so as you

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.470 
little bit of space in between so as you
do<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:26.039> spinous<00:00:26.760> process<00:00:27.180> watching

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
do this the spinous process watching

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089 
do this the spinous process watching
vertebrates<00:00:27.930> gonna<00:00:28.199> fit<00:00:28.410> right<00:00:28.740> into<00:00:28.949> this

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
vertebrates gonna fit right into this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099 
vertebrates gonna fit right into this
little<00:00:29.310> groove<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.750> balls<00:00:30.990> are

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
little groove here and the balls are

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.290 
little groove here and the balls are
gonna<00:00:31.320> run<00:00:31.980> along<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> sides<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> spine

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
gonna run along the sides of the spine

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.690 
gonna run along the sides of the spine
where<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> musculature<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:35.219> we've<00:00:35.550> got

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
where the musculature is so we've got

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
where the musculature is so we've got
Mickey<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> help<00:00:36.420> us<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.960> give<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
Mickey here to help us out so give you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.220 
Mickey here to help us out so give you
this<00:00:37.710> perfect<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.600> we'll<00:00:39.870> start<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.200> with

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
this perfect and so we'll start out with

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.530 
this perfect and so we'll start out with
the<00:00:40.410> demonstration<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.610> trigger<00:00:42.030> point<00:00:42.239> in

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the demonstration of a trigger point in

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.360 
the demonstration of a trigger point in
the<00:00:42.690> upper<00:00:42.930> back<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.160> thoracic<00:00:44.340> reach

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
the upper back here the thoracic reach

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.279 
the upper back here the thoracic reach
so<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:47.730> he's<00:00:48.210> racing<00:00:48.930> herself

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
so as you can see he's racing herself

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
so as you can see he's racing herself
she's<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.980> holding<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.460> position<00:00:50.700> now

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
she's just holding this position now

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.270 
she's just holding this position now
there's<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> lot<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.350> movement<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.100> goes

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
there's not a lot of movement that goes

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.100 
there's not a lot of movement that goes
on<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> more<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.539> compression

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
on here this is more of a compression

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.650 
on here this is more of a compression
you're<00:00:55.800> gonna<00:00:55.920> find<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.460> tender<00:00:57.090> area<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
you're gonna find that tender area and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.349 
you're gonna find that tender area and
just<00:00:57.719> compress<00:00:58.590> into<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.460> probably<00:01:00.149> hold

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
just compress into it and probably hold

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.080 
just compress into it and probably hold
it<00:01:00.480> anywhere<00:01:00.780> from<00:01:00.899> 15<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> 30<00:01:01.829> seconds<00:01:02.309> how's

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds how's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.660 
it anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds how's
that<00:01:03.300> feel<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> tender<00:01:04.500> yeah<00:01:04.890> don't

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that feel I have to tender yeah don't

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
that feel I have to tender yeah don't
you<00:01:05.820> forget<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.210> breathe<00:01:06.799> exactly<00:01:07.799> oh<00:01:07.830> very

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you forget to breathe exactly oh very

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.109 
you forget to breathe exactly oh very
good<00:01:08.369> point<00:01:08.610> step<00:01:12.049> great<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:14.850> could<00:01:15.000> do

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
good point step great and you could do

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.820 
good point step great and you could do
this<00:01:15.270> along<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> entire<00:01:16.140> length<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
this along the entire length of the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.800 
this along the entire length of the
spine<00:01:17.130> where<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> true<00:01:18.240> power<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> this

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
spine where the true power of this

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050 
spine where the true power of this
technique<00:01:19.259> uses<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.100> sacral<00:01:20.549> base<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.030> use

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
technique uses in the sacral base we use

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
technique uses in the sacral base we use
this<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.659> quite<00:01:21.930> effective<00:01:22.439> sequel<00:01:22.920> base

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this for quite effective sequel base

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.760 
this for quite effective sequel base
release<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.229> straight<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
release so now we're going straight to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.940 
release so now we're going straight to
maybe<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.640> lumbar<00:01:27.000> region<00:01:27.450> there

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
maybe a bit of a lumbar region there

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.219 
maybe a bit of a lumbar region there
perfect<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.450> Mickey's<00:01:30.960> come

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
perfect so as you can see Mickey's come

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
perfect so as you can see Mickey's come
up<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.560> her<00:01:31.770> pelvis<00:01:32.549> she's<00:01:32.880> using<00:01:33.090> her<00:01:33.329> legs

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
up with her pelvis she's using her legs

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990 
up with her pelvis she's using her legs
to<00:01:33.810> stabilize<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.710> once<00:01:35.460> again<00:01:35.610> there's<00:01:35.880> not

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to stabilize and once again there's not

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.569 
to stabilize and once again there's not
a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.450> movement<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.110> biting<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> pelvis

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
a lot of movement but biting the pelvis

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.310 
a lot of movement but biting the pelvis
forward<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.060> back<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> create<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.200> bit

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
forward and back and create a little bit

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.770 
forward and back and create a little bit
of<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.590> rocking<00:01:41.009> motion<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.790> help<00:01:42.000> release<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
of a rocking motion to help release the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.060 
of a rocking motion to help release the
trigger<00:01:43.170> points<00:01:43.729> how's<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.939> felt<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
trigger points how's that felt and you

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.830 
trigger points how's that felt and you
can<00:01:50.220> control<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.090> depth<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> amount

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
can control the the depth and the amount

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.200 
can control the the depth and the amount
of<00:01:51.899> pressure<00:01:52.140> you're<00:01:52.530> using<00:01:52.710> by<00:01:53.040> using<00:01:54.000> your

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
of pressure you're using by using your

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.230 
of pressure you're using by using your
feet<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.570> think<00:01:54.780> right

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
feet I think right

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.389 
feet I think right
you<00:01:55.450> push<00:01:55.689> it<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.930> your<00:01:56.049> heel<00:01:56.229> sir<00:01:56.619> yeah<00:01:57.130> using

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
you push it to your heel sir yeah using

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.920 
you push it to your heel sir yeah using
your<00:01:57.549> elearn<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:58.210> can<00:01:58.390> take<00:01:58.689> off<00:01:58.869> a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
your elearn then you can take off a

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.380 
your elearn then you can take off a
little<00:01:59.170> bit<00:01:59.290> of<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.470> pressure<00:02:00.299> relaxing<00:02:01.299> a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
little bit of the pressure relaxing a

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.880 
little bit of the pressure relaxing a
little<00:02:01.630> bit<00:02:01.750> more<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.170> can<00:02:02.350> put<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> lot<00:02:02.710> more

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
little bit more you can put a lot more

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.440 
little bit more you can put a lot more
force<00:02:03.159> on<00:02:03.369> top<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.909> just<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.180> great

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
force on top this is just a great

the sacral base okay so as you can see

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.050 
the sacral base okay so as you can see
she's<00:02:14.260> positioning<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.040> all<00:02:15.220> they're<00:02:15.489> good

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
you know the amount of pressure you're

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.820 
you know the amount of pressure you're
using<00:02:25.630> using<00:02:26.080> their<00:02:26.200> legs<00:02:26.410> as<00:02:26.560> Mickey

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.449 
bit of a pelvic tilt turn yeah you just
kind<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.600> by<00:02:34.600> pushing<00:02:34.900> with<00:02:35.739> your<00:02:35.769> fingers<00:02:36.280> you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
balls a little bit further down and then

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.449 
balls a little bit further down and then
by<00:02:44.019> pushing<00:02:44.230> forward<00:02:44.739> with<00:02:44.830> your<00:02:44.950> thumbs<00:02:45.220> you

can feel your pelvic going forward and
that's<00:02:47.769> going<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.220> raising<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.700> further<00:02:48.940> up

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
that's going to be raising it further up

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.110 
that's going to be raising it further up
along<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.540> sacrum<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:51.370> then<00:02:51.580> finding<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
along the sacrum and then finding the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.920 
along the sacrum and then finding the
little<00:02:52.510> area<00:02:52.989> of<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.349> hurt<00:02:54.569> it's<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.660> very

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
little area of that hurt it's a very

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.350 
little area of that hurt it's a very
effective<00:02:56.349> technique<00:02:56.670> from<00:02:57.670> working<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.150> any

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
effective technique from working out any

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.240 
effective technique from working out any
restrictions<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.440> base<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.890> sacrum

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
restrictions of the base of the sacrum

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.009 
restrictions of the base of the sacrum
there<00:03:00.400> sometimes<00:03:01.150> it's<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.390> bit<00:03:01.540> difficult<00:03:01.959> to

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
there sometimes it's a bit difficult to

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.170 
there sometimes it's a bit difficult to
get<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.590> foam<00:03:03.130> roller<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.970> two

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
get with a foam roller but the two

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.640 
get with a foam roller but the two
tennis<00:03:04.510> balls<00:03:04.720> connected<00:03:05.230> with<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.440> duct

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
tennis balls connected with the duct

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.650 
tennis balls connected with the duct
tape<00:03:05.859> it's<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.340> great<00:03:06.670> exercise<00:03:07.150> for<00:03:07.180> releasing

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
tape it's a great exercise for releasing

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:41.460 
tape it's a great exercise for releasing
this<00:03:07.870> area<00:03:10.980> excellent

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470
