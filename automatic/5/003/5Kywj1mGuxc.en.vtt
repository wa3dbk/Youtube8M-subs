00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.950
 two weeks of four kilos less than 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.050
 seven hours of daily training a lot

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.280
 swimming is the adventure of Lanzarote 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.530
 Today I leave you with a video that is a 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.570
 session of mobility and stretching 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.179
 with the duathlon world champion 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.220
 russia rock but before you see this 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.899
 is that I want to show you a bit of what 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.759
 go to one of the things that will be in the 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:29.169
 video to who from lanzarote was that this 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.169
 we recorded it right there to see 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.040
 my mother who is my mother's ass 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.870
 comfort 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.490
 Juan giving him cane for a good one and the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.160
 thing follows this that you see here 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.630
 moving is the hand of ginés díaz that 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.000
 is who has helped me record everything 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.310
 this and in 45 days and now I'm going to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.630
 berlin to continue training and with some 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.100
 pretty work meetings 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.100
 important that we have with Gordon so 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.860
 no and after this and direct to 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.220
 few gentlemen this is not for this is not 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.110
 for and this just just started to like 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.270
 It costs nothing if you feel like 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.060
 keep watching San Juan around the world 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.790
 with trainings with trips and with cities and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.400
 with curro and everything that is needed 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.250
 give a little mike to the pussy video that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.450
 help me a lot and it costs money we 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.860
 to do is that it can be even 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.680
 when you have warmed the series a little 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.810
 it's a bit between stretches and 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.240
 joint mobility that serves to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.250
 activate a cube with the body and in this 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.290
 case now then put it in its place you 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.450
 we give from top to bottom to say 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.040
 who does not eat 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.310
 let's say yes 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.860
 always in gentle movements this I what 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.580
 you pay 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.990
 always soft moments but with the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.340
 maximum possible mobility according 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.939
 let's do there's a little bit of laps 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.679
 slowly but the maximum mobility 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.700
 possible the whole body we move the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.420
 shoulders 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.250
 from now on you are making me some 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.920
 sexy movements that any time 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.910
 He left the camera and put it in its place in 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.910
 this means the beard 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.740
 here there are many of this breakthrough we are going to 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.900
 move the arms 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.240
 maximum forward maximum mobility 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.220
 mobility behind 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.350
 so that one of fun comes that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.350
 know me already knows it well and so 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.830
 to the camera that we go on all fours 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.830
 everyone 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.530
 the two above 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.530
 he was getting great now 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.450
 host for the dyslexics 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.450
 and quickie 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.750
 but I know how many years have been training 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:12.980
 this and it comes out half one-eyed or lion these 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.980
 arms that want to take off 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.160
 but good 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.360
 if it moves is to say 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.640
 vigilant not having anyone behind 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.110
 because if 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.640
 the boys do not correct them for richter 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:41.040
 the damn 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:46.520
 good fuck beard a couple of days 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.520
 today you are not shaved please 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.060
 because if you throw more palante you will attack 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.680
 the goal of the face 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.480
 when we run we basically work 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.670
 the bottom is the important thing is 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.310
 work or stretch more or less the part 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.580
 lower legs quadriceps ischiums 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.450
 twins more or less with this we will cover 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.450
 The file 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.450
 very easy quadriceps the stretch of 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.310
 all our lives here we help each other 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.660
 little by hand to stretch more 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.660
 this area here 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.180
 and the one that falls first as we do 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.520
 the stretch 10 the world 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.770
 as long no more than 15 seconds are not 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.340
 try to be there with colleagues there 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.800
 it's good that we put doing here 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.750
 and you can talk to each other no no no no when 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.010
 we stretch we stretch very concentrated in 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.600
 Stretching because it's a job 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.290
 important we change the leg 10 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.479
 seconds without pain be we notice that strip 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.090
 the muscle but without pain is not about 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.620
 gain flexibility for that we can 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.090
 do another flexibility training 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.880
 but this is not an extra training 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.949
 is to recover replenish the muscle where 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.390
 we were done quadriceps we're going to 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.490
 do 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.400
 if it were a little higher we would come 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.689
 better what is the position to try 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.539
 align the two feet and look 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:11.249
 the opposite foot according sought to 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.499
 a slightly higher position you have to 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:17.969
 notice that if you throw this away you 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:20.759
 we work for ten seconds and change the 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:24.149
 foot and leg moved against the 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.919
 site in the leg because I break is what 

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:28.369
 which is known as stretching the 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.369
 paper bin 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.500
 how could we also stretch muscles 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.840
 otherwise if we do not have anything then 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.070
 we get like this and go down this does not 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.700
 you record that it went wrong 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.700
 it's worth here 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.280
 without looking for rebounds just stretching 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.510
 looking to try to touch the palm of the 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.970
 hand on the floor now who touches the 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.860
 palm of the hand on the ground the palm of the 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.520
 palm to nobody in some palm I do not see 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.520
 no way 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.730
 that you do not get to your knees like 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:05.280
 men you have to stretch a little more 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.280
 we have quadriceps and scion stretched 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.669
 the sun I put on a curb and 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.940
 we throw away ay ay ay we throw the whole area 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.190
 of the twin even the tendon always 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.540
 ten seconds without forcing much alone 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.560
 noticing the stretch 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.560
 and we change 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:34.350
 well i like rue 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:36.500
 The recórcholis basket are very basic 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:40.140
 there are 50 million more stretches 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.580
 but with this we save the file 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.360
 of stretching or come a strong 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.360
 applause for rousseff 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.490
 and now you have to go through each one 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:56.000
 give a euro one euro until we go 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.000
 make friends
