so<00:01:29.880> great<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.479> ribbon<00:01:30.749> because<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.380> were

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
so great for ribbon because if you were

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.190 
so great for ribbon because if you were
using<00:01:31.679> liquid<00:01:32.100> glue<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.299> were<00:01:33.479> trying<00:01:33.869> to

put<00:01:34.829> regular<00:01:35.219> tape<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.609> the<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.969> it<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
put regular tape on the back of it it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
put regular tape on the back of it it
just<00:01:36.359> would<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.810> horrible<00:01:37.439> mess<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:37.920> this

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159
