 who deliver each year to each generator, whether Keeper Ariel or St becomes one 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.739
 subjected to extensive testing 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.980
 we want to show you with what enormous effort for the generators 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.980
 test and prepared for shipping 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.570
 every original sold is opened and the generator and accessories 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.570
 more careful 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.300
 it will now open like the servo flap around the generator with the test 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.680
 necessary supplies 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 Meinecke 8 is scrupulously accurate to the right height 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.350
 the following filling of the engine oil is by means of a 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 commercial funnel made 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.469
 The serial number of the generator from the internal test report now applies 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.469
 as noted 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.309
 Now Fischer is fueling in with quotations from Fritsch 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.930
 with the added quantity of gasoline the generator later becomes too 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.929
 need of the fuel is tested 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.149
 after filling the operating materials 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.149
 Â«When the generators are released for the first test run 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.389
 before the unit is started for the first time, the video camera is put into position 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.379
 to document both the start and the entire test 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.440
 now the serial number of the generator is held in front of the camera and 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.440
 additionally filed again 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.620
 The generator test Bruns has a hearty over under Last &amp; Cie 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.430
 running camera 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.690
 Now both the external impression of the housing as well as the own city 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.690
 except for serial number of the engine 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.360
 It follows an examination of all Schalke wants to stand cables and hoses 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.729
 The generator lights so landed until the fuel is completely consumed 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:32.039
 is
