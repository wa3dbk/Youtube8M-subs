immediately<00:00:45.800> is<00:00:46.159> a<00:00:46.460> good<00:00:46.789> sign<00:00:46.999> that<00:00:47.030> means

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
immediately is a good sign that means

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.259 
immediately is a good sign that means
they've<00:00:47.569> done<00:00:47.780> half<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.409> work<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.039> then<00:00:49.269> I'll

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
they've done half the work and then I'll

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
do about 5% and we'll do the rest so

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.379 
do about 5% and we'll do the rest so
it's<00:00:54.229> been<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.469> great<00:00:54.620> process<00:00:54.859> I<00:00:55.280> always<00:00:56.179> find

as<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.110> performer<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.830> was<00:01:07.700> not<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:08.120> was<00:01:08.180> by<00:01:08.900> myself

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
as a performer I was not I was by myself

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
as a performer I was not I was by myself
I<00:01:09.470> think<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:10.330> would<00:01:11.330> have<00:01:11.390> enjoyed<00:01:11.750> being<00:01:12.440> in

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
I think I would have enjoyed being in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.830 
I think I would have enjoyed being in
the<00:01:13.280> room<00:01:13.430> with<00:01:13.490> everyone<00:01:13.850> but<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:14.690> know<00:01:14.810> a

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
the room with everyone but you know a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.740 
the room with everyone but you know a
lot<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.140> what<00:01:15.410> I<00:01:15.440> was<00:01:15.680> doing<00:01:15.710> was<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:18.470> know<00:01:18.590> for

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
lot of what I was doing was you know for

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.600 
lot of what I was doing was you know for
9,000<00:01:20.750> takes<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:21.320> know<00:01:21.890> there's<00:01:22.100> no<00:01:22.250> reason

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
9,000 takes so I know there's no reason

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.920 
9,000 takes so I know there's no reason
that<00:01:22.640> Joel<00:01:23.000> Murray<00:01:23.210> has<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.600> sit<00:01:23.870> around

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
that Joel Murray has to sit around

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.140 
that Joel Murray has to sit around
listen<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.410> me<00:01:24.500> doing<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:24.890> but<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:26.030> would

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
listen to me doing that but it would

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.430 
listen to me doing that but it would
have<00:01:26.210> been<00:01:26.330> fun<00:01:26.510> to<00:01:26.540> bounce<00:01:26.780> off<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.140> people

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
have been fun to bounce off of people

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.430 
have been fun to bounce off of people
but<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.740> don't<00:01:27.980> really<00:01:28.220> have<00:01:28.880> banter<00:01:29.630> I'd<00:01:30.050> throw

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
but I don't really have banter I'd throw

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.320 
but I don't really have banter I'd throw
in<00:01:30.560> an<00:01:30.680> absurd<00:01:30.980> non<00:01:31.310> sequitur<00:01:31.820> here<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.180> there

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
in an absurd non sequitur here and there

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.680 
in an absurd non sequitur here and there
and<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:33.890> think<00:01:34.010> it<00:01:34.460> was<00:01:34.610> they<00:01:35.360> needed<00:01:35.510> to

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
and and so I think it was they needed to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.290 
and and so I think it was they needed to
be<00:01:35.810> isolated<00:01:36.620> to<00:01:36.890> get<00:01:37.160> that<00:01:37.370> in<00:01:37.880> terms<00:01:38.180> of

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
be isolated to get that in terms of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.520 
be isolated to get that in terms of
something<00:01:38.510> like<00:01:38.690> this<00:01:38.900> where<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.290> becomes

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
something like this where it becomes

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.040 
something like this where it becomes
almost<00:01:39.920> purely<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.490> vocal<00:01:40.940> exercise<00:01:41.060> or

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
almost purely a vocal exercise or

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.470 
almost purely a vocal exercise or
something<00:01:42.410> like<00:01:42.590> Pacific<00:01:43.160> Rim<00:01:43.490> which<00:01:43.730> I<00:01:44.030> can't

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
something like Pacific Rim which I can't

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.850 
something like Pacific Rim which I can't
imagine<00:01:44.570> where<00:01:44.930> physical<00:01:45.410> shoots<00:01:45.620> and<00:01:45.740> when<00:01:45.830> I

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
imagine where physical shoots and when I

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.560 
imagine where physical shoots and when I
saw<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.100> guys<00:01:46.280> going<00:01:46.610> through<00:01:46.640> yeah<00:01:47.060> very

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
saw you guys going through yeah very

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.150 
saw you guys going through yeah very
different<00:01:47.660> challenges<00:01:48.350> how<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:48.920> prepare
