my mom just thought that'd be easier for
me<00:04:50.250> so<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:50.760> makes<00:04:50.790> me<00:04:50.970> think<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.180> my<00:04:51.300> mom<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:51.930> I

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
me so it makes me think of my mom so I I

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.440 
me so it makes me think of my mom so I I
get<00:04:53.040> them<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.430> when<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.610> have<00:04:53.970> little<00:04:54.180> girls
