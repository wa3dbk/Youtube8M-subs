00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello guys welcome to prepare them 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.390
 dotcom electricity we go with a new 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.130
 biology video 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.450
 on this good occasion we keep talking 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:16.779
 of the nucleic acids we have already seen 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.029
 the DNA and we have in the previous video 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.000
 I have just started 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.269
 to describe what the rn is and in this 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.179
 video I will try with the goal of 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.579
 this video make it clear that it is the arn 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.550
 messenger, I told you good what 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.170
 I wanted in the previous video that the theme 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 of the rn I was going to divide it into so many 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.219
 videos like types of rn ay worth for what 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.440
 well then to try to have more 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.690
 clear the characteristics of each one 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.260
 of them okay okay we go then 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.570
 as I say with the air in the messenger the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.120
 first of the harness we're going to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.590
 see along with the transfer rn and 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.610
 with the sonic ribon vale 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.630
 well it's called so the arn messenger and 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.110
 It has that name 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.560
 because the chains that are formed by the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.170
 transcription of a gene that contained the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 information is valid for the synthesis of the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.740
 protein results in an agreement is 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 say are the arn chains that are 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.530
 formed by the transcription of a gene 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.850
 that contains all the information 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.430
 necessary so that after 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.190
 subsequently, the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.800
 synthesis of proteins synthesis of 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.440
 proteins that you receive that you 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.750
 will perform through the translation process 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.600
 let's remember then what was the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.930
 transcript that was the copy or the step 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.729
 from the DNA to the harness corresponding to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.440
 complementary harness 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.260
 taking into account complementarity 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.990
 of the bases and taking into account 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.240
 of the rn contains an asylum in its 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.300
 structure and does not contain thymine worth 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.880
 then as I say once the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.490
 transcript is worth the air is formed in 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.250
 the messenger air and is the one that will contain 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.920
 all the information to carry out 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.190
 protein synthesis according to the air 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.660
 in the air that formed in the nucleus and 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.570
 subsequently he passed 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.980
 the cytoplasm is worth fixing that what 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.480
 it also has to be clear to us is 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.520
 that not all genes 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.520
 because we said that the gene was the place 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.730
 where the 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.510
 the passage of the DNA to the harness and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.820
 transcript that happened in the gene but 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.100
 you have to know that not all the genes 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.740
 they have information to carry out the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.950
 protein synthesis that is to say there are some 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.800
 that will act only as a mold for the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.250
 forming RNA molecules 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.340
 arn ribosomal or transfer it 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.190
 then as you know we have already said each 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.130
 protein will be formed by one or 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.200
 for more peptide chains and the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.330
 amino acid sequence of each pair 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.360
 of each typical pep chain is 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.910
 determined by the sequence of bases of 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.830
 a DNA gene that is to say depending on 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.380
 how it is carried out whatever the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.830
 sequence of DNA bases so will be the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.500
 sequence to complementary sequence of 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.780
 the rn and therefore thus will also be the 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.050
 amino acid sequence of the chain 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.960
 extinct to tell you also that each chain 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.620
 of rn messenger once they form the 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.810
 core will happen to the site 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.989
 of the cell and this is where it's going to 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.810
 associate with ribosomes because the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.819
 ribosomes are the cellular organs 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.620
 where is going to carry out the 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.780
 synthesis of the protein in the synthesis 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.390
 well rather the synthesis of the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.370
 peptide chains that will give rise to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.829
 proteins the amino acids therefore 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.629
 that form these chains and in order 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.150
 where they are coming 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.120
 determined because by the sequence of 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.860
 the bases of the messenger rn and the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.099
 sequence of the bases of the rn 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.829
 Messenger is a copy of the sequence 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.950
 from those of the base sequences of 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.440
 corresponding DNA gene where 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.650
 carried out where the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.109
 transcript of agreement I hope that 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.590
 are 3 that are understood and by 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.600
 last to tell you that the chains of arn 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.030
 therefore transmit all the 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.389
 genetic information that contains the DNA 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.370
 is located in the nucleus and there they will go 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.100
 to the ribosomes that are in the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.630
 cytoplasm that is where they will take to 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.970
 out protein synthesis 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.650
 now we can understand why the name 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.830
 messenger because the only one they do 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.560
 is to transmit the information carry the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.090
 core information ie the gene 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.930
 of DNA going through that of life or by 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.690
 once the copy of the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.400
 the rn the transcript in the rn carries the 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.040
 information so that now in the 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.130
 cytoplasm is where the 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.590
 protein synthesis and based on the 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.140
 information that they bring that they bring of the gene 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.880
 corresponding DNA the length of 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.010
 the chains of the messenger rn goes to 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.890
 depend logically on the number of 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.920
 nucleotides that form the gene is worth and a 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.490
 once the synthesis of the 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.490
 protein the messenger chains are 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.840
 break in the nucleotides 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.510
 corresponding accordingly well then 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.720
 this is then the video on the air 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.790
 in a messenger, and as I say, I'm going to 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.740
 record a video for each type of arn 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.330
 so because the goal is that 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.090
 you understand well 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.919
 the different types and do not mix them 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.500
 partner because we would make the video more 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.840
 long and maybe it would not be understood no 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.490
 would agree entirely clear well 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.919
 as always thank you very much 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.340
 I hope you find this video very useful and thank you 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.340
 for being there
