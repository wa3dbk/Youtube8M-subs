weather-related<00:02:05.130> events<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.790> Russia<00:02:06.710> North

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
weather-related events in Russia North

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.500 
weather-related events in Russia North
America<00:02:08.190> Australia<00:02:09.170> South<00:02:10.170> America<00:02:10.619> then

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
America Australia South America then

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.530 
America Australia South America then
these<00:02:12.510> pre<00:02:12.980> particular<00:02:14.000> up<00:02:15.000> surges<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
these pre particular up surges and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.690 
these pre particular up surges and
prices<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:16.860> use<00:02:16.980> risk<00:02:17.220> management

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
prices then you can use risk management

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.170 
prices then you can use risk management
tools<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.239> for<00:02:18.510> example<00:02:19.940> we've<00:02:20.940> done<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
tools so for example we've done a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.940 
tools so for example we've done a
project<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:21.750> Malawi<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.560> very<00:02:22.770> much

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
project with Malawi that is very much

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.090 
project with Malawi that is very much
dependent<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.550> rain-fed<00:02:23.820> agriculture<00:02:24.739> so<00:02:25.739> you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
dependent on rain-fed agriculture so you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.710 
dependent on rain-fed agriculture so you
can<00:02:26.250> buy<00:02:26.400> rain<00:02:26.640> index<00:02:27.000> features<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
can buy rain index features so if the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.120 
can buy rain index features so if the
rain<00:02:27.870> doesn't<00:02:27.900> come<00:02:28.290> above<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.739> certain<00:02:28.980> level

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
rain doesn't come above a certain level

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.800 
rain doesn't come above a certain level
you<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> certain<00:02:30.000> sort<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.420> payment<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
you get a certain sort of payment and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.410 
you get a certain sort of payment and
system<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.340> how<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.910> use<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
system so this is how you can use the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.770 
system so this is how you can use the
much<00:02:34.380> decrying<00:02:34.860> derivatives<00:02:35.520> markets<00:02:35.940> for

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
much decrying derivatives markets for

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.130 
much decrying derivatives markets for
positive<00:02:37.739> purposes<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.940> if<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.720> think<00:02:40.019> there

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
positive purposes so if I think there

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.420 
positive purposes so if I think there
are<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.260> number<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.530> prevent<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:40.980> Goldman

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
are a number of prevent that Goldman

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.150 
are a number of prevent that Goldman
will<00:02:41.580> be<00:02:41.670> glad<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.940> hear<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.390> thanks<00:02:43.130> but<00:02:44.130> I

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
will be glad to hear you thanks but I

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.640 
will be glad to hear you thanks but I
think<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.970> key<00:02:45.150> point<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.870> how<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.410> try

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
think the the key point is how do we try

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.620 
think the the key point is how do we try
to<00:02:46.709> make<00:02:46.950> these<00:02:47.160> markets<00:02:47.790> work<00:02:47.970> better<00:02:48.269> in

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
to make these markets work better in

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.990 
to make these markets work better in
information<00:02:49.260> when<00:02:49.769> we<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
information when we have the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.970 
information when we have the
uncertainties<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.049> risks<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.530> market

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
uncertainties and risks of the market

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.680 
uncertainties and risks of the market
let's<00:02:53.340> try<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.610> help<00:02:53.850> those<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.360> are<00:02:54.660> most

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
let's try to help those that are most

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.750 
let's try to help those that are most
vulnerable<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.530> that's<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.130> way<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.459> frankly

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
vulnerable and that's a way that frankly

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.460 
vulnerable and that's a way that frankly
you<00:02:56.880> can<00:02:57.060> target<00:02:57.299> your<00:02:57.480> efforts<00:02:57.989> at<00:02:58.230> lower

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
you can target your efforts at lower

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.479 
you can target your efforts at lower
costs<00:02:58.769> we<00:02:59.760> shouldn't<00:03:00.090> unleash<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.950> massive

most of us it isn't we can grow perfect
we<00:03:18.329> can<00:03:18.480> eat<00:03:18.630> perfectly<00:03:18.900> good<00:03:19.320> food<00:03:19.560> without

we can eat perfectly good food without

we can eat perfectly good food without
having<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.640> genetically<00:03:21.150> modified<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
having it genetically modified but the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.280 
having it genetically modified but the
fact<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.540> at<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.690> moment<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.140> is

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
fact is that at the moment this is

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.259 
fact is that at the moment this is
simply<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.650> propaganda<00:03:26.310> point<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.880> they<00:03:27.030> make

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
simply a propaganda point that they make

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.479 
simply a propaganda point that they make
to<00:03:27.510> try<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:27.959> justify<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.769> technology

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
to try and justify the technology

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.020 
to try and justify the technology
claiming<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.450> be<00:03:30.600> caring<00:03:31.110> about<00:03:31.230> poor<00:03:31.680> people

claiming to be caring about poor people

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.640 
claiming to be caring about poor people
actually<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.600> they've<00:03:33.780> put<00:03:34.049> almost<00:03:34.380> no

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
actually that they've put almost no

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.560 
actually that they've put almost no

their<00:03:37.140> whole<00:03:37.320> effort<00:03:37.530> has<00:03:37.829> been<00:03:37.860> put<00:03:38.250> into

their whole effort has been put into
getting<00:03:38.850> richer<00:03:39.510> themselves<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.769> um<00:03:41.100> I've<00:03:41.940> see

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
getting richer themselves so um I've see

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.699 
getting richer themselves so um I've see
no<00:03:42.360> reason<00:03:42.690> why<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:43.049> should<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.590> an

no reason why we should have an

no reason why we should have an
