00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.410
 today 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:14.510
 We put on adult, but are at lunch break now 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.510
 I'm shooting a little video because enroute is trying out a motorbike 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.310
 Here Oh 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.590
 Thunder Tiger raw 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.590
 1/5 is also words and deeds Weiss 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.090
 me 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.930
 After all compared with Tosa regular touring 4 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.400
 A little maneuver 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.400
 You say that selfishness is different 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 Come on now 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.110
 Straight also I valid kana 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.040
 me 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.040
 Do not turn off the scan 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.600
 That's why he has been buried 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.600
 4 I can not go anywhere 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.869
 It's kinda hard to be a modification of the 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.360
 Here also the hardness 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.630
 This and frozen 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.079
 As side guards come out to the left and right 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.079
 I hear the sound of loading a study 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.750
 Well as it is today, I'm making this commitment today . 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.760

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.150
 Prewar mother ah ah 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.150

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.579
 Very this 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.299
 Originally it is easy to light up 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.299
 It is quite easy 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.450
 And had made durable 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.560
 It's not too bad to fight 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:24.120
 And when you are not running at that lunch time etc. 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.630
 It 's not perfect for enjoying yourself when you're not running an adult car 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.630
 I wonder 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.530
 Let's start looking at this video for a moment 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.580
 This way of thinking 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.580
 I think you are welcome 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.230

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.700

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.660

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.610

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.750
 Well 40 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.750
 Because it is the left wing 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.769
 In Sosore the future to enter the part of the afternoon
