actually cannot live you have exactly
one<00:00:14.820> year<00:00:15.480> yeah<00:00:15.780> mm-hmm<00:00:16.440> during<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.859> open<00:00:17.190> so

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
one year yeah mm-hmm during the open so

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.460 
one year yeah mm-hmm during the open so
it<00:00:17.460> was<00:00:17.640> hard<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.420> very<00:00:18.720> difficult<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:19.320> in

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
it was hard it's very difficult to do in

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.170 
it was hard it's very difficult to do in
a<00:00:19.500> court<00:00:19.740> actually<00:00:20.279> that's<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:20.820> makes<00:00:21.090> you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
a court actually that's what makes you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.640 
a court actually that's what makes you
feel<00:00:21.330> good<00:00:21.539> about<00:00:21.630> tennis<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.560> see

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
feel good about tennis but you see

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.920 
feel good about tennis but you see
they're<00:00:22.800> always<00:00:23.100> jammed<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:24.029> think<00:00:24.630> there<00:00:24.810> are

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
they're always jammed I think there are

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.050 
they're always jammed I think there are
not<00:00:25.080> many<00:00:25.199> courts<00:00:25.650> around<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> play<00:00:26.939> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
not many courts around here to play and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
not many courts around here to play and
I<00:00:27.119> think<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:27.660> I'm<00:00:27.810> correct<00:00:28.050> I've<00:00:28.380> read<00:00:28.529> an

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
I think if I'm correct I've read an

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.019 
I think if I'm correct I've read an
article<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.070> stated<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.640> weren't<00:00:29.820> that

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
article you stated that weren't that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:57.040 
article you stated that weren't that
expensive<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.779> play<00:00:30.960> on

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.570 

now<00:00:57.560> it's<00:00:57.740> worth<00:00:57.950> it<00:00:58.130> just<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.340> see<00:00:58.550> that

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
now it's worth it just to see that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.300 
now it's worth it just to see that
reaction
