with custom sliders and I'm only doing

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.179 
with custom sliders and I'm only doing
it<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.960> basically<00:01:30.960> pro<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.680> far<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it on basically pro so far but the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.890 
it on basically pro so far but the
custom<00:01:32.549> sliders<00:01:32.970> look<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.570> bit<00:01:33.750> like

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
custom sliders look a little bit like

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.010 
custom sliders look a little bit like
this<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.610> basically<00:01:35.610> didn't<00:01:36.540> change<00:01:36.720> anything

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
this I basically didn't change anything

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.600 
this I basically didn't change anything
i'm<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.259> using<00:01:37.650> default<00:01:37.979> sliders<00:01:38.430> eight

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
i'm just using default sliders eight

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
i'm just using default sliders eight
minute<00:01:38.939> quarters<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.689> i've<00:01:39.840> turned<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
minute quarters but i've turned all the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.399 
minute quarters but i've turned all the
shots<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.009> cpu<00:01:41.840> sliders<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
shots for the cpu sliders up so that I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
shots for the cpu sliders up so that I
definitely<00:01:43.770> had<00:01:43.979> an<00:01:44.130> advantage<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.149> uh

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
definitely had an advantage there but uh

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
definitely had an advantage there but uh
I<00:01:45.659> am<00:01:46.439> probably<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> raise<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
I am probably going to raise it up to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
I am probably going to raise it up to
all-star<00:01:47.790> pretty<00:01:48.180> soon<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:48.960> not

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
all-star pretty soon here but I'm not

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
all-star pretty soon here but I'm not
going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.890> game<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.369> we're

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
going to do that for this game as we're

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.630 
going to do that for this game as we're
playing<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> lakers<00:01:51.390> next<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.369> should

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
playing the lakers next so that should

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.959 
playing the lakers next so that should
be<00:01:53.670> very<00:01:53.909> interesting<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:56.700> stuff

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.920 
inspired by him coming back to the Suns
in<00:03:19.110> this<00:03:19.980> NBA<00:03:20.250> season<00:03:20.670> Udonis<00:03:21.480> Haslem<00:03:21.510> and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
in this NBA season Udonis Haslem and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.590 
in this NBA season Udonis Haslem and
soon<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.350> soul<00:03:22.530> gaseous<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:24.450> is

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
soon a soul gaseous and that is

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.090 
soon a soul gaseous and that is
definitely<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:25.019> solid<00:03:25.200> bench<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.769> could<00:03:25.980> even

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
definitely a solid bench that could even

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.640 
definitely a solid bench that could even
you<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.880> I'd<00:03:27.420> say<00:03:27.660> our<00:03:27.690> second<00:03:28.410> unit<00:03:28.590> is

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
you know I'd say our second unit is

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.259 
you know I'd say our second unit is
probably<00:03:29.010> better<00:03:29.220> than<00:03:29.430> some<00:03:29.730> NBA<00:03:29.880> teams

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
probably better than some NBA teams

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.509 
probably better than some NBA teams
first<00:03:30.480> units<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.019> that's<00:03:31.200> great<00:03:31.380> calc<00:03:32.250> over

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
first units so that's great calc over

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.400 
first units so that's great calc over
