00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
a top color they came out two different

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.070 
a top color they came out two different
colors<00:00:26.039> because<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.609> bleached<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.660> other<00:00:27.840> day

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
colors because I bleached the other day

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.820 
colors because I bleached the other day
and<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.500> didn't<00:00:28.830> bleach<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.279> all<00:00:29.869> but<00:00:30.869> yeah

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.819 
so I actually think it was like really
good<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.450> gonna<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.440> bad

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
good it's just gonna be really bad

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.520 
good it's just gonna be really bad
because<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.610> gonna<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.940> wash<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.719> really

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
