hey dim in fact about right we are and
it's<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.840> bit<00:00:26.020> blowy<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.500> we<00:00:26.800> can<00:00:26.980> hear<00:00:27.369> the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
it's a bit blowy and we can hear the

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.640 
it's a bit blowy and we can hear the
high-quality<00:00:28.390> care<00:00:28.630> of<00:00:28.779> is<00:00:28.900> buffing<00:00:29.320> around

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
high-quality care of is buffing around

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.100 
high-quality care of is buffing around
and<00:00:30.130> let's<00:00:30.310> face<00:00:30.490> it<00:00:30.550> mate<00:00:30.910> that's<00:00:31.240> what<00:00:31.930> I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
guess this camp is claimed to find is

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.570 
guess this camp is claimed to find is
they<00:00:34.480> have<00:00:34.660> got<00:00:34.989> high<00:00:35.290> quality<00:00:35.860> canvas<00:00:36.370> like

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
they have got high quality canvas like

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.390 
they have got high quality canvas like
the<00:00:36.730> bottom<00:00:37.480> line<00:00:37.660> is<00:00:37.930> when<00:00:38.379> it<00:00:38.530> pours<00:00:39.010> rain

no worries yeah but it is it's different
its<00:01:13.000> manufacturing<00:01:13.689> in<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.140> they're<00:01:14.380> not

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
its manufacturing in that they're not

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.490 
its manufacturing in that they're not
using<00:01:14.860> durability<00:01:15.670> using<00:01:16.180> high<00:01:16.869> quality

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
using durability using high quality

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.740 
using durability using high quality
steel<00:01:17.830> welding<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.730> entire<00:01:19.060> construction

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
steel welding the entire construction

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.770

the<00:01:22.870> hot<00:01:23.020> spots<00:01:23.320> anywhere<00:01:23.620> so<00:01:24.070> he's<00:01:24.220> gonna

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
the hot spots anywhere so he's gonna

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.410 
the hot spots anywhere so he's gonna
last<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.880> lot<00:01:25.000> longer

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
Tim it's the Kona canopy you can't help

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.600 
Tim it's the Kona canopy you can't help
it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
it

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.750 
it
why<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:35.210> mean<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:35.570> got<00:01:35.690> quality<00:01:36.200> Australian

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
why I mean it's got quality Australian

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.890 
why I mean it's got quality Australian
Candice<00:01:37.760> it<00:01:38.120> looks<00:01:38.450> good

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
Candice it looks good

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.080 
Candice it looks good
okay<00:01:39.410> it<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.650> more<00:01:40.010> simple<00:01:40.490> build<00:01:40.850> it

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
okay it is a more simple build it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.420 
okay it is a more simple build it
doesn't<00:01:41.330> have<00:01:41.420> power<00:01:41.450> mmm<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:43.040> only<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.280> lot

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
doesn't have power mmm it's only a lot

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.290 
doesn't have power mmm it's only a lot
of<00:01:43.490> gas<00:01:43.640> one<00:01:44.030> Jerry<00:01:44.540> but<00:01:45.170> it's<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.380> sort<00:01:45.620> of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
of gas one Jerry but it's a sort of

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.910 
of gas one Jerry but it's a sort of
cavity<00:01:47.300> good<00:01:47.510> boy<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.080> caught<00:01:48.410> it<00:01:48.560> even

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
cavity good boy and you caught it even

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.830 
cavity good boy and you caught it even
if<00:01:49.040> it's<00:01:49.220> 12<00:01:49.670> months<00:01:49.790> trial<00:01:50.150> if<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.420> won't<00:01:50.600> use

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
if it's 12 months trial if you won't use

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.990 
if it's 12 months trial if you won't use
it<00:01:50.870> much<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.770> could<00:01:51.920> sell<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.160> and<00:01:52.430> Ora<00:01:52.760> can

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
it much you could sell it and Ora can

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.130 
it much you could sell it and Ora can
you<00:01:53.090> get<00:01:53.360> your<00:01:53.750> money<00:01:53.930> back

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.219 

let's<00:02:00.140> face<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.380> this<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.340> pretty<00:02:01.790> well

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
let's face it this is pretty well

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.570 
let's face it this is pretty well
infinitely<00:02:03.229> upgradable<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.460> upgrade

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
infinitely upgradable you can upgrade

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.700 
infinitely upgradable you can upgrade
pretty<00:02:05.119> much<00:02:05.300> every<00:02:05.630> element<00:02:05.960> well<00:02:06.530> that's

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
pretty much every element well that's

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.350 
pretty much every element well that's
the<00:02:06.830> idea<00:02:06.860> with<00:02:07.220> this<00:02:07.310> camper<00:02:07.700> it's<00:02:07.850> um<00:02:08.119> it's

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
the idea with this camper it's um it's

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.969 
the idea with this camper it's um it's
built<00:02:08.570> on<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.840> same<00:02:09.050> trail<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.560> same<00:02:09.709> chassis

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
built on the same trail and same chassis

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.930 
built on the same trail and same chassis
as<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.399> whole<00:02:11.180> trackabout<00:02:11.570> range<00:02:15.850> Oregon<00:02:16.850> is

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
as the whole trackabout range Oregon is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.780 
as the whole trackabout range Oregon is
a<00:02:17.030> very<00:02:17.270> basic<00:02:17.540> unit<00:02:18.050> isn't<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.430> yeah<00:02:19.430> it's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
a very basic unit isn't it yeah it's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.520 
a very basic unit isn't it yeah it's
it's<00:02:20.120> very<00:02:20.180> simple<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.200> know<00:02:21.290> there's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
it's very simple but you know there's

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.290 
it's very simple but you know there's
there's<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.860> lot<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.190> them<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.760> lot<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.120> like

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
there's a lot of them a lot to like

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.090 
there's a lot of them a lot to like
