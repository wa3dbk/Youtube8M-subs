00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Imagine you are coming to a party 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.859
 and the first thing you do is pick her up 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.580
 you an animal and push with yours 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.470
 friends 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.790
 but what are you drinking? 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.790
 and how is it made? 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.350
 everyone knows so well, the beer is a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.510
 alcohol and carbonated drink 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.080
 to the main food of ours 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.689
 German 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.490
 but from what and how is made for 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.750
 the ingredients we look at the german 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
 purity requirement 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.040
 It is said that we should only hop malt 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.520
 yeast and water included 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.320
 and that for almost 500 years 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.600
 Let's take a look at the hops first 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.579
 but not among the hemp plants 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.170
 Smoking on the fields will only be 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.660
 female plants installed 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.750
 so there is more yield on the ground like that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.899
 why the ears are at the hops why is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.940
 hop in the pier by bactericidal so 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.750
 Bacteria killing effect it becomes beer 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.850
 durable 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.680
 so it stays beer for a long time 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.820
 and spoil me as well gives that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.829
 hop the beer its bitter 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.650
 Taste and stabilizes the charm 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.689
 we come to the next ingredient times at 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 malt is first the question what the fuck 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.460
 is actually as it is in water 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.979
 soaked dried cheese 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.409
 So from barley wheat rye spelled 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.180
 or the like by soaking in 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 water is to germinate crops 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.890
 what's behind it is me 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 starch of the grain when germinating in 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.470
 Water-soluble malt sugar decomposes this 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.400
 Whole happens through enzymes 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.439
 then the mixture is slow 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.640
 dried and heated as well 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.490
 is designated therein 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.259
 This will destroy the enzymes now 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.570
 the malt and hop in water 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.619
 heated together the mixture is called 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.750
 called master 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.799
 To conclude, some and yeast 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.040
 given together 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.020
 First, however, the yeast is advised 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.329
 yeast these are unicellular mushrooms the five 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.710
 to ten microns in size are pretty 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.509
 small compared to your fingers 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.180
 width are about the same as 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.189
 your finger width to number the house 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.079
 then metabolize the sugar and 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.810
 Make alcohol and carbon dioxide 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.040
 from that he quite rightly eat 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 sugar and we drink what the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.250
 excrete 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.229
 Let's look at that with the equation 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.660
 there are two reactions now 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.530
 on the one hand, the fermentation and 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.260
 to at 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.800
 the respiration of the yeast cells first the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.600
 fermentation of sugar so c6 has 12 o'clock 6 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.580
 is under energy gain for the 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.260
 yeast cells are transformed so that the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.270
 equation looks like this 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.330
 sugar becomes ethanol and 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.890
 carbon dioxide which finds cellular respiration 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.590
 also instead of under air 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.500
 only very slightly sugar plus 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.870
 Oxygen is added to carbon dioxide plus 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.459
 water under the fermentation 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.110
 The conclusion of the air is ours 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.000
 alcohol and partly the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.550
 carbon dioxide so the carbonic acid 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.410
 In our drink we see how 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.090
 from the ingredients the bi is pending 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.560
 Now you know when next time 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.150
 at a party since you know exactly what 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.340
 Drinks and how it is made 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.170
 Post it in the comments what your 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.180
 favorite is when he has more 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.160
 you want to see horny videos then subscribed 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.140
 this channel and more importantly 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.239
 look past us we are like 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.239
 simple works and always there for you
