00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.990
 good evening london 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.090
 today we will get to know the muscles 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.099
 of the predicted ark that will be a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 challenging video article because 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.869
 we're going to see 33 muscles not 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.860
 we'll look at the pelvic floor because 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.500
 this will dedicate a video if on 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.180
 origin iliac crest are inserted 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.830
 different muscles on the outer lip 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.830
 we find the external oblique 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.750
 later we find part 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.820
 of the origin of the large muscle bear 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.290
 which has a functional continuation 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.650
 fascial 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.750
 with the large contralateral gluteal in 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.150
 this case we find the big one 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.360
 bluff the side man that fits 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.750
 on the iliac crest on the heliac spine 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.920
 postero superior on the sacrum and on the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.090
 plus tuberous ligament 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 internally on the intermediate line 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.929
 we find an internal public that a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.520
 an insert always on the hip too 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:25.530
 under your beautiful with the audience on the lip 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.969
 internal instead we find the muscle 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.789
 transverse followed by the square of the loins 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:36.350
 it is even more posteriorly from the mass 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.350
 common paravertebral disease 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.650
 in the upper whole heliacal end 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.259
 we find the origin of the sartorius muscle 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.259
 the longest muscle in our body 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.619
 externally we find the origin of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.560
 tensor of the fascia lata on the plug e 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.619
 there less character instead we 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.200
 the origin of the rectus femoris muscle which 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.370
 has a dual origin both in this 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:17.910
 section is more externally above the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.430
 acetabulum capsule on the face 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.850
 external of the delirium wing we find in the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:34.739
 medium and the small buttock with their 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:38.370
 respective origin and their insertion 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.220
 on a large trochanter on the side 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.540
 lateral the gluteus millet and on the side 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.290
 medial 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.530
 the small buttock the great buttock that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.739
 we had seen previously fits 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.130
 partly on the gluteal tuberosity of the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.130
 femur 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.270
 on the inside face of the delirium area 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.810
 we find the heliacal pit in which 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.780
 the original iliac muscle accompanied 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.740
 from the big psoas even though these two 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.830
 muscles have a different origin 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.900
 their listing is common on a small 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:25.520
 trochanter are the only muscles that 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.040
 they fit into this anatomical area 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:34.920
 we will dedicate part videos to these 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.739
 important muscles on the public bone 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.070
 and partly on the branch of the ischia we find 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.070
 semolic the muscles on the crest bettini a 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.769
 we find a pectineus muscle on the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.860
 public tubercle we find insertion 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.360
 of the abdominal rectum inferiorly as 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.040
 we have seen we find part 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.350
 of the insertion of the internal obligation 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.640
 on the inferior year of the pubis we find 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.310
 above the long lead 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:11.790
 inferiorly the adductor short the 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:17.010
 gracilis the great adductor e 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.900
 external shutter part of these 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.120
 muscles fit on the part 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.690
 proximal of the femur 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.080
 later we saw the great 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.250
 buttock we find the big next 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.880
 adductor the short lead and the 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.880
 pectineus 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:43.500
 on the inner face delirium of the pubis e 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.140
 of the risk we find the shutter 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.590
 indoor 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.110
 we also see the origin of the muscles here 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.230
 of the pelvic floor but how 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.340
 had said earlier we will not see 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.130
 the crazy internal shutter 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.090
 posteriorly under the plug and bugged 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:09.900
 ca and connects with two other muscles the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.750
 upper twin the lower twin 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.850
 the three muscles have a common insertion 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.850
 in the crispy rica pit 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.720
 we notice another muscle superiorly 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.460
 which originates on the front face 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.430
 of the sacrum and is the muscle 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.130
 piriform which also fits on the 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.510
 great trochanter to this muscle 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.460
 we will dedicate a video part we can 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.890
 note the cranial origin 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:47.010
 of the internal shutter the origin 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:52.650
 caudal and the origin of the twin 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:55.020
 upper and lower twin close 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.930
 and on the crunchy pit we can 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.740
 note the insertion of the muscle 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:05.160
 piriformis of the upper twin e 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:10.980
 lower and internal shutter e 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:13.620
 of the external shutter on the tuberosity 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:19.260
 ischia we find the origin of 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:24.750
 Ural purposes Semi- membranous biceps 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:27.810
 femoral and semi-tendinous laterally 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.670
 we find the origin of the square of the 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.710
 femur 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.610
 his insertion on the inter crest 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.610
 too ancient
