this and that is 14,000 350 so as you
can<00:02:26.380> see<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:27.069> can<00:02:27.220> actually<00:02:27.340> make<00:02:27.610> quite<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.880> bit

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
can see we can actually make quite a bit

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.830 
can see we can actually make quite a bit
right<00:02:28.180> here<00:02:28.260> now<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.300> kind<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.630> little
