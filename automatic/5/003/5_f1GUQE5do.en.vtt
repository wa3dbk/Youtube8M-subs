00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.559
 state television present in 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.330
 our homes for several 

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:06.770
 years taking us in each of their 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.509
 series to fantastic places 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.759
 showing us stories that tell the 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.530
 reality or surpass it in each of 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.940
 the episodes and this is why I've 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.499
 decided to talk about the new series of 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.850
 television that currently what 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.830
 they speak of detaching us from our life 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 everyday to show that the impossible 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.670
 it is possible that the humanity of food 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.410
 seafood is active of the human being or 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.360
 even to get a laugh out of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.650
 once in a while so be prepared that 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.350
 this is the special of the following 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.100
 television only in the xto channel 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.100
 Mexico 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.130
 we are in a reality where gender 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.110
 bandits has created duty pretty much of 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.630
 watch blowjobs like they are twilight or 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.550
 club what modified their origin to 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.310
 make them more effective and sexually 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.200
 I insisted words bless proposals 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.650
 They bet they were completely faithful to their 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.150
 mythology disappointing in the same way 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.030
 It would seem that nobody gave a fuck for 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.400
 these beings at least until a few 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.170
 months and in this special touch the turn 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.120
 to talk about what I can consider the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.400
 best television series I saw the year 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.500
 past based on the geology of the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.030
 cared our compatriot william 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.030
 of the bull does not write writes 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.800
 which is emitted in the channel effects 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.810
 the series in an accident has happened 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.910
 an airplane where for mysterious reasons 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.090
 all passengers died for reasons 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.070
 unknown except four that little to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 little will begin to develop symptoms 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.480
 of a strange disease that will go 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.400
 little by little becoming vampires and 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.530
 and throughout the series we will see from the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.570
 point of view of several characters like 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.360
 lead with this plaque that threatens their 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.730
 city ​​and their loved ones as well as their 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.890
 attempt to stop her or survive her 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.750
 a series that invents the genre 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.690
 vampiric from a different perspective 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.810
 and how it fits into a society 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.470
 current but it goes up details and now 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.300
 of my points for this series 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.310
 something interesting that I said at his moments 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.440
 is the new approach to truth 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.990
 mental vampires that we always have 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.179
 seen as an elegant man or woman of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.910
 good lineage or even as a fly 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.500
 frightening in this series we see them 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.210
 like beings that move through the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.370
 desire to feed on their beings 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.550
 loved ones and even be powerful beings 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.980
 both in abilities and influences 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 I feel that a great success is to give them a 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.320
 Breath of fresh air to mythology 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.300
 giving them an explanation in quotes 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.860
 scientific but at the same time something that 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.070
 is in balance with an ancestral origin 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.870
 still uncertain which we see quite a lot in 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.510
 other projects from the bull as what 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.970
 they are the labyrinth of the hellboy faun and 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.920
 here is not the exception one way in the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.290
 that many will love course will make you 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.600
 the vampires but I can only say that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.120
 certainly was the right one for this new 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.520
 it was but leaving aside the touch 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.080
 supernatural of the show we have great of 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.970
 invocations on the side of the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.790
 performances that certainly can not leave 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.680
 go through my comments as we have 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.320
 actor corey stoll who plays the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.970
 doctor efrain good weather a man who 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.740
 will try to protect your family 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.530
 despite having to put aside their 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.620
 medical conventions we also have to 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.140
 song austin like jim that a companion of 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.920
 Ephraim work that will be involved 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.920
 in created sides of this story 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.230
 to miguel gómez as bus elizalde un 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.349
 ex-convict who will try to deal with the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.800
 strain that in turn out of vision and 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.319
 clear my favorites that are to free him 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.030
 as ever hand is believed to whom a man 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.150
 which has fought against this threat 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.100
 for more than 50 years since it is craving 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.860
 will be willing to help the protagonists to 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.100
 defend yourself from these creatures there are already 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.660
 said to mel as tomás eichhorst an ex 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.090
 Nazi who became the first 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.340
 acolyte master 's degrees being the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.890
 most interesting character in this series 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.380
 has excellent dialogues and a very 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.450
 good story of great background but the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.340
 mentioned above are only some 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.650
 There are many characters that we will see in 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.420
 this show and the performances do not stay 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.280
 in the background giving big 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.830
 demonstration of the excellent cast that 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.720
 has this series and what to tell you 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.430
 main argument that reminds me 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.590
 vaguely to how the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 Enoch bed to series as they are game or 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.720
 close where we see diverse characters and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.090
 how are they separated by having each 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.770
 one his own problems and the 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.520
 characters in this story has a 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.410
 big 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.470
 from which they have family problems 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.050
 economic psychological and how are these 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.120
 affect in the course of episodes and 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.159
 we can even see these details in 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.190
 flashback at different times of the 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:42.050
 history but in itself the most interesting 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.210
 is the great weight that love has in 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.970
 this series since it is the main 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.129
 enemy or antagonist since these 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.139
 they feed the vampires of their beings 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:53.120
 ones and at the same time is the 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.960
 main reason to follow our 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.120
 protagonists 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.310
 likewise builds a series of 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.590
 subplots that expand your universe like 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.509
 see other types of manteros creatures or 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.229
 societies that will continue to expand to the 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:08.810
 series a personal seal of the bull in his 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.520
 production is to be highlighted as it is 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.039
 signed in a way where national 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.289
 night is highlighted with a great use of 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.090
 lighting in these and even with the 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.250
 vampires the degree of makeup and 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.719
 visual effects despite not being so 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.030
 extensive these small details 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:26.030
 stand out the scenes where they appear 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.060
 be these beings or even some other 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.310
 creature caring for the quality of the series 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.340
 which is a visual delight in each 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.590
 the chapters that the only thing that makes me 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.360
 to say is that this series had a better 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.550
 and I think he was up to his 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.260
 quality have been following what 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.270
 enough of special will know that 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.000
 I consider it very important that each series 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.040
 of television have one although they do not last 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.590
 enough seriously I think I enjoy 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.080
 quite a lot and I do not think I'm the only one here 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.880
 think in this way the serious one that 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.820
 enjoy this series of principle to 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.460
 end there is no single character any 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.100
 single scene no single dialogue that does not 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.490
 have enjoyed this one at least 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.070
 for me it is simply perfect and I 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.140
 I'm dying to see what's next, what if 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.720
 continue with this quality could 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.050
 become a better television 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.430
 that I have seen in my life recommended for 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.380
 all those who love what 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.090
 supernatural that sure not what 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.120
 will select and finish so 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.040
 hooked as I am but by the 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.260
 moment this has been all for this 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.660
 shows that if you liked it or not 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.010
 of light online and share it so that 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.070
 more than one can give you a chance 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.480
 to this great of a series and we continue with 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.400
 the 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.100
 by saying on television with the reviews 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.660
 most expected so do not take off from 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.230
 this channel and see you in the next 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.230
 video 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.030
 yes 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.750
 two 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.750
 ah
