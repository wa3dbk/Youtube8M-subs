00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
could go was worth Perot and that 20

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.120 
could go was worth Perot and that 20
million<00:05:29.479> mark<00:05:29.599> I'll<00:05:29.810> say<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.530> that's<00:05:30.949> how

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
million mark I'll say like that's how

much<00:05:31.310> Royce<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.909> worth<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.419> I<00:05:32.509> reckon<00:05:32.810> they

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
much Royce is worth and I reckon they

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.800 
much Royce is worth and I reckon they
would<00:05:33.110> do<00:05:33.259> that<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:34.659> unfortunately<00:05:35.659> we

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
would do that so unfortunately we
