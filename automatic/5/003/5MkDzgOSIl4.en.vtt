 other health problems 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.410
 now I am a little 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.819
 there it's done 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.449
 finally it's not our story 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.460
 I am more than disappointed 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.029
 you must not complain 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.369
 Nothing more normal 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.960
 so you had to master by going fast 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.769
 the system 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 while he was on the run 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.560
 despite an offer a babysitter 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.560
 with afp 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.120
 she has not been the same for a week 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.090

 Monday, March 15 at old trafford 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.950
 in July 2008 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.950
 emerging markets 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.680
 popular media 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.680
 bitz remains to be seen 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.130
 it is equipped with a small event 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.130
 collective 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.300
 this same basic technique 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.490
 ten years later 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 now we will see 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.900
 dakar 25 Apr 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 now it means no departure 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 thanks to our pride 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.460
 but in October having no longer a late place of 2 5% 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 in front of kbc 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.390
 anyway persona 5 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.110
 so 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.500
 character to another 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.660
 ordinarily 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.570
 in the end in this sense 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.010
 the Taliban rebel spokesman 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.010
 the bad luck but a small military caste 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.730
 paris reuters - eads 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.470
 the primary 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.859
 it is this person 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.859
 so he never has the incident 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:19.909
 that's what 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.039
 social fracture 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.049
 cla 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.430
 the latter are not clear
