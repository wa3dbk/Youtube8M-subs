two places to hook it up to and these

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.280 
two places to hook it up to and these
two<00:01:15.810> wires<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.610> polarity<00:01:17.610> sensitive<00:01:18.290> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
two wires are not polarity sensitive you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
two wires are not polarity sensitive you
can<00:01:19.350> hook<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.860> either<00:01:20.040> way<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.640> it'll

well<00:02:57.550> here's<00:02:58.550> how<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.820> hook<00:02:59.030> up<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.450> wires

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
well here's how you hook up the wires

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.010 
well here's how you hook up the wires
underneath<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:01.150> tankless<00:03:02.150> water<00:03:02.240> heater<00:03:02.720> to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
underneath a tankless water heater to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.320 
underneath a tankless water heater to
your<00:03:03.170> remote<00:03:03.380> control<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:04.640> notice<00:03:05.120> there's

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
your remote control you notice there's

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.470 
your remote control you notice there's
two<00:03:05.420> terminals<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.760> these<00:03:07.760> terminals<00:03:08.330> are

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
two terminals and these terminals are

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.020 
two terminals and these terminals are
not<00:03:08.690> polarity<00:03:09.260> sensitive<00:03:09.520> so<00:03:10.520> you<00:03:10.550> can<00:03:10.880> hook

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
not polarity sensitive so you can hook

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.550 
not polarity sensitive so you can hook
them<00:03:11.120> up<00:03:11.240> either<00:03:11.510> way<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.930> I'll<00:03:12.050> work<00:03:12.290> just

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
them up either way and I'll work just

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.850 
them up either way and I'll work just
fine<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:14.000> then<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.360> put<00:03:14.600> your<00:03:14.860> connection

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
fine so then you put your connection

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.120 
fine so then you put your connection
cover<00:03:16.190> your<00:03:16.730> remote<00:03:17.030> connection<00:03:17.600> cover<00:03:18.130> right

that the water would come at come on at

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.460 
that the water would come at come on at
if<00:04:44.940> we<00:04:45.090> turn<00:04:45.300> on<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.570> hot<00:04:45.720> water<00:04:45.890> sit<00:04:46.890> on<00:04:47.070> there

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
if we turn on the hot water sit on there

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.020 
if we turn on the hot water sit on there
okay<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:49.980> you<00:04:50.280> see<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.640> little<00:04:50.790> red<00:04:50.850> light

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.130 
tankless water heater is now in use we
decided<00:05:00.510> we<00:05:01.110> only<00:05:01.380> want<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.100> be<00:05:03.140> 108

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
decided we only want it to be 108

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.730 
decided we only want it to be 108
degrees<00:05:04.580> 106<00:05:05.580> degrees<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:07.110> just<00:05:07.290> set<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.530> like

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
degrees 106 degrees you just set it like

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.830 
degrees 106 degrees you just set it like
that<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:09.200> little<00:05:10.200> warmer<00:05:10.620> instead<00:05:11.250> like<00:05:11.430> that

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
that a little warmer instead like that

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.940 
that a little warmer instead like that
now<00:05:12.980> you<00:05:13.980> say<00:05:14.190> well<00:05:15.000> what<00:05:15.210> is<00:05:15.390> this<00:05:15.950> priority

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
now you say well what is this priority

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.400 
now you say well what is this priority
button<00:05:17.310> here<00:05:17.600> what<00:05:18.600> that<00:05:18.780> is<00:05:18.960> for<00:05:19.200> it's

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
button here what that is for it's

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.380 
button here what that is for it's
telling<00:05:19.680> you<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:19.890> this<00:05:20.310> remote<00:05:20.880> control<00:05:21.240> has

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
telling you that this remote control has

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.230 
telling you that this remote control has
priority<00:05:21.990> over<00:05:22.020> other<00:05:22.470> remote<00:05:22.920> controls<00:05:23.430> you

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
priority over other remote controls you

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.450 
priority over other remote controls you
can<00:05:24.270> use<00:05:24.600> as<00:05:24.780> many<00:05:24.930> as<00:05:25.110> three<00:05:25.410> remote<00:05:26.040> controls

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
can use as many as three remote controls

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.680 
can use as many as three remote controls
on<00:05:26.760> your<00:05:27.420> system<00:05:27.900> only<00:05:28.830> one<00:05:29.130> remote<00:05:29.580> control

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
on your system only one remote control

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.630 
on your system only one remote control
comes<00:05:30.690> with<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.230> unit<00:05:31.470> you'd<00:05:32.130> have<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:32.430> buy

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
comes with the unit you'd have to buy

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.280 
comes with the unit you'd have to buy
the<00:05:32.700> other<00:05:33.030> two<00:05:33.680> from<00:05:34.680> ring<00:05:35.120> but<00:05:36.120> then<00:05:37.020> there's

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
the other two from ring but then there's

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.670 
the other two from ring but then there's
a<00:05:37.550> you<00:05:38.550> know<00:05:38.580> perhaps<00:05:39.120> one<00:05:40.080> will<00:05:40.230> be<00:05:40.320> set<00:05:40.590> at

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
a you know perhaps one will be set at

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.880 
a you know perhaps one will be set at
105<00:05:41.280> that'll<00:05:41.820> be<00:05:41.940> 100<00:05:42.300> set<00:05:42.720> 108<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.380> one<00:05:43.560> this

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
105 that'll be 100 set 108 and one this

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.690 
105 that'll be 100 set 108 and one this
will<00:05:44.100> be<00:05:44.130> set<00:05:44.400> at<00:05:44.490> 110<00:05:45.120> well<00:05:45.930> this<00:05:46.470> one<00:05:46.710> in<00:05:46.950> this

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
will be set at 110 well this one in this

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.330 
will be set at 110 well this one in this
case<00:05:47.940> would<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.330> priority<00:05:48.750> so<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.950> water

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
case would have priority so the water

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.970 
case would have priority so the water
would<00:05:50.520> be<00:05:50.700> at<00:05:50.850> 110<00:05:51.450> power<00:05:52.230> to<00:05:52.530> turn<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.830> power

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
would be at 110 power to turn the power

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.510 
would be at 110 power to turn the power
off<00:05:53.220> right<00:05:53.850> here<00:05:54.240> we<00:05:54.540> turn<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:54.870> off<00:05:55.280> just<00:05:56.280> turn

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
off right here we turn it off just turn

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.020 
off right here we turn it off just turn
it<00:05:56.610> back<00:05:56.790> on<00:05:57.030> like<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:58.580> I'm<00:05:59.580> going<00:05:59.790> to<00:05:59.880> put

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
it back on like that I'm going to put

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.950 
it back on like that I'm going to put
some<00:06:00.240> links<00:06:00.480> in<00:06:00.720> my<00:06:00.780> video<00:06:01.290> description<00:06:02.960> both
