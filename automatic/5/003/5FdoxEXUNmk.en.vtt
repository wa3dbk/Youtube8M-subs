when<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.560> lockdown<00:01:24.009> I<00:01:24.280> just<00:01:24.609> assume

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
when is it lockdown I just assume

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.819 
when is it lockdown I just assume
they're<00:01:25.179> all<00:01:25.240> just<00:01:25.630> in<00:01:25.810> it's<00:01:26.380> been<00:01:26.530> building

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
they're all just in it's been building

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.649 
they're all just in it's been building
on<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.340> sleeping<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.850> expects<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.509> each

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
on and sleeping that expects to each

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:39.059 
on and sleeping that expects to each
other<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:38.020> spend<00:01:38.259> time<00:01:38.439> or<00:01:38.709> locked<00:01:38.920> up

other because to spend time or locked up
together<00:01:39.250> on<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.969> maths<00:01:40.209> you<00:01:40.770> get<00:01:41.770> one<00:01:41.979> crack

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
together on the maths you get one crack

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.330 
together on the maths you get one crack
one<00:01:42.609> race<00:01:42.819> a<00:01:42.849> day<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:44.079> each<00:01:44.259> day's<00:01:44.560> placings

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
one race a day and each day's placings

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.399 
one race a day and each day's placings
determine<00:01:46.240> where<00:01:46.359> you<00:01:46.450> go<00:01:46.629> and<00:01:46.899> the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
determine where you go and the

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.529 
determine where you go and the
subsequent<00:01:47.920> day<00:01:48.099> the<00:01:48.670> big<00:01:48.879> final<00:01:49.149> on<00:01:49.360> day

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
subsequent day the big final on day

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.389 
subsequent day the big final on day
three<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.590> there's<00:01:50.739> a<00:01:50.799> lot<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:50.950> strategy

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
three so there's a lot of strategy

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.510 
three so there's a lot of strategy
working<00:01:52.119> up<00:01:52.390> your<00:01:52.750> opponent's<00:01:53.289> whether<00:01:54.189> you

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
working up your opponent's whether you

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.369 
working up your opponent's whether you
go<00:01:54.700> straight<00:01:55.149> from<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.599> gun<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.020> try<00:01:56.229> and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:56.379 
go straight from the gun and try and

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:57.959 
go straight from the gun and try and
hold<00:01:56.500> everyone<00:01:56.799> off<00:01:56.860> you're<00:01:57.009> at<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.250> front<00:01:57.399> or

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
hold everyone off you're at the front or

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.130 
hold everyone off you're at the front or
if<00:01:58.119> you're<00:01:58.270> at<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.390> back<00:01:58.569> you've<00:01:58.780> got<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:58.989> make

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
if you're at the back you've got to make

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.410 
if you're at the back you've got to make
a<00:01:59.170> move<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.709> be<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.099> place<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.459> be<00:02:00.610> while

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
a move and be in a place to be while

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.969 
a move and be in a place to be while
you're<00:02:01.599> out<00:02:01.750> there<00:02:01.989> you've<00:02:02.170> got<00:02:02.379> to<00:02:02.439> be<00:02:02.530> really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
you're out there you've got to be really

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.380 
you're out there you've got to be really
instinctive<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:03.700> just<00:02:03.849> haven't<00:02:04.060> got<00:02:04.209> much

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
instinctive you just haven't got much

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.539 
instinctive you just haven't got much
time<00:02:04.599> to<00:02:04.810> actually<00:02:04.929> think<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:06.099> these<00:02:06.280> guys

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
time to actually think and these guys

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.279 
time to actually think and these guys
are<00:02:06.579> full<00:02:06.879> time<00:02:07.090> curing<00:02:07.450> races<00:02:07.840> it's<00:02:08.019> all<00:02:08.140> they

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
are full time curing races it's all they

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.030 
are full time curing races it's all they
do<00:02:08.349> they're<00:02:08.979> experts<00:02:09.670> or<00:02:09.819> specialists

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.770 

generally<00:02:15.040> pre-race<00:02:15.430> they<00:02:15.670> go<00:02:16.510> through<00:02:16.720> a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
generally pre-race they go through a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.830 
generally pre-race they go through a
pretty<00:02:17.349> specific<00:02:17.530> routine<00:02:18.420> about<00:02:19.420> an<00:02:19.630> hour

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
pretty specific routine about an hour

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.809 
pretty specific routine about an hour
before<00:02:20.010> I'll<00:02:21.010> jump<00:02:21.250> on<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.489> rollers<00:02:21.790> just

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
before I'll jump on the rollers just

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.770 
before I'll jump on the rollers just
nice<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.389> easy

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
nice and easy

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.360 
nice and easy
didn't<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.349> show<00:02:23.500> her<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> bit<00:02:23.859> of<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.010> sprint

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
didn't you show her a bit of a sprint

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.509 
didn't you show her a bit of a sprint
and<00:02:25.209> then<00:02:26.139> a<00:02:26.349> few<00:02:26.590> stretches<00:02:26.799> maybe<00:02:27.340> some

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
and then a few stretches maybe some

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.910
