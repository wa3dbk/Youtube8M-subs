00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.050 
but I mean just because he accepts it
doesn't<00:04:16.560> mean<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.130> should<00:04:17.430> accept<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.820> as<00:04:17.910> well

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.840 
let me know in the comments below
because<00:05:00.290> hopefully<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:01.530> turn<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.070> if<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.670> is

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
because hopefully you turn it if it is

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.120 
because hopefully you turn it if it is
the<00:05:02.880> case<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.900> everyone's<00:05:04.320> got<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:04.890> they

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
the case if everyone's got it and they

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.420 
the case if everyone's got it and they
find<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.850> is<00:05:06.480> a<00:05:06.540> foe<00:05:06.990> as<00:05:07.530> opposed<00:05:07.950> to<00:05:08.070> what

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
find that it is a foe as opposed to what

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.600 
find that it is a foe as opposed to what
the<00:05:08.580> Apple<00:05:09.320> staff<00:05:10.320> claimed<00:05:10.680> that<00:05:10.860> every<00:05:11.310> phone

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
the Apple staff claimed that every phone

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.120 
the Apple staff claimed that every phone
does<00:05:11.820> it<00:05:11.940> because<00:05:12.180> it<00:05:12.270> has<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:12.740> vibrating<00:05:13.740> part

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
does it because it has a vibrating part

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.820 
does it because it has a vibrating part
then<00:05:14.850> maybe<00:05:15.420> you<00:05:15.570> could<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:16.260> know<00:05:16.290> make<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.650> a

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
then maybe you could you know make it a

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.250 
then maybe you could you know make it a
big<00:05:16.980> deal<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:18.510> will<00:05:18.660> turn<00:05:18.810> out<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:18.960> be<00:05:19.080> one

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
big deal and it will turn out to be one

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.150 
big deal and it will turn out to be one
