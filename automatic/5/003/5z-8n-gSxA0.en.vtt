by HK audio it's come through the
complete<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:39.960> six<00:00:40.079> elements<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
complete with six elements you have a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.900 
complete with six elements you have a
passive<00:00:41.879> subwoofer<00:00:42.360> an<00:00:42.629> active<00:00:43.290> subwoofer

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
passive subwoofer an active subwoofer

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.590 
passive subwoofer an active subwoofer
you<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.510> ant<00:00:46.440> module<00:00:47.239> which<00:00:48.239> looks<00:00:48.420> very

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
you have a ant module which looks very

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
you have a ant module which looks very
similar<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> mid<00:00:49.170> high<00:00:49.320> unit<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
similar to the mid high unit so you

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.220 
similar to the mid high unit so you
basically<00:00:51.120> click<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.780> together<00:00:51.899> like

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
basically click it all together like

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
basically click it all together like
Lego<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.379> build<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.309> 44<00:00:56.760> different

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
Lego you can build up to 44 different

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.750 
Lego you can build up to 44 different
systems<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.780> set<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.579> it<00:00:59.579> comes

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
systems with the one set up it comes

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.869 
systems with the one set up it comes
with<00:00:59.969> an<00:01:00.090> extension<00:01:00.420> pole<00:01:00.890> all<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.129> rigging

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
with an extension pole all the rigging

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.060 
with an extension pole all the rigging
is<00:01:02.969> internal<00:01:03.559> well<00:01:04.559> those<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:04.920> another

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
is internal well those are another

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.950 
is internal well those are another
reading<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> powers<00:01:06.060> internal<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.720> can

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
reading the powers internal so you can

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 
reading the powers internal so you can
in<00:01:07.799> signal<00:01:08.159> cables<00:01:08.490> internal<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.119> just

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
in signal cables internal so you just

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.630 
in signal cables internal so you just
that<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:09.990> through<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:11.689> clip<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.370 

it<00:01:17.180> high<00:01:17.390> unit<00:01:18.400> trading<00:01:19.400> like<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:21.260> you

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
it high unit trading like that and you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.320 
it high unit trading like that and you
can<00:01:21.530> keep<00:01:21.650> on<00:01:21.830> going<00:01:22.130> up<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.550> up<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.030> up<00:01:23.120> and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
can keep on going up and up and up and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.510 
can keep on going up and up and up and
up<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:24.170> we'll<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:24.409> run<00:01:24.500> with<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.310> for<00:01:25.490> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
up so we'll just run with this for the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.670 
up so we'll just run with this for the
moment<00:01:25.700> okay<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.659> currently<00:01:27.200> what<00:01:27.380> we've<00:01:27.530> got

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
moment okay so currently what we've got

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.050 
moment okay so currently what we've got
here<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.990> one<00:01:29.990> passive<00:01:30.440> sub<00:01:30.740> being<00:01:31.400> powered<00:01:31.850> by

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
here is one passive sub being powered by

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.540 
here is one passive sub being powered by
the<00:01:32.119> amp<00:01:32.510> module<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:34.040> looks<00:01:34.190> like<00:01:34.280> we've

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
the amp module and it looks like we've

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.460 
the amp module and it looks like we've
got<00:01:34.670> one<00:01:34.910> top<00:01:35.180> box<00:01:35.420> going<00:01:35.690> on<00:01:35.930> top<00:01:36.140> we'll<00:01:36.290> just

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
got one top box going on top we'll just

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.040 
got one top box going on top we'll just
stick<00:01:36.619> with<00:01:36.770> one<00:01:36.979> top<00:01:37.220> box<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.670> I'll<00:01:38.660> throw<00:01:38.930> up

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
stick with one top box and I'll throw up

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.380 
stick with one top box and I'll throw up
another<00:01:39.170> one<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.130> looks<00:01:40.310> like<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:40.970> amp

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
another one so it looks like this amp

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.609 
another one so it looks like this amp
module<00:01:41.840> them<00:01:41.990> up<00:01:42.110> would<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.290> be<00:01:42.440> right<00:01:42.590> in

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
module them up would I be right in

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.690 
module them up would I be right in
saying<00:01:42.800> would<00:01:43.729> power<00:01:44.140> 1<00:01:45.140> passive<00:01:45.590> sub<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.130> two

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
saying would power 1 passive sub and two

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.790 
saying would power 1 passive sub and two
of<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.909> top<00:01:47.119> satellite<00:01:47.600> speakers<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.560> at

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
of the top satellite speakers the at

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.950 
of the top satellite speakers the at
module<00:01:49.039> power<00:01:49.399> up<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.820> four<00:01:50.210> mid<00:01:50.509> high<00:01:50.660> units

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
module power up to four mid high units

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.650 
module power up to four mid high units
or<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.580> passive<00:01:52.580> subwoofers<00:01:53.060> or<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.539> this

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
or to passive subwoofers or in this

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.260 
or to passive subwoofers or in this
situation<00:01:54.080> a<00:01:54.140> passive<00:01:54.440> subwoofer<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.759> mid

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
situation a passive subwoofer and to mid

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.770 
situation a passive subwoofer and to mid
high<00:01:56.420> units<00:01:58.090> would<00:01:59.090> have<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.270> bit<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.450> illicit

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
high units would have a bit of illicit

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.969 
high units would have a bit of illicit
well<00:01:59.930> why<00:02:00.080> not<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:00.500> looked<00:02:00.770> probably

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
well why not this looked probably

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.040 
well why not this looked probably
something<00:02:01.610> that<00:02:01.759> would<00:02:01.880> be<00:02:02.000> great<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.630> in<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
something that would be great in in the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.169 
something that would be great in in the
shop<00:02:03.259> there's<00:02:03.920> not<00:02:04.250> very<00:02:04.280> much<00:02:04.670> else<00:02:04.970> that

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
shop there's not very much else that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:06.490 
shop there's not very much else that
looks<00:02:05.270> like<00:02:05.539> it<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.750> can<00:02:05.810> think<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.259> another

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
looks like it I can think of another

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.979 
looks like it I can think of another
brand<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:07.220> four<00:02:07.700> letters<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.360> have<00:02:08.479> produced

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
brand of four letters that have produced

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.610 
brand of four letters that have produced
something<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:09.830> but<00:02:10.489> not<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.239> is

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
something like this but not that is

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.050 
something like this but not that is
going<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.739> come<00:02:12.920> apart<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.670> or<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.940> be

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
going to come apart like this or to be

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.690 
going to come apart like this or to be
added<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.780> think<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.380> whole<00:02:15.700> elements

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
added to and I think the whole elements

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.850 
added to and I think the whole elements
thing<00:02:16.940> just<00:02:17.330> keep<00:02:17.510> adding<00:02:17.720> what<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.200> need<00:02:18.380> you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
thing just keep adding what you need you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.550 
thing just keep adding what you need you
can<00:02:19.010> actually<00:02:19.130> build<00:02:19.400> right<00:02:19.610> up<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.560> three

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
can actually build right up to a three

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.410 
can actually build right up to a three

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
point 6 K system as well so you can run

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.569 
point 6 K system as well so you can run
a<00:02:23.450> full<00:02:24.049> band<00:02:24.260> through<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:24.680> unlike<00:02:25.310> some<00:02:25.489> of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
a full band through this unlike some of

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.650 
a full band through this unlike some of
the<00:02:25.640> competitors<00:02:26.060> where<00:02:26.299> they're<00:02:26.450> sort<00:02:26.630> of

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the competitors where they're sort of

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.940 
the competitors where they're sort of

here just out of the quick look you have
a<00:03:34.960> selection<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.470> filters<00:03:35.800> here<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.070> basically

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
a selection of filters here so basically

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.160 
a selection of filters here so basically
you<00:03:36.820> just<00:03:36.850> tell<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.240> how<00:03:37.360> many<00:03:37.450> top<00:03:37.720> boxes<00:03:38.050> you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
you just tell it how many top boxes you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.420 
you just tell it how many top boxes you
want<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.410> run<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.740> you<00:03:38.770> switch<00:03:39.010> through<00:03:39.250> that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
want to run to you switch through that

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.400 
want to run to you switch through that
and<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.390> if<00:03:40.450> you're<00:03:40.570> running<00:03:40.750> one<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.050> say<00:03:41.200> one

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
and so if you're running one you say one

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.870 
and so if you're running one you say one
two<00:03:41.680> three<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.100> four<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.430> all<00:03:42.490> that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
two three and four and all that

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.540 
two three and four and all that
obviously<00:03:43.180> does<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.040> line<00:03:45.190> array<00:03:45.340> sort

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
obviously does is to the line array sort

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.220 
obviously does is to the line array sort
of<00:03:45.610> filtering<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.000> just<00:03:46.210> adjusts<00:03:46.990> your<00:03:47.020> low

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
of filtering it just adjusts your low

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.070 
of filtering it just adjusts your low
mids<00:03:47.500> for<00:03:47.740> fougere<00:03:48.400> coupling<00:03:48.820> as<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.750> go<00:03:49.900> so

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
mids for fougere coupling as you go so

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.360 
mids for fougere coupling as you go so
obviously<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.500> longer<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.830> banana<00:03:51.160> the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
obviously the longer you banana the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.980 
obviously the longer you banana the
better<00:03:51.550> than<00:03:51.670> your<00:03:51.760> performance<00:03:52.210> all<00:03:52.720> right

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
better than your performance all right

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.600 
better than your performance all right
well<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.440> show<00:03:53.650> would<00:03:53.890> not<00:03:53.920> be<00:03:54.190> complete

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
well the show would not be complete

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.190 
well the show would not be complete
unless<00:03:54.760> we<00:03:55.090> heard<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.540> let's<00:03:55.750> have<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:55.960> think

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
unless we heard it let's have a think

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.050 
unless we heard it let's have a think
because<00:03:56.560> if<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.800> sounds<00:03:57.340> as<00:03:57.490> good<00:03:57.550> as<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.880> looks

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
because if it sounds as good as it looks

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.340 
because if it sounds as good as it looks
I<00:03:58.240> think<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.570> we<00:03:58.630> should<00:03:58.810> put<00:03:58.990> it<00:03:59.110> in<00:03:59.230> the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
I think that we should put it in the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.720 
I think that we should put it in the
shop<00:04:01.740> now<00:04:02.740> I'm<00:04:02.800> not<00:04:02.950> sure<00:04:03.160> if<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.370> can<00:04:03.490> hear

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
shop now I'm not sure if you can hear

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.850 
shop now I'm not sure if you can hear
that<00:04:03.880> at<00:04:04.030> home<00:04:04.210> but<00:04:04.450> by<00:04:04.990> gosh<00:04:05.410> that's<00:04:05.680> a

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
that at home but by gosh that's a

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.080 
that at home but by gosh that's a
pleasant<00:04:06.100> sound

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.500 

[Music]

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.270 

No

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.180 

but<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.520> heart<00:04:21.590> you're<00:04:22.590> not<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:22.980> get<00:04:23.070> an

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
but the heart you're not going to get an

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.950 
but the heart you're not going to get an
idea<00:04:23.490> through<00:04:23.790> the<00:04:23.910> microphone<00:04:24.480> but<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.750> can

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
idea through the microphone but I can

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.480 
idea through the microphone but I can
certainly<00:04:25.200> say<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:25.710> there<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.160> nice

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
certainly say that there is a nice

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.030 
certainly say that there is a nice
balance<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.210> bottom<00:04:27.540> end<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.840> top<00:04:28.110> end<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.830> is

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
balance of bottom end and top end it is

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.190 
balance of bottom end and top end it is
so<00:04:29.310> flexible<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:30.030> put<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.330> together<00:04:30.570> it

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
so flexible to put this together it

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.870 
so flexible to put this together it
certainly<00:04:31.680> does<00:04:31.950> sound<00:04:32.220> like<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.640> quality

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
certainly does sound like the quality

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.730 
certainly does sound like the quality
that<00:04:33.120> we<00:04:33.270> should<00:04:33.600> expect<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.990> see<00:04:34.110> at<00:04:34.350> factory

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
that we should expect to see at factory

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.920 
that we should expect to see at factory
sound<00:04:34.920> so<00:04:35.250> if<00:04:35.670> anybody<00:04:36.150> would<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.600> see

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
sound so if anybody would like to see

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.320 
sound so if anybody would like to see
this<00:04:37.170> know<00:04:37.800> from<00:04:38.070> now<00:04:38.250> pop<00:04:38.730> into<00:04:38.970> Factory

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
this know from now pop into Factory

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.910 
this know from now pop into Factory
we're<00:04:39.480> going<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.750> have<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.900> demo<00:04:40.260> system<00:04:40.710> just

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
we're going to have a demo system just

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.490 
we're going to have a demo system just
like<00:04:40.980> this<00:04:41.280> set<00:04:41.580> up<00:04:41.730> go<00:04:42.240> through<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:42.960> if

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
like this set up go through it so if

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
you're in a small band if you've got a

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.660 
you're in a small band if you've got a
small<00:04:45.840> act<00:04:46.170> that<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.890> just<00:04:47.070> need<00:04:47.310> something

small act that you just need something

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.120 
small act that you just need something
for<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.690> hundred<00:04:48.990> people<00:04:49.650> in<00:04:49.830> an<00:04:49.950> environment
