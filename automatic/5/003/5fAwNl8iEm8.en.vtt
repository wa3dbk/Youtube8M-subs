the<00:00:18.720> suppressor<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.439> are<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> differences

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
the suppressor what are the differences

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.710 
the suppressor what are the differences
between<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.550> flash<00:00:20.789> suppressor<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
between the flash suppressor and the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.750 
between the flash suppressor and the
suppressor<00:00:22.289> aka<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> silencer<00:00:23.279> was<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.580> call

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
suppressor aka the silencer was it call

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.220 
suppressor aka the silencer was it call
that<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> silencer<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.779> confuse<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that the silencer not to confuse you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.380 
that the silencer not to confuse you
guys<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> flash<00:00:25.859> suppressor<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
guys with the flash suppressor and I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.150 
guys with the flash suppressor and I
don't<00:00:27.570> use<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> silencer<00:00:28.109> very<00:00:28.560> often<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.010> all

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
don't use the silencer very often at all

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
don't use the silencer very often at all
to<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.429> honest<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.880> found<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> recent

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
to be honest I found it with the recent

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
to be honest I found it with the recent
patch<00:00:31.500> they've<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:32.130> made<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:33.030> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
patch they've really made it not that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
patch they've really made it not that
good<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> mean<00:00:33.870> that's<00:00:34.170> probably<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
good I mean that's probably one of the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.380 
good I mean that's probably one of the
attachments<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> biggest<00:00:36.030> nerf

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
attachments to get the biggest nerf

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.780 
attachments to get the biggest nerf
because<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.440> made<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> damage<00:00:38.370> drop<00:00:38.610> off

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
because they made the damage drop off

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
because they made the damage drop off
start<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> lot<00:00:39.450> sooner<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> don't<00:00:40.379> know

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
start a lot sooner and if you don't know

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.869 
start a lot sooner and if you don't know
what<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.739> means<00:00:40.950> we'll<00:00:41.160> talk<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> little<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
what that means we'll talk a little a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.630 
what that means we'll talk a little a
little<00:00:42.120> bit<00:00:42.360> about<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.050> later<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.640> but

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
little bit about that here later on but

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.220 
little bit about that here later on but
they<00:00:44.730> also<00:00:44.879> made<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.539> hipfire<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
they also made it so that hipfire is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.310 
they also made it so that hipfire is
worse<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.360> well<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.450> didn't<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:49.079> didn't

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
worse and well they didn't they didn't

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
worse and well they didn't they didn't
make<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> vertical<00:00:50.340> recoil<00:00:50.579> was

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
make it so that the vertical recoil was

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.490 
make it so that the vertical recoil was
reduced<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.660> using<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.960> suppressor<00:00:52.199> which

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
reduced when using the suppressor which

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
reduced when using the suppressor which
is<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:52.890> nice<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.309> mean<00:00:53.399> that's<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.670> really

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
is really nice I mean that's a really

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.490 
is really nice I mean that's a really
big<00:00:54.090> advantage<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> sizable<00:00:55.410> advantage

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
big advantage that's a sizable advantage

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
big advantage that's a sizable advantage
to<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.239> when<00:00:57.239> using<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> presser<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to have when using this as a presser it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.869 
to have when using this as a presser it
not<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> mention<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> already<00:00:59.430> keeps<00:00:59.760> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
not to mention that it already keeps you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
not to mention that it already keeps you
off<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.059> radar<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.140> fact<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> does

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
off the radar but the fact that it does

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
off the radar but the fact that it does
increase<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> damage<00:01:02.550> drop-off<00:01:03.030> makes<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
increase the damage drop-off makes it a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
increase the damage drop-off makes it a
really<00:01:03.960> limited<00:01:04.470> attachment<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.369> find

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
really limited attachment if you find

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
really limited attachment if you find
yourself<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> people's<00:01:06.659> faces<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
yourself right in people's faces if you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.460 
yourself right in people's faces if you
find<00:01:07.500> yourself<00:01:07.590> being<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.460> beyond<00:01:09.470> 50

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
find yourself being you know beyond 50

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.800 
find yourself being you know beyond 50
yards<00:01:10.890> or<00:01:11.400> 15<00:01:11.760> meters<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.150> should<00:01:12.299> say<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> want

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
yards or 15 meters I should say you want

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.450 
yards or 15 meters I should say you want
to<00:01:12.900> try<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> avoid<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> suppressor<00:01:14.189> because

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
to try to avoid the suppressor because

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.920 
to try to avoid the suppressor because
the<00:01:14.580> suppressor<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.450> make<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the suppressor is going to make it so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.510 
the suppressor is going to make it so
that<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.200> damage<00:01:16.560> drop-off<00:01:16.920> starts<00:01:17.310> much

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that your damage drop-off starts much

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.640 
that your damage drop-off starts much
sooner<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> minimum<00:01:19.470> damage

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
sooner and you get to the minimum damage

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.340 
sooner and you get to the minimum damage
must<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.460> sooner<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.900> instance<00:01:22.200> here

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
must much sooner so for instance here

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
must much sooner so for instance here
you're<00:01:22.799> seeing<00:01:23.040> me<00:01:23.280> use<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> M<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.420> M<00:01:24.570> for

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you're seeing me use the M for the M for

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.530 
you're seeing me use the M for the M for
the<00:01:25.080> damage<00:01:25.439> hits<00:01:25.920> its<00:01:26.100> minimum<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.610> 50<00:01:27.150> yards

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the damage hits its minimum at 50 yards

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.330 
the damage hits its minimum at 50 yards
or<00:01:27.900> 50<00:01:28.200> meters<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.530> keep<00:01:28.680> saying<00:01:28.829> yards<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
or 50 meters they keep saying yards I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.100 
or 50 meters they keep saying yards I
keep<00:01:29.670> wanting<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.270> American<00:01:30.810> used<00:01:30.990> in

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
keep wanting be that American used in

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
keep wanting be that American used in
the<00:01:31.200> arts<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.560> no<00:01:31.680> 50<00:01:32.340> meters

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the arts but no 50 meters

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
the arts but no 50 meters
it<00:01:33.299> starts<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.689> 50<00:01:33.960> meters<00:01:34.110> well<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> put

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
it starts at 50 meters well if you put

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
it starts at 50 meters well if you put
on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> suppressor<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> start<00:01:36.509> at

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
on the suppressor it's going to start at

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.850 
on the suppressor it's going to start at
30<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.200> means<00:01:37.380> you're<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> hit

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
30 so that means you're going to hit

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
30 so that means you're going to hit
that<00:01:37.970> 14.5<00:01:38.970> damage<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.600> whatever<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.200> that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that 14.5 damage or whatever it is that

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.770 
that 14.5 damage or whatever it is that
its<00:01:40.530> lowest<00:01:40.950> much<00:01:41.549> much<00:01:41.790> sooner<00:01:42.030> almost<00:01:42.479> 20

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
its lowest much much sooner almost 20

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.289 
its lowest much much sooner almost 20
meters<00:01:43.200> sooner<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.369> suppressor<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.909> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
meters sooner with the suppressor on so

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
meters sooner with the suppressor on so
if<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> find<00:01:46.049> yourself<00:01:46.140> engaging<00:01:46.770> people<00:01:47.100> out

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
if you find yourself engaging people out

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.490 
if you find yourself engaging people out
close<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.450> might<00:01:48.689> want<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
close you might want to think about the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.840 
close you might want to think about the
suppressor<00:01:49.950> because<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> make

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
suppressor because it is going to make

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.399 
suppressor because it is going to make
it<00:01:50.970> easier<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.299> control<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.810> weapon<00:01:52.140> because

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it easier to control your weapon because

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.830 
it easier to control your weapon because
the<00:01:52.560> recoil<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.310> reduced<00:01:54.210> by<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the recoil is going to be reduced by you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.690 
the recoil is going to be reduced by you
know<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> pretty<00:01:55.200> good<00:01:55.350> amount<00:01:55.610> but<00:01:56.610> you're

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
know a pretty good amount but you're

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.010 
know a pretty good amount but you're
also<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> keep<00:01:57.240> yourself<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:57.750> frayed

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
also going to keep yourself are frayed

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.810 
also going to keep yourself are frayed
are<00:01:58.170> well<00:01:58.439> where<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.490> find<00:01:59.700> yourself

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
are well where is if you find yourself

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.760 
are well where is if you find yourself
shooting<00:02:00.329> people<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.990> far<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
shooting people really far like at the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.990 
shooting people really far like at the
end<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.070> hallway<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.490> notice<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.880> was

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
end of this hallway you notice I was

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.580 
end of this hallway you notice I was
getting<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.420> hit<00:02:03.540> markers<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.320> might

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
getting a lot of hit markers you might

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.399 
getting a lot of hit markers you might
want<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.860> consider<00:02:05.189> taking<00:02:05.399> off<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.149> know

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
want to consider taking off the you know

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.630 
want to consider taking off the you know
the<00:02:07.409> suppressor<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:07.979> putting<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> flash

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the suppressor and putting on the flash

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.999 
the suppressor and putting on the flash
suppressor<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.020> lot<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.619> choices<00:02:10.890> here

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
suppressor so a lot of choices here

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.010 
suppressor so a lot of choices here
basically<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:12.000> what<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.629> flash<00:02:12.840> suppressor

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
basically what what the flash suppressor

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.820 
basically what what the flash suppressor
does<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.650> they

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
does is they

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.390 
does is they
it<00:02:14.100> reduces<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.760> vertical<00:02:15.240> recoil<00:02:15.450> without

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
it reduces the vertical recoil without

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.680 
it reduces the vertical recoil without
affecting<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.520> damage<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> pretty

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
affecting the damage and that's a pretty

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.200 
affecting the damage and that's a pretty
big<00:02:18.870> advantage<00:02:19.020> now<00:02:19.470> both<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.250> flash<00:02:20.850> and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
big advantage now both the the flash and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.900 
big advantage now both the the flash and
the<00:02:21.420> silencer<00:02:22.050> both<00:02:22.400> reduce<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.580> hipfire

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the silencer both reduce the hipfire

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.280 
the silencer both reduce the hipfire
spread<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.360> mean<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.690> makes<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.050> lot<00:02:25.230> harder

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
spread I mean it makes it a lot harder

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.440 
spread I mean it makes it a lot harder
to<00:02:25.740> just<00:02:26.280> kind<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.490> spray<00:02:26.730> people<00:02:26.910> down<00:02:27.240> up

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
to just kind of spray people down up

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.240 
to just kind of spray people down up
close<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.080> find<00:02:28.290> yourself<00:02:28.380> using<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
close so if you find yourself using the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.640 
close so if you find yourself using the
hipfire<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.390> lot<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.050> might<00:02:31.290> want<00:02:31.560> to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
hipfire a lot you might want to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.680 
hipfire a lot you might want to
reconsider<00:02:32.070> either<00:02:32.730> these<00:02:33.030> attachments<00:02:33.600> and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
reconsider either these attachments and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.060 
reconsider either these attachments and
maybe<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.930> want<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.140> go<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:34.530> something<00:02:34.890> else

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
maybe you want to go for something else

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.160 
maybe you want to go for something else
maybe<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.330> grip<00:02:36.540> or<00:02:36.720> something<00:02:37.020> like<00:02:37.110> that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
maybe for grip or something like that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
maybe for grip or something like that
which<00:02:37.560> doesn't<00:02:37.920> really<00:02:38.040> hurt<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.490> ton<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.090> a

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
which doesn't really hurt in a ton so a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.380 
which doesn't really hurt in a ton so a
lot<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.220> choices<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.850> mean<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.090> would<00:02:42.360> say

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
lot of choices here I mean I would say

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.020 
lot of choices here I mean I would say
that<00:02:42.620> suppressor<00:02:43.620> was<00:02:43.770> one<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.130> most<00:02:44.490> used

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
that suppressor was one of the most used

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.020 
that suppressor was one of the most used
attachments<00:02:45.780> before<00:02:46.710> they<00:02:47.130> patched<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.670> now<00:02:48.000> I

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
attachments before they patched it now I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.760 
attachments before they patched it now I
would<00:02:48.480> say<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:49.080> probably<00:02:49.350> one<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
would say that it's probably one of the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.920 
would say that it's probably one of the
worst<00:02:49.920> choices<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> lot<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.880> weapons<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
worst choices on a lot of weapons the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.130 
worst choices on a lot of weapons the
weapons<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.320> do<00:02:52.380> enjoy<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.160> or<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.959> m4<00:02:54.959> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
weapons I do enjoy it on or the m4 the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.680 
weapons I do enjoy it on or the m4 the
m16<00:02:55.800> are<00:02:56.070> both<00:02:56.340> solid<00:02:56.790> solid<00:02:57.000> choices<00:02:57.420> because

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
m16 are both solid solid choices because

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.150 
m16 are both solid solid choices because
they<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> high<00:02:58.350> rate<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.560> fire<00:02:58.680> allows

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
they do have a high rate of fire allows

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.400 
they do have a high rate of fire allows
you<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.370> get<00:02:59.490> in<00:02:59.640> there<00:02:59.760> close<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.840> found<00:03:01.260> some

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
you to get in there close I found some

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.230 
you to get in there close I found some
they<00:03:01.500> both<00:03:01.680> do<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.190> really<00:03:02.520> low<00:03:02.670> recoil<00:03:02.940> that

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
they both do have really low recoil that

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.730 
they both do have really low recoil that
the<00:03:03.420> suppressor<00:03:03.840> doesn't<00:03:04.140> make<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.380> big<00:03:04.440> fat

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
the suppressor doesn't make that big fat

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.530 
the suppressor doesn't make that big fat
deal<00:03:04.890> because<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.550> stay<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:05.970> target<00:03:06.209> for

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
deal because you can stay on target for

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.060 
deal because you can stay on target for
those<00:03:06.630> extra<00:03:06.959> shots<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.440> going<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.709> take<00:03:07.890> at

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
those extra shots it's going to take at

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.310 
those extra shots it's going to take at
longer<00:03:08.310> ranges<00:03:08.760> because<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.630> has<00:03:10.050> such<00:03:10.290> a

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
longer ranges because it just has such a

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.010 
longer ranges because it just has such a
flat<00:03:10.650> recoil<00:03:11.130> so<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.330> situation<00:03:12.540> where

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
flat recoil so that's a situation where

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.870 
flat recoil so that's a situation where
the<00:03:13.170> where<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.709> silencer<00:03:14.070> doesn't<00:03:14.459> affect<00:03:14.760> at

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
the where the silencer doesn't affect at

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.390 
the where the silencer doesn't affect at
a<00:03:14.970> ton<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.360> f2000<00:03:16.080> that's<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.830> great<00:03:17.190> choice

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
a ton the f2000 that's a great choice

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.800 
a ton the f2000 that's a great choice
for<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.790> silencer<00:03:18.120> because<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.390> has<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> lot<00:03:18.780> of

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
for the silencer because it has a lot of

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.199 
for the silencer because it has a lot of
vertical<00:03:19.260> recoil<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.830> once<00:03:20.640> again<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.060> does

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
vertical recoil and once again it does

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.940 
vertical recoil and once again it does
shoot<00:03:21.390> very<00:03:21.690> very<00:03:21.900> fast<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.680> can<00:03:22.830> get

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
shoot very very fast so if you can get

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.410 
shoot very very fast so if you can get
on<00:03:23.070> target<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.519> get<00:03:23.610> those<00:03:23.760> bullets<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.269> there

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
on target and get those bullets in there

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.140 
on target and get those bullets in there
real<00:03:24.600> quick<00:03:25.100> it's<00:03:26.100> gonna<00:03:26.220> do<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.670> know<00:03:26.790> it's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
real quick it's gonna do you know it's

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.300 
real quick it's gonna do you know it's
gonna<00:03:27.330> get<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.840> job<00:03:27.870> done<00:03:28.290> whereas<00:03:28.709> weapons

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
gonna get the job done whereas weapons

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.530 
gonna get the job done whereas weapons
that<00:03:29.400> shoot<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.670> little<00:03:29.790> bit<00:03:29.970> slower<00:03:30.209> like<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
that shoot a little bit slower like the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.870 
that shoot a little bit slower like the
ak-74m<00:03:31.230> that's<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.830> it's<00:03:32.130> usually<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.459> weapon<00:03:32.820> I

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
ak-74m that's a it's usually a weapon I

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.490 
ak-74m that's a it's usually a weapon I
like<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.150> stay<00:03:33.360> away<00:03:33.450> from<00:03:33.660> with<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.110> silencer

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
like to stay away from with the silencer

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.780 
like to stay away from with the silencer
because<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.800> really<00:03:35.040> seems<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.400> hurt<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
because it really seems to hurt it

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.180 
because it really seems to hurt it
because<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.150> do<00:03:36.269> shoot<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.410> slow<00:03:37.769> with<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
because you do shoot so so slow with it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.280 
because you do shoot so so slow with it
but<00:03:38.400> really<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.510> gonna<00:03:39.630> come<00:03:39.870> down<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.200> your

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
but really it's gonna come down to your

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.380 
but really it's gonna come down to your
play<00:03:40.500> style<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:40.950> said<00:03:41.250> with<00:03:41.880> weapons<00:03:42.330> that

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
play style like I said with weapons that

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.509 
play style like I said with weapons that
are<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.690> your<00:03:42.840> face<00:03:43.080> such<00:03:43.380> as<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> m4<00:03:43.800> I've

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
are in your face such as the m4 I've

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.460 
are in your face such as the m4 I've
really<00:03:45.030> found<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.750> suppressor<00:03:46.290> is

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
really found that the suppressor is

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.710 
really found that the suppressor is
something<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.070> works<00:03:47.310> well<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.880> like<00:03:48.030> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
something that works well on it like the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.660 
something that works well on it like the
a91<00:03:49.140> used<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.650> be<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.800> weapon<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.190> use<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.459> lots

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
a91 used to be a weapon I use the lots

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.250 
a91 used to be a weapon I use the lots
of<00:03:50.790> press<00:03:51.030> too<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:51.720> you're<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> fan<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.050> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
of press too so if you're a fan of the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.710 
of press too so if you're a fan of the
a91<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.920> might<00:03:53.100> want<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.310> try<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.700> out<00:03:53.730> now

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
a91 you might want to try that out now

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.000 
a91 you might want to try that out now
like<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.959> said<00:03:55.140> it's<00:03:55.260> really<00:03:55.320> going<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.830> limit

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
like I said it's really going to limit

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.250 
like I said it's really going to limit
your<00:03:56.160> distance<00:03:56.610> um<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:57.180> lot<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.840> people<00:03:58.050> say

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
your distance um a lot of people say

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.780 
your distance um a lot of people say
like<00:03:58.470> Google<00:03:58.709> mid<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.860> put<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.340> suits<00:03:59.700> are

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
like Google mid I put on the suits are

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.920 
like Google mid I put on the suits are
known<00:03:59.940> it's<00:04:00.090> just<00:04:00.209> feeling<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.540> can't<00:04:00.780> kill

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
known it's just feeling I can't kill

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.000 
known it's just feeling I can't kill
anybody<00:04:01.140> well<00:04:01.440> that's<00:04:01.590> because<00:04:01.769> you're

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
anybody well that's because you're

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.530 
anybody well that's because you're
shooting<00:04:02.160> people<00:04:02.430> you're<00:04:02.820> engaging<00:04:03.120> them<00:04:03.360> at

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
shooting people you're engaging them at

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.820 
shooting people you're engaging them at
ranges<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.140> shouldn't<00:04:04.410> be<00:04:04.470> engaging

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
ranges that you shouldn't be engaging

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.500 
ranges that you shouldn't be engaging
them<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.489> like<00:04:05.640> right<00:04:05.850> now<00:04:06.000> me<00:04:06.209> engaging

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
them in see like right now me engaging

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.479

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
that guy he's too far away I shouldn't

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.860 
that guy he's too far away I shouldn't
even<00:04:08.580> be<00:04:08.700> shooting<00:04:09.060> at<00:04:09.180> those<00:04:09.330> guys<00:04:09.540> but

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
even be shooting at those guys but

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.840 
even be shooting at those guys but
eventually<00:04:10.860> here<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.040> learned<00:04:11.280> my<00:04:11.430> lesson<00:04:11.459> and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
eventually here I learned my lesson and

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.340 
eventually here I learned my lesson and
decide<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.150> take<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.420> different<00:04:12.660> route<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.200> try

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
decide to take a different route to try

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.930 
decide to take a different route to try
to<00:04:13.410> get<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> get<00:04:14.130> an<00:04:14.220> angle<00:04:14.489> on<00:04:14.610> these<00:04:14.730> guys

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
to get a get an angle on these guys

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.640 
to get a get an angle on these guys
because<00:04:15.269> like<00:04:15.390> I<00:04:15.480> said<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.959> just<00:04:16.140> can't<00:04:16.380> seem

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
because like I said you just can't seem

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.409 
because like I said you just can't seem
to<00:04:16.680> do<00:04:16.979> work<00:04:17.280> at<00:04:17.489> longer<00:04:17.760> ranges<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.299> the

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
to do work at longer ranges with the

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.880 
to do work at longer ranges with the
suppressor<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.140> it's<00:04:19.290> definitely<00:04:19.709> an

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
suppressor so it's definitely an

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.550 
suppressor so it's definitely an
in-your-face<00:04:20.190> type<00:04:20.660> attachments<00:04:21.660> now<00:04:21.750> it

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
in-your-face type attachments now it

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.320 
in-your-face type attachments now it
used<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.800> be<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.130> lot<00:04:23.490> more<00:04:23.669> versatile<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.180> my

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
used to be a lot more versatile in my

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.090 
used to be a lot more versatile in my
eyes<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.600> used<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.020> used<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.350> use<00:04:25.560> suppressor

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
eyes I used to I used to use suppressor

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.260 
eyes I used to I used to use suppressor
all<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.640> time<00:04:26.880> but

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
all the time but

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.170 
all the time but
rarely<00:04:28.020> do<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.289> see<00:04:28.500> me<00:04:28.650> running<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.180> getting

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
rarely do you see me running it getting

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.960 
rarely do you see me running it getting
sniped<00:04:30.449> but<00:04:30.919> overall<00:04:31.919> like<00:04:32.099> I<00:04:32.129> said<00:04:32.400> look<00:04:32.789> for

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
sniped but overall like I said look for

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.279 
sniped but overall like I said look for
weapons<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.389> have<00:04:33.569> a<00:04:33.599> lot<00:04:33.810> of<00:04:33.840> vertical

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
weapons that have a lot of vertical

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.020 
weapons that have a lot of vertical
recoil<00:04:34.470> if<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:34.860> see<00:04:35.039> a<00:04:35.069> weapon<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.639> find

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
recoil if you see a weapon and you find

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.730 
recoil if you see a weapon and you find
that<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:36.330> hard<00:04:36.449> to<00:04:36.599> control<00:04:36.810> upward<00:04:37.440> recoil

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
that it's hard to control upward recoil

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.249 
that it's hard to control upward recoil
on<00:04:38.129> it<00:04:38.340> try<00:04:38.879> the<00:04:38.940> suppressor<00:04:39.479> on<00:04:39.509> it<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:39.780> mean<00:04:40.050> it

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
on it try the suppressor on it I mean it

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.110 
on it try the suppressor on it I mean it
does<00:04:40.470> have<00:04:40.740> an<00:04:40.889> advantage<00:04:40.979> of<00:04:41.460> reducing<00:04:42.000> that

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
does have an advantage of reducing that

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.290 
does have an advantage of reducing that
a<00:04:42.150> lot<00:04:42.389> if<00:04:43.289> you<00:04:43.349> don't<00:04:43.650> want<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.400> downside<00:04:45.270> of

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
a lot if you don't want the downside of

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.089 
a lot if you don't want the downside of
having<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.990> drop<00:04:46.199> off<00:04:46.409> try<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.800> flash

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
having the drop off try the flash

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.589 
having the drop off try the flash
suppressor<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.849> those<00:04:48.270> are<00:04:48.449> two<00:04:48.569> big

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
suppressor so those are two big

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.170 
suppressor so those are two big
differences<00:04:48.960> guys<00:04:49.440> I<00:04:49.470> mean<00:04:49.770> pretty<00:04:50.580> set<00:04:50.879> you

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
differences guys I mean pretty set you

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.670 
differences guys I mean pretty set you
know<00:04:51.300> right<00:04:51.810> in<00:04:51.840> your<00:04:52.110> face<00:04:52.289> you<00:04:52.470> know<00:04:52.590> you

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
know right in your face you know you

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.680 
know right in your face you know you
understand<00:04:53.190> what<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.400> means<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.759> got<00:04:54.449> faith<00:04:54.659> in

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
understand what it means I got faith in

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.029 
understand what it means I got faith in
you<00:04:54.930> guys<00:04:54.960> because<00:04:55.379> a<00:04:55.409> lot<00:04:55.590> of<00:04:55.680> people<00:04:55.860> have

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
you guys because a lot of people have

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.980 
you guys because a lot of people have
asked<00:04:56.310> me<00:04:56.400> about<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.699> like<00:04:57.090> why<00:04:57.360> did<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:57.690> say

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
asked me about that like why did I say

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.210 
asked me about that like why did I say
that<00:04:58.139> I<00:04:58.199> don't<00:04:58.289> like<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.560> suppress<00:04:58.949> her<00:04:59.069> and

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
that I don't like to suppress her and

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.850 
that I don't like to suppress her and
that's<00:04:59.460> why<00:04:59.669> right<00:04:59.909> there<00:04:59.970> basically<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.710> I'm

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
that's why right there basically and I'm

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.260 
that's why right there basically and I'm
starting<00:05:02.099> to<00:05:02.190> ramble<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.610> little<00:05:02.819> bit<00:05:02.909> here<00:05:03.060> but

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
starting to ramble a little bit here but

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.390 
starting to ramble a little bit here but
overall<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:04.020> think<00:05:04.169> if<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:04.590> had<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:05.039> choose<00:05:05.250> an

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
overall I think if I had to choose an

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.499 
overall I think if I had to choose an
attachment<00:05:05.669> out<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> two<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.360> would

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
attachment out of the two I would

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.270 
attachment out of the two I would
definitely<00:05:07.020> pick<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.560> flash<00:05:07.800> suppressor<00:05:07.979> I

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
definitely pick the flash suppressor I

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.620 
definitely pick the flash suppressor I
found<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.819> staying<00:05:09.060> off<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.389> mini-map

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
found that staying off the mini-map

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.330 
found that staying off the mini-map
really<00:05:10.169> isn't<00:05:10.289> that<00:05:10.560> big<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:10.860> deal<00:05:11.069> in

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
really isn't that big of a deal in

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.279 
really isn't that big of a deal in
battlefield<00:05:12.150> 3<00:05:12.360> it<00:05:12.599> used<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:12.960> be<00:05:13.080> in<00:05:13.169> the

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
battlefield 3 it used to be in the

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.020 
battlefield 3 it used to be in the
beginning<00:05:13.380> when<00:05:13.800> people<00:05:13.830> worked<00:05:14.430> as<00:05:14.699> and<00:05:14.940> look

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
beginning when people worked as and look

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.520 
beginning when people worked as and look
at<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.210> freeze<00:05:15.449> frame<00:05:15.479> guy<00:05:15.810> right<00:05:16.020> there<00:05:16.050> it

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
at that freeze frame guy right there it

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.689 
at that freeze frame guy right there it
used<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:16.770> be<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.889> big<00:05:17.069> deal<00:05:17.250> in<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.400> beginning

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
used to be a big deal in the beginning

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.629 
used to be a big deal in the beginning
but<00:05:17.819> now<00:05:17.880> anymore<00:05:18.569> you<00:05:19.469> get<00:05:19.620> spotted<00:05:19.949> so<00:05:20.250> often

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
but now anymore you get spotted so often

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.270 
but now anymore you get spotted so often
it's<00:05:20.789> not<00:05:20.880> really<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.770> sizable<00:05:22.770> advantage<00:05:22.830> in

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
it's not really a sizable advantage in

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.559 
it's not really a sizable advantage in
my<00:05:23.400> eyes<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:23.669> feel<00:05:23.789> like<00:05:24.060> since<00:05:24.270> you're<00:05:24.360> always

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
my eyes I feel like since you're always

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.149 
my eyes I feel like since you're always
spotted<00:05:25.080> it<00:05:25.169> doesn't<00:05:25.440> really<00:05:25.530> matter<00:05:25.860> if

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
spotted it doesn't really matter if

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.159 
spotted it doesn't really matter if
you're<00:05:26.729> on<00:05:26.759> the<00:05:27.060> radar<00:05:27.360> or<00:05:27.509> not<00:05:27.690> when<00:05:27.900> you<00:05:27.960> fire

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
you're on the radar or not when you fire

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.260 
you're on the radar or not when you fire
some<00:05:28.500> I<00:05:28.740> mean<00:05:29.370> if<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.639> find<00:05:29.759> yourself<00:05:29.940> in

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
some I mean if you find yourself in

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.029 
some I mean if you find yourself in
situations<00:05:30.449> where<00:05:30.870> you're<00:05:31.050> really<00:05:31.380> lone<00:05:31.740> wolf

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
situations where you're really lone wolf

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.939 
situations where you're really lone wolf
in<00:05:32.159> it<00:05:32.250> yeah<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.550> can<00:05:32.819> I<00:05:33.030> can<00:05:33.210> see<00:05:33.620> why<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.680> would

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
in it yeah I can I can see why you would

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.529 
in it yeah I can I can see why you would
really<00:05:35.130> prefer<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:36.090> silencer<00:05:36.509> but

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
really prefer the the silencer but

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.330 
really prefer the the silencer but
honestly<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.289> flash<00:05:37.500> suppressor<00:05:37.680> offers

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
honestly the flash suppressor offers

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.120 
honestly the flash suppressor offers
that<00:05:38.610> vertical<00:05:39.030> recoil<00:05:39.300> reduction<00:05:40.130> without

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
that vertical recoil reduction without

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.969 
that vertical recoil reduction without
the<00:05:41.340> downside<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:41.909> reducing<00:05:42.539> damage<00:05:42.719> so<00:05:43.110> me

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
the downside of reducing damage so me

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.860 
the downside of reducing damage so me
personally<00:05:44.130> definitely<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:44.909> frost<00:05:45.300> repressor

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
personally definitely a frost repressor

are to using the foregrip now because I

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.290 
are to using the foregrip now because I

suppressor<00:06:43.690> as<00:06:43.810> being<00:06:44.020> the<00:06:44.229> most<00:06:44.409> nerfed

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830
