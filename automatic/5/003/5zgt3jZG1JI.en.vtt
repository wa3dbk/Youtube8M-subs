00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
it's a good monster and I didn't think

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.550 
it's a good monster and I didn't think
about<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.880> when<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:37.600> were<00:02:37.780> making<00:02:37.900> movie<00:02:38.410> I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
about that when we were making movie I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.900 
about that when we were making movie I
just<00:02:38.799> kind<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.070> assumed<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.519> would<00:02:39.610> be<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> good

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
monster but like then I realized that

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.630
