00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
break this one and then put a lever

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.920 
break this one and then put a lever
right<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.520> run<00:01:32.520> redstone<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.810> way

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
right here and run redstone all the way

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.859 
right here and run redstone all the way
up<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.630> very

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
up all this so you have to be very

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
up all this so you have to be very
careful<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> redstone<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
careful with the redstone not to have it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
careful with the redstone not to have it
actually<00:01:38.909> touch<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.420> TNT<00:01:39.810> or<00:01:39.930> else<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> TNT

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
actually touch the TNT or else the TNT

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
actually touch the TNT or else the TNT
itself<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.400> blow<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.450> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
itself will actually blow up but here is

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.560 
itself will actually blow up but here is
our<00:01:42.810> completed<00:01:43.820> x-ray<00:01:44.820> machine<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.509> we

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
our completed x-ray machine and now we

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
our completed x-ray machine and now we
will<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.960> able<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.470> what's<00:01:46.770> under<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.159> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
will be able to see what's under here I

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
will be able to see what's under here I
don't<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.490> what's<00:01:47.670> under<00:01:47.850> yet<00:01:48.299> maybe<00:01:48.630> it'll

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
deep cave underneath us and over there

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.150 
deep cave underneath us and over there
we<00:02:06.000> got<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.750> cave<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:07.649> water<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.099> another

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
would be able to see mob spawners like

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.470 
would be able to see mob spawners like
it<00:02:20.920> looks<00:02:21.129> like<00:02:21.250> there's<00:02:21.549> one<00:02:21.730> right<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.299> there

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
it looks like there's one right in there

it looks like there's one right in there
you<00:02:22.659> can<00:02:22.870> see<00:02:22.900> one<00:02:23.140> right<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:23.799> with

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
you can see one right in there with

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.770 
you can see one right in there with
where<00:02:24.310> my<00:02:24.430> cursor<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.849> you<00:02:25.209> can<00:02:25.329> actually<00:02:25.450> see

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
where my cursor is you can actually see

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.649 
where my cursor is you can actually see
mob<00:02:26.079> spawners<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.799> can<00:02:26.950> see<00:02:27.099> chests<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:28.540> can

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
mob spawners you can see chests you can

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.449 
mob spawners you can see chests you can
see<00:02:28.780> different<00:02:29.140> ores<00:02:29.409> so<00:02:29.980> if<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.189> have<00:02:30.280> some

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
see different ores so if you have some

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.949 
see different ores so if you have some
diamond<00:02:30.939> near<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.390> would<00:02:31.510> definitely<00:02:31.689> be

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
diamond near you you would definitely be

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.259 
diamond near you you would definitely be
able<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.170> see<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.439> diamond<00:02:32.920> if<00:02:33.819> it's<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.209> a

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
able to see the diamond if it's in a

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.300 
able to see the diamond if it's in a
cave<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.659> is<00:02:34.720> but<00:02:35.439> this<00:02:35.590> essentially<00:02:36.159> will

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
cave that is but this essentially will

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.610 
cave that is but this essentially will
allow<00:02:36.549> you<00:02:36.609> to<00:02:36.760> find<00:02:37.329> any<00:02:37.780> cave<00:02:38.079> system<00:02:38.530> this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
allow you to find any cave system this

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.210 
allow you to find any cave system this
will<00:02:38.799> let<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.069> find<00:02:39.310> your<00:02:39.579> um<00:02:39.909> your<00:02:40.810> uh<00:02:41.220> what's

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
to and to get out of this all you do is

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.740 
to and to get out of this all you do is
walk<00:02:48.129> towards<00:02:48.549> where<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.060> walked<00:02:49.299> out<00:02:49.450> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
walk towards where you walked out and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.180 
walk towards where you walked out and
then<00:02:50.049> you<00:02:50.139> can<00:02:50.260> turn<00:02:50.409> it<00:02:50.470> off<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.709> then<00:02:50.980> turn

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
then you can turn it off and then turn

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.129 
then you can turn it off and then turn
it<00:02:51.220> back<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.579> later<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.659> can<00:02:52.810> move<00:02:52.930> this

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
it back on later and you can move this

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.960 
it back on later and you can move this
around<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.829> few<00:02:54.129> blocks<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.760> can

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
around it's just a few blocks so you can

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.369 
around it's just a few blocks so you can
break<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.329> down<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.900> then<00:02:56.019> move<00:02:56.260> it

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
break this down and then move it

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.360 
break this down and then move it
somewhere<00:02:56.680> else<00:02:56.739> if<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.010> want<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.280> keep
