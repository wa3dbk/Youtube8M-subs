Mac<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.800> bro<00:02:16.040> fired<00:02:16.280> mine<00:02:17.890> Doris<00:02:18.890> which<00:02:19.790> is

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
Mac and I bro fired mine Doris which is

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.420 
Mac and I bro fired mine Doris which is
great<00:02:20.239> because<00:02:20.569> I<00:02:21.019> can<00:02:21.050> use<00:02:21.319> earthquake<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.069> I

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
great because I can use earthquake and I

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.800 
great because I can use earthquake and I
don't<00:02:22.670> know<00:02:22.760> if<00:02:22.819> he<00:02:22.970> expecting<00:02:23.480> me<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.720> use

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
don't know if he expecting me to use

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.170 
don't know if he expecting me to use
earthquake<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.560> he<00:02:25.250> didn't<00:02:25.550> switch<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.150> i

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
earthquake but he didn't switch so i

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.369 
earthquake but he didn't switch so i
guess<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.599> was<00:02:26.629> inspecting<00:02:27.140> matey's

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
guess it was inspecting matey's

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.770 
guess it was inspecting matey's
earthquake<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.819> all<00:02:29.000> i<00:02:29.360> want<00:02:29.599> for<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
earthquake but all i want for the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.750 
earthquake but all i want for the
earthquake<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.590> since<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.920> half-life<00:02:31.280> for<00:02:31.519> it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
earthquake and since I half-life for it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.570 
earthquake and since I half-life for it
it<00:02:31.970> was<00:02:32.239> for<00:02:32.420> me<00:02:32.569> something<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:33.379> yeah<00:02:33.950> Merc

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.220 
said that happens well since he his mac
is<00:02:42.190> down<00:02:44.440> he<00:02:45.440> buffered<00:02:45.860> ah<00:02:46.130> yeah<00:02:47.000> repair<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.840> I

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
is down he buffered ah yeah repair and I

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.020 
is down he buffered ah yeah repair and I
was<00:02:48.380> like<00:02:48.560> I'm<00:02:48.799> not<00:02:49.010> gonna<00:02:49.190> use<00:02:49.459> earthquake

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
was like I'm not gonna use earthquake

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.319 
was like I'm not gonna use earthquake
because<00:02:50.269> yeah<00:02:51.140> if<00:02:51.860> i<00:02:52.040> use<00:02:52.250> iron<00:02:52.640> head<00:02:52.790> maybe<00:02:53.209> I

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
because yeah if i use iron head maybe I

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.860 
because yeah if i use iron head maybe I
get<00:02:53.599> a<00:02:53.630> flint<00:02:54.019> sex<00:02:54.260> or<00:02:54.500> something<00:02:54.739> but<00:02:55.250> I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
get a flint sex or something but I

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.410 
get a flint sex or something but I
didn't<00:02:56.870> got<00:02:57.049> it<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.650> that's<00:02:58.640> bad<00:02:58.910> for<00:02:59.150> me<00:02:59.180> and

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
didn't got it so that's bad for me and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.539 
didn't got it so that's bad for me and
ear<00:02:59.840> of<00:03:00.079> quakes<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:01.010> was<00:03:01.129> pretty<00:03:01.310> sure<00:03:01.519> I

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
ear of quakes and I was pretty sure I

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.460 
ear of quakes and I was pretty sure I
would<00:03:01.730> surprise<00:03:01.879> because<00:03:02.329> Star<00:03:02.750> Wars<00:03:02.959> has<00:03:03.140> a

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
would surprise because Star Wars has a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.890 
would surprise because Star Wars has a
decent<00:03:04.150> defense<00:03:05.150> stats<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.170> mean<00:03:06.799> he's<00:03:07.040> great

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
decent defense stats I mean he's great

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.229 
decent defense stats I mean he's great
so<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:08.930> want<00:03:09.140> for<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.349> earthquake<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.670> was

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
so I want for the earthquake and I was

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.550 
so I want for the earthquake and I was
pretty<00:03:11.450> sure<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.750> with<00:03:12.019> one<00:03:12.170> hit<00:03:12.260> kills

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
pretty sure that with one hit kills

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.240 
pretty sure that with one hit kills
because<00:03:12.829> earthquake<00:03:13.579> is<00:03:14.139> stronger<00:03:15.139> than<00:03:15.410> ever

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
because earthquake is stronger than ever

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.129 
because earthquake is stronger than ever
had<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.600> dude<00:03:17.750> one<00:03:17.930> hit<00:03:18.109> KO<00:03:18.290> anyway<00:03:18.799> so<00:03:19.639> I

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
had so the dude one hit KO anyway so I

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.289 
had so the dude one hit KO anyway so I
earthquake<00:03:21.139> and<00:03:21.470> another<00:03:22.310> double<00:03:22.760> down<00:03:22.940> so

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
earthquake and another double down so

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.599 
earthquake and another double down so
this<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.600> this<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.410> pretty<00:03:24.620> cool<00:03:24.709> honestly

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
this is this is pretty cool honestly

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.330 
this is this is pretty cool honestly
because<00:03:25.880> we<00:03:26.389> got<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:27.260> double<00:03:27.650> downs<00:03:27.859> right

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
because we got to double downs right

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.910 
because we got to double downs right
here<00:03:28.459> any<00:03:29.299> brought<00:03:29.599> out<00:03:29.780> his<00:03:29.959> magnet<00:03:30.680> trick

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
here any brought out his magnet trick

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.089 
here any brought out his magnet trick
and<00:03:31.160> he<00:03:31.849> went<00:03:32.030> for<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.209> charge<00:03:32.480> beam<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.099> yeah

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
and he went for a charge beam and yeah

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.860 
and he went for a charge beam and yeah
it<00:03:34.400> doesn't<00:03:34.639> matter<00:03:34.880> because<00:03:35.090> i<00:03:35.480> want<00:03:35.690> for<00:03:35.840> a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
it doesn't matter because i want for a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.870 
it doesn't matter because i want for a
coal<00:03:36.260> mine<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.530> if<00:03:37.099> you<00:03:37.130> get<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> specialist

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
coal mine and if you get a specialist

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.150 
coal mine and if you get a specialist
attack<00:03:38.269> boost<00:03:38.510> like<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.900> did<00:03:39.079> it<00:03:39.500> doesn't

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
attack boost like it did it doesn't

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.069 
attack boost like it did it doesn't
matter<00:03:40.220> because<00:03:40.370> we<00:03:40.760> are<00:03:40.849> even<00:03:41.060> because<00:03:41.720> yeah

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
matter because we are even because yeah

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.509 
matter because we are even because yeah
I<00:03:42.109> want<00:03:42.349> for<00:03:42.470> comment<00:03:42.889> I<00:03:43.040> got<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> special

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
I want for comment I got a special

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.530 
I want for comment I got a special
defense<00:03:43.910> boost<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.500> yeah<00:03:45.500> he<00:03:46.130> got<00:03:46.280> just<00:03:46.609> an

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
defense boost and yeah he got just an

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.630 
defense boost and yeah he got just an
special<00:03:48.230> attack<00:03:48.409> boost<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.310> I'm<00:03:49.400> pretty<00:03:49.519> sure

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
special attack boost so I'm pretty sure

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.030 
special attack boost so I'm pretty sure
he<00:03:49.849> went<00:03:50.030> for<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.599> Thunderbolt<00:03:51.290> because<00:03:51.680> yes

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
he went for the Thunderbolt because yes

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.709 
he went for the Thunderbolt because yes
that's<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.579> combination<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:53.090> magnetic

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:53.719 
that's just the combination of magnetic

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.740 
that's just the combination of magnetic
charge<00:03:54.379> beam<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.950> Thunderbolt<00:03:55.640> but<00:03:56.450> it

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
charge beam and Thunderbolt but it

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.910 
charge beam and Thunderbolt but it
doesn't<00:03:57.019> matter<00:03:57.079> because<00:03:57.230> i<00:03:57.590> want<00:03:57.739> for<00:03:57.859> the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
doesn't matter because i want for the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.970 
doesn't matter because i want for the
earth<00:03:58.280> power<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.420> was<00:03:59.629> pretty<00:03:59.989> sure<00:04:00.469> I<00:04:00.500> it

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
earth power and I was pretty sure I it

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.009 
earth power and I was pretty sure I it
would<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:01.670> kale<00:04:02.000> because<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.510> got<00:04:02.840> caught

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
would like kale because I got caught

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.390 
would like kale because I got caught
mind<00:04:03.290> up<00:04:03.469> you<00:04:03.650> know<00:04:03.799> and<00:04:04.510> yeah<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:06.140> was<00:04:06.400> pretty

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
mind up you know and yeah it was pretty

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.550 
mind up you know and yeah it was pretty
much<00:04:07.780> predict<00:04:08.780> table<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.200> know<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.500> he

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
much predict table you know that he

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.819 
much predict table you know that he
would<00:04:09.739> die<00:04:09.920> if<00:04:10.730> he<00:04:10.790> didn't<00:04:11.659> created<00:04:12.140> my

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
would die if he didn't created my

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.920 
would die if he didn't created my
lunatone<00:04:13.370> but<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.150> didn't<00:04:14.359> happen<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:14.750> that's

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
lunatone but it didn't happen so that's
