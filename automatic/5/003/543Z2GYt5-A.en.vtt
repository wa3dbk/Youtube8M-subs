00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.719
 Good day to all 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.119
 this swarm and immediately want to say that 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.630
 a little sick so I say a little 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:20.660
 be quiet and her voice is a little strange 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.420
 today I want to show you the mechanism one 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.920
 very interesting at the same time simple 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.960
 this mechanism is based on command 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.660
 blocks and in fact it's just 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.930
 randomizer in principle what is 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.030
 randomizer is such a mechanism which 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.770
 will give a random signal when 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.629
 pressing a button that is if we 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.979
 push the button first case us 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.589
 I can not know in the first case 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.929
 there is issued a helmet in the second case 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.399
 fairy in the third there is a repeater and so 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.440
 etc. Well let me take you now 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.659
 demonstrate and then explain how everything 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.539
 works so now i press the button 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:02.510
 as you can see I manage the sword again the sword 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:04.850
 now ax diamond one more sword yet 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.680
 one ax one more what let's now 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.790
 other rays 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.610
 now Ender's chest while another 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.310
 Conder's sword in general as you see each 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.230
 a random item is issued but what 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.180
 now let me show you all 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.590
 working principle the mechanism consists of 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.660
 two parts the first part is myself 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.610
 randomizer and the second part is 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.500
 the activating part that is where we are 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.090
 give a signal from the button as you can see they 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.370
 can be absolutely anywhere 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.910
 absolutely in different places I would even 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.070
 said but it is desirable that this here 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.410
 the randomizer itself we were not far from 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.990
 buttons because if we go on 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.790
 distance in my 15 chunk of the rat 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.070
 100 depends on us and nothing works 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.870
 Well will now let you 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 I'll tell you how all the workers are here with us 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.440
 there are six command blocks and in a circle 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.350
 us walks once became a signal let 's 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.860
 time rule chain here for example 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.500
 and show how all the work and so here u 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.729
 we have a team soon board the website 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.240
 dog rand one here rand 2 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.470
 brand 3 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.470
 brand four rand 5 and rand 6 as 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.049
 you understand we have a tone that goes on 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.760
 circle and ruled by ask constantly 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.510
 set different values ​​of this 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.430
 variable 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.110
 that is, a ton unit then a deuce on 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.930
 top three until the engineer finished the top five then 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.650
 six and from this side where we 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.620
 button 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.760
 6 is again the same command blocks and 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.110
 each of them gives a certain 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.750
 item to the player with certain 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.440
 parameters ie here gives us 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.560
 diamond 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.590
 gives the player with the parameter one 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.310
 iron helmet for player with parameter 2 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.950
 here gives out diamond players parameters 3 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.739
 here are four five and six but in principle 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.379
 this and the whole shove the scheme but in order to 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.359
 do all this for a start you need 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.989
 create an event for this we enter 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:05.209
 just such a team will soon board roasting tires 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.590
 From instead of the name we write the right to us 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.190
 I wrote the name 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.670
 rand and further we write to the dam by the nodes this 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.349
 we are just an ordinary one stone signal 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.690
 it is just a way out that is not what 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.549
 he does not attach importance 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.569
 but since prescribing the value 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.660
 sure we write the data and then we 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.310
 create a circle of command 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.959
 blocks depending on how much you need 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.989
 possible options that is if you 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.849
 It is necessary that there should be 8 possible series 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.150
 always you put 8 pocket blocks 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.260
 if 15 then 15 and so on I set 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
 6 just for example 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.900
 well then we connect and taxi 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.510
 repeaters and there is one trick here 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.590
 if we just take and click now 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.859
 on the button, then everything will close on us therefore 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.310
 we need to either push the button and then 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:02.090
 break the repeater when signal 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.810
 closes either to make such a small 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.760
 trick in the form of 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.120
 short pulse generator if 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.000
 now remember how to do it of course 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.379
 It seems like this 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.280
 it is necessary to delay the repeater 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.829
 to put 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.500
 and as you can see it starts with chasing 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:25.040
 strong in a circle and further if I can 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.430
 push the button that is enter here 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.389
 these are all options 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.040
 gay dog ​​a score right one of 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:39.860
 Cleveland I like alone 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.960
 that is, the name of our event then we 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.160
 I will be able to random object that I 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.190
 I want to note this is what is required 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.850
 pointing scoring madina soon windom 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.940
 min-1 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.540
 because if you specify just a one 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.090
 then it will read the sector all 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.530
 values ​​that are smaller that is if you 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.750
 point soon rand 5 then he will 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.730
 give you all the items that should 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.840
 issued a graculus unit of two and 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.180
 three and four 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.640
 Well on this in principle today 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.850
 all I want to note that the mechanism is pretty 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.460
 simple and interesting but i'm so delayed with 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.380
 a lesson for you to understand correctly 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.270
 confused nothing if that 2 teams 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.440
 will be in the description if someone is too lazy 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.180
 write it all yourself 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.880
 although there is nothing 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.740
 supernatural is not the world but all 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.690
 thank you very much for your attention do not forget 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.040
 leave your comments and ratings and 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.690
 if you really appreciated that
