00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
then to be drawn at 90 minutes 3.75 yeah
I<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:54.390> take<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.720> throw<00:01:54.960> absolutely<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.040> but

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I will take to throw absolutely and but

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.910 
I will take to throw absolutely and but
I<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> better<00:01:57.210> order<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.990> will<00:01:58.140> use<00:01:58.619> it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
I have a better order you will use it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.670 
I have a better order you will use it
when<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> will<00:01:59.850> say<00:02:00.000> my<00:02:00.329> top<00:02:00.540> tips<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.350> i<00:02:01.380> will

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
when I will say my top tips but i will

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.740 
when I will say my top tips but i will
take<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.890> draw<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.479> stake

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
take a draw with the little stake

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
take a draw with the little stake
because<00:02:04.500> i<00:02:04.770> think<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:06.060> will<00:02:06.240> close

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
because i think that they will close

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.320 
because i think that they will close
each<00:02:06.719> other<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.259> two<00:02:07.469> teams<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> as<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.119> saw

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
each other these two teams and as I saw

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.059 
each other these two teams and as I saw
them<00:02:09.569> win

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
them win

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.959 
them win
in<00:02:10.609> disturb<00:02:11.030> mentor<00:02:11.599> they<00:02:12.260> are<00:02:12.319> more<00:02:13.189> notable

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:13.969 
in disturb mentor they are more notable

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.649 
in disturb mentor they are more notable
defending<00:02:14.950> them<00:02:15.950> attacking<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.209> think<00:02:17.359> that

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
defending them attacking so I think that

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.989 
defending them attacking so I think that
they<00:02:17.749> will<00:02:17.870> close<00:02:18.049> each<00:02:18.349> other<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.969> what<00:02:19.969> I

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:19.999 
they will close each other and what I

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.580 
they will close each other and what I
think<00:02:20.389> that<00:02:20.510> they<00:02:20.599> were<00:02:20.719> scored<00:02:21.019> both<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.260> them

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
think that they were scored both of them

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.559 
think that they were scored both of them
this<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.129> why<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.310> am<00:02:22.430> going<00:02:22.819> for<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.389> choice

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
this is why I am going for that choice

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.509 
this is why I am going for that choice
okay<00:02:24.469> yeah<00:02:24.680> well<00:02:24.829> the<00:02:24.950> both<00:02:25.099> teams<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.489> score

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
okay yeah well the both teams to score

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.899 
okay yeah well the both teams to score
markets<00:02:25.969> really<00:02:26.209> low<00:02:26.450> 1.55<00:02:27.409> Ladbrokes<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
markets really low 1.55 Ladbrokes the

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.229 
markets really low 1.55 Ladbrokes the
over<00:02:29.510> as<00:02:29.689> well<00:02:29.750> as<00:02:30.139> the<00:02:30.290> shore<00:02:30.530> alt<00:02:30.799> 1.65<00:02:31.730> do

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
over as well as the shore alt 1.65 do

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.550 
over as well as the shore alt 1.65 do
you<00:02:32.329> agree<00:02:32.569> they<00:02:32.780> will<00:02:32.930> see<00:02:33.079> in<00:02:33.170> over<00:02:33.379> two<00:02:33.530> and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
you agree they will see in over two and

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.280 
you agree they will see in over two and
a<00:02:33.680> half<00:02:33.769> goals<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.159> the<00:02:34.219> 90<00:02:34.489> minutes<00:02:35.260> no<00:02:36.260> I

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
a half goals in the 90 minutes no I

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.559 
a half goals in the 90 minutes no I
think<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:36.859> we<00:02:37.280> will<00:02:37.340> see<00:02:37.549> an<00:02:37.669> under<00:02:38.120> 2.5

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
think that we will see an under 2.5

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.050 
think that we will see an under 2.5
goals<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.439> the<00:02:39.560> 90<00:02:39.889> minutes<00:02:40.219> I'm<00:02:40.370> going<00:02:40.700> with<00:02:40.999> a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
goals in the 90 minutes I'm going with a

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.649 
goals in the 90 minutes I'm going with a
bigger<00:02:41.359> or<00:02:41.659> 2.2<00:02:42.560> as<00:02:42.829> you<00:02:43.280> mentioned<00:02:43.819> I<00:02:44.060> think

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
bigger or 2.2 as you mentioned I think

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.289 
bigger or 2.2 as you mentioned I think
that<00:02:44.840> will<00:02:45.079> not<00:02:45.260> see<00:02:45.439> a<00:02:45.469> lot<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.799> balls<00:02:46.099> Eva<00:02:46.700> I

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
that will not see a lot of balls Eva I

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.289 
that will not see a lot of balls Eva I
think<00:02:47.659> that<00:02:47.810> also<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.739> better<00:02:49.310> now<00:02:49.609> my<00:02:49.819> thinking

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
think that also a better now my thinking

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.830 
think that also a better now my thinking
about<00:02:50.629> it<00:02:50.870> both<00:02:51.709> team<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.189> score<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.840> under

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
about it both team to score and under

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.470 
about it both team to score and under
2.5<00:02:54.319> goals<00:02:54.739> it's<00:02:55.400> an<00:02:55.579> interesting<00:02:55.849> one<00:02:56.239> I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
2.5 goals it's an interesting one I

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.069 
2.5 goals it's an interesting one I
think<00:02:56.870> it's<00:02:57.019> around<00:02:57.819> 3.5<00:02:58.819> are<00:02:59.629> not<00:02:59.810> like<00:03:00.049> that

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
think it's around 3.5 are not like that

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.000 
think it's around 3.5 are not like that
so<00:03:00.919> again<00:03:01.579> this<00:03:02.359> choice<00:03:02.689> with<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.049> small<00:03:03.709> state

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
so again this choice with a small state

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.509 
so again this choice with a small state
it's<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.879> really<00:03:05.269> good<00:03:05.389> for<00:03:06.260> me<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:07.159> I<00:03:07.280> suppose

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
it's a really good for me and I suppose

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.159 
it's a really good for me and I suppose
you<00:03:07.549> may<00:03:07.790> as<00:03:07.849> well<00:03:07.939> also<00:03:08.209> put<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> steak<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
you may as well also put a steak on the

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.259 
you may as well also put a steak on the
one<00:03:09.680> all<00:03:09.889> score<00:03:10.280> line<00:03:10.519> as<00:03:10.730> well<00:03:10.909> there<00:03:11.090> if<00:03:11.180> you

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
one all score line as well there if you

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.610 
one all score line as well there if you
think<00:03:11.419> it's<00:03:11.540> going<00:03:11.629> to<00:03:11.689> be<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.840> draw<00:03:12.109> under<00:03:12.469> two

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
think it's going to be a draw under two

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.890 
think it's going to be a draw under two
and<00:03:12.650> half<00:03:12.919> balls<00:03:13.189> both<00:03:13.459> teams<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:14.000> score<00:03:14.030> just

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
and half balls both teams to score just

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.990 
and half balls both teams to score just
points<00:03:15.229> to<00:03:15.349> a<00:03:15.379> 1<00:03:15.650> 1<00:03:15.859> score<00:03:15.919> would<00:03:16.669> you<00:03:16.819> actually

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
points to a 1 1 score would you actually

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.520 
points to a 1 1 score would you actually
take<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.569> bet<00:03:17.750> put<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:17.989> bit<00:03:18.109> of<00:03:18.139> money<00:03:18.290> on

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530

take the bet put a bit of money on
modern<00:03:18.799> it<00:03:18.889> being<00:03:19.069> 11<00:03:19.930> yeah<00:03:20.930> last<00:03:21.319> time<00:03:21.439> that<00:03:21.859> I
