think<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.759> there's<00:01:11.270> no<00:01:11.420> way<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:11.899> would

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
think you there's no way that you would

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.899

you would spend that kind of money on
something<00:01:14.409> that's<00:01:15.409> that<00:01:15.920> small<00:01:16.399> right<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.540> you

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
something that's that small right so you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.779 
something that's that small right so you
can<00:01:17.810> sort<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:18.049> see<00:01:18.290> that's<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.310> size<00:01:19.549> of<00:01:19.700> my

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
can sort of see that's the size of my

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.420 
can sort of see that's the size of my
hand<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.329> my<00:01:20.420> hands<00:01:20.810> aren't<00:01:21.110> huge<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.189> it's

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
hand and my hands aren't huge so it's

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.100 
hand and my hands aren't huge so it's
pretty<00:01:22.640> small<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.979> if<00:01:25.189> I<00:01:25.369> said<00:01:25.670> 23<00:01:26.420> pounds<00:01:26.689> I'd

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
pretty small and if I said 23 pounds I'd

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.130 
pretty small and if I said 23 pounds I'd
like<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:27.860> go<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:28.460> buy<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.930> probably

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
like you to go and buy that you probably

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.190 
like you to go and buy that you probably
wouldn't<00:01:30.469> think<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.860> was<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.250> bargain<00:01:31.899> if<00:01:32.899> I

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
wouldn't think it was a bargain if I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.520 
wouldn't think it was a bargain if I
showed<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.810> foundation<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:36.200> and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
showed you a foundation like this and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.880 
showed you a foundation like this and
this<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:37.100> one<00:01:37.280> by<00:01:37.490> illamasqua<00:01:38.359> and<00:01:38.799> it's<00:01:39.799> a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
this is one by illamasqua and it's a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.289 
this is one by illamasqua and it's a
cream<00:01:40.100> foundation<00:01:40.219> so<00:01:40.820> it's<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.180> good

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
cream foundation so it's a good

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.749 
cream foundation so it's a good
foundation<00:01:41.509> as<00:01:41.960> well<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:43.189> would<00:01:43.280> probably<00:01:43.399> be

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
foundation as well you would probably be

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.950 
foundation as well you would probably be
more<00:01:44.109> inclined<00:01:45.109> to<00:01:45.320> buy<00:01:45.469> this<00:01:45.530> at<00:01:46.060> 23<00:01:47.060> then<00:01:47.810> you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
more inclined to buy this at 23 then you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.649 
more inclined to buy this at 23 then you
would<00:01:48.109> be<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.950> at<00:01:49.189> 23<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.270> understand

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
would be this at 23 and I can understand

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.380 
would be this at 23 and I can understand
why<00:01:50.719> because<00:01:51.469> size<00:01:51.679> matters<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:53.240> does

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
why because size matters so does

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.330 
why because size matters so does
packaging<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.380> know<00:01:54.469> this<00:01:54.649> packaging<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.280> a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
packaging you know this packaging is a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.999 
packaging you know this packaging is a
bit<00:01:55.520> blair<00:01:55.880> worse<00:01:56.780> obviously<00:01:57.439> Masika<00:01:57.859> have

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
bit blair worse obviously Masika have

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.429 
bit blair worse obviously Masika have
more<00:01:58.219> money<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:59.420> they<00:01:59.570> can<00:01:59.600> create<00:02:00.289> more

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
more money so they can create more

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.340 
more money so they can create more
elaborate<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.039> beautiful<00:02:01.189> packaging<00:02:02.350> but

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
elaborate and beautiful packaging but

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.239 
elaborate and beautiful packaging but

into<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.819> now<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.829> don't<00:02:58.069> remember<00:02:58.219> how

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
into this now this I don't remember how

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.619 
into this now this I don't remember how
much<00:02:58.609> this<00:02:58.760> cost<00:02:59.030> me<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.180> think<00:02:59.389> it<00:02:59.510> was

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
much this cost me I think it was

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.479 
much this cost me I think it was
something<00:02:59.840> like<00:03:00.079> 11<00:03:00.650> pounds<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.189> it's<00:03:01.430> about

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
something like 11 pounds so it's about

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.689 
something like 11 pounds so it's about
half<00:03:01.790> price<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.419> this<00:03:02.629> and<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:04.400> difference

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:04.699 
half price of this and the difference

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.149 
half price of this and the difference
between<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.090> two<00:03:05.359> is<00:03:05.719> that<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.859> highly

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
between the two is that this is highly

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.679 
between the two is that this is highly
concentrated<00:03:07.400> at<00:03:07.909> little<00:03:08.120> goes<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.329> long<00:03:08.449> way

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
concentrated at little goes a long way

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.140 
concentrated at little goes a long way
gross<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.530> really<00:03:09.799> isn't<00:03:10.010> as<00:03:10.400> concentrated

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
gross this really isn't as concentrated
