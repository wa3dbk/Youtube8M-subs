00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.250
 Hello and welcome to «MusicStar» TV this year from 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.059
 Investor Kuhl mat 6 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.509
 that's a pretty complicated name for a very easy to use one 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.179
 device 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.560
 It has a very high quality audio interface 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.869
 Overfall victim is connected to the computer 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.520
 if one of Phoenix housing that is her name in the DAX Topp Comex already says 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.080
 select the song 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.630
 and you're right next to the keyboard and the mouse 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.169
 the direct work submitted tool 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.819
 the car is that you can be on the PC or on Mac 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.839
 h on the back following connections for the first time he was still like that 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.519
 a lot of microphone and then 2 in the beginning I grew out of the boxes 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.629
 maybe because we still have a special feature then I have one more 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.719
 Monitor output Boßeln around the stress so also the monitoring pubs 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.699
 Percent and that and a headphone jack of course that 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.439
 Firewall buses and the power supply 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840
 so is in the arms 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.880
 even boxing that is nicely made warm drink on the front 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.070
 The so-called are persistent that means I can directly with 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:15.560
 Select keypress 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.070
 how are switched at the beginning of growth 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.710
 therefore, the first sentence I have Nico before and other instrument 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.390
 Because of her second Oscar, that's two of mine, meaning he's opposite 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.690
 switched electronic devices 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.780
 or I have to work and out of the water as the new entrance on the left 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.880
 and a signal very flexible so in the application 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.540
 that of the DAX again in principle all possibilities no matter if you are a guitar 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.550
 To be singing or Barcelona as records 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.110
 Cromwell the Scene Schalke as mentioned earlier, that's very easy 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.940
 how to get the inputs world 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.100
 is a really great feature 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.490
 four singers have a problem with it when they dry their face completely 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.109
 lost his head and could sing me really well 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.340
 and they have to like each other a bit 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.820
 Effect shares ready 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.890
 and that Katy's Eric is already considered in the device that is called 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.700
 is totally simple, because I can not only with the Bauhaus the scandal 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.850
 between the input signals and the audio signals connected and over 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.700
 be sufficient 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.870
 something like that can adjust my needs 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.629
 No, I can easily find out about it 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.310
 also how was the field with serves 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.310
 Every singer in the studio will be happy about that 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.129
 All are very nice for it is also that is a high resolution from Worms 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.919
 Display directly on the device may be the case with many parts of the tablet 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:39.699
 that's maybe a two three LEDs holding one can not really be accurate 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:45.239
 look that is optimally solved here and that does great also very robust 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.849
 A sturdy metal case is also processed underneath 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.449
 complete is that means it does not slip on the 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:51.410
 working surface 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.200
 So it's about twice as well 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.930
 Inns to device for digital audio rest 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.400
