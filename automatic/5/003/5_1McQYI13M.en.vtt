was too much sugar that I added you can

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.420 
was too much sugar that I added you can
cut<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.040> down<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.490> tablespoon<00:01:09.070> but<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.160> find

cut it down to a tablespoon but I find

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:19.330 
cut it down to a tablespoon but I find
it's<00:01:10.580> fine<00:01:11.030> like<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:14.050> there<00:01:15.050> we<00:01:15.080> go<00:01:18.159> in<00:01:19.159> my

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
it's fine like that there we go in my

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.660 
it's fine like that there we go in my
top<00:01:19.580> one<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.590> then<00:01:21.590> I'm<00:01:22.100> just<00:01:22.159> going<00:01:22.400> to<00:01:22.460> pulse

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
top one and then I'm just going to pulse

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:37.570 
top one and then I'm just going to pulse
this

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.850 

just<00:01:38.180> let<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.510> go<00:01:38.750> until<00:01:38.780> it's<00:01:39.290> really<00:01:39.710> well

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
just let this go until it's really well

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.770 
just let this go until it's really well
combined<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.790> I'll<00:01:46.880> grab<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.120> couple<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.510> spoons
