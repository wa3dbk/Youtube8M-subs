00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.630
 hello it's true that giguère and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.950
 last that joy welcome to this 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.929
 garden passion capsule 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.690
 so what are we talking about today 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.270
 today we talk vegetable and not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.130
 any of the vegetables that are going 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.900
 pique the curiosity of your neighbors 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.820
 aioli here is the little cucumber 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.960
 it's a contest my pickles and he 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.940
 takes a third of the space that planck of 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.879
 standard pickles could take 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.649
 so a very compact super plan 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.530
 interesting for small spaces 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.110
 it is better to harvest the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.809
 cucumber to size of 3.5 inches then 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.969
 And that's good for any 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.859
 plan of cucumbers if we harvest 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.719
 regularly we will increase the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.010
 production 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.329
 so this year I missed all that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.850
 so I found myself a 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.320
 so you see the stepladder so if 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 to show you that you can take everything 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.790
 to make plants climb like a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.340
 cac climbing here so we see here 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.960
 salt and pepper watched the flea market 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 which is like a little white for salt 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 white yellow and small black dots 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.420
 also for the point so take it out 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.920
 piper who is this tasted enough to salt and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 pepper so no need to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.420
 season it with thivel coke in 2015 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.400
 to taste 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.680
 I present you a good vegetables and not 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 it's not a melon it's a 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.950
 zucchini named potito we see a beautiful 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.920
 grooves disappointed we like it for its 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.810
 color and its different shape that goes 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.680
 be easy to use to stuff by 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.590
 example we are now talking about peppers 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.360
 peppers to discover that have shapes 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.399
 different and sewer maybe 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.960
 different than you've ever tasted 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.460
 so here is the banana pepper from where I 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.399
 read to really advance for its form 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.729
 which is interesting light yellow mova 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.500
 it's super decorative here we do not 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.990
 sweet pepper paprika 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.020
 it's peppers by name 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.770
 which could come from Hungary then it's 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.660
 a sweet too and here is the a spicy 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.910
 of espelette iman who happens to be a 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.580
 a little more spicy actually you'll be 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.760
 spicy but it's still pretty sweet we can 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.730
 use Espelette pepper for 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.850
 replace pepper for example and the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.920
 espelette pepper is so called because 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.630
 in France and Espelette villages you can 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.720
 observe on several houses 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.650
 garlands of pretty chili like these 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.090
 who decorate the houses in the village 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.760
 so here we have another beautiful novelty 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.230
 to grow in our kitchen garden 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.040
 the aubergine ping pong 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.790
 so we see a very long then vegetables 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.320
 pretty original for our vegetable garden 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.140
 so I hope we showed you some 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.340
 vegetable and fruit plants that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.940

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.340
