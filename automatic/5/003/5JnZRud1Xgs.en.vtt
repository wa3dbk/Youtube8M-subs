in all Yi Chi has shown us that not all

in all Yi Chi has shown us that not all
dinosaurs<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.850> evolved<00:01:39.270> flight<00:01:39.450> use

dinosaurs that evolved flight use

feathers to help them fly we now know

feathers to help them fly we now know
one<00:01:42.450> group<00:01:42.720> had<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.080> strange<00:01:43.440> adaptation

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
one group had this strange adaptation

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.180 
one group had this strange adaptation
instead<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:45.810> very<00:01:46.110> strange<00:01:46.410> dinosaur<00:01:47.010> has

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
instead this very strange dinosaur has

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.250 
instead this very strange dinosaur has
shown<00:01:47.430> us<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.940> how<00:01:48.090> diverse<00:01:48.270> dinosaurs<00:01:49.020> were

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
shown us just how diverse dinosaurs were

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.830 
shown us just how diverse dinosaurs were
and<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.160> we<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.670> looking<00:01:50.880> at<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.630> tip

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and that we are just looking at the tip

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.810 
and that we are just looking at the tip
of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.080> iceberg<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.710> dinosaur<00:01:53.160> species<00:01:53.400> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
of the iceberg of dinosaur species and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
of the iceberg of dinosaur species and
we<00:01:54.180> could<00:01:54.300> always<00:01:54.450> find<00:01:54.870> another<00:01:55.050> Yi<00:01:55.500> Chi<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
we could always find another Yi Chi that

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.210 
we could always find another Yi Chi that
changes<00:01:56.400> our<00:01:56.520> whole<00:01:56.700> perspective<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.480> things

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
changes our whole perspective of things

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.920 
changes our whole perspective of things
thanks<00:01:59.220> for<00:01:59.340> watching

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.700 

nice<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:08.490> Oh
