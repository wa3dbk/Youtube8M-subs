00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 and if you can clarify 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.170
 These 15 billion are the refusal of Ukraine 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.049
 from association from association with 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:19.650
 European Union or and how much do you 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:23.580
 We are willing to pay more to it as well here 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.599
 now the conversation has gone serious to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.740
 ending as you need a second to 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.019
 finally take the official Kiev 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.930
 look towards europe by field seo 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:40.050
 Ukrainian agency unian okay you me 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 pleased with my questions but I'm nocturnal 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.690
 still colleagues who started 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.329
 articulate this topic in general as i 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.329
 assumed it was almost the same 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.610
 why we made such a decision on 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.309
 lending and gas prices now i'm 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.180
 I will comment on it know perfectly 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.790
 seriously tell you without any irony we 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.350
 often use the word combination 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.330
 fraternal country fraternal people today 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.600
 we see that Ukraine is in difficult 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:22.460
 position and economic social and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:26.460
 political situation has arisen for a number 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.650
 circumstances and causes but it is objective 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.740
 this situation and if we really 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.710
 say that this is a brotherly people and on 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.079
 fraternal country then we must do 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.130
 like close relatives and support 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.829
 Ukrainian people in this difficult situation 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.439
 I assure you that this is the main reason 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.250
 by which we made these decisions not 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.200
 first decision of this kind you somehow 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.479
 don't mouse over miss some things 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.920
 after all, Gazprom signed twice 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.110
 addition to the current protocol 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.049
 existing transfer contract 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.619
 payments on dark october then there on 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.770
 November 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.350
 Now we have transferred payments again and we 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.310
 we really understand that there are difficulties 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.220
 with solvency so why 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.900
 finish off your main partner 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.770
 15 billion this is here to support 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.790
 budget so that you can pay for 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.810
 pension pay social benefits 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.700
 but we think that this part of you 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.980
 also quite pragmatic why 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.840
 because yes it is Ukrainian support 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.830
 economy and the Ukrainian people without 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.860
 no doubt but this means fnb 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.620
 how do you know our backup means 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.610
 funds we have in government reserves on 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:56.140
 today 175 billion dollars 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.840
 and another 500 15 billion dollars gold 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.830
 central bank foreign exchange reserves here 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.270
 these funds are 15 billion we give out 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.340
 government reserves and fnb on 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.850
 commercial terms five percent of 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.220
 coupon on demand of the Ukrainian side 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.970
 they will be these papers Ukrainian will 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.050
 placed on the Irish Stock Exchange and 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.210
 the proposal of the Ukrainian side 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.000
 The manager of this transaction will be VTB Capital 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:34.120
 it's not ours come up in were ready on 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.300
 anybody here is the essence of our proposals 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:42.200
 agreement is in no way associated or 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:45.170
 not with Maidan has nothing to do with the euro 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.700
 means the negotiations of Ukraine, we just 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.180
 we see that Ukraine is in that difficult position 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.180
 and need to be supported and we have such 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.180
 opportunity and we use it consider 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.450
 repeat again and I mean ours 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.190
 special relationship with Ukraine and wanting 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.400
 to keep cooperation in which we, too 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.470
 borrow interested by the way here's 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.470
 these are these commodity flows 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.200
 engineering products which 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.040
 go to mts Ukraine g all heritage 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.919
 cooperation which still got 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.049
 of the Soviet Union there are many archaic 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.850
 but overall these are huge ours 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.160
 competitive advantages 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.410
 which need to be properly used 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.540
 carve and we can do it on 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.900
 the benefit of both Ukrainian and Russian 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.030
 economy I end up already a lot 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.460
 once said 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.990
 Ukrainian politicians and economists themselves and 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.360
 experts must calculate and accept 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.910
 pragmatic decision which is more profitable so 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.220
 act or otherwise and we do not insist 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.160
 not on anyone's 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.070
 but these 15 billion and which I 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.960
 said this return money again 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.950
 I want five percent from the coupon 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.550
 posted on the Irish Stock Exchange by 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.680
 my English law therefore they 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.660
 protected and 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.289
 I do not see any waste here 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:16.419
 from our side well of course it is obvious 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.419
 support of our Ukrainian
