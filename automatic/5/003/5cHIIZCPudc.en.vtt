that<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> better<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.920> cannot<00:00:53.370> even<00:00:53.640> start

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that the better you cannot even start

emotionally to a crippling extent so you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.429 
emotionally to a crippling extent so you
need<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> separate<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.260> rest<00:01:07.260> of

need to separate out from the rest of
your<00:01:07.700> wherewithal<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.939> sum<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.570> money<00:01:09.960> with

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
which you are to speculate okay that's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.920 
which you are to speculate okay that's
the<00:01:13.170> basic<00:01:13.560> that's<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> start<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.659> then<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the basic that's the start that then it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.770 
the basic that's the start that then it
gets<00:01:16.170> complicated<00:01:16.680> after<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> are

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
gets complicated after that what you are

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
gets complicated after that what you are
really<00:01:18.960> looking<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.680> you're<00:01:19.830> serious

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
really looking to do if you're serious

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.770 
really looking to do if you're serious
is<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.909> grow<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.530> stake<00:01:23.509> while<00:01:24.509> mitigating

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
is to grow your stake while mitigating

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.200 
is to grow your stake while mitigating
against<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> champs<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> risk<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.850> ruin

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
against the champs of the risk of ruin

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.260 
against the champs of the risk of ruin
so<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> speculate<00:01:28.670> enough<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.119> make

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so you want to speculate enough to make

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.170 
so you want to speculate enough to make
a<00:01:30.299> profit<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.740> much<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> depends

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
a profit but not so much so it depends

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.550 
a profit but not so much so it depends
on<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> price<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.869> horse<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.439> edge

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
on the price of the horse and the edge

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
on the price of the horse and the edge
that<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.100> getting<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that you are getting which you have to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.440 
that you are getting which you have to
try<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.479> estimate<00:01:36.570> now<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:38.369> try<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.579> remove

try and estimate now to try and remove
some<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> those<00:01:39.840> complexities<00:01:40.200> let's<00:01:40.619> play<00:01:40.890> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
point you can't have any more spins and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.970 
point you can't have any more spins and
you<00:02:18.300> give<00:02:18.420> me<00:02:18.480> two<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:18.810> each<00:02:18.840> time<00:02:19.140> yes<00:02:19.500> you

you give me two to one each time yes you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.370 
you give me two to one each time yes you
then<00:02:20.190> obviously<00:02:20.670> need<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.880> be<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.360> degree<00:02:22.080> more

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
then obviously need to be a degree more

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.260 
then obviously need to be a degree more
conservative<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.610> don't<00:02:23.880> want<00:02:24.150> to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270

do all your money before the tenth spin
of<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> coin<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.380> think<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.770> betting

it's<00:05:11.970> very<00:05:12.120> difficult<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.630> start<00:05:12.840> saying<00:05:13.169> you

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
it's very difficult to start saying you

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.680 
it's very difficult to start saying you
know<00:05:13.680> have<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:13.889> 4-point<00:05:14.370> selection<00:05:14.849> on<00:05:14.940> this<00:05:15.090> 20

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
know have a 4-point selection on this 20

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.170 
know have a 4-point selection on this 20
to<00:05:15.810> 1<00:05:15.960> shot<00:05:16.259> because<00:05:16.830> it's<00:05:17.099> you<00:05:17.340> know<00:05:17.400> very<00:05:18.000> few

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
to 1 shot because it's you know very few

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.670 
to 1 shot because it's you know very few
people<00:05:18.509> can<00:05:18.630> necessarily<00:05:18.870> get<00:05:19.229> four<00:05:19.440> times

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
people can necessarily get four times

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.559 
people can necessarily get four times
their<00:05:19.949> stake<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.460> given<00:05:20.970> that<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.150> do<00:05:21.210> keep

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
their stake and given that I do keep

records<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.139> my<00:05:22.289> selections<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:23.130> think<00:05:23.789> it

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
records of my selections I think it

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.700 
records of my selections I think it
would<00:05:24.000> be<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> fair<00:05:24.720> criticism<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:25.319> say<00:05:25.470> that<00:05:25.650> if

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
would be a fair criticism to say that if

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.469 
would be a fair criticism to say that if
you<00:05:25.800> put<00:05:25.830> in<00:05:26.069> five<00:05:26.280> points<00:05:26.460> upon<00:05:26.940> fifty<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.360> one

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
you put in five points upon fifty to one

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.210 
you put in five points upon fifty to one
shots<00:05:27.810> it's<00:05:28.020> gonna<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.650> gonna<00:05:28.800> give<00:05:29.099> an

shots it's gonna it's gonna give an

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.820 
shots it's gonna it's gonna give an
unrealistic<00:05:29.900> depiction<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.080> have<00:05:31.259> 10<00:05:31.469> over

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
the years I've cooked down pretty much

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.529 
the years I've cooked down pretty much

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.060 
to one than two point selections it's

should be but if you think your horse

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.040 
should be but if you think your horse
then<00:05:51.060> generally<00:05:51.389> that's<00:05:51.539> going<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:51.750> happen<00:05:51.930> at

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
then generally that's going to happen at

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.629 
then generally that's going to happen at
the<00:05:52.110> higher<00:05:52.289> end<00:05:52.440> of<00:05:52.530> the<00:05:52.590> market<00:05:52.680> for<00:05:53.190> my<00:05:53.310> kind

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
the higher end of the market for my kind

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.059 
the higher end of the market for my kind
of<00:05:53.759> selections<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:54.630> as<00:05:55.050> I<00:05:55.169> say<00:05:55.349> saying<00:05:55.710> have

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
of selections and as I say saying have

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.159 
of selections and as I say saying have
five<00:05:56.310> points<00:05:56.639> on<00:05:56.729> the<00:05:56.819> 25<00:05:57.180> to<00:05:57.389> 1<00:05:57.509> selection

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
five points on the 25 to 1 selection

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.959 
five points on the 25 to 1 selection
he's<00:05:58.469> not<00:05:58.650> really<00:05:58.800> realistic<00:05:59.219> so<00:05:59.699> it's<00:05:59.880> this

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
he's not really realistic so it's this

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.850 
he's not really realistic so it's this
kind<00:06:00.150> of<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.360> balancing<00:06:00.780> act<00:06:00.900> like<00:06:01.139> wind<00:06:01.620> can

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
kind of a balancing act like wind can

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.529 
kind of a balancing act like wind can
you<00:06:02.009> do<00:06:02.430> it<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.610> way<00:06:02.699> you<00:06:02.759> did<00:06:03.090> people<00:06:03.330> say

you do it the way you did people say

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.939 
you do it the way you did people say
well<00:06:03.659> it's<00:06:03.780> unrealistic<00:06:04.169> you<00:06:04.440> can't<00:06:04.650> get<00:06:04.770> 5

more and win only best that's largely

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.740 
more and win only best that's largely
due<00:07:23.490> to<00:07:23.520> the<00:07:23.700> fact<00:07:23.729> that<00:07:23.940> I<00:07:24.060> put<00:07:24.240> a<00:07:24.270> lot<00:07:24.510> of

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
due to the fact that I put a lot of

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.290 
due to the fact that I put a lot of
fairly<00:07:25.470> speculative<00:07:26.280> bets<00:07:26.460> that<00:07:26.729> I<00:07:26.790> think<00:07:27.180> I

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
fairly speculative bets that I think I

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.150 
fairly speculative bets that I think I
can<00:07:27.510> see<00:07:27.690> running<00:07:28.020> really<00:07:28.169> well<00:07:28.290> and<00:07:28.560> winning

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
can see running really well and winning

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.980 
can see running really well and winning
or<00:07:29.340> I<00:07:29.370> can<00:07:29.760> save<00:07:30.000> only<00:07:30.180> no<00:07:30.419> sort<00:07:30.720> of<00:07:30.780> race

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990

they're<00:07:31.229> not<00:07:31.380> ones<00:07:31.620> that<00:07:31.889> I<00:07:32.070> think<00:07:32.580> should<00:07:32.970> be

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.030 
they're not ones that I think should be

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.730 
they're not ones that I think should be
there<00:07:33.300> about<00:07:33.479> so<00:07:33.900> that<00:07:34.020> tends<00:07:34.229> to<00:07:34.290> be<00:07:34.380> the<00:07:34.470> kind

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
there about so that tends to be the kind

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.190 
there about so that tends to be the kind
of<00:07:34.919> bat<00:07:35.790> that<00:07:35.940> I<00:07:36.030> put<00:07:36.360> up<00:07:36.510> and<00:07:36.690> it<00:07:36.780> doesn't<00:07:37.050> make

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.200 
of bat that I put up and it doesn't make

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.659 
of bat that I put up and it doesn't make
much<00:07:37.380> sense<00:07:37.410> then<00:07:37.889> because<00:07:38.100> I<00:07:38.190> tend<00:07:38.400> to<00:07:38.490> think

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:38.669 
much sense then because I tend to think

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:41.030 
much sense then because I tend to think
that<00:07:38.850> the<00:07:39.030> place<00:07:39.630> chance<00:07:40.080> doesn't<00:07:40.860> represent

that the place chance doesn't represent

that the place chance doesn't represent
