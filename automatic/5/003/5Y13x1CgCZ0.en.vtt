00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
this process actually takes if you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.310 
this process actually takes if you
played<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.570> remember<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.260> first

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
played and remember the very first

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.260 
played and remember the very first
iterations<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> map<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.790> literally

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
iterations of the map it literally

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
iterations of the map it literally
started<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> gray<00:00:43.440> shell<00:00:43.800> no<00:00:44.309> cover<00:00:44.640> just

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
started with a gray shell no cover just

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
started with a gray shell no cover just
a<00:00:45.090> few<00:00:45.120> trees<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.809> an<00:00:45.960> untextured<00:00:46.500> flat<00:00:46.950> ground

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a few trees on an untextured flat ground

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.580 
a few trees on an untextured flat ground
if<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:48.000> had<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> regular<00:00:48.780> weekly<00:00:49.140> updates

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
if then had a regular weekly updates

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
if then had a regular weekly updates
until<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.059> front

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
until we have what you now see in front

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.779 
until we have what you now see in front
of<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:52.110> pretty<00:00:52.410> much<00:00:52.789> unrecognizable

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
of you it's pretty much unrecognizable

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.490 
of you it's pretty much unrecognizable
from<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:54.180> only<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> beginning<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.110> even<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
from not only the beginning but even the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
from not only the beginning but even the
last<00:00:55.680> few<00:00:55.920> iterations<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> looks

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
last few iterations and it looks

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.779 
last few iterations and it looks
fantastic<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> lot<00:00:59.309> closer<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
fantastic and now it's a lot closer to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.430 
fantastic and now it's a lot closer to
what<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> final<00:01:00.359> maps<00:01:00.629> gonna<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.230> when

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
what the final maps gonna be like when

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.110 
what the final maps gonna be like when
it's<00:01:01.590> released<00:01:01.920> probably<00:01:02.370> later<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.969> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
it's released probably later on in this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
it's released probably later on in this
year<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.170> feels<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.739> you're<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
year it really feels like you're in a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
year it really feels like you're in a
jungle<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:06.150> vine<00:01:06.540> straight<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.200> from<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
jungle now vine straight down from the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.620 
jungle now vine straight down from the
trees<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:08.010> over<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.369> map<00:01:08.580> grass<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.450> foliage

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
trees all over the map grass and foliage

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660 
trees all over the map grass and foliage
actually<00:01:10.439> gives<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> lots<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.100> cover<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
actually gives you lots of cover and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
actually gives you lots of cover and
that's<00:01:11.909> something<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.510> changed<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> lot<00:01:13.229> on

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that's something that's changed a lot on

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
that's something that's changed a lot on
this<00:01:13.530> version<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.130> really<00:01:14.400> make<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> map<00:01:14.820> feel

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
this version to really make the map feel

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
this version to really make the map feel
a<00:01:15.030> lot<00:01:15.240> more<00:01:15.270> lush<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:16.350> works<00:01:16.710> in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
a lot more lush and it really works in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
a lot more lush and it really works in
fact<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.090> only<00:01:18.450> other<00:01:18.600> jungle<00:01:19.020> maps<00:01:19.200> in

China rising Maps and trust me when I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.060 
China rising Maps and trust me when I
say<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.240> community<00:01:24.780> map<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.350> only<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.680> far

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
say the community map is not only a far

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.219 
say the community map is not only a far
better<00:01:26.220> jungle<00:01:26.729> map<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> far<00:01:27.750> better<00:01:27.930> map

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
better jungle map but a far better map

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
of the map for me has to be the temple

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.990 
of the map for me has to be the temple
it<00:01:43.110> sits<00:01:43.560> underneath<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> waterfall<00:01:44.549> but

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it sits underneath the waterfall but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.179 
it sits underneath the waterfall but
originally<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.810> waterfall<00:01:46.320> was<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
originally the waterfall was just at the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.190 
originally the waterfall was just at the
side<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> map<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.119> top<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> mountain

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
side of the map on top of the mountain

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
side of the map on top of the mountain
and<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> didn't<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> visual

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and it didn't really have the visual

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.210 
and it didn't really have the visual
impact<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.450> needed<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.500> thankfully<00:01:53.040> they've

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
impact it needed so thankfully they've

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.679 
impact it needed so thankfully they've
put<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> lot<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.700> time<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.030> effort<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.479> this

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
put a lot of time and effort into this

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.030 
put a lot of time and effort into this
they've<00:01:54.960> tweaked<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> around<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> little<00:01:55.799> bit

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
they've tweaked it around a little bit

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.800 
they've tweaked it around a little bit
and<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.399> changed<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> temple<00:01:57.630> flag

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
and it's changed so that the temple flag

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.749 
and it's changed so that the temple flag
actually<00:01:58.259> sat<00:01:58.500> underneath<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> waterfall

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
actually sat underneath the waterfall

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
actually sat underneath the waterfall
and<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.329> made<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> huge<00:02:00.719> difference<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and it made a huge difference and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.190 
and it made a huge difference and
finally<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> coolest<00:02:03.509> visual<00:02:03.899> parts

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
finally one of the coolest visual parts

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.139 
finally one of the coolest visual parts
of<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> map<00:02:04.560> actually<00:02:05.100> becomes<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.700> playable

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
of the map actually becomes a playable

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
of the map actually becomes a playable
area<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> map<00:02:07.079> rather<00:02:07.290> than<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.890> being

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
area of the map rather than just being

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.210 
area of the map rather than just being
out<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.910> distance<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.840> skybox<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.739> this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
out in the distance in a skybox in this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.680 
out in the distance in a skybox in this
version<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.760> temple<00:02:12.120> flag<00:02:12.330> has<00:02:12.510> had<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
version the temple flag has had a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.480 
version the temple flag has had a
massive<00:02:13.080> war

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
massive war

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.880 
massive war
Gover<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.420> looks<00:02:14.690> awesome<00:02:15.350> ruin

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
Gover and now it looks awesome ruin

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.560 
Gover and now it looks awesome ruin
structures<00:02:16.400> are<00:02:16.550> scattered<00:02:16.970> around<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.390> so

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
structures are scattered around it so

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.970 
structures are scattered around it so
you've<00:02:17.720> got<00:02:17.870> some<00:02:18.050> cover<00:02:18.260> when<00:02:18.440> approaching

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
you've got some cover when approaching

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.560 
you've got some cover when approaching
and<00:02:19.190> there's<00:02:19.430> also<00:02:19.610> some<00:02:20.030> tall<00:02:20.300> roots

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
and there's also some tall roots

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.360 
and there's also some tall roots
underneath<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.170> temple<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.070> can<00:02:22.220> get

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
underneath the temple that you can get

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.310 
underneath the temple that you can get
through<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.580> sneak<00:02:23.000> inside<00:02:23.210> overall<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
through to sneak inside overall the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.990 
through to sneak inside overall the
design<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:24.950> brilliant<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.700> more

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
design of it is brilliant and more

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.760 
design of it is brilliant and more
importantly<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.690> lot<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.170> new<00:02:27.290> assets<00:02:27.620> have

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
importantly a lot of new assets have

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.560 
importantly a lot of new assets have
been<00:02:27.800> made<00:02:28.100> specifically<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.150> temple

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
been made specifically for the temple

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.480 
been made specifically for the temple
and<00:02:29.750> there<00:02:30.230> isn't<00:02:30.500> quite<00:02:30.530> anything<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:31.250> it

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
and there isn't quite anything like it

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.160 
and there isn't quite anything like it
on<00:02:31.580> any<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.120> other<00:02:32.300> maps<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.750> all<00:02:32.900> looks

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
on any of the other maps it all looks

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.710 
on any of the other maps it all looks
like<00:02:33.260> new<00:02:33.620> materials<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.550> fact<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.330> jungle

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
like new materials in fact the jungle

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.480 
like new materials in fact the jungle
saying<00:02:35.900> itself<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.620> very<00:02:36.860> well<00:02:37.040> done<00:02:37.250> with<00:02:37.400> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
saying itself is very well done with the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.760 
saying itself is very well done with the
foliage<00:02:37.850> finds<00:02:38.210> trees<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.380> cover<00:02:39.650> is

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
foliage finds trees and the cover is

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.860 
foliage finds trees and the cover is
just<00:02:40.280> brilliant<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:41.000> blends<00:02:41.240> together<00:02:41.450> to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
just brilliant it all blends together to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.420 
just brilliant it all blends together to
make<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.230> gorgeous<00:02:42.560> looking<00:02:42.920> map<00:02:43.220> that

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
make a gorgeous looking map that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.520 
make a gorgeous looking map that
actually<00:02:43.760> plays<00:02:44.030> surprisingly<00:02:44.720> well<00:02:45.020> the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
actually plays surprisingly well the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.380 
actually plays surprisingly well the
focus<00:02:45.800> here<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.160> on<00:02:46.490> infantry<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.180> course

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
focus here is on infantry of course

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.640 
focus here is on infantry of course
there<00:02:47.570> are<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.690> couple<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:48.050> vehicles<00:02:48.230> though

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
there are a couple of vehicles though

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.410 
there are a couple of vehicles though
but<00:02:49.100> around<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.550> other<00:02:49.760> parts<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.240> map

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
but around the other parts of the map

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.120 
but around the other parts of the map
the<00:02:50.600> log<00:02:50.810> flag<00:02:51.140> now<00:02:51.410> looks<00:02:51.650> completely

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
the log flag now looks completely

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.190 
the log flag now looks completely
different<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.910> earlier<00:02:53.300> iterations<00:02:53.990> with

different to earlier iterations with
lots<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.950> building<00:02:55.370> structures<00:02:55.820> that<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.000> can

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
lots of building structures that you can

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.630 
lots of building structures that you can
go<00:02:56.300> under<00:02:56.690> as<00:02:56.810> well<00:02:56.960> as<00:02:57.080> inside<00:02:57.620> previously<00:02:58.460> it

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
go under as well as inside previously it

go under as well as inside previously it
was<00:02:58.730> literally<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.390> lines<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.870> trees<00:03:00.170> and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
was literally just lines of trees and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.930 
was literally just lines of trees and
even<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.890> ghost<00:03:01.130> town<00:03:01.370> has<00:03:01.580> had<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.730> lot<00:03:01.910> of
