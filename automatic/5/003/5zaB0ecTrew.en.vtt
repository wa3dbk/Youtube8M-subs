and<00:00:15.330> i'm<00:00:15.600> here<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.810> talk<00:00:15.930> a<00:00:15.990> little<00:00:16.170> bit<00:00:16.350> about

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and i'm here to talk a little bit about

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.260 
and i'm here to talk a little bit about
the<00:00:16.680> crystal<00:00:16.920> clinical<00:00:17.370> on<00:00:17.430> my<00:00:17.520> marathon<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the crystal clinical on my marathon and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.250 
the crystal clinical on my marathon and
training<00:00:19.020> for<00:00:19.910> during<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.120> day<00:00:21.720> here<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
training for during my day here I get a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.930 
training for during my day here I get a
lot<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.440> questions<00:00:22.770> about<00:00:22.920> training<00:00:23.520> indoors

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
lot of questions about training indoors

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.490 
lot of questions about training indoors
outdoors<00:00:24.600> running<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:24.930> treadmill<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
outdoors running on treadmill and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.710 
outdoors running on treadmill and
outside<00:00:25.950> and<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.790> is<00:00:26.850> just<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> few<00:00:27.420> things

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
outside and so this is just a few things

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.200 
outside and so this is just a few things
for<00:00:28.470> advantage<00:00:28.950> disadvantage<00:00:29.310> pros<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.060> cons

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
for advantage disadvantage pros and cons

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.840 
for advantage disadvantage pros and cons
about<00:00:30.420> running<00:00:30.930> indoors<00:00:31.440> and<00:00:31.680> outdoors<00:00:31.850> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
about running indoors and outdoors and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.670 
about running indoors and outdoors and
what<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.300> look<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:33.629> so<00:00:34.140> first<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.470> all<00:00:34.530> is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
what you can look for so first of all is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.290 
what you can look for so first of all is
when<00:00:34.800> you're<00:00:34.920> training<00:00:35.129> indoors<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.239> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
when you're training indoors on a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.850 
when you're training indoors on a
treadmill<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.470> you<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> patient

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
treadmill and if you have a patient

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
treadmill and if you have a patient
usually<00:00:38.160> training<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
usually training that for one of the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.680 
usually training that for one of the
runs<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.920> would<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.400> a<00:00:41.460> pace<00:00:41.699> of<00:00:42.000> 10

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
runs you would like to have a pace of 10

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.110 
runs you would like to have a pace of 10
miles<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.410> assuming<00:00:43.860> 10<00:00:44.250> min<00:00:44.400> smile<00:00:44.670> name<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
miles I'm assuming 10 min smile name is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.430 
miles I'm assuming 10 min smile name is
my<00:00:45.239> life<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.570> stuff<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.900> you<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.110> easily<00:00:46.320> do

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
my life that stuff and you can easily do

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.319 
my life that stuff and you can easily do
that<00:00:46.470> with<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> treadmill<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.970> when<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> run

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that with a treadmill but when you run

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.060 
that with a treadmill but when you run
out<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.510> treadmill<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.320> usually<00:00:49.560> are<00:00:50.040> not

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
out on treadmill you usually are not

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
out on treadmill you usually are not
exerting<00:00:50.700> quite<00:00:51.060> as<00:00:51.180> much<00:00:51.360> energy<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
exerting quite as much energy as you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
exerting quite as much energy as you
will<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.530> when<00:00:52.710> you're<00:00:52.829> outside<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
will be when you're outside and the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430 
will be when you're outside and the
reason<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.480> because<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.290> wind

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
reason for that is because of the wind

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.930 
reason for that is because of the wind
resistance<00:00:55.950> when<00:00:56.100> we're<00:00:56.280> running<00:00:56.550> inside<00:00:56.790> on

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
resistance when we're running inside on

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
resistance when we're running inside on
a<00:00:57.030> treadmill<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.540> course<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.380> getting

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
a treadmill of course you're not getting

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
a treadmill of course you're not getting
any<00:00:58.890> wind<00:00:59.130> resistance<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.790> actually<00:00:59.969> need

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
any wind resistance so you actually need

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.299 
any wind resistance so you actually need
to<00:01:00.390> pick<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.440> resistance<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.980> little<00:01:02.219> bit

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to pick up the resistance a little bit

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.860 
to pick up the resistance a little bit
more<00:01:02.489> while<00:01:02.850> you're<00:01:03.030> running<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.329> treadmill

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
more while you're running on treadmill

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
more while you're running on treadmill
you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:05.280> lose<00:01:05.670> between<00:01:05.910> five<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you can actually lose between five and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.200 
you can actually lose between five and
ten<00:01:06.810> percent<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.890> muscle<00:01:08.430> energy<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
ten percent of your muscle energy and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.820 
ten percent of your muscle energy and
your<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.170> your<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.910> oxygen<00:01:12.450> intake<00:01:13.229> by

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
your see your your your oxygen intake by

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.279 
your see your your your oxygen intake by
running<00:01:14.250> inside<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.690> counteract<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.110> we

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
running inside so to counteract that we

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.810 
running inside so to counteract that we
want<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.890> sure<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> treadmill<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
want to make sure that the treadmill is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.000 
want to make sure that the treadmill is
up<00:01:17.910> by<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.660> two<00:01:18.690> percent<00:01:19.140> incline<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
up by a one or a two percent incline to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.080 
up by a one or a two percent incline to
make<00:01:20.159> sure<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.430> you're<00:01:20.460> equaling<00:01:20.940> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
make sure that you're equaling the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.230 
make sure that you're equaling the
output<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.750> far<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.140> cardiovascular<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
output as far as cardiovascular so just

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.840 
output as far as cardiovascular so just
remember<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:25.250> another<00:01:26.250> thing<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
remember that another thing and this is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.539 
remember that another thing and this is
a<00:01:26.880> big<00:01:27.299> problem<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.010> run<00:01:29.280> into

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
a big problem that we can run into

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.120 
a big problem that we can run into
running<00:01:30.270> inside<00:01:30.630> versus<00:01:31.020> outside<00:01:31.380> when<00:01:31.950> we're

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
running inside versus outside when we're

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
running inside versus outside when we're
running<00:01:32.400> outside<00:01:33.200> we<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.470> notice<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
running outside we have to notice the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.160 
running outside we have to notice the
train<00:01:35.430> you're<00:01:35.700> running<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.750> road<00:01:36.930> you're

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
train you're running on the road you're

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
train you're running on the road you're
running<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> sidewalk<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> may<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
running on the sidewalk you may have to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.460 
running on the sidewalk you may have to
run<00:01:38.760> through<00:01:38.939> some<00:01:39.060> grass<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.659> when<00:01:40.260> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
run through some grass and when that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.100 
run through some grass and when that
occurs<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.580> natural<00:01:42.049> occurrence<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
occurs the natural occurrence that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.649 
occurs the natural occurrence that
happens<00:01:43.260> for<00:01:43.740> us<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.220> humans<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.210> called

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
happens for us as humans we called

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.990 
happens for us as humans we called
proprioception<00:01:45.920> when<00:01:46.920> proprioception<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
proprioception when proprioception is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
proprioception when proprioception is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the ability to know where we are in

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190 
the ability to know where we are in
space<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.159> time<00:01:50.270> without<00:01:51.270> having<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.900> really

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
space and time without having to really

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.899 
space and time without having to really
think<00:01:52.380> about<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.070> you're<00:01:53.220> striding<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
think about it so as you're striding and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.859 
think about it so as you're striding and
you're<00:01:54.030> running<00:01:54.210> you're<00:01:55.049> changing<00:01:56.869> surfaces

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you're running you're changing surfaces

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
you're running you're changing surfaces
make<00:01:58.470> your<00:01:58.650> ankle<00:01:59.040> work<00:01:59.460> harder<00:01:59.850> mix<00:01:59.970> your

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
make your ankle work harder mix your

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.399 
make your ankle work harder mix your
capital<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.630> harder<00:02:00.900> make<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.229> work<00:02:01.380> harder

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
capital it harder make you work harder

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.170 
capital it harder make you work harder
of<00:02:02.100> course<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
of course you're not going to get that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.730 
of course you're not going to get that
when<00:02:03.750> you're<00:02:03.869> running<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.170> treadmill<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
when you're running on treadmill it's a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.069 
when you're running on treadmill it's a
very<00:02:04.950> smooth<00:02:05.280> surface<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.820> never<00:02:06.390> changes<00:02:06.900> as

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
very smooth surface it never changes as

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.210 
very smooth surface it never changes as
far<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.820> variety<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.690> lose<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
far as the variety and so we lose that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.970 
far as the variety and so we lose that
