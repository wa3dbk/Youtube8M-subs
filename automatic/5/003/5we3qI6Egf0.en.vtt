so<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.510> RC<00:00:03.510> car<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:04.529> mounted<00:00:05.310> all<00:00:05.430> my

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
so this is the RC car I mounted all my

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.930 
so this is the RC car I mounted all my
electronics<00:00:06.120> onto<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.690> RC<00:00:07.500> truck<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.400> found<00:00:08.820> a

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
electronics onto this RC truck I found a

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.320 
electronics onto this RC truck I found a
goodwill<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.510> like<00:00:09.630> five<00:00:09.809> dollars<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:11.300> see<00:00:12.300> I

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
goodwill for like five dollars and see I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.310 
goodwill for like five dollars and see I
still<00:00:12.660> got<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.490> breadboard<00:00:14.490> Arduino<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:16.049> red

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
still got the breadboard Arduino the red

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.510 
still got the breadboard Arduino the red
ship<00:00:16.590> there<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.279> motor<00:00:18.029> driver<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:20.130> then

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
ship there is the motor driver and then

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.060 
ship there is the motor driver and then
the<00:00:20.840> RFM<00:00:21.840> 12<00:00:22.140> B<00:00:22.320> wireless<00:00:22.920> transceiver

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
the RFM 12 B wireless transceiver

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.330 
the RFM 12 B wireless transceiver
powering<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> I've<00:00:26.369> got<00:00:26.599> eight<00:00:27.599> double<00:00:27.960> A's

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
powering it I've got eight double A's

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.260 
powering it I've got eight double A's
for<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> motor<00:00:29.789> power<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.990> then<00:00:31.170> inside

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
for the motor power and then inside

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
for the motor power and then inside
there<00:00:33.270> there's<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.079> couple<00:00:34.260> nine<00:00:34.770> volts<00:00:35.130> that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
there there's a couple nine volts that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.660 
there there's a couple nine volts that
power<00:00:35.520> both<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> transceiver<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:38.600> Arduino

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
power both the transceiver and Arduino

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.600 
power both the transceiver and Arduino
and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.200> all<00:00:43.200> taped<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> wired<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.460> on

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and then here all taped and wired up on

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.750 
and then here all taped and wired up on
the<00:00:44.700> breadboard<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.860> another<00:00:46.860> Arduino<00:00:47.190> with

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the breadboard is another Arduino with

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.830 
the breadboard is another Arduino with
another<00:00:48.149> RF<00:00:48.870> m<00:00:48.989> 12<00:00:49.289> B<00:00:49.440> transceiver<00:00:50.300> with<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
another RF m 12 B transceiver with the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
another RF m 12 B transceiver with the
Wii<00:00:51.989> Nunchuk<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:53.219> controls<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> we'll<00:00:56.219> go

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
Wii Nunchuk that controls it so we'll go

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.969 
Wii Nunchuk that controls it so we'll go
ahead<00:00:58.190> switch<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.399> on<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.739> got

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
ahead switch this on and now all we got

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.690 
ahead switch this on and now all we got
to<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:07.100> hit<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> brake

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to do hit the brake

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:33.460 
to do hit the brake
and<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.420> go

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.109 

the<00:01:34.470> range<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.830> pretty<00:01:35.040> good<00:01:35.399> supposedly

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the range is pretty good supposedly

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.109 
the range is pretty good supposedly
these<00:01:36.300> two<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.080> hundred<00:01:37.290> meters<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
these two get about a hundred meters I

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.190 
these two get about a hundred meters I
haven't<00:01:39.119> really<00:01:39.300> tested<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> far<00:01:40.290> yet

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
haven't really tested it that far yet

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.539 
haven't really tested it that far yet
I've<00:01:43.200> gone<00:01:43.470> down<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> where<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> red

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
I've gone down to where you see the red

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.950 
I've gone down to where you see the red
and<00:01:44.700> white<00:01:44.790> stripe<00:01:45.649> close<00:01:46.649> down<00:01:46.920> there<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
and white stripe close down there and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.469 
and white stripe close down there and
that's<00:01:48.960> about<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.290> far<00:01:49.440> as<00:01:49.500> I've<00:01:49.680> gotten

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.330 

one<00:01:54.479> thing<00:01:54.690> using<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.080> accelerometer<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
one thing using the accelerometer it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.219 
one thing using the accelerometer it
does<00:01:56.550> get<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:57.000> little<00:01:57.119> sensitive<00:01:57.659> especially

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
does get a little sensitive especially

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.639 
does get a little sensitive especially
when<00:01:58.380> you're<00:01:58.610> going<00:01:59.610> full<00:01:59.909> speed

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
when you're going full speed

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:11.050 
when you're going full speed
turning<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.600> gets<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:04.229> sensitive

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.650 

and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.239> brake<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.200> we're<00:02:13.530> done
