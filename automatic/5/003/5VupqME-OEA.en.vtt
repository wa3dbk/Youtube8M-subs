00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:20.570
 I choose your character 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.250
 playstation stores battle royale sonys 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.079
 Reply to nintendo's super smash bros 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.579
 series which now has three 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.650
 generations the players can tie 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.540
 Batteries are not easy then 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 knock off tenorarie but it 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.669
 convinced in his own way and 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.649
 wise 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.510
 he collects with every attack and combo 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.180
 Attack points for you when you reach 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.520
 a certain number at level 1 2 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.410
 let rise 3 or reducing their 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.850
 special handles can ever execute 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.530
 higher the level is the stronger 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.530
 and more effectively he is attacked 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 the goal is with the help of this attack the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.830
 could kill each other around 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.420
 a point stall the player of the am 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.640
 killed most people 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 wins the round in the mode you go 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.270
 so by a total of six labor 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.890
 under the endboss middle-left no such 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.810
 should pose a big problem 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.070
 on the contrary the game offers in 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.020
 single player mode despite the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 diverse opponents and the beautiful 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.540
 a little bizarre level design little 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.370
 variety 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.750
 the battles are always linear 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.370
 and are different except for the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.170
 opponents and their respective attacks 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.700
 little of each other is always the animal 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.150
 I hope to win over the opponents kill 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.830
 to be able to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.110
 the strength of playstation oster 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.460
 betteray , on the other hand, is multiplayer 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.229
 friends or online 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.240
 so you can fight against opponents of all 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.729
 measure the world and try the best lord 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.920
 to become world ranking the levels are 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.570
 beautifully constructed it happens frequently 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 that you have topics and level in the second 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.690
 completely change half of the fight 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.250
 It happens that with a cut 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.140
 off of level behind hades suddenly 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.149
 neither patapons appear or that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 cute logo highly appreciated shock in 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.509
 finds elements being disturbed as 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.180
 playable characters are numerous 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.979

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.300

 playstation oyster battle royale shows 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.280
 impressive as this kind of song on 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.170
 the playstation 3 can look like 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 the comparison with super smash bros is 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.740
 however, none is justified 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.450
 copy of the same month 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.130
 impressively proved how to do this 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.750
 title can give a new high 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.920
 and that can really be proud of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.810
 Many thanks to sony for the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.810
 provision of the review copies
