for if that does happen to you all you
have<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.909> switch<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> other

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
have to do is switch to the other

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.249 
have to do is switch to the other
character<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> wait<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.970> computer<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.920 

get<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.680> its<00:01:34.890> own<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.720> little

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
get up on its own and it it's a little

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.780 
get up on its own and it it's a little
bit<00:01:37.020> quicker<00:01:37.290> than<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.680> doing<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.100> or<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
bit quicker than you doing it or it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.260 
bit quicker than you doing it or it
might<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.869> makes<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.320> easier<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.979> I

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
might not be but it makes it easier so I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
might not be but it makes it easier so I
actually<00:01:42.270> happens<00:01:42.810> twice<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.350> video<00:01:43.710> second

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
actually happens twice this video second

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710 
actually happens twice this video second
time<00:01:44.369> he<00:01:44.490> falls<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.509> push

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
time he falls is just because I push

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.920 
time he falls is just because I push
them<00:01:45.930> off

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
them off

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.320
