00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.420
 hello everyone welcome on motivated 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.250
 I'm crazy I'm afraid today we 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.420
 found on the floor with shaped escapes for the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.290
 technical demonstration of an exercise 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.300
 for the abdominals 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.130
 this is the statement of legs at the bar 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.700
 fixed or possibly to the chair 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.279
 Roman if you have one it will be more 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.900
 rather a variant of the records of 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.670
 legs the language I use 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.079
 personally for my workout 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.910
 abdominals in sight you've been 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.440
 very many to ask me what was 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.829
 what were my exercises for my 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.470
 routine 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.670
 abdou so before entering cleanly 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.050
 speak in the technical demonstration 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.780
 of this exercise 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.240
 I want to remember the primary function 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.500
 abdominals at motor level hold 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.630
 movement allow us to perform 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.250
 the abdominals down the abdominals we 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.470
 allow to flex the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 hole in this case to bring back the 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.270
 pubis to bring the pubis closer to our 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.800
 sternum and that's a dish it's a 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.229
 capital point that you must remember 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.939
 to really work effectively 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.720
 your abs 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.930
 so we will start to put ourselves in 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.620
 position to impose his departure I'm going 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.800
 settle on the fixed bar agree 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.850
 I will start the movement 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.080
 legs at 90 ° and then there I see you 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.110
 who say yes but good normally 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.600
 we start the arms the legs pardon 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.940
 the legs in the upright ben no the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.650
 friends why I do not start yet 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.659
 once it's my variant why I 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.400
 do not start this exercise with the 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.330
 simply vertical legs 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.210
 because if we analyze the muscles that 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.290
 come into play during this phase 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.590
 okay if I had to make legs 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.280
 strained not during this phase 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.640
 that is to say the passage of the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.110
 verticality at the angle of 90 degrees this 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.000
 will not be my abs who will do 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.979
 the main work got mixed up 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.640
 hip flexor muscle it's up to 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.629
 say the places psoas the right the big 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.909
 inside thigh the tension 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.379
 of the fascia the tare in no case this does not 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.519
 will be my abs who are going who are going 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.530
 work elsewhere you feel it 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.799
 when you often elsewhere 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.360
 an error that is commonly made 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.240
 by the practitioners that to perform 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.660
 Legs like this 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.960
 this is what we are trying to pass from the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.280
 verticality at the angle 80 ° friends 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.230
 by the way you feel it you're going 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.670
 to have pain at that level is going to heat up 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.840
 the same at the thighs you 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.640
 knot work that you will do schiesser 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.240
 of the hip so starting to 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.740
 80 ° know ensures that 90 degrees 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.070
 until the end of the movement 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.930
 only my abs will come into play 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.230
 a single message from Lyon will work 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.160
 so I take the position so I 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.030
 I'm not there at 80 ° I win 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.270
 well in the abdominals 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.430
 I'm going to tummy up the maximum 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.300
 back and right she without jerking I'm going 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.750
 perform a winding up of the 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.300
 spine of the spine 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.100
 this is a point g is essential that this 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.540
 in this exercise where in 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.920
 others exist others others 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.290
 exercises I have already discussed 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.780
 with the highest product 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.240
 you must have this desire to 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.610
 put you in a ball of agreement remember 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.780
 me the highest crunch 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.430
 the crunch apulia where I ask you 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.110
 to curl up with a word or 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.890
 asks the column from the bust to 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.050
 from the sternum 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.640
 that's exactly the same thing but 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.540
 it will be necessary to put you in ball 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.910
 from the basin 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.520
 so we'll have to make a name 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.370
 spine roll of the column to 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.290
 from the basin 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.080
 this time it is the key point that so 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.580
 knees at 80 ° people roll basin I 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.540
 knees up to the top 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.490
 I contract and I go back down when I 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.290
 mounted 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.820
 I will explain maximum to empty the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.780
 abdominal muscles to promote 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.910
 contraction is I go back down we could 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.300
 see my legs do not come down anymore 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.760
 down that the horizontal okay you 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.400
 can go down 10 cm below but 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.850
 in no case will we return to the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.850
 vertical 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.340
 at home is to climb the highest 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.560
 possible for a shortening to 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.889
 maximum has shortened moscow the maxe 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.889
 match 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:42.009
 so here's a friend you'll see the 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:46.009
 just go back to the horizontal at that 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.750
 it offers a lot of sensations enough 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.789
 unique in the abdominals 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.039
 getting your knee up a good 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.550
 maximum I meant you're going 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.500
 really have maximum shortening 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.659
 but it is to maintain the contraction 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.539
 a small second at the end of the movement 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.879
 okay and again we were rolling 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.969
 well we drove well put yourself at 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.039
 this is the key to this exercise 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:12.169
 put yourself to work you can exact 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.509
 you can possibly do this 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.189
 exercise at the Roman chair 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.639
 hominal shahzad if you have one 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:21.560
 hour for those who have he will say if this 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.080
 would be too simple to empty you can 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.180
 possibly put a dumbbell between 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.219
 stuck between your feet or possibly 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.729
 do this exercise with the same concern 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.310
 technical 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.069
 I heard a lot harder at 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.120
 level of number of series performed 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.919
 three four series usually these 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.909
 names of syria that i'm doing i have 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.150
 performed the abdominals this work the 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:43.639
 abdominals one session out of two so 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.189
 three times a week so here are three 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.949
 four sessions 3 4 forgiveness series so of 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.800
 repetition if it's not ballasted we go to 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.719
 max this is this video is over 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.460
