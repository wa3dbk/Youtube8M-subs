see if there was anything I could do and
it<00:02:27.980> was<00:02:28.660> plain<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:32.150> put<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.480> back

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
it was plain and the to put it back

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.309 
it was plain and the to put it back
together<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:33.709> was<00:02:33.920> having<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.550> hard<00:02:34.880> time

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.660 
assembling assembling it again and I
just<00:02:38.750> put<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.440> back<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.130> haven't<00:02:40.489> had<00:02:40.580> the
