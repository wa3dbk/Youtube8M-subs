00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
rock your mind playing all that I don't

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
freshman year here at the University I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.230 
freshman year here at the University I
took<00:00:46.500> class<00:00:47.250> called<00:00:47.520> gaming<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.060> greater

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
took class called gaming for the greater

good<00:00:48.540> yeah<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.990> always<00:00:49.560> had<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.490> notion<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.290> we

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
good yeah I always had this notion of we

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.010 
good yeah I always had this notion of we
should<00:00:52.560> in<00:00:52.710> our<00:00:52.830> classes<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:54.120> projects<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
should in our classes do projects that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.310 
should in our classes do projects that
have<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> strong<00:00:55.470> social<00:00:55.770> context<00:00:57.200> we<00:00:58.200> are

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
have a strong social context we are

I<00:01:08.570> teach<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.659> software<00:01:10.020> engineering<00:01:10.320> class<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I teach a software engineering class and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.919 
I teach a software engineering class and
I<00:01:11.009> seek<00:01:11.219> the<00:01:11.399> introduction<00:01:11.939> engineering

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
I seek the introduction engineering

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.539 
I seek the introduction engineering
my<00:01:13.289> students<00:01:13.710> need<00:01:13.859> to<00:01:13.920> work<00:01:14.219> on<00:01:14.399> real

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
my students need to work on real

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520 
my students need to work on real
progress<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.929> come<00:01:16.079> up<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.229> some

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
progress so I can come up with some

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.590 
progress so I can come up with some
reprise<00:01:17.009> project<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.179> can<00:01:18.299> come<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.570> with

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
reprise project or we can come up with

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
reprise project or we can come up with
projects<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.710> something<00:01:20.100> good<00:01:20.249> so<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
projects that do something good so this

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.849 
projects that do something good so this
is<00:01:21.119> path<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:22.049> idea<00:01:22.350> behind<00:01:22.499> it<00:01:22.679> is<00:01:22.829> very

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
is path the idea behind it is very

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.340 
is path the idea behind it is very
simple<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.579> you<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> path<00:01:24.749> displayed<00:01:25.200> on

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
simple so you have a path displayed on

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.899 
simple so you have a path displayed on
screen<00:01:25.679> and<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.130> are<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.429> supposed<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> do

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
screen and what are you supposed to do

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.819 
screen and what are you supposed to do
is<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.179> follow<00:01:27.359> it<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.780> whatever<00:01:28.020> body

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
is just follow it with whatever body

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.260 
is just follow it with whatever body
part<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.159> choose<00:01:29.369> right<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:29.609> we<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:30.119> offer

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
part you choose right now we we offer

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
part you choose right now we we offer
either<00:01:30.659> hand<00:01:31.109> either<00:01:31.530> foot<00:01:31.829> either<00:01:32.069> knee

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
either hand either foot either knee

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.849 
either hand either foot either knee
either<00:01:32.579> elbow<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.270> head<00:01:33.539> so<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.319> idea<00:01:34.649> is

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
either elbow or your head so the idea is

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.859 
either elbow or your head so the idea is
let's<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.249> if<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.609> this<00:01:35.759> here<00:01:35.969> just<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
let's see if I can do this here just to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.809 
let's see if I can do this here just to
follow<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.670> pretty

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
follow it like that and it's pretty

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.550 
follow it like that and it's pretty
simple<00:01:38.999> and<00:01:39.359> we<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.350> pretty

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
simple and we like to think it's pretty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.679 
simple and we like to think it's pretty
fun<00:01:40.770> our<00:01:41.280> goal<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.609> to<00:01:41.640> kind<00:01:41.999> of<00:01:42.030> improve<00:01:42.359> gross

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
fun our goal is to kind of improve gross

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.779 
fun our goal is to kind of improve gross
motor<00:01:42.960> control<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.829> over<00:01:44.130> time<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.670> can

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
motor control so over time you can

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.760 
motor control so over time you can
repeat<00:01:45.090> these<00:01:45.299> paths<00:01:45.689> again<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.139> again<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
repeat these paths again and again and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.289 
repeat these paths again and again and
you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.979> get<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> no<00:01:47.369> finer<00:01:47.609> and<00:01:47.850> finer<00:01:47.880> control

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
you can get a no finer and finer control

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.889 
you can get a no finer and finer control
over<00:01:48.740> gross<00:01:49.740> motor<00:01:49.920> functions<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.270> landscape

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
over gross motor functions the landscape

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
over gross motor functions the landscape
is<00:01:52.139> so<00:01:52.170> huge<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.889> mean<00:01:53.009> there's<00:01:53.249> a<00:01:53.340> lifetime

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
is so huge I mean there's a lifetime

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.879 
is so huge I mean there's a lifetime
worth<00:01:54.359> before<00:01:54.719> that<00:01:55.109> that<00:01:55.319> we<00:01:55.409> could<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.679> in

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:55.889 
worth before that that we could do in

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:57.649 
worth before that that we could do in
the<00:01:56.130> open<00:01:56.310> physical<00:01:56.700> cognitive<00:01:56.909> there's<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the open physical cognitive there's a

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
and the only way to get that when you're

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.759 
and the only way to get that when you're
dealing<00:02:46.730> with<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.209> special<00:02:48.140> audience<00:02:48.560> is

trying to move out we don't want to get

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.670 
trying to move out we don't want to get
to<00:02:55.120> like<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.329> end<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.720> production<00:02:55.930> cycle

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
to like the end of the production cycle

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.350 
to like the end of the production cycle
and<00:02:56.829> realize<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.790> game<00:02:57.939> has<00:02:58.180> no

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
time energy spent designing the game to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:20.610 
time energy spent designing the game to
be<00:03:03.010> there<00:03:03.250> beautifully<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.840> any<00:03:20.349> of<00:03:20.530> you

I mean I think the tools are ready I
think<00:05:40.270> we<00:05:40.660> have<00:05:40.840> all<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:41.170> pieces<00:05:41.380> in<00:05:41.680> place<00:05:41.920> as

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
think we have all the pieces in place as
