00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
locked into the playoff position and I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.080 
locked into the playoff position and I
think<00:01:59.040> they'll<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.280> resting<00:01:59.670> some<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.969> their

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
think they'll be resting some of their

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.690 
think they'll be resting some of their
starters<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.869> game<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.560> didn't<00:02:02.340> they<00:02:02.430> rest

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
starters this game but didn't they rest

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.480

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
all their starters the entire season so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.980 
all their starters the entire season so
I<00:02:05.520> think<00:02:05.969> they're<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.390> fine<00:02:06.719> I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
I think they're going to be fine I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.650 
I think they're going to be fine I
definitely<00:02:07.469> am<00:02:07.710> picking<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> Seahawks

Jacksonville<00:02:09.660> at<00:02:09.840> kc<00:02:10.340> jacksonville<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.459> a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
Jacksonville at kc jacksonville is a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.580 
Jacksonville at kc jacksonville is a
horrible<00:02:12.000> road<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
horrible road to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.800 
horrible road to
and<00:02:12.739> Kansas<00:02:13.400> City<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> really<00:02:14.420> good<00:02:14.569> home

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and Kansas City is a really good home

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.869 
and Kansas City is a really good home
team<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.680> think<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.489> Chiefs<00:02:16.730> are

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
team so I think that the Chiefs are

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.990 
team so I think that the Chiefs are
going<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.090> win<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.360> game<00:02:17.769> Miami<00:02:18.769> at<00:02:19.099> Indy<00:02:19.790> I

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
going to win this game Miami at Indy I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.119 
going to win this game Miami at Indy I
think<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.720> will<00:02:20.840> see<00:02:21.080> Peyton<00:02:21.560> Manning<00:02:22.010> in

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
think that we will see Peyton Manning in

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.580 
think that we will see Peyton Manning in
a<00:02:22.220> little<00:02:22.550> bit<00:02:22.730> better<00:02:23.060> mood<00:02:23.569> after<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.290> game

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
a little bit better mood after this game

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.220 
a little bit better mood after this game
this<00:02:24.800> weekend<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.519> think<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.330> Colts<00:02:26.750> are<00:02:26.780> going

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
this weekend I think the Colts are going

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.070 
this weekend I think the Colts are going
to<00:02:27.440> win<00:02:27.640> also<00:02:28.640> we<00:02:28.790> have<00:02:29.000> San<00:02:29.269> Francisco<00:02:29.750> Denver

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
to win also we have San Francisco Denver

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.900 
to win also we have San Francisco Denver
and<00:02:30.500> Denver's<00:02:31.160> just<00:02:31.400> thanking<00:02:31.700> their<00:02:31.879> lucky

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
and Denver's just thanking their lucky

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.690 
and Denver's just thanking their lucky
stars<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.840> they<00:02:33.680> need<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> win<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.250> get<00:02:34.519> in<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
stars that they need a win to get in the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.360 
stars that they need a win to get in the
playoffs<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.299> they're<00:02:35.989> facing<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.620> 49ers<00:02:37.250> at

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
playoffs and they're facing the 49ers at

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.220 
playoffs and they're facing the 49ers at
home<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.209> think<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.540> Broncos<00:02:38.930> are<00:02:39.049> going<00:02:39.170> to

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
home so I think the Broncos are going to

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.250 
home so I think the Broncos are going to
win<00:02:39.410> also<00:02:40.190> we<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.489> Atlanta<00:02:41.150> at<00:02:41.360> Philadelphia

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
win also we have Atlanta at Philadelphia

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.430 
win also we have Atlanta at Philadelphia
and<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:43.310> think<00:02:43.730> Ron<00:02:43.940> Mexico<00:02:44.239> might<00:02:44.720> prove<00:02:45.319> that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and I think Ron Mexico might prove that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.680 
and I think Ron Mexico might prove that
he<00:02:45.530> actually<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.549> coach<00:02:46.819> killer<00:02:47.180> because

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
he actually is a coach killer because

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.039 
he actually is a coach killer because
after<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.349> game<00:02:48.680> Maura<00:02:49.579> might<00:02:50.090> not<00:02:50.360> have<00:02:50.810> a

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
after this game Maura might not have a

after this game Maura might not have a
