00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.339
 a chapter 12 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.640
 finishing processes 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.829
 and the sensory analysis of wines 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.509
 finishing processes 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.050
 before wine motels you have to clarify what stabilize it and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.760
 filter it 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.230
 planning 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 is when the wine is completely clean of substances 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.100
 foreign 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.890
 and that does not present any type of turbidity them 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.540
 It is a process that has already been done little by little in the steps 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.490
 prior to the preparation 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.700
 the clarification consists in leaving the wine totally clean 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.300
 stabilization 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.210
 but it is not only that the wine is clean but that this clarity 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.000
 be maintained over time 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.140
 that does not become muddy wine once clarified 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.450
 for that there are certain physical and chemical procedures that prevent 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.390
 albino of possible alterations 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.159
 mainly due to cold heat and action 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.230
 filtered out 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.290
 It is made before bottling and serves to leave the wine completely clean 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.710
 the filtering processes drag the foreign particles to the wine 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.070
 but they also take with them beneficial parts like coloring matter 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280
 aromas and busts 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.049
 there must be a balance between more or less aggressive filtering so that 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.920
 the wine is correct 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.310
 besides the piero we believe in a little aggressive filtering 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.820
 we want to eliminate foreign particles to the wine 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.320
 but that does not drag too many natural components of the wine as 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230
 coloring matter played badly 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.560
 this makes the wines more fair assets 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.150
 and with better quality 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.160
 but sometimes it can favor that some wine has wells 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.130
 Wells that are totally natural components of wine 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270
 and we must know that it is beneficial natural material for wine and for our 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.410
 Health 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.280
 in all wines there are always some very small particles that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.239
 they are practically impossible to eliminate 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.519
 on the other hand in some red wines of prolonged aging in wood and bottle 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.430
 the formation of pompous deposits of coloring matter is frequent 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.690
 and in certain wines 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.639
 almost inevitable 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.529
 precipitation of wine 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.219
 It is a natural phenomenon and is the result of not having intervened 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.309
 radical form in the process of development and aging through strong 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:32.499
 clarifications today intense leaks 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.829
 they are not wine defects are symptoms of quality and respect to a way of 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.429
 natural work 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.799
 over the years 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.589
 essentially two types of sediments are formed 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.739
 the treatments 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.859
 and the coloring matter 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:46.969
 the tartazos 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.969
 they are natural crystallizations from the grape 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.620
 the most usual 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.739
 is the vita potassium treatment 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.709
 They are salts of tartaric acid that are precipitated by the action of cold 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.119
 Bottle background 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.879
 The easiest way to act on sediments is through the 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.109
 decanting 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.069
 wine decanting 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.569
 for a good decantation we must treat the bottle carefully 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.849
 without moving it or shaking it 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.160
 once heard 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.069
 remembering that what should move is the corkscrew tino the bottle 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 we decant it slowly in a transparent glass jar 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.299
 when we see that the liquid comes out cloudy we will finish a process of 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.230
 decanting 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.569
 leaving the wells in the bottle 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.039
 nevertheless it is necessary to make clear that the wells are not a waste 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.049
 the wells have broad health benefits and are employees of different 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.579
 ways 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.820
 they are used in therapeutic treatments 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.780
 and in countries like Portugal there is a habit of eating the company 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.689
 Sensory analysis of wines 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.829
 in the tasting, the sight, smell and taste are mainly involved 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:55.569
 the view 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.159
 analyzes the external appearance of wine and conveys a first impression of 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.159
 how is it puts us on the track of its typology 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.479
 structure and so on 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.759
 Although its importance is not decisive, it lies in the fact that 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.819
 guide kaka 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.999
 The taster facilitates the task of concentrating on comparing wine with 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.439
 similar records 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.879
 the sense of smell helps us to identify the personality of the wine 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.000
 we must understand the aromas as a reflection 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.890
 of everything that the fruit has acquired during the growth 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.789
 ripening wine 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.059
 and the tuning 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.960
 taste 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.990
 the palate 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.779
 will give us information about the character of the wine 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:41.589
 we understand the character of the wine in the mouth as the skeleton structure 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.099
 the wine in the mouth will inform us of the evolution capacity that the fruit 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.139
 has left 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.729
 will also inform us of the requirement of the vineyard 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.039
 and the work of viticulture and biz
