00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.620 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.550 

so<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.370> took<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.640> sample<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.390> made<00:00:28.200> a<00:00:28.230> couple

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so I took that sample and made a couple

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200 
so I took that sample and made a couple
entrance<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.460> let's<00:00:29.940> look<00:00:30.030> at<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
entrance out of it let's look at the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.780 
entrance out of it let's look at the
first<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.690> here<00:00:31.190> we're<00:00:32.190> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.370> open<00:00:32.670> this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
first one here we're going to open this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
first one here we're going to open this
guy<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:35.330> its<00:00:36.330> first<00:00:36.900> thing<00:00:37.080> you'll<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
guy up and its first thing you'll see is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.770 
guy up and its first thing you'll see is
an<00:00:37.500> arpeggiator<00:00:38.220> there's<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.940> synth<00:00:39.270> itself

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
an arpeggiator there's the synth itself

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.280 
an arpeggiator there's the synth itself
with<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.440> sample<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> couple<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
with the sample and a couple of the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.799 
with the sample and a couple of the
little<00:00:43.500> things<00:00:43.710> frequency<00:00:44.310> shift<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:44.910> little

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
little things frequency shift or little

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.830 
little things frequency shift or little
utility<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.620> kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.980> put<00:00:47.610> things<00:00:47.660> more<00:00:48.660> in

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
utility to kind of put things more in

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.460 
utility to kind of put things more in
the<00:00:48.930> center<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.950> limiter<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:51.170> most<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
the center and a limiter and most of the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.170 
the center and a limiter and most of the
controls<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.280> coming<00:00:53.580> right<00:00:53.610> off<00:00:53.790> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
controls here are coming right off the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.990 
controls here are coming right off the
sampler<00:00:54.930> itself<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:57.050> start<00:00:58.050> off<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:59.010> low

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
sampler itself so start off with a low

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
sampler itself so start off with a low
pass<00:01:00.239> filter<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> resonance<00:01:07.440> 25

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
pass filter and we get the resonance 25

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
pass filter and we get the resonance 25
total<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:10.640> I've<00:01:11.640> also<00:01:11.850> got<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.150> filter

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
total and I've also got a filter

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.760 
total and I've also got a filter
envelope<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:15.680> which<00:01:16.680> will<00:01:16.860> change<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
envelope here which will change the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.140 
envelope here which will change the
that's<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.010> decay<00:01:20.370> right<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:22.940> it's<00:01:23.940> on<00:01:24.120> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that's the decay right there it's on the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.860 
that's the decay right there it's on the
residents<00:01:24.690> up<00:01:25.640> it'll<00:01:26.640> change<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.570> filter

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
residents up it'll change the filter

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.960 
residents up it'll change the filter
over<00:01:28.140> time<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.340> much<00:01:29.490> time<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
over time and this is how much time it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.370 
over time and this is how much time it
will<00:01:30.060> take<00:01:30.680> three<00:01:31.680> seconds<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.050> I<00:01:34.140> lower

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
will take three seconds and if I lower

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.570 
will take three seconds and if I lower
it<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.680> way<00:01:34.830> down<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> much

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
it all the way down you get a much

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.100 
it all the way down you get a much
different<00:01:35.880> effect<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> that's<00:01:42.720> something<00:01:42.930> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
different effect so that's something you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.180 
different effect so that's something you
can<00:01:43.230> play<00:01:43.380> around<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.070> keep

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
can play around with I'm going to keep

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.460 
can play around with I'm going to keep
it<00:01:44.340> neutral<00:01:44.670> right<00:01:45.060> now

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.790 

we've<00:01:48.100> got<00:01:48.280> an<00:01:48.400> FM<00:01:48.790> oscillator<00:01:49.650> this<00:01:50.650> is

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
we've got an FM oscillator this is

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.320 
we've got an FM oscillator this is
totally<00:01:51.190> without<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.870> as<00:01:53.560> we<00:01:53.710> turn<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.100> up

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
totally without it and as we turn it up

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.850 
totally without it and as we turn it up
I'll<00:01:55.330> open<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.660> up<00:01:55.810> here<00:01:56.020> too<00:01:56.260> so<00:01:56.410> you<00:01:56.500> can<00:01:56.560> see

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
I'll open it up here too so you can see

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.700 
I'll open it up here too so you can see
it<00:01:57.330> it's<00:01:58.330> set<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.720> triangle<00:01:59.260> wave<00:01:59.410> it's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
it it's set to the triangle wave it's

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.930 
it it's set to the triangle wave it's
just<00:01:59.860> one<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.130> like<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.370> best<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.670> only<00:02:03.850> a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
just one I like the best it's only a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.850 
just one I like the best it's only a
short<00:02:04.300> time<00:02:04.360> it's<00:02:04.810> less<00:02:05.020> than<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.290> second<00:02:05.740> than

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
short time it's less than a second than

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.340 
short time it's less than a second than
it<00:02:05.950> lasts<00:02:06.340> for<00:02:06.550> her<00:02:06.870> but<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:08.020> gives<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.320> that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
it lasts for her but that gives it that

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.440 
it lasts for her but that gives it that
kind<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.710> like<00:02:08.830> barrel<00:02:09.399> sound<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.270> almost

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
kind of like barrel sound that almost

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.130 
kind of like barrel sound that almost
pluck<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:13.270> might<00:02:13.480> be<00:02:13.510> maybe<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.960> little

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
pluck to it this might be maybe a little

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:25.530 
pluck to it this might be maybe a little
much<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:17.350> can<00:02:17.440> also<00:02:17.590> tune<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:24.510> make<00:02:25.510> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
much but you can also tune it to make a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.260 
much but you can also tune it to make a
kind<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.930> cool<00:02:26.110> bass<00:02:26.320> sound<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
kind of cool bass sound for you and the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.550 
kind of cool bass sound for you and the
other<00:02:28.420> thing<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.660> put<00:02:28.810> on<00:02:28.930> here<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.320> an<00:02:29.470> hour

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
other thing I put on here is an hour

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.490 
other thing I put on here is an hour
peji<00:02:29.800> ater<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.640> LPGA<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.240> off<00:02:31.450> until<00:02:32.110> you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
peji ater so the LPGA is off until you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:43.470 
peji ater so the LPGA is off until you
turn<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.860> knob<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:42.000> maybe<00:02:43.000> play<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.390> little

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
turn the knob so maybe play it a little

00:02:43.480 --> 00:03:01.080 
turn the knob so maybe play it a little
higher<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.280> by<00:03:00.370> turning<00:03:00.430> these<00:03:00.820> knobs

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
higher so just by turning these knobs

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.490 
higher so just by turning these knobs
you<00:03:01.269> get<00:03:01.390> quite<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.660> different<00:03:02.050> sound<00:03:02.320> from

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
you get quite a different sound from

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.880 
you get quite a different sound from
this<00:03:02.769> link<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:05.290> know<00:03:05.380> that's<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.769> you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
this link and you know that's it you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.590 
this link and you know that's it you
play<00:03:06.100> around<00:03:06.280> with<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.390> how<00:03:07.540> you

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
play around with it just it to how you

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.710 
play around with it just it to how you
like<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.459> found<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.580> was<00:03:09.730> kind<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.090> useful<00:03:10.269> as

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
like I found it was kind of useful as

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.860 
like I found it was kind of useful as
like<00:03:11.050> kind<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.440> like<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> plucky<00:03:12.040> bass<00:03:12.250> sound

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.820 

it's<00:03:16.870> something<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.500> this

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.930 

okay<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:25.890> let<00:03:26.099> me<00:03:26.129> show<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.519> next<00:03:26.640> one

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
okay so let me show you the next one

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.300 
okay so let me show you the next one
here<00:03:27.150> close<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.540> sky<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.890> one<00:03:29.129> is

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
here close the sky up and this one is

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.210 
here close the sky up and this one is
the<00:03:29.430> same<00:03:29.670> exact<00:03:30.090> sample<00:03:30.599> except<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.980> one's

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the same exact sample except this one's

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:41.839 
the same exact sample except this one's
made<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.879> sound<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.390> pad<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:41.489> it's

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
made to sound more like a pad so it's

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.580 
made to sound more like a pad so it's
also<00:03:42.060> kind<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.540> noisy<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.049> that's<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.379> sound

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
also kind of noisy and that's the sound

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.080 
also kind of noisy and that's the sound
of<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.920> sample<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.519> look<00:03:44.700> there's<00:03:44.940> some

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
of the sample if you look there's some

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.270 
of the sample if you look there's some
clicks<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.660> pops<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:46.140> there

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.730 

and<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:50.270> have<00:03:50.450> control<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:50.930> where<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.319> sample

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
and you have control of where the sample

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.680 
and you have control of where the sample
starts<00:03:52.130> over<00:03:52.370> on<00:03:52.400> these<00:03:52.610> last<00:03:52.910> two<00:03:53.180> knobs<00:03:53.390> here

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
starts over on these last two knobs here

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.320 
starts over on these last two knobs here
so<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.290> move<00:03:55.069> this<00:03:55.250> over<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.670> little<00:03:55.700> bit<00:03:56.030> it's

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
so I move this over a little bit it's

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.390 
so I move this over a little bit it's
going<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.569> be<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.660> little<00:03:56.810> bit<00:03:56.959> cleaner<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.620> could

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
going to be a little bit cleaner I could

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.660 
going to be a little bit cleaner I could
change<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.790> length<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.270> samples

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.410 

if<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.150> put<00:04:06.330> these<00:04:06.480> really<00:04:07.020> tight

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
if you put these really tight

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.750 
if you put these really tight
you<00:04:08.990> get<00:04:09.140> this<00:04:09.290> kind<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.740> like<00:04:09.920> almost

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
you get this kind of like almost

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.199 
you get this kind of like almost
granular<00:04:11.420> sound<00:04:11.780> from<00:04:12.140> it<00:04:13.090> depending<00:04:14.090> on

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
granular sound from it depending on

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.949 
granular sound from it depending on
where<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:14.630> put<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.050> samples<00:04:15.700> start<00:04:16.959> there's

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
where you put the samples start there's

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.289 
where you put the samples start there's
some<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.350> noise<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.970> get<00:04:20.120> different

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
some of that noise you get different

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.900 
some of that noise you get different
sounds<00:04:21.040> maybe<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.190> first<00:04:22.310> thing<00:04:22.550> she<00:04:22.639> told

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
sounds maybe the first thing she told

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.190 
sounds maybe the first thing she told
you<00:04:23.090> is<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:23.270> there's<00:04:23.480> actually<00:04:23.810> three<00:04:23.840> of

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
you is that there's actually three of

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.590 
you is that there's actually three of
these<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.730> one<00:04:25.730> is<00:04:25.850> down<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.060> middle<00:04:26.330> and

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
these and one is down the middle and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.300 
these and one is down the middle and
what<00:04:26.750> then<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.110> other<00:04:27.230> two<00:04:27.290> app<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.770> left<00:04:28.100> and

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
what then the other two app and left and

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.879 
what then the other two app and left and
right<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:29.690> have<00:04:29.840> control<00:04:30.230> over<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.590> attack

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
right you have control over the attack

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.560 
right you have control over the attack
and<00:04:31.100> release<00:04:31.220> right<00:04:31.730> now<00:04:31.880> I've<00:04:32.030> got<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.360> long

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
and release right now I've got the long

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.180 
and release right now I've got the long
attack<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.380> could<00:04:35.440> also<00:04:36.440> have<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.860> short

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
attack but you could also have a short

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.370 
attack but you could also have a short
one<00:04:37.370> if<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.580> like<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:38.570> like<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.200> long

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
one if you like so I like the long

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.780 
one if you like so I like the long
attack<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.860> long<00:04:39.980> release<00:04:40.310> if<00:04:40.490> we're<00:04:40.639> going

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
attack and long release if we're going

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.340 
attack and long release if we're going
for<00:04:40.970> a<00:04:41.030> pad<00:04:41.240> sound<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:43.490> back<00:04:44.210> over<00:04:44.570> here<00:04:44.870> we've

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
for a pad sound so back over here we've

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.000 
for a pad sound so back over here we've
got<00:04:45.380> if<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.370> don't<00:04:46.550> like<00:04:46.729> those<00:04:47.919> you<00:04:48.919> know

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
got if you don't like those you know

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.530 
got if you don't like those you know
i'll<00:04:49.250> let<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.610> kind<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:50.000> hear<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.389> a<00:04:50.450> little

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
i'll let you kind of hear it a little

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.050 
i'll let you kind of hear it a little
better<00:04:50.780> but<00:04:50.990> if<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.169> don't<00:04:51.350> like<00:04:51.470> all<00:04:51.650> that

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
better but if you don't like all that

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.659 
better but if you don't like all that
low<00:04:53.060> kind<00:04:53.570> of<00:04:53.660> popping<00:04:54.040> sound<00:04:55.040> just<00:04:55.460> turn<00:04:55.639> up

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
low kind of popping sound just turn up

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.410 
low kind of popping sound just turn up
the<00:04:55.910> high<00:04:56.060> filter

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
the high filter

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
the high filter
and<00:04:57.930> that<00:04:58.050> cuts<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.470> stuff<00:04:58.740> out<00:04:58.860> nicely

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.450 

so<00:05:02.440> there's<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.620> little<00:05:02.710> Rumble<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.310> way

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
so there's a little Rumble that way

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.760 
so there's a little Rumble that way
which<00:05:04.389> I<00:05:04.539> decided<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:05.080> keep<00:05:05.199> in<00:05:05.440> because<00:05:05.650> you

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
which I decided to keep in because you

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.770 
which I decided to keep in because you
might<00:05:05.919> like<00:05:06.130> it<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.460> you<00:05:07.000> can<00:05:07.210> get<00:05:07.419> rid<00:05:07.599> of<00:05:07.630> it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
might like it and you can get rid of it

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.779 
might like it and you can get rid of it
entirely<00:05:08.080> by<00:05:08.410> just<00:05:08.620> moving<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:09.190> sample<00:05:09.550> start

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
entirely by just moving the sample start

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.790 
entirely by just moving the sample start
over<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:11.580> playing<00:05:12.580> with<00:05:12.759> the<00:05:12.849> filter<00:05:13.800> we've

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
over and playing with the filter we've

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.080 
over and playing with the filter we've
got<00:05:15.009> a<00:05:15.039> low-pass<00:05:15.490> filter<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:18.580> resonance

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
got a low-pass filter the resonance

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.999 
got a low-pass filter the resonance
controls<00:05:19.569> both<00:05:19.780> these<00:05:20.050> you<00:05:20.319> see<00:05:20.500> I'm<00:05:20.680> doing<00:05:20.830> a

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
controls both these you see I'm doing a

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.279 
controls both these you see I'm doing a
filter<00:05:21.400> through<00:05:21.669> eq8<00:05:22.120> right<00:05:22.449> here<00:05:22.720> that's

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
filter through eq8 right here that's

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.249 
filter through eq8 right here that's
what<00:05:23.440> we're<00:05:23.560> looking<00:05:23.889> at<00:05:23.979> over<00:05:24.970> here<00:05:26.849> just

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
what we're looking at over here just

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.089 
what we're looking at over here just
find<00:05:29.259> the<00:05:29.380> eq<00:05:29.710> eight<00:05:29.830> sounds<00:05:30.789> really<00:05:31.060> cool<00:05:32.099> so

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
find the eq eight sounds really cool so

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.300 
find the eq eight sounds really cool so
we<00:05:33.159> using<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.550> as<00:05:33.699> a<00:05:33.729> filter<00:05:34.030> today<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
we using that as a filter today the

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.980 
we using that as a filter today the
residence<00:05:36.759> is<00:05:36.909> FEX<00:05:37.360> both<00:05:37.599> of<00:05:37.750> them<00:05:37.870> at<00:05:37.930> the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
residence is FEX both of them at the

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.689 
residence is FEX both of them at the
same<00:05:38.080> time<00:05:40.169> let<00:05:41.169> me<00:05:41.440> just<00:05:41.830> close<00:05:42.220> this<00:05:42.460> guy

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
same time let me just close this guy

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.270 
same time let me just close this guy
down<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.060> bit<00:05:43.509> and<00:05:43.690> i'll<00:05:44.139> show<00:05:44.380> you<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.770> auto

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
down a bit and i'll show you the auto

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.730 
down a bit and i'll show you the auto
pan<00:05:45.930> which<00:05:46.930> I<00:05:47.110> have<00:05:47.199> here<00:05:47.229> set<00:05:47.889> up<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:48.220> do<00:05:48.400> some

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
pan which I have here set up to do some

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.190 
pan which I have here set up to do some
tremolo<00:05:50.740> basically

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
tremolo basically

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.880 
tremolo basically
so<00:05:53.390> it's<00:05:54.390> effectively<00:05:54.840> off<00:05:55.110> with<00:05:55.320> a<00:05:55.350> depth<00:05:55.650> at

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
so it's effectively off with a depth at

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.430 
so it's effectively off with a depth at
0<00:05:56.160> as<00:05:57.090> you<00:05:57.240> turn<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:57.570> up<00:05:57.690> to<00:05:57.840> get<00:05:57.990> more<00:05:58.200> and<00:05:58.380> more

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
0 as you turn it up to get more and more

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.890 
0 as you turn it up to get more and more
auto<00:05:59.430> pan<00:05:59.880> tremolo<00:06:00.710> you<00:06:01.710> want<00:06:01.890> total<00:06:02.190> tremolo

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
auto pan tremolo you want total tremolo

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.470 
auto pan tremolo you want total tremolo
put<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:04.050> phase<00:06:04.260> at<00:06:04.500> zero<00:06:04.800> or<00:06:05.100> 360<00:06:06.890> you<00:06:07.890> get<00:06:08.480> the

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
put the phase at zero or 360 you get the

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.430 
put the phase at zero or 360 you get the
unaffected<00:06:10.410> tremolo<00:06:11.100> if<00:06:11.850> you<00:06:12.090> move<00:06:12.300> this<00:06:12.540> now

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
unaffected tremolo if you move this now

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.740 
unaffected tremolo if you move this now
you<00:06:13.500> go<00:06:13.680> from<00:06:13.920> left<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.250> right<00:06:14.370> if<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.660> have

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
you go from left to right if you have

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.290 
you go from left to right if you have
headphones<00:06:15.930> on<00:06:16.290> you<00:06:16.410> can<00:06:16.560> hear<00:06:16.770> us<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.300> the
