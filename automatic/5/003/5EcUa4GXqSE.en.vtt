00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.720
Right, let's jump straight into the traffic and check how people can or can't drive

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.980
I'll try to show you some interesting situations that are worth your attention

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.960
Approaching a roundabout

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.500
Seeing such lane merging I always look in my mirrors

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.340
to check if there is no other quick vehicle coming.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.680
Fortunately this time it's clear.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.060
Now who's gonna let the lady pass the street, huh?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.260
Nobody :-(

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.860
Changing the lane - I do this as soon as possible

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.160
so nobody can run on my back.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360
Keeping an eye on the car on my left

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.340
It's a Seicento so not expecting a huge acceleration.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.240
Changing the lanes I always turn my head

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.940
since I can't fully trust the mirrors.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.360
It's a healthy habit.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520
Attention to the Citroen on the right hand

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480
she might want to turn left.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
No, she doesn't. But I want to change the lane

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.320
OK

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.620
Enough space? Enough...

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.240
Look at that

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.700
They bursted like The Red Sea in front of Moses.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
Now carefully. There is a Skoda on the right, she wants to drive her left.n.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.800
If I'll try to overtake the white van it could be tricky.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.589
So I decided to stop and wait for the clumsy Skoda driver.

00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:56.384
But it looks like he doesn't want to go.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.140
Making someone a favour you loose...

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.200
The right stop light is not working in this van

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.440
Pay attention for the back lights

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.340
It is relatively often malfunction.

00:02:20.864 --> 00:02:22.864
Which has a direct impact on us.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.980
When starting on a junction

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.640
Even If I have green light

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.240
I look left/right side

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.220
There can be a "late driver" coming

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.160
I've mentioned about it before, on my first film

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.480
I just have this habit

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250
Here we have a jam on this roundabout

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.980
because 200m in that way there are lights

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:11.060
And if there is red light over there we have a jam in here.

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:14.973
Looks like longer stop

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.160
Let's use some bike's priviledges.

00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:30.568
Nice. "I can't go any further - so are you"

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.880
The next jam. Reason?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.020
400m ahead is the roundabout. 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.460
And what is next? 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.600
LIGHTS!!!

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.460
So everybody is blocked

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.140
When filtering you must observe the right side streets

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.113
since there might be someone coming

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.080
I can't see the exact distance between cars in front of me

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.200
and there might be a gap left for someone coming from the right side

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.080
Thanks

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.240
So keep on mind this can be a potential trouble-making space

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.380
So huge attention and reduce the speed

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.040
And similar situation here from the left

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.700
because maybe THIS gap was planned for somebody else

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.460
coming from the left

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.460
We have our rights but we have many obligations as well

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.180
Approaching pedestrian crossing

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.580
I can't see now if there's somebody going so I reduce the speed

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.960
and avoiding a "surprise".

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.760
What is ths boy on a bike planning?

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.362
He is looking at me so want to drive left.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.540
And so he did. On the pedestrians crossing...

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.900
to be continued...
