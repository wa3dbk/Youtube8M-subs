00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
could just for it that's what's made for

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
could just for it that's what's made for
my<00:00:30.029> dad<00:00:30.269> bought<00:00:30.449> off<00:00:30.630> his<00:00:30.779> cousin<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.349> my

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
my dad bought off his cousin and my

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.950 
my dad bought off his cousin and my
cousin<00:00:32.579> his<00:00:32.910> cousin<00:00:33.210> said<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.480> fastest<00:00:33.809> he

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
cousin his cousin said the fastest he

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.930 
cousin his cousin said the fastest he
went<00:00:34.140> was<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.590> hundred<00:00:35.370> kilometers<00:00:35.760> per<00:00:35.880> hour

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
went was a hundred kilometers per hour

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.720 
went was a hundred kilometers per hour
so<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.890> think<00:00:37.890> that's<00:00:38.070> 80<00:00:38.250> miles<00:00:38.460> per<00:00:38.550> hour
