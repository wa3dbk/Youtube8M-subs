 here it is very natural duration simply with no glitter 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:24.710
 too coarse 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.550
 so for those who don't like the lacquered effect, the effect is too bright 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.559
 they are a bit of contact us to accept 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.289
 internet carella

 I'm not the mclaren I'm not long lasting I'm not really 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.199
 hunter duration 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.460
 but in fact 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.930
 but turin on normal buckets that make it so much 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.660
 the only certain thing is that as long as it has it very particular done so for 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.460
 all types 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.369
 in this camber 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:42.169
 you have to click 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.330
 why smart 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.499
 turn the lipstick in a strange way then you risk breaking akita opertine 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.099
 you spray yourself to fit it in the wrong way tight models competence 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.279
 so you have to attack that the camber is on the right side 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.279
 and in this way it will close perfectly 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.129
 the only flaw is this 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:07.690
 as you are there are the ingredients and as usual all deborah products 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:09.439
