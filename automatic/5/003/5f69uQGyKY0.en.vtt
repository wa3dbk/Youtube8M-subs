00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
 it's worth little we go fifth we're here 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.170
 a race which there are many super 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.850
 jumps so eye more flashes but 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.050

 one hundred because it is worth more and ninth more fall 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.350
 perfect ok I'm going by let's third is the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.780
 First, it's worth, do not fear before, you can 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.420
 to have before psychology viagra is worth when 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 points are 34 control points and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 I think it's all full of jumps or that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.100
 it seems like you look at the moment 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.100
 partner 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.460
 I hit me and not come or joke 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.070
 how it arrived I do not get uncle seriously 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.519
 worth the key is to start the race the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.519
 key to life 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.580
 but and now I hit the ramp on 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.759
 serious uncle, yes, that pisses me off 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.460
 very much but very much I do not lose the 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.240
 I lose I lose to see the first one 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.740
 the first one, and nothing I say now 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.409
 It gives the ramp because I was always 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.479
 against her because I do not know but that's how they are 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.630
 the ramps guys someday well and others 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.630
 days 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.470
 let's go let's go 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.590
 I do not know what happens seeing the start the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.360
 race because the ramp was a bit 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.550
 farruca then the restart for 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.289
 that this way it goes up so it's worth 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.880
 Wait, I have a plan to go back and 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.330
 that's not cool anymore so let's go 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.280
 sixth 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.960
 we go sixth and we go to those of caÃ±itas 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.119
 because to see if now the ramp is not seen 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.220
 there I can skip a pretty detail 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.780
 unique on his part of this one 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.060
 I wanted to give him so I do not know anything but 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.369
 finally the last possibility 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.880
 because if we can calmly do 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.739
 well we jump wei wei wei ok let's fall 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.870

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.989

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.370
 so much are they having to for that same 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.980

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.030
 someone comes seeing question and how 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.860
 why but the word for not turning 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.180

 without shitting it doing everything 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.360
 it's perfectly worth we put on 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.200
 first 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.970

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.310

 too much is too high 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.570
 the key is to change the slipstream is the 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.950
 key guys to see if with a little 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.290

 the smack that waits for him to arrive 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.990
 he does not know 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:55.520
 for the boy the key is standing on 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:58.520
 Come on, come on, come on, guys. 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.520
 companions 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.889
 have felt is accelerates payments come on 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.810
 we let it worth worthless uncle 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.400
 It does not accelerate uncle mikkawi 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.720
 it is difficult to choose the slipstream book that 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.470
 analyzed step even more effectively 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.810
 appear in plan to face the 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.220
 it's worth braking we let it pass 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.190
 I had a partner thank you thank you 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.389
 to see if now we are going to see guys you have 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.990
 it does not come out we're going to press a little 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.880
 let's go to spaces you have to leave space 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:32.630
 so as not to hit anything, I have it 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:35.560
 than looking for someone to run what 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.460
 same as me as for example about 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.000
 Now I think we'll catch it 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.900
 just at the moment in which it is 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.900
 jumping and we're going to hit him 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.090
 eye eye I want you the volt and that is 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.500
 my savior the volt and that if it's my 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.200
 damn savior I love you mister of the bowl 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.090
 title I swear that it was given or the added 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.090
 play now that uncle is a machine 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:06.290
 but what do people do we are going to try 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.730
 throw him so the uncle does not call and 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.350
 it's perfect we throw it away and now 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.220
 we look for guys let's see if what 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.720
 we get because the one that has been 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.550
 stayed still and to catch the first 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.200
 it's going to be impossible basically 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.270
 good is worth the first one leads to finish 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.790
 the first one is going to finish playing 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.280
 that jump here we go a lot of battle 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.260
 jump did not reach the club hugo to the limit to 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.900
 limit did not arrive ten minutes needed 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.210
 God, I need the slipstream of Adjame 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.020
 load additive more I do not know how to say it 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.250
 God 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:36.229
 to the limit we are going to make the last 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.210
 I turn left to pick up 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.550
 the left side of the building 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.680
 and now we take the point that is here 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.479
 down that appears the idea madryn lad 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.280
 How do I look for Carlos's solutions? 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.470
 Valdez can be the point of what is 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.180
 around here so we'll end I think 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.259
 let's go let third parties want some 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.949
 everything really is that the race has been 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:53.949
 very difficult 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.960
 kid 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:04.280
 No way I go through here or joke or 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.590
 of cogna 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:16.539
 Padilla potencies entornada legal then 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:16.539
 it was complicated by the half torn 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:25.260
 the question and my house does not win my house 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.260
 my house can not if it's not worth worth 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.570
 above 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.099
 and I say one kid the other who came for 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.419
 up or down and time and almost 

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:43.139
 stuck gave to finally I get everything 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.139
 so fast
