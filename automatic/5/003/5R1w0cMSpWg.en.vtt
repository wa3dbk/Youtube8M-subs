00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.750
 hello everyone I'm hector and today I come 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.320
 I come to show you a build like 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.180
 alternative archon or to the acm the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.240
 freeze 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.150
 we'll call this guild black eyes 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.280
 which will consist of ice damage 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.680
 basically 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.810
 here we see that we have main beam 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.610
 of ice with the rune of the frozen ground 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.550
 what it will do is that the monsters 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.790
 leave a trail die side after 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.710
 secondary school we have 20 with the increase of 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.760
 damage area the ruin is approaching the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.620
 winter 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.840
 here we have cider the hydra of ice 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.510
 and drawings we have familiar with generator 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.420
 to increase the magic weapon dps with 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.790
 bloody magic to recover life at 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.739
 damage enemies and armor 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.630
 storm that what it will do is that when 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.159
 we receive a body body attack or 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.830
 distance increases us the speed of 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.860
 movement then we have the skills 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.880
 passive that are astral presence that we 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.909
 increases the maximum arcane and two points of 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.040
 regeneration of arcane power per second 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.410
 then ice in the veins will comment a 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.899
 20% all damage inflicted objects 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.380
 frozen and frozen and craving for power 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.149
 what he will do is 30 power points 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.540
 arcane every time we pick up a sphere 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.980
 of health 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.560
 It is worth as you see the return is in Canada 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.330
 to the damage by ice basically both the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.660
 main as the secondary as the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.040
 ivy all faced the damage by 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.220
 ice 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.680
 but we will also need equipment 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.470
 have arcane power equipped by 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.030
 critical hit here I am playing 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.370
 no monsters power since my team 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.250
 it will not allow me 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.650
 play in pm jumps but more or less to 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.920
 so that you have an idea of ​​how it is 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.920
 the Web 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 the process once in the middle of the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.970
 fight would be to throw the conjuration bufos 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.420
 of familiar magic weapon and armor of the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.760
 storm and once the bufos 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.760
 hydra meteorite and ice beam 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.180
 so let's practice to see what 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.569
 such we go to beautiful fields by 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.569
 example 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.920
 we launch groups 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.280
 here we already see a group we launched cider 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.340
 ice radio blizzard 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.750
 and will say if they are few, you do not need 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 blizzard is in itself 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.130
 we find a large group we are going to 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.650
 burst right away with blizzard and here 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.050
 the area is we have put the rune that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.560
 increases the area in which it affects 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.560
 blizzard 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.090
 is that having no monster power 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.720
 Well, we are not going to find a group of 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.720
 big enemies 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.070
 that has been a failure in the truth 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.070
 to see if we find something here 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.400
 let out 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.220
 well I have put pm 1 because if I have not 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.470
 realized that to get into fields 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.140
 We missed the same density 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.040
 of monsters 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.480
 if we meet some small buffon 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.430
 we had found a hydra group 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.430
 blizzard and lightning from the sky 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.519
 We continue to launch cider and take care of 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:15.310
 kill the bugs another group leads 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.199
 dentist and ice failure this is 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.199
 basically the process to follow 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.419
 having everything focused on the damage by 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.900
 ice because the damage it does is a 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.900
 barbarity 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.110
 with a good team can replace me 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.110
 I see perfectly talk with d 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.820
 then we find the crypt of the 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.820
 ancestors to see what is in sight 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.569
 groups and draft industry and radio 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.440
 we continue to release 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:27.330
 and I recommend having the resistance over 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.860
 500 or 600 or even more since not 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.580
 have a diamond skin or anything that we 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.490
 increase the resistances because if we 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.620
 they give a strong blow because possibly of 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.620
 several touches leave us ends 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:53.669
 we keep going around different 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.669
 map areas now in lion mansion 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.639
 what we have here 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.460
 if you could see me now 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.390
 and well this is basically what you 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.370
 I wanted to teach an alternative life to 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:06.370
 archon as I said before 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:10.449
 and to freeze I think it's pretty 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.160
 effective if we have a good team and 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:17.130
 this is all for my part I hope that you 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.130
 like and greetings all goodbye
