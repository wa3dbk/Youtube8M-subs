00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
whatever so there was a nice big pile of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.710 
whatever so there was a nice big pile of
rocks<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:38.910> these<00:01:39.000> big<00:01:39.210> rocks<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.630> were

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
rocks see all these big rocks they were

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
rocks see all these big rocks they were
all<00:01:39.840> laying<00:01:40.050> in<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> middle<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.979> thought

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
all laying in the middle so I thought

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
all laying in the middle so I thought
I'd<00:01:41.369> move<00:01:41.520> them<00:01:41.760> maybe<00:01:42.270> blow<00:01:42.570> off<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> bedrock

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
I'd move them maybe blow off the bedrock

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.930 
I'd move them maybe blow off the bedrock
maybe<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.560> find<00:01:43.800> some<00:01:43.950> gold<00:01:44.160> layin<00:01:44.460> Anna<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
maybe I find some gold layin Anna I

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.910 
maybe I find some gold layin Anna I
don't<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.330> well<00:01:46.050> as<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> big<00:01:46.680> rocks

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
don't know well as I got the big rocks

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.600 
don't know well as I got the big rocks
out<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.220> way<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.340> realize<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.280> it's<00:01:50.280> clay

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
out of the way I realize it is it's clay

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.550 
out of the way I realize it is it's clay
it<00:01:51.060> takes<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.360> long<00:01:51.570> time<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.140> build<00:01:52.260> up<00:01:52.380> these

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it takes a long time to build up these

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
it takes a long time to build up these
clay<00:01:52.800> bags<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.369> pocket<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.180> pile<00:01:54.869> or

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
clay bags so this pocket or pile or

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.139 
clay bags so this pocket or pile or
whatever's<00:01:55.619> been<00:01:55.830> here<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.490> number<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
whatever's been here for a number of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.550 
whatever's been here for a number of
years<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.750> every<00:01:57.869> time<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.170> floods<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
years and every time it floods it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.080 
years and every time it floods it
probably<00:01:58.979> drops<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.700> bold<00:01:59.910> in

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
probably drops a little more bold in

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.600 
probably drops a little more bold in
here<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:00.540> mean<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:01.860> drop<00:02:02.100> right<00:02:02.340> here

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
here I mean it's a good drop right here

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.060 
here I mean it's a good drop right here
I<00:02:02.729> mean<00:02:03.229> force<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> gold<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.800> let's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
I mean force the gold there let's

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.969 
I mean force the gold there let's
protect<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.960> digging<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.590> I've<00:02:07.800> done

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
protect so I'm digging in here I've done

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.609 
protect so I'm digging in here I've done
like<00:02:08.130> three<00:02:08.310> shovel<00:02:08.759> fulls<00:02:08.970> for<00:02:09.450> about<00:02:10.410> three

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
like three shovel fulls for about three

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.740 
like three shovel fulls for about three
happenings<00:02:11.209> forgetting<00:02:12.209> about<00:02:12.270> three<00:02:12.510> little

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
happenings forgetting about three little

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.900 
happenings forgetting about three little
bits<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.050> piece<00:02:13.260> but<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.130> still<00:02:14.310> going<00:02:14.550> down

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
bits of piece but it's still going down

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.540 
bits of piece but it's still going down
so<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.360> possible<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:16.260> mean<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.400> is

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
so it's possible I mean this is this is

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.850 
so it's possible I mean this is this is
a<00:02:17.580> wide-open<00:02:18.330> drop<00:02:18.840> right<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.739> it's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
a wide-open drop right here so it's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.410 
a wide-open drop right here so it's
probably<00:02:19.980> been<00:02:20.280> cleaned<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.670> thousand<00:02:21.209> times

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
probably been cleaned a thousand times

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.300 
probably been cleaned a thousand times
but<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.470> hasn't<00:02:22.620> been<00:02:22.709> cleaned<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.130> while

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
but it hasn't been cleaned in a while

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.000 
but it hasn't been cleaned in a while
that's<00:02:23.610> where<00:02:23.790> all<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:23.940> clay<00:02:24.270> builds<00:02:24.660> up

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
that's where all that clay builds up

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.860 
that's where all that clay builds up
it's<00:02:26.010> been<00:02:26.250> here<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:26.850> been<00:02:27.090> building<00:02:27.420> up<00:02:27.660> for

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
it's been here it's been building up for

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.150 
it's been here it's been building up for
a<00:02:27.930> long<00:02:28.110> time<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.680> maybe<00:02:28.830> I'll<00:02:29.010> get<00:02:29.100> lucky

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
a long time so maybe I'll get lucky

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.699 
a long time so maybe I'll get lucky
maybe<00:02:29.580> there'll<00:02:29.850> be<00:02:29.880> something<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.269> there<00:02:30.450> and

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
maybe there'll be something in there and

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.039 
maybe there'll be something in there and
you<00:02:31.709> know<00:02:31.799> all<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.070> got<00:02:32.220> out<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.459> last

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
you know all that got out of that last

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.330 
you know all that got out of that last
crevasse<00:02:34.049> was<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.650> nugget<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.130> then<00:02:35.250> I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
crevasse was just that nugget and then I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.890 
crevasse was just that nugget and then I
got<00:02:35.489> three<00:02:35.730> little<00:02:35.910> bits<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.360> was<00:02:36.510> it

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
got three little bits that was it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.870 
got three little bits that was it
because<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> water<00:02:37.830> moves<00:02:38.070> too<00:02:38.280> fast<00:02:38.310> for<00:02:38.850> a

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
because the water moves too fast for a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.110 
because the water moves too fast for a
small<00:02:39.090> hole<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.330> drop<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:40.519> this<00:02:41.519> here<00:02:41.910> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
small hole to drop in there this here I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.910 
small hole to drop in there this here I
don't<00:02:42.180> know<00:02:42.390> I'm<00:02:43.170> only<00:02:43.350> digging<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.769> because

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
don't know I'm only digging it because

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.949 
don't know I'm only digging it because
that<00:02:44.010> clays<00:02:44.280> there<00:02:44.549> is<00:02:44.970> piled<00:02:45.360> up<00:02:45.540> there<00:02:45.720> so

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
that clays there is piled up there so

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.350 
that clays there is piled up there so
it's<00:02:46.110> been<00:02:46.320> here<00:02:46.560> awhile<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.000> you'll<00:02:48.180> see

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
it's been here awhile and you'll see

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.400 
it's been here awhile and you'll see
what<00:02:48.480> comes<00:02:48.690> out<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.170> maybe<00:02:49.680> nothing<00:02:49.920> I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
what comes out of it maybe nothing I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.600 
what comes out of it maybe nothing I
think<00:02:52.410> I'm<00:02:52.620> gonna<00:02:52.739> call<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.070> quits<00:02:53.100> I've<00:02:53.489> been

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
think I'm gonna call it quits I've been

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.350 
think I'm gonna call it quits I've been
on

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.390 

as<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.050> can<00:02:57.200> see<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.440> water<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.770> really<00:02:57.980> kind

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
as you can see the water is really kind

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.330 
as you can see the water is really kind
of<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.760> little<00:02:59.209> too<00:02:59.390> strong<00:02:59.690> for<00:02:59.959> privacy<00:03:00.470> you

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
of a little too strong for privacy you

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.740 
of a little too strong for privacy you
know<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.550> can't<00:03:01.849> really<00:03:02.060> see<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.569> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
know you can't really see in the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.160 
know you can't really see in the
crevices<00:03:03.379> they<00:03:04.450> can't<00:03:05.450> do<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.959> probably

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
crevices they can't do that you probably

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.540 
crevices they can't do that you probably
wouldn't<00:03:06.650> public<00:03:08.860> some<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.980> these<00:03:10.040> smaller

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
wouldn't public some of these smaller

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.460 
wouldn't public some of these smaller
stuff<00:03:10.910> might<00:03:11.150> been<00:03:11.360> familiar<00:03:11.599> when<00:03:12.080> I<00:03:12.170> sluice

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
stuff might been familiar when I sluice

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.380 
stuff might been familiar when I sluice
and<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.739> don't<00:03:12.800> remember<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:14.000> that's<00:03:14.150> that

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and I don't remember but that's that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.110 
and I don't remember but that's that
booger<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.750> got<00:03:15.019> today<00:03:15.489> that's<00:03:16.489> probably<00:03:17.030> a

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
booger I got today that's probably a

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.630 
booger I got today that's probably a
point<00:03:17.420> six<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.110> don't<00:03:18.470> know<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:19.220> was<00:03:19.340> worth<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
point six I don't know it was worth the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.140 
point six I don't know it was worth the
day<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.849> me<00:03:20.380> it's<00:03:21.380> $25<00:03:22.130> nugget<00:03:22.549> can't<00:03:22.760> complain

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
day to me it's $25 nugget can't complain

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.710 
day to me it's $25 nugget can't complain
which<00:03:23.750> everyday<00:03:24.140> was<00:03:24.319> that<00:03:24.470> good<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:26.180> I'm

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
which everyday was that good so I'm

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.449 
which everyday was that good so I'm
really<00:03:26.930> kind<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.380> waiting<00:03:27.709> until<00:03:27.890> this<00:03:28.160> water

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
really kind of waiting until this water

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.140 
really kind of waiting until this water
recedes<00:03:28.970> someone<00:03:29.680> maybe<00:03:30.680> by<00:03:30.950> milla<00:03:31.640> next<00:03:31.970> week

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
recedes someone maybe by milla next week

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.580 
recedes someone maybe by milla next week
it'll<00:03:32.360> be<00:03:32.450> about<00:03:32.720> half<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:32.989> what<00:03:33.349> it's<00:03:33.500> doing

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it'll be about half of what it's doing

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.229 
it'll be about half of what it's doing
right<00:03:33.829> now

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
right now

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.699 
right now
when<00:03:35.239> I<00:03:35.329> get<00:03:35.510> into<00:03:35.720> these<00:03:35.810> crevasses<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:36.590> I
