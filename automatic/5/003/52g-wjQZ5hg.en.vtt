00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
fighting games in 2011 upon that which

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.920 
fighting games in 2011 upon that which
was<00:01:09.620> amazing<00:01:09.830> marvel<00:01:10.280> vs<00:01:10.490> capcom<00:01:10.520> 3<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.660> how

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
was amazing marvel vs capcom 3 so how

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.720 
was amazing marvel vs capcom 3 so how
about<00:01:12.080> five<00:01:12.470> really<00:01:13.070> does<00:01:13.250> pale<00:01:13.520> in

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
about five really does pale in

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.790 
about five really does pale in
comparison<00:01:13.930> really<00:01:14.930> when<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.170> break<00:01:15.620> it<00:01:15.650> down

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
comparison really when you break it down

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.590 
comparison really when you break it down
and<00:01:16.250> think<00:01:16.460> about<00:01:16.550> it<00:01:16.730> it's<00:01:17.030> fighting<00:01:17.420> with

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
and think about it it's fighting with

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.270 
and think about it it's fighting with
swords<00:01:17.810> well<00:01:18.320> no<00:01:18.409> that<00:01:18.620> was<00:01:18.740> always<00:01:19.040> what<00:01:19.190> it

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
swords well no that was always what it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.860 
swords well no that was always what it
was<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:19.460> thought<00:01:19.760> it<00:01:19.940> was<00:01:20.060> maybe<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.720> reason

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
was I thought it was maybe the reason

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.870 
was I thought it was maybe the reason
why<00:01:21.170> i<00:01:21.500> don't<00:01:21.890> think<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.159> absolute<00:01:22.610> shit

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
why i don't think it's absolute shit

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.790 
why i don't think it's absolute shit
because<00:01:23.300> i've<00:01:23.510> never<00:01:23.780> played<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.080> soul<00:01:24.409> calibur
