00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.290
 good afternoon alexei well would you like 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.059
 start with a question like from 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.630
 different is for you to play in tournaments 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.450
 individual or by team 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.440
 it turns out that lately I play much more 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.640
 team tournaments 15 the same as clear 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.160
 entities to earn a living you have to 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.900
 play the best tournaments in the world and 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.279
 There, they do not invite me a problem. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.410
 then and while the same time 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.480
 when you put in the quick clickers by 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.270
 example where it is removed that in the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.910
 Russian league is when this normal way of 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.800
 daisy then I'm already very 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.649
 used to playing with good equipment 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.750
 this year we have won the Russian league and for 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.890
 I'm here with this same team 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.140
 if it's going to go well 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.450
 how would you rate the particular result 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.880
 of your departure today how are you doing 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:04.680
 to the good team the kit directly 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.680
 but we wanted to win 6 to 0 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.460
 I can give up to 15 years 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.040
 like 15 years ago that you do not stop at 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.080
 a part cancer therapy good today 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.260
 he has given another surprise of his life 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.630
 so I think this is all 51 is 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.850
 normal 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.579
 and I've seen that my rival is not 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.799
 pretty hard that sometimes has all done 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.409
 with strong players with black without 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.659
 Temptation has also seemed very 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.630
 serious and I think that played more or less well 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.130
 but maybe at some point you have to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 look for a more forced approach than 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 required 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.720
 strategic prison and I think so 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.909
 he was also pretty mind in this field 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.890
 and I'm also happy has a 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.720
 move 41 and it 's continuation because 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.209
 I can continue more strategically 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.700
 but I've seen that win so 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.039
 tactics and I found it more interesting yes 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.490
 and finally you could talk to us about your 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.310
 prospects for the tournament 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.619
 well I think the favorites 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.620
 The main ones are, of course, the team 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.050
 of playing and also this new team of 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.780
 italy but we are also going to 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.050
 fight is that in this format any 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.120
 thing can happen everything depends on a 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.010
 particular result 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.990
 if we win some more important 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.030
 we will have more chances to win 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.670
 perfect very much because we are going to 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.110
 try us even though I know that we 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.190
 we are not strangers to the favorites 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.650
 but we are going to try 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.770
 the death many thanks and very many 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.770
 luck
