the second fattest state let's go it's

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.099 
the second fattest state let's go it's
right<00:00:29.560> up<00:00:29.710> there<00:00:29.859> 30<00:00:30.369> percent<00:00:30.970> are<00:00:31.119> obese<00:00:31.359> not

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
even overweight obese they don't eat a

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.850 
even overweight obese they don't eat a
lot<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.360> they<00:00:34.780> don't<00:00:34.930> eat<00:00:35.050> well<00:00:35.260> in<00:00:35.440> Alabama

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
lot and they don't eat well in Alabama

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.130 
lot and they don't eat well in Alabama
no<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.700> believe<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.510> fattest<00:00:37.870> state<00:00:37.989> is

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
no I believe the fattest state is

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.840 
no I believe the fattest state is
Mississippi<00:00:38.649> so<00:00:38.950> you<00:00:39.040> get<00:00:39.309> a<00:00:39.340> sense<00:00:39.579> of<00:00:39.730> the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
Mississippi so you get a sense of the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.370 
Mississippi so you get a sense of the
trend<00:00:40.180> that's<00:00:40.420> going<00:00:40.510> on<00:00:40.809> I<00:00:40.930> thought<00:00:41.200> we<00:00:41.290> were

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
trend that's going on I thought we were

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.260 
trend that's going on I thought we were
going<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.739> Texas<00:00:42.190> yeah<00:00:42.700> no<00:00:42.910> I<00:00:42.940> think<00:00:43.030> it's

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
going with to Texas yeah no I think it's

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.389 
going with to Texas yeah no I think it's
Mississippi<00:00:43.630> Texas<00:00:43.840> too<00:00:44.260> large<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.800> it's<00:00:45.250> got

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
Mississippi Texas too large and it's got

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.160 
Mississippi Texas too large and it's got
Austin<00:00:45.880> or<00:00:46.059> there's<00:00:46.390> liberals<00:00:46.899> who<00:00:47.020> eat

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
healthy and give them money which is how

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.530 
healthy and give them money which is how
by<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.650> way<00:01:20.799> most<00:01:21.040> states<00:01:21.400> do<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.880> not

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
by the way most states do it and not

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.060 
by the way most states do it and not
some<00:01:23.200> states<00:01:23.439> do<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.650> that<00:01:23.770> way<00:01:23.890> some

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
some states do it that way some

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.770 
some states do it that way some
companies<00:01:24.490> do<00:01:24.640> it<00:01:24.760> that<00:01:24.939> way<00:01:25.090> but<00:01:25.510> when<00:01:25.659> you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
companies do it that way but when you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.380 
companies do it that way but when you
penalize<00:01:26.350> people<00:01:26.380> for<00:01:26.799> how<00:01:27.070> they<00:01:27.250> look<00:01:27.549> that's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
penalize people for how they look that's

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.429 
penalize people for how they look that's
certainly<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.810> perception<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.350> people

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
certainly the perception that people

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.160 
certainly the perception that people
have<00:01:29.680> man<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:31.210> doesn't<00:01:31.630> sit<00:01:31.810> right<00:01:31.840> with<00:01:32.020> a

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
have man that doesn't sit right with a

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.420 
have man that doesn't sit right with a
lot<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.439> folks<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.740> doesn't<00:01:32.799> sit<00:01:33.159> right<00:01:33.189> with

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
lot of folks it doesn't sit right with

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.520 
lot of folks it doesn't sit right with
me<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.729> by<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.210> way<00:01:34.390> also<00:01:34.659> remember<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.380> it

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
me and by the way also remember that it

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.499 
me and by the way also remember that it
is<00:01:35.650> partly<00:01:36.130> genetic<00:01:36.610> some<00:01:36.939> people<00:01:37.180> really

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
is partly genetic some people really

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.080 
is partly genetic some people really
can't<00:01:37.780> do<00:01:37.900> anything<00:01:37.930> about<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:40.030> you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
can't do anything about it and now you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.300 
can't do anything about it and now you
