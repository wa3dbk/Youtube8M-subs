00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.240 
fusion theme this is the custom slider
now<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.229> messed<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.920> slider

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
now I think it messed up my slider

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.569 
now I think it messed up my slider
because<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.439> mini<00:01:58.439> slider<00:01:58.860> mod<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
because I have the mini slider mod that

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
because I have the mini slider mod that
i<00:01:59.610> downloaded<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.390> showed<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.719> my<00:02:00.750> last

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
i downloaded and showed in my last

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.380 
i downloaded and showed in my last
couple<00:02:01.649> videos<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.790> that's<00:02:02.969> probably<00:02:03.149> why<00:02:03.329> it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
couple videos so that's probably why it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.709 
couple videos so that's probably why it
messes<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.930> text<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.670> overall<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.360> team

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
messes up the text but overall this team

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.749 
messes up the text but overall this team
doesn't<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.259> mod<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.950> icons<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
doesn't a mod the icons but it

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.729 
doesn't a mod the icons but it
definitely<00:02:08.940> adds<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.599> cool<00:02:10.020> wallpaper

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
definitely adds a really cool wallpaper

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.030 
definitely adds a really cool wallpaper
and<00:02:11.099> status<00:02:11.459> bar<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
and status bar and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.039 
and status bar and
I<00:02:13.099> really<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.120> it's<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.480> simple<00:02:14.840> theme

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
I really just like it's a simple theme

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.740 
I really just like it's a simple theme
because<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.500> icons<00:02:15.950> from<00:02:16.640> on<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.000> iphone<00:02:17.510> are

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750
