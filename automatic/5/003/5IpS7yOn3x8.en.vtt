00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
I stumbled across the weaving that was

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.749

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
called selling yarns which actually

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.320 
called selling yarns which actually
explored<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> idea<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.890> indigenous<00:01:53.580> textiles

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
explored the idea of indigenous textiles

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.840 
explored the idea of indigenous textiles
including<00:01:54.929> a<00:01:55.619> whole<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.490> weaving

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
including a whole lot about the weaving

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.770 
including a whole lot about the weaving
it<00:01:57.090> took<00:01:57.539> me<00:01:57.780> until<00:01:57.960> last<00:01:58.590> year<00:01:59.240> to<00:02:00.240> finally

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it took me until last year to finally

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
it took me until last year to finally
come<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.860> concept<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.729> thought

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
come up with a concept that I thought

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.440 
come up with a concept that I thought
might<00:02:03.360> actually<00:02:03.569> work<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:05.429> was<00:02:05.789> pretty<00:02:06.060> clear

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
might actually work it was pretty clear

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.109 
might actually work it was pretty clear
to<00:02:06.659> me<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> any<00:02:07.229> sort<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.799> product<00:02:08.429> idea<00:02:08.880> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
to me that any sort of product idea that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.770 
to me that any sort of product idea that
required<00:02:09.979> replication<00:02:10.979> or<00:02:11.160> duplication<00:02:11.940> just

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
required replication or duplication just

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.870 
required replication or duplication just
wouldn't<00:02:13.049> be<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.290> interest<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:14.010> weavers

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
wouldn't be of interest for the weavers

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.300 
wouldn't be of interest for the weavers
to<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:16.200> idea<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.709> we've<00:02:16.890> come<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.160> with

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
to do the idea that we've come up with

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.090 
to do the idea that we've come up with
is<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.030> provide<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.720> weavers<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> frame

bush finding the right pandanus plants

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.440 
bush finding the right pandanus plants
then<00:02:55.769> selecting<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.370> right<00:02:56.549> leaves<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.239> use

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
of the pandanus tree can be used because

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.940 
of the pandanus tree can be used because
they're<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.510> longest<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.350> straightest

they're the longest and the straightest

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.130 
they're the longest and the straightest
then<00:03:05.670> they<00:03:05.850> all<00:03:06.000> have<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.299> get<00:03:06.450> stripped<00:03:06.870> which

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
then they all have to get stripped which

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.759 
then they all have to get stripped which
is<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.370> difficult<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.090> do<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.569> had<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.170> number<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
is so difficult to do I had a number of

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.430 
is so difficult to do I had a number of
turns<00:03:11.220> when<00:03:11.670> we<00:03:11.790> were<00:03:11.880> up<00:03:12.000> there<00:03:12.230> recently<00:03:13.230> of

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
turns when we were up there recently of

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440 
turns when we were up there recently of
trying<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:14.010> actually<00:03:14.190> work<00:03:14.549> out<00:03:14.760> how<00:03:15.120> this

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
trying to actually work out how this

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.449 
trying to actually work out how this
stripping<00:03:15.810> process<00:03:16.410> occurred<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:19.250> feel<00:03:20.250> that

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
stripping process occurred I feel that

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.309 
stripping process occurred I feel that
we've<00:03:20.639> been<00:03:21.319> extremely<00:03:22.319> privileged<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:23.340> gain

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
we've been extremely privileged to gain

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.550 
we've been extremely privileged to gain
some<00:03:25.319> insight<00:03:25.560> into<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.940> woman's<00:03:27.720> incredible

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
some insight into the woman's incredible

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.190 
some insight into the woman's incredible
culture<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.280> their<00:03:29.400> traditions<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.359> that

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
culture and their traditions and that

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.349 
culture and their traditions and that
we're<00:03:31.350> extremely<00:03:31.739> fortunate<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.549> they<00:03:32.940> have

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
we're extremely fortunate that they have

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.259 
we're extremely fortunate that they have
actually<00:03:33.690> embraced<00:03:34.109> this<00:03:34.440> project<00:03:35.340> they<00:03:35.880> work

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
actually embraced this project they work

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.710 
actually embraced this project they work
together<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:37.109> they<00:03:37.530> share<00:03:37.950> stories<00:03:38.549> and

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
together but they share stories and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.960 
together but they share stories and
laugh<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.709> guess<00:03:41.340> it's<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.609> sort<00:03:41.910> of

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
laugh and I guess it's that sort of

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.730 
laugh and I guess it's that sort of
communication<00:03:42.840> whilst<00:03:43.109> work

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
communication whilst work

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.950 
communication whilst work
which<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.130> such<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.820> lovely<00:03:45.120> thing<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.810> be<00:03:45.930> a

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
which is such a lovely thing to be a

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.220 
which is such a lovely thing to be a
part<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:47.000> in<00:03:48.000> terms<00:03:48.240> of<00:03:48.420> where<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.600> see<00:03:48.960> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
part of in terms of where I see the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.350 
part of in terms of where I see the
collaboration<00:03:49.710> going<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.820> lampshade

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
collaboration going the lampshade

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.230 
collaboration going the lampshade
project<00:03:51.900> your<00:03:52.560> turbo<00:03:52.980> dialer<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.640> really<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
project your turbo dialer is really the

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.950 
project your turbo dialer is really the
beginning<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:55.050> our<00:03:55.520> collaboration<00:03:56.960> we're

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
beginning of our collaboration we're

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.470 
beginning of our collaboration we're
also<00:03:58.710> starting<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.730> work<00:03:59.850> on<00:04:00.060> some<00:04:00.330> other

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
also starting to work on some other

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.950 
also starting to work on some other
ideas<00:04:01.260> which<00:04:02.040> build<00:04:02.820> upon<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.330> sort<00:04:03.930> of

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
ideas which build upon this sort of

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.410 
ideas which build upon this sort of
concept<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:05.040> guess<00:04:05.280> what<00:04:05.490> we<00:04:05.670> kind<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.090> ended

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
concept if I guess what we kind of ended

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.250 
concept if I guess what we kind of ended
up<00:04:06.570> calling<00:04:06.930> art<00:04:07.380> products<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.260> recognizing

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
up calling art products so recognizing

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.930 
up calling art products so recognizing
the<00:04:10.350> fact<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.740> each<00:04:10.920> one<00:04:11.220> was<00:04:11.460> a<00:04:11.490> unique

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
the fact that each one was a unique

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.600 
the fact that each one was a unique
piece<00:04:12.300> but<00:04:12.840> there<00:04:13.080> was<00:04:13.260> no<00:04:13.520> duplication<00:04:14.520> or

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
piece but there was no duplication or

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.310 
piece but there was no duplication or
replication<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.720> we've<00:04:15.930> got<00:04:16.080> some<00:04:16.230> other

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
replication and we've got some other

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.289 
replication and we've got some other
really<00:04:16.770> exciting<00:04:16.890> ideas<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:18.060> we're<00:04:18.180> going

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
really exciting ideas that we're going

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.090 
really exciting ideas that we're going
to<00:04:18.450> start<00:04:18.690> working<00:04:18.840> on<00:04:19.170> with<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.739> women<00:04:19.980> as

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
to start working on with the women as

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.520 
to start working on with the women as
well<00:04:20.310> as<00:04:20.420> refining<00:04:21.420> the<00:04:21.600> lampshades<00:04:22.170> and

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
well as refining the lampshades and

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.830 
well as refining the lampshades and
seeing<00:04:23.070> what<00:04:23.220> else<00:04:23.250> sort<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:23.820> transpires<00:04:24.480> out

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
seeing what else sort of transpires out

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.070 
seeing what else sort of transpires out
of<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.050> lampshade<00:04:25.530> project
