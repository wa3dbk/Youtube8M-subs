00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
I think he would have an overall 81 with

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.909 
I think he would have an overall 81 with
a<00:00:27.589> right-wing<00:00:28.070> card<00:00:28.659> his<00:00:29.659> pace<00:00:29.929> it<00:00:30.230> would<00:00:30.769> be

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
fourth-best key because it is to others

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.140 
fourth-best key because it is to others
first<00:04:17.620> as<00:04:17.799> much<00:04:17.979> Laurentiis<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.639> others<00:04:18.970> who

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
first as much Laurentiis to others who

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
transport and I think he is the fourth

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.390 
transport and I think he is the fourth
best

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
best

a<00:04:42.900> correct<00:04:43.860> for<00:04:44.100> my<00:04:44.310> prediction<00:04:44.940> because<00:04:45.360> he

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
a correct for my prediction because he

does he he does dive a lot two balls and
he<00:04:50.310> does<00:04:50.520> get<00:04:50.699> he<00:04:51.300> he<00:04:51.930> saves<00:04:52.229> a<00:04:52.380> lot<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.560> goals

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
the best keepers I think who do

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.770 
the best keepers I think who do
one-on-ones<00:04:58.229> with<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.740> players<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.780> make

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
one-on-ones with the players and make

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.670 
one-on-ones with the players and make

the player no able to score his kicking

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.390 
the player no able to score his kicking
is<00:05:05.010> very<00:05:05.220> high<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:06.050> call<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.139> does<00:05:07.289> he<00:05:07.530> does<00:05:07.770> take

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
is very high a call it does he does take

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.540 
is very high a call it does he does take
a<00:05:08.460> lot<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:10.639> powerfully<00:05:11.639> it<00:05:12.440> was<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.889> was<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
a lot a powerfully it was it was the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.950 
a lot a powerfully it was it was the

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
handling and positioning 75 and 79 is

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.400 
handling and positioning 75 and 79 is
because<00:05:25.289> that<00:05:25.320> his<00:05:25.860> ages<00:05:26.580> are<00:05:26.880> famous<00:05:27.270> 31<00:05:27.990> 32

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
because that his ages are famous 31 32

because that his ages are famous 31 32
now<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.039> i<00:05:29.729> think<00:05:29.789> is<00:05:30.060> coming<00:05:30.360> towards<00:05:30.690> end<00:05:30.960> i

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
now and i think is coming towards end i

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.640 
now and i think is coming towards end i
was<00:05:31.199> clear<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:32.520> this<00:05:32.789> prime<00:05:33.240> time<00:05:33.599> so<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.229> think

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
was clear and this prime time so I think

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.629 
was clear and this prime time so I think
those<00:05:35.070> thoughts<00:05:35.370> would<00:05:35.669> be<00:05:36.300> correct<00:05:36.990> and<00:05:37.639> just

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
those thoughts would be correct and just

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.279 
those thoughts would be correct and just
about<00:05:38.880> right<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.449> what<00:05:39.599> he<00:05:39.750> will<00:05:39.900> be<00:05:40.020> getting<00:05:40.260> a

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
about right to what he will be getting a

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.240 
about right to what he will be getting a
