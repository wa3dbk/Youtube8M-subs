00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:19.020
 I like to sing in the scum 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 the weed of the low quarters the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.660
 bad boys the scoundrel those who 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.660
 were born on the cobblestones 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.700
 why I rappel four years I write I 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.230
 tell me that we hear it I do not like 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.100
 launch beaches and pleasure and 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.170
 then it's been a long time 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.000
 maybe that gives me stop 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.739
 a kind of lack that problems get 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.570
 worry that people are asking for more 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.070
 the other harbor I hear in your own 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.750
 saying I'm saturating myself I'm doing this for my 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.520
 left hearing it's been ten years since 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.900
 it lasts I do not see it for the glory nor 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
 for the thune the chicks 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.050
 I do not care about appearances or 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.309
 not all the good things I'm going to do 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.540
 songs I only stay what 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.220
 can offer my loved ones who any 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.059
 way this fight will be to be able to us 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.619
 fill the pockets 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.119
 why I might be in fact 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.649
 it's just a big challenge in my head 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.720
 it avoids you it's the brothel like a bag 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.490
 girl is just a trick each 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.140
 greenhouse I already think patois it's my 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.210
 raving and somewhere it was kind 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.680
 loophole already hype offers to 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.030
 the oral how do I curse man when 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.100
 this world gives me the sheaf I take the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.750
 rap like a motilium for you you think 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.520
 that we played standing up doing 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.050
 thunes had to go hard to make the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.340
 others are suggestive of mixing tubes 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.259
 not everything anyway if he is a 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.210
 highly esteemed boy fo assets because 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.890
 it's more than a predestined vocation 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.270
 why do you think we 'll have to do 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.440
 zeal like all young people all of us 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.640
 the days we know swears it's this 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.229
 that they help us current young 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.820
 listen to their mocky sentences have to do 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.710
 and what they have in the team none 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.220
 will be live like a newspaper 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.960
 respondent 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.610
 why am I doing this to think for 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.320
 unpacking words in mind to stay 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.820
 simple do not bend and talk to yourself about 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.170
 ours I talk about the life of his 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.290
 pain because it leaves so little 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.880
 things supported me from 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.350
 color like the walls that carson that 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 hot I do not do texts as if 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 you fund to fight your movies and 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.520
 I'm talking to you about it because I'm afraid of it 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.140
 when I see my son's future 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.850
 why I rap because I do not see 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.230
 me what in say you think the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.060
 contrary or even that your aces 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.190
 that lie to some are lining up for 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.509
 the glory me I claim and I draw 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.070
 in the soup not for drinking but 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.630
 to claim against bullshit 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.950
 of the biggest oaks then at 20h 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.540
 bring to life in this world of barrels 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.610
 vote wary because pointers monitors 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.840
 your life why I raptor their story 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.400
 I do not have any way I think 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.110
 sometimes in range story does not fall 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.610
 in the frustration that we have things to 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.230
 tell apart his mother I want all 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.670
 the cannons can be all carl lang 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.290
 it turns out we do this all the cases 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.880
 why do you think we played 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.260
 from one you make money to towards 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.000
 hard to make hues because of his 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.890
 concave r &amp; d mix not all keep 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.450
 at the same if he is in quarters estimated center 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.670
 founded in any case force is more than a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.140
 predestined vocation why do you believe 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.459
 that we will be zealous like all 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.390
