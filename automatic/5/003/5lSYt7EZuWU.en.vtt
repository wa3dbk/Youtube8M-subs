00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.220
 the reason why the Japanese 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.690
 never knew how to make success 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.370
 international of their popular music 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.620
 and that they are still too attached to a 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.089
 style related to ancestral traditions 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:19.180
 fall local before the birth of a 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:19.180
 President Ben Ali's time 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.849
 what is there room resumes 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.020
 not stop to lust and 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.460
 in most Japanese restaurants 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.910
 we have the impression of hearing 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.829
 Japanese traditional music 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.949
 so like that with according to eso in chile 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.910
 1 the music that you can say it's 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.589
 maybe win the food at the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.150
 home and it's an idea that but we do not 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.600
 does not come out so easily the tradition 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.910
 Japanese 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.100
 we will be better here and that is hardly 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.530
 a few sessions a better of the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.089
 music and comes from the food the 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.650
 lyrics of a japanese song can 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.879
 sound weird at the sound but it's 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.080
 only because of their very language 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.400
 far from ours reducing 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.510
 simultaneously a Japanese song and 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.530
 finding that it's the same thing as 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.820
 at home last night I ate a 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.909
 staircase all because my dad is 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.080
 a tissue 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.080
 I sold my armpits to a pot 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.509
 monica lewinsky that the only adventure of 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.509
 Bill Clinton 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.650
 I suffer from bloating finally 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.700
 substantially most 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.780
 Japanese songs are like 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.770
 songs from other countries it's what it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.360
 is a phenomenon enough that it does not 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.010
 not place on the international charts 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.090
 yet two-thirds of the instruments 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.500
 electronic devices used by artists 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.700
 the most popular in the world are 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.560
 made by Japanese 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.560
 for example this genesis song 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.780
 ap no 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.220
 gold is any other aspect if we have 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 removed all instruments from the effects 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.740
 Japanese electronics that you're staying 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.180
 as the Germans had done at a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.310
 some time the Japanese use 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:40.760
 almost abusively computers for 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:40.760
 his companion and musically it's cool
