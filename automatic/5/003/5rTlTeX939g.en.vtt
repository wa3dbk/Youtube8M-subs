00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
as you take the heat off it will go back

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.110 
as you take the heat off it will go back
to<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.000> map<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:32.349> quickly<00:02:33.099> you<00:02:33.400> have<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.849> get

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
to the map so quickly you have to get

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.619 
to the map so quickly you have to get
your<00:02:34.359> wet<00:02:35.349> cut<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.799> wall<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.430> read<00:02:37.000> put<00:02:37.510> some

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
your wet cut a wall and read put some

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.020 
your wet cut a wall and read put some
more<00:02:37.780> water<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.349> but<00:02:38.590> squeeze<00:02:38.799> it<00:02:38.950> off<00:02:39.099> this

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
more water in it but squeeze it off this

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.640 
more water in it but squeeze it off this
is<00:02:40.090> where<00:02:40.329> you<00:02:40.450> go<00:02:40.599> around<00:02:40.719> in<00:02:41.139> tiny<00:02:41.439> little

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
is where you go around in tiny little

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.250 
is where you go around in tiny little
circles<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:46.000> around<00:02:46.209> in<00:02:46.299> tiny<00:02:46.510> little<00:02:46.659> circles

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
circles go around in tiny little circles

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.619 
circles go around in tiny little circles
because<00:02:47.920> then<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.189> all<00:02:48.340> merges<00:02:48.819> into<00:02:48.969> one<00:02:49.359> so

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
because then it all merges into one so

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.979 
because then it all merges into one so
you<00:02:49.750> can't<00:02:50.019> see<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.629> marks<00:02:52.629> from<00:02:52.750> where
