00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.380
 we are in slovenia today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.250
 with a new Mercedes-Benz 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.319
 a class 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.090
 of course we would be a regular there 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.820
 can make introduction video because he 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.170
 car is new but is a class 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.849
 according to us such a 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.109
 play an important role 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.410
 that we are immediately most important 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:25.859
 competitors 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:27.269
 [Music] 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.980
 yes, because mercedes-benz throws it with the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.179
 new A class really about one 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 totally different approach 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.920
 You must see what a metamorphosis is true 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.809
 the previous one disrespectfully said a bit 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.000
 a weird high bowl was for people who 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.790
 everything has had a new hip 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.260
 this new completely different 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.210
 all of a sudden it's a low hatchback that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.470
 must clearly subscribe to young 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.699
 account managers with shiny 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.920
 sunglasses 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.969
 correct yes exactly in the water of the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.969
 bmw 1 series 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.869
 [Music] 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.750
 so in the new a-class this car has 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.250
 is an important task not only 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.170
 because the young buyers go to the brand 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.880
 Mercedes-Benz must lure but also because 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 this must be able to compete with the new one 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.110
 volvo v40 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.920
 the new audi a3 and so that a series 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.600
 but its appearance will make it into everyone 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.880
 case 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.759
 huge bumpers sang logo in the nose 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.190
 and from that very nice dynamic line 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.320
 on the flanks I have to say it is 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.729
 can appreciate 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.110
 yes it is clear that mercedes-benz 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.500
 with a knobel coming into this 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.909
 segment 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.590
 it's a tasty one anyway 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.390
 become a distinctive audi 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.810
 also look but after interior looks around 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.580
 just a little different from the child's 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.229
 some higher bling bling content will be solid 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.180
 not everyone's taste are but the 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.890
 a-class is correct from within it 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.509
 dashboard looks good with those sms 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.820
 like ventilation grilles and one 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.619
 stand-alone navigation screen but it feels 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.280
 until all is solid and the f noomi is 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.280
 great for each other 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.750
 however , you will still find it in a jury 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.550
 faster your way 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.690
 the ending bitch system is more extensive 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.979
 then the command operation in the a class 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.660
 and it simply works 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.399
 more user-friendly 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.990
 there it is taste-related here 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.730
 clearly more peace aboard this 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.259
 bmw 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.640
 [Music] 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.290
 whether they have actually done fun is 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.480
 the placement of that automatic lever 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.799
 This is just like the larger Mercedes 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.940
 them on the steering column 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.070
 And that ensures that you will taste good here 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.630
 a lot of space now that we are left 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.299
 have a vending machine 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.180
 He is standard on this 250 I am 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.079
 not really a fan of it I must say 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.650
 it is a vending machine with double 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.120
 link 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.799
 but yes frankly you do not notice there 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.390
 so many of me think his reactions 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.500
 what waiting 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.209
 it is a common complaint with 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.150
 and on this it has weather and mystery 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.480
 then the reactions to the flippers 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.879
 yes i don't like it all 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.930
 intuitive as I would like 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.459
 then it does not take away that you are within the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.810
 100 shortest times because of such 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.090
 engine is not 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.180
 this a four-cylinder with a turbo 211 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.709
 pk ja you really get enough you pray 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.180
 that nature was 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.519
 it is purely that machine that you what 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.930
 restrained causes responses from 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.239
 not as lively as that of a 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.319
 a 250 note the thickest model up to 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.970
 present day 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.590
 you also the A2 fifth sport but 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.250
 You would expect something from him 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:16.390
 find 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:19.640
 [Music] 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.840
 and then adjust the driving behavior of these 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.810
 I think that is a plus of this car 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.580
 I must say he is agile and that is 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.260
 a lot for a CD series , he said 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.070
 is ruin he responds well to you 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.920
 send input 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.910
 steering feel is also great he feels 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.230
 nice and small 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.720
 I just found it quickly taken in that 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.920
 turns, yes, a little understeered 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.720
 and if you come for the grass or go 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.000
 the ass nice to put is the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.610
 balance is pretty good 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.080
 less I find the waste comfort and that 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.770
 I honestly expected better 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.770
 with this music 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:57.290
 [Music] 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.209
 yes him than the energy he had from 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.310
 fear and filters that address and this week 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.360
 game is of course that this car 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.420
 therefore a drive on the rear wheels 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.220
 has radical front-wheel drive 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.910
 yes what do you notice about that at ladies 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.150
 use 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.890
 frankly not too much but one 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.440
 thing is very disturbing this car was 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.970
 that has placed bwm at 19 inches 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.950
 it looks fantastic but late 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.510
 omit it because it robs this one 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.370
 car really a good piece of comfort 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.590
 for the chassis for the rest 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.760
 actually very neat 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.530
 Klaus, although this feature 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.210
 adjustable dampers so you can put it on 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.919
 sport set and gets a little harder 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.400
 just the normal chassis is yes 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.840
 exactly how you want it 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.419
 remains with the control that bmw 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.490
 assembles is unparalleled 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.110
 that A-class so pretty fine but here 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.890
 is just much more feeling in that car 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.200
 That 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.580
 respond immediately there remains a better chance 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.020
 in the turns 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.770
 yes almost for way you go here anyway 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.770
 enjoy playing with it 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.740
 [Music] 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.459
 [Applause] 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.459
 [Music] 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.030
 there the comparison becomes natural 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.530
 a bit clouded by the fact that 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.260
 here is a manual gearbox and one in the best 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.640
 standard and automatic but this is 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.620
 my choice though 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.870
 manual gearbox you can determine yourself 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.870
 vipat how much you get from the engine 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.590
 if you are sporty it is really going to 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.840
 my choice engine itself is reasonable 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.380
 comparable in power output with that 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:31.740
 in the mercedes 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:32.730
 and unnoticed is the incredibly fast and 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.930
 then the space 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.880
 yes it may be clear that they are here 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.710
 neither of them excel in his meaning 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.980
 you don't go for fun in a series 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.330
 sit in the back but in class 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.580
 you make it as colorful as possible 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.740
 First, the entry is free 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.420
 small through this roofline 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.190
 but also well let's say if you 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.140
 are an 80 then it goes 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.570
 you are longer make sure that you are in the front and 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.760
 then the trunk there too you have to 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.320
 of course no basal expected though 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.710
 which is quite a series nowadays 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.280
 useful 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:05.640
 look at me and here too 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.110
 Delft and a class the worst look at 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.880
 first is that opening 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.610
 well let's say not really big and 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.100
 also the space inside yes we are that 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.770
 simply better than the 1 series 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.310
 in conclusion if you want an A class 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.660
 go row 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.300
 You will definitely have to make some sacrifices on it 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.109
 space area 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.279
 [Music] 

00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:27.479
 but I still have a stumbling block and that 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.879
 is a prize 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.109
 you have an entry-level A class for such 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.759
 29,000 euros that means that those three a 

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:34.979
 four thousand euros more expensive than one 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.079
 comparable competitor 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.549
 yes and honestly you can do a best 

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:40.109
 have put down a good car 

00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:41.609
 but the future must tell or that 

00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:42.780
 Pricing was a smart thing in this 

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:45.910
 competitive field 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.910
