00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 and that says mario trejo the director 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.520
 sports cougars 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.209
 the closing 2012 will be for the board 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.340
 of cougars the decisive tournament for 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.510
 maintain support for homegrown or 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 look for other ideologies 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.640
 yes absolutely if I would tell you that if 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.010
 in this particular tournament it is very 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.930
 important for us to see up to what 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.539
 point we can continue with this line 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.160
 [Music] 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:36.040
 start or else start looking for him 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.379
 another way not just quarry 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.320
 the players may be those of the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.110
 schools but not just quarry 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.989
 we have that clear because we want 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.390
 take that risk and follow that line 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.089
 ascending of the institution understand 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.670
 why we do this is not how 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.269
 says out there that this pipe for not 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.159
 spend for that we do not have reinforcements 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.689
 our campus the potential of him 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.299
 because we also have to be very 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:07.210
 realistic where are we from as we are 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.119
 and why are we at this stage in the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.100
 that we are giving it an absolute support 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.170
 and total to our people of basic strength 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.930
 because he deserves it and although this does not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.150
 means opening the entire portfolio, 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.750
 has been a great solution for what 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.030
 have seen on other computers when we see 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.920
 that reach a certain limit when not 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.100
 reach us to have a level of 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.530
 adequate competition to that institution 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.700
 the easiest thing is what I have always 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.040
 said is it's not difficult at all has its 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.860
 problematic also runs a lot 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.560
 risk you lose a lot of money there are clubs 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.360
 worth commenting on in 30 years 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.100
 they have a championship would have to do 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.710
 accounts of how much what has been the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.630
 investment or there are others that are after 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.080
 of 29 years with the possibility of being 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.910
 champions for the sole occasion of this 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.040
 way cougars keeps his step in the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.380
 preseason where memo vÃ¡zquez wants 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.479
 a dynamic team and the directive wants 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.390
 see results in this next tournament 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.390
 must be sports leonardo villalpando
