00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
holes right here where you can put wire

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.880 
holes right here where you can put wire
in<00:01:07.790> close<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> knife<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.140> blade<00:01:10.439> will

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
in close the knife and the blade will

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
in close the knife and the blade will
actually<00:01:11.189> cut<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> sheathing<00:01:11.790> off<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.479> the
