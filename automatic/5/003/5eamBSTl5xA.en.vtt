00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.050
 hi friends i am david of three kingdoms 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.820
 reappeared com and today I wanted to present 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.970
 this new model of the American house 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.250
 new balance the mt 860 in version 4 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.350
 here you have them 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.119
 fixes is a court shoe 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.700
 pretty classic and weight we could 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.619
 say that a little high we are going to 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.300
 start I'll explain a little 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.360
 history this shoe is a sneaker 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.059
 in principle a model intended for 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.820
 street asphalt but that in equal it has 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.470
 wanted to take this version to bring 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.239
 the running as you can see here in the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.870
 about let's start I'll explain a little 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.629
 the sole is this sole that fixes takes a 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.700
 kind of pentagons both in the part 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.530
 front oriented to favor the 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.960
 displacement fixes that are cut 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.750
 in this direction as in the part 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.309
 back also these pentagons 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.640
 inverted to prevent skidding 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.860
 forward when we go 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.530
 in some descent is a sole of 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.020
 endurance material is a material in 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.420
 theory that is going to wear down very little 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 all these we are going to see and explain 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.400
 in the review and here look how it has 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.320
 this much harder plastic material 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.830
 look here like it sounds a lot harder 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.409
 t is called a beam and stabilizer 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.370
 the time it helps the bridge part 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.080
 in the one in the tread, notice that it is difficult 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.910
 pretty bending and that is that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.310
 profiles of these shoes are very 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.890
 raised fix this profile here behind 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.080
 very high and also even in front 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.960
 they are high profiles that make 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.180
 have a drop of 12 millimeters so 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.640
 as much a slipper as I have already told you 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.090
 pretty classic cut in terms of the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.119
 half sole fixes two compounds this 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.330
 red absorbs a compound that absorbs 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.539
 very well the impact of the tread and a 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.209
 second compound above this gray 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.009
 which is active active elite light a 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.290
 composed of new balance that is a 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.660
 new very light 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.810
 for the part set by this part 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.150
 fixed these were these 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.640
 grated bands is a much composed 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.610
 harder that will help us at the time 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.140
 of also controlling the tread and the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.880
 people who have pronation problems 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.710
 see how much it costs me 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.440
 it's really very different from this 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.600
 composed here with this interior 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.660
 we have like in this part is much more 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.340
 easy to put the cue in but 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.870
 in the interior part it is much more 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.950
 difficult in terms of the aper fix 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.950
 I'm going to take out the template 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.440
 so you can see these as these symbols 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.810
 of rain and that is a pear 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.560
 Waterproof and waterproof we can 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.270
 do the test we do with this 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.600
 type of shoes we are going to place 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.230
 here and we're going to pour water for him 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.590
 see 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.540
 to see the result of this upper in 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.819
 waterproof and waterproof theory 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.460
 we are going to explain it logically in the 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.000
 review but we wanted to do the test 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.870
 see how spectacular it is 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.280
 as nothing has been wetted 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.910
 here you have it 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.910
 Thus 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:40.790
 it is true that your balance says d 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.040
 from apple water resistant the 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.250
 interior also very careful in the house 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.260
 American seamless here you can 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.819
 see so I do not have a seam 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.980
 but in the foot all this front 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.300
 it is absolutely seamless 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.280
 be careful 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.310
 maybe to you what the water commented to you 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.690
 resistant and a heel area in the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.260
 top also very padded 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.950
 but it must be said that it is a bit rough 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.580
 a little is not of those so soft 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.250
 but it is a little more more cardboard with 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.490
 these side areas always fix 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.430
 taking advantage of the n to favor the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.300
 foot support 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.810
 and a classic style tongue more 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.030
 well moderately padded as you see 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.410
 neither does it have on the sides for 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.479
 prevent the entry of land or 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.030
 little stones and now I'm going to show you 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:49.680
 fixed template that big is already 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:52.320
 this template no doubt to help 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.199
 to the absorption of impacts and 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.900
 cushioning also here set this 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.539
 part of here blue also very squishy 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.910
 with which we are sure that between 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.370
 all these combined parts we are going to 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.169
 have a very cushioned shoe but 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.320
 all this logically we are going to 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.139
 tell in the review therefore friends 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.479
