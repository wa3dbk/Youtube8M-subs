here's<00:00:44.920> what<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.190> looks<00:00:45.340> like<00:00:45.430> with<00:00:45.579> a<00:00:45.610> plywood

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
here's what it looks like with a plywood

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.060 
here's what it looks like with a plywood
on<00:00:46.090> top<00:00:46.289> there's<00:00:47.289> going<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.500> be<00:00:47.559> a<00:00:47.620> hatch<00:00:47.890> in
