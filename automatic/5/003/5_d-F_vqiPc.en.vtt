 the professor andrÃ© 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.510
 This class continues from the previous lesson. 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.509
 connecting pins right panel 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.419
 front of the case on the motherboard 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:24.189
 we have the pins here let's focus here 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:26.710
 the main power sw 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.689
 we will follow the wire as standard 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.140
 negative the white 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.520
 we have here the power if wo post w 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:41.830
 follow in the outline of the previous class 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.470
 it goes to us at 6 and 8 to a tire 6 and 8 8 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.620
 negative then white 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.430
 he will have to stand by the side of the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.590
 Sunday 8 is connected pe-18 then is that 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:59.050
 motherboard 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.420
 we have the pins below the 1 1 3 5 7 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.330
 and 9 above 2 4 6 and 8 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.330
 then you can w be in these two up 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 switched on 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:31.929
 if you can see it there 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:34.209
 Let's make as much as possible the 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.219
 know that videos are recorded on the 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:40.569
 camera of my cell phone 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:43.750
 unfortunately I'm 100 camcorder and 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.609
 but I'm already making some savings out 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.979
 to buy a really good camcorder 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:51.579
 to make the videos in HD if the staff 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.379
 which it helps and helps to spread 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.149
 our work has a higher quality 

00:01:53.379 --> 00:02:00.489
 of content 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:03.700
 here we have the reset swk the wire 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:10.450
 white is the negative reset follow in 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.680
 schematic connected below the power sw the 5 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.079
 and the 7 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.910
 the reverse reset is the positive and 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:23.349
 negative so white it will get the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:29.200
 on the left side to connect here 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:32.459
 power in 1579 it will stay free we 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:39.220
 We're not going to plug anything into it. 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:42.280
 we have here the hd led hd led lupino 1 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.180
 and 3 is positive and negative 31 is negative 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.180
 will a white thread stay 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:56.870
 We have here the per led that until 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.720
 separated going on 24 the white wire 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:07.470
 evaluated pin 4 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.510
 there the front panel is connected to paulo 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.280
 and the light 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.280
 We have here in this office. 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:24.299
 the isp have the son of the spirit we have 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.280
 positive and negative in the case of plaque 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:33.900
 mother has written there the negative side 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:36.109
 right but calling so we have here 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.109
 also 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:49.560
 do you use if sp 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:54.630
 we have this here is the audio of 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:59.940
 someone connected here he has the pins 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:09.060
 different from here very much like the 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:12.139
 usb to the front of the audio and usb in 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.040
 look here on the plate is connected to it 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.950
 ta 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.450
 with design sp a hero f1 in usb 2 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:28.139
 which is the usb frontal usb front 2 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:30.570
 Let's make the link here in usb that 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.950
 everything comes apart 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.220
 sbt comes with everything and facilitates more 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.220
 Link 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:04.720
 there ready to sbt 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.530
 the two are on the power the leds 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.380
 is on 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.160
 that's how I tell those who are starting 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.950
 is to search the motherboard manual you 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.470
 understand the numbering of each pin 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.720
 which means each penalty but with this 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.260
 video lesson to the previous one 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:29.590
 I did the drawing, okay? 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:32.780
 the front panel and make all connection 7 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.780
