make<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.860> work<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.239> basically<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.440> nutshell

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880

make it work so basically in a nutshell
basically<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.239> how<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.360> think<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:33.959> gonna

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
basically and how I think this is gonna

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.550 
basically and how I think this is gonna
work<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.580> plug<00:02:35.730> into<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.810> Xbox<00:02:37.170> I

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
work is this will plug into the Xbox I

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.240 
work is this will plug into the Xbox I
believe<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.819> plug<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.209> Wi-Fi<00:02:39.860> um<00:02:40.860> I'll
