more and the constant scanning of the
scenery<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.390> signs<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:19.200> both<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
scenery for signs is both one of the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.670 
scenery for signs is both one of the
challenges<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.000> hunting<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.530> its

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
challenges of hunting and one of its

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.940 
challenges of hunting and one of its
rewards<00:01:23.490> there's<00:01:24.270> some<00:01:24.450> people<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.920> go<00:01:25.920> out

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
rewards there's some people that go out

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.370 
rewards there's some people that go out
just<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.580> meat

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
just for the meat

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.749 
just for the meat
that<00:01:28.380> would<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.590> their<00:01:28.740> primary<00:01:29.189> purpose<00:01:29.220> but

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that would be their primary purpose but

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.880 
that would be their primary purpose but
I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> majority<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.140> hunters<00:01:31.380> nowadays

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
I think the majority of hunters nowadays

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010 
I think the majority of hunters nowadays
just<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.430> being<00:01:32.670> outside<00:01:32.790> being<00:01:33.720> around<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
just like being outside being around the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.620 
just like being outside being around the
animals<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.850> javelina<00:01:35.850> out<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
animals there are javelina out there and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560 
animals there are javelina out there and
they<00:01:36.720> spot<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> far<00:01:38.159> distance<00:01:38.729> but

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
they spot one in the far distance but

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.380 
they spot one in the far distance but
getting<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.200> area<00:01:40.590> means<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:41.610> walking

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
getting to that area means more walking

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.080 
getting to that area means more walking
as<00:01:42.659> day<00:01:43.380> one<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> hunt<00:01:43.920> winds<00:01:44.579> down<00:01:44.820> they

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
as day one of the hunt winds down they

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
as day one of the hunt winds down they
find<00:01:45.420> signs<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.990> another<00:01:46.320> non<00:01:46.829> javelina

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
find signs of another non javelina

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
pretty tight in there so they found

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.999 
pretty tight in there so they found
Howards<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.060> javelina<00:02:09.690> perhaps<00:02:10.649> day<00:02:10.950> two

Howards but not javelina perhaps day two

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.790 
Howards but not javelina perhaps day two
will<00:02:11.670> change<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.989> again<00:02:13.410> get

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
will change that they again get

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
will change that they again get
an<00:02:13.860> early<00:02:14.310> start<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.970> apparently<00:02:15.420> not<00:02:15.840> before

the<00:02:16.650> cows<00:02:16.860> came<00:02:17.220> home<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:18.210> we're<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.630> to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the cows came home so we're going to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.950 
the cows came home so we're going to
sweep<00:02:18.990> around<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.560> Ridge<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.270> drop<00:02:21.270> over

the top so we can catch the backside of
the<00:02:25.590> draw<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.830> we've<00:02:26.340> been<00:02:26.490> seeing<00:02:26.760> them<00:02:26.940> in

await their efforts what day two offers
that<00:02:33.090> day<00:02:33.420> one<00:02:33.780> lacked<00:02:34.200> almost<00:02:34.710> entirely<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that day one lacked almost entirely is a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.780 
that day one lacked almost entirely is a
group<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.690> javelina<00:02:37.170> within<00:02:37.710> reach<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.550> one

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
group of javelina within reach that one

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.900 
group of javelina within reach that one
is<00:02:38.910> big<00:02:39.180> though<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:40.800> other<00:02:40.980> ones<00:02:41.220> smaller<00:02:41.550> but

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
is big though the other ones smaller but

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.930 
is big though the other ones smaller but
that<00:02:42.210> boar<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.230> pretty<00:02:43.500> big<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:44.160> course<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
that boar is pretty big of course it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.570 
that boar is pretty big of course it
can't<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.630> easy<00:02:45.900> they're<00:02:46.560> still<00:02:46.980> quite<00:02:47.550> a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
can't be easy they're still quite a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.240 
can't be easy they're still quite a
stroll<00:02:48.000> away<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:49.110> add<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.320> challenge<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
stroll away and to add a challenge the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.010 
stroll away and to add a challenge the
hunters<00:02:50.610> would<00:02:50.820> like<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.270> get<00:02:51.420> close<00:02:51.660> enough

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
hunters would like to get close enough

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.440 
hunters would like to get close enough
to<00:02:52.530> use<00:02:52.740> their<00:02:53.010> sidearms<00:02:53.730> rather<00:02:54.030> than<00:02:54.270> their

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
to use their sidearms rather than their

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.970 
to use their sidearms rather than their
rifles<00:02:56.900> okay<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.170> trick<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.440> we're<00:02:58.890> gonna

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
rifles okay so the trick is we're gonna

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.400 
rifles okay so the trick is we're gonna
lose<00:02:59.280> them<00:02:59.430> when<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.670> go<00:02:59.820> down<00:03:00.140> but<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.260> know

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
lose them when we go down but we know

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.320 
lose them when we go down but we know
which<00:03:01.560> way<00:03:01.740> they're<00:03:01.890> going<00:03:02.100> yep<00:03:03.060> they're

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
which way they're going yep they're

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.000 
which way they're going yep they're
going<00:03:03.360> into<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.900> drop<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.620> we're<00:03:04.830> quiet

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
going into that drop and if we're quiet

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.470 
going into that drop and if we're quiet
we<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.460> get<00:03:05.610> close<00:03:05.820> enough<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.240> shoot<00:03:06.420> a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
we can get close enough to shoot a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.160 
we can get close enough to shoot a
handgun<00:03:06.930> let's<00:03:07.680> try<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:07.980> go<00:03:08.190> up<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.490> hill<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
handgun let's try to go up this hill and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.350 
handgun let's try to go up this hill and
then<00:03:10.170> keep<00:03:10.410> an<00:03:10.530> eye<00:03:10.850> we<00:03:11.850> know<00:03:12.000> where<00:03:12.210> they're

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
then keep an eye we know where they're

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.050 
then keep an eye we know where they're
at<00:03:12.390> there's<00:03:13.140> three<00:03:13.470> there<00:03:13.790> there<00:03:14.790> might<00:03:15.030> be

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
at there's three there there might be

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.300 
at there's three there there might be
more<00:03:15.360> further<00:03:15.660> down<00:03:16.050> at<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.770> point<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
more further down at this point the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.460 
more further down at this point the
walking<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:18.030> every<00:03:18.540> bit<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:18.840> hard<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.350> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
walking is every bit as hard but the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.020 
walking is every bit as hard but the
hunters<00:03:19.800> are<00:03:19.950> finally<00:03:20.459> running<00:03:20.670> on

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
hunters are finally running on

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.140 
hunters are finally running on
adrenaline<00:03:21.840> rather<00:03:22.380> than<00:03:22.650> stamina<00:03:23.340> yes<00:03:23.940> we

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
adrenaline rather than stamina yes we

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.280 
adrenaline rather than stamina yes we
can<00:03:24.300> just<00:03:24.510> get<00:03:24.630> shot

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.530 

turn<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:30.550> down<00:03:32.680> into<00:03:33.680> one<00:03:34.010> draw<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.640> up<00:03:35.090> over<00:03:35.510> a

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
turn it down into one draw and up over a

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.810 
turn it down into one draw and up over a
ridge<00:03:35.660> into<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.440> javelina<00:03:36.770> territory<00:03:37.520> and

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
ridge into the javelina territory and

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.650 
ridge into the javelina territory and
they<00:03:38.180> find<00:03:38.710> no<00:03:39.710> javelina<00:03:40.460> they<00:03:41.330> might<00:03:41.510> not

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
they find no javelina they might not

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.120 
they find no javelina they might not
even<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:42.050> run<00:03:42.230> they<00:03:42.440> might<00:03:42.590> have<00:03:42.680> just<00:03:42.860> topped

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
even to run they might have just topped

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.350 
even to run they might have just topped
over<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.760> been<00:03:44.540> natural<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:45.680> then<00:03:45.860> we<00:03:46.360> we

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
over and been natural but then we we

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.410 
over and been natural but then we we
kind<00:03:47.570> of<00:03:47.660> went<00:03:47.780> down<00:03:49.120> upside<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.270> way<00:03:50.450> so

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
kind of went down upside this way so

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.550 
kind of went down upside this way so
yeah<00:03:53.420> they<00:03:53.630> can't<00:03:53.900> have<00:03:54.050> gone<00:03:54.200> far

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
over top of a hill got over it pretty

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.930 
over top of a hill got over it pretty
much<00:04:02.750> disappeared<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:05.330> we're<00:04:05.560> trying<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.680> find

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
much disappeared so we're trying to find

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.940 
much disappeared so we're trying to find

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
they would not spot the javelinas again

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.850 
they would not spot the javelinas again
