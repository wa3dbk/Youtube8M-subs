simple

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.939 
simple
and<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.240> very<00:00:30.359> similar<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.410> previous

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
and it's very similar to a previous

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.850 
and it's very similar to a previous
video<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.610> did<00:00:32.699> except<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.739> towards<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
video that I did except it's towards the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.470 
video that I did except it's towards the
end<00:00:34.949> it<00:00:35.280> will<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.489> slightly<00:00:35.730> more<00:00:36.090> different

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
end it will be slightly more different

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
end it will be slightly more different
and<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:37.469> also<00:00:37.620> using<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.280> different<00:00:38.790> hitter<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and I'm also using a different hitter of

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.290 
and I'm also using a different hitter of
scale<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.980> mean<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> differently<00:00:41.969> jobs

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
scale and I mean it differently jobs

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.680 
scale and I mean it differently jobs
earlier<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.890> much<00:00:44.430> longer<00:00:45.059> much<00:00:45.390> wider

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
earlier it's a much longer much wider

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.529 
earlier it's a much longer much wider
and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.160> need<00:00:47.340> my<00:00:47.520> previous<00:00:47.910> videos<00:00:48.270> so

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and then you need my previous videos so

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.440 
and then you need my previous videos so
hopefully<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.200> will<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.410> useful<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.450> I'll

neat<00:04:23.970> looking<00:04:24.419> -<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:27.620> that's<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.800> yeah<00:04:28.919> so<00:04:29.460> you

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
neat looking - and that's it yeah so you

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.000 
neat looking - and that's it yeah so you
can<00:04:29.820> see<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:30.300> little<00:04:31.020> detail<00:04:31.410> on<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.650> side<00:04:31.860> but

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
can see a little detail on the side but

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.030 
can see a little detail on the side but
it's<00:04:32.190> not<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.639> overpowering<00:04:33.060> powering<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.229> mind

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
it's not so overpowering powering a mind

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.310 
it's not so overpowering powering a mind
of<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.250> hijab<00:04:35.580> is<00:04:35.910> it's<00:04:36.300> quite<00:04:36.540> a<00:04:36.570> strong

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320

took it into something and on this
occasion<00:04:59.639> we're<00:04:59.910> just<00:05:00.060> going<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.240> take<00:05:00.450> it
