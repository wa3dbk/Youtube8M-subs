00:00:08.540 --> 00:02:11.690 

you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.850 

I<00:02:11.760> knew<00:02:12.450> coming<00:02:12.720> into<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> big<00:02:13.319> mountain<00:02:13.739> day

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I knew coming into the big mountain day

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.180 
I knew coming into the big mountain day
that<00:02:14.069> we<00:02:14.250> had<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:14.760> strong<00:02:15.209> team<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:16.190> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
that we had a really strong team and I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.809 
that we had a really strong team and I
didn't<00:02:17.940> expect<00:02:18.269> us<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.540> win<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:19.050> 62<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:20.580> I

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
didn't expect us to win with 62 but I

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.550 
didn't expect us to win with 62 but I
thought<00:02:21.209> we<00:02:21.390> were<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.750> take<00:02:21.900> most<00:02:22.200> most

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
thought we were going to take most most

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.400 
thought we were going to take most most
points<00:02:22.890> today<00:02:23.040> because<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.910> think<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.019> really

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
points today because I I think we really

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.320 
points today because I I think we really
need<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:26.129> extra<00:02:26.370> points<00:02:26.790> going<00:02:26.940> into<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
need some extra points going into the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.790 
need some extra points going into the
backcountry<00:02:27.690> slopestyle<00:02:28.260> because<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
backcountry slopestyle because the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.030 
backcountry slopestyle because the
americas<00:02:29.160> team<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:30.330> strong<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.810> day
