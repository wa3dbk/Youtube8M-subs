00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.110
 Now let's sow 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.799
 green beans 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.799
 we take 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.560
 we see 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.640
 these pots we are going to use with a 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.630
 flower pot 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.630
 let's be one 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.950
 two 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.050
 and 3 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.809
 this is the right compost for 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.809
 plant of any type 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.310
 and we have it there almost full 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 let's put the plant d 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.350
 they become children of the beans 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.280
 with little seeds that are small beans 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.590
 but let's put 4 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.659
 two 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.860
 3 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.460
 and four plugs or take in the center 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.440
 this once it has sprouted from the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.460
 few days 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.460
 we put 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.710
 we put him to be transplanted 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.650
 Now let's take a little 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.700
 compost over to cover it 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.590
 I know that of some two centimeters 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.609
 One day with this is enough 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.609
 but you will see 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.300
 Jewish 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.190
 notably 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.190
 your label 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.409
 little girl 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.900
 10 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.480
 and the date 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.170
 of 5 of the 14 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.170
 very well 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.020
 all right 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.770
 and we have it ready until the cb to 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.180
 bud and when it buds back already back 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.180
 we move to a large pot 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.170
 well here we have 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.170
 bean sprouts 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.170
 or is it true or well those five days in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.940
 leaving the bean leaves very very soon very 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.080
 yield 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.650
 and we have the beans 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.650
 d 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.860
 practically seven days 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.840
 from both sides quite well and are 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.650
 going up quite 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.890
 well here we have the 20 day beans 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.720
 since they are quite high it seems that 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.920
 it is growing well 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.660
 we are going to transplant today 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.569
 beans that we already have raised here 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.790
 the twigs of beans 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.350
 and we are going to make this pot transparent 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.180
 higher 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.520
 so let's try to get it out with 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.040
 very careful 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.040
 in half to make us break a lot 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.599
 the roots 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.480
 already 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.770
 so we can 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.480
 with hand 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.210
 we put it here is a flower pot 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.260
 It is much older 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.909
 and so you will have more 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.909
 more growth advantage 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.600
 and here we are going to throw a little 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.550
 the deal 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.490
 fair 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.730
 in order that this plant is ideal 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.950
 that is growing in conditions 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.070
 is right now is already we have it 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:01.030
 planted here in this big 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.860
 and this one we're going to focus 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.249
 since there is not very well 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.329
 leaves 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:10.470
 it's not very good today it's been great 

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:12.690
 now more 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.930
 I do not know if it's because of just many 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.430
 hours 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.430
 let's center this well 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.730
 in canada 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.009
 sometimes they break down because the phial 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:39.590
 much 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:42.480
 and you can not risk so much 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.980
 here 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.980
 this entry 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.599
 I hope that now 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.710
 show in this new habitat 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.710
 these beans 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.420
 reborn we could decide to be 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.260
 that they catch with a good 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.260
 and good growth 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.350
 what do I have to do and put it then 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.150
 a little the sun 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.150
 it does not take much but 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.200
 the tree 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.200
 peterson and water it 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.000
 until another occasion that I already put to 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.000
 another video
