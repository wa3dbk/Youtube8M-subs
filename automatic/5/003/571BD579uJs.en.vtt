it'll<00:01:12.390> misfire<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:14.250> seems<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> less

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it'll misfire it seems to do it less

it'll misfire it seems to do it less
when<00:01:15.299> I'm<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> driving<00:01:15.990> gear<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.650> reverse

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
when I'm in a driving gear so reverse

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.710 
when I'm in a driving gear so reverse
Drive<00:01:17.390> tool<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.500> won't<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.040> much

Drive tool or one it won't do it as much

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.140 
Drive tool or one it won't do it as much
I<00:01:22.009> mean<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:23.340> infrequent<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.030> I'm

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
I mean it's really infrequent when I'm

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.969 
I mean it's really infrequent when I'm
in<00:01:24.299> those<00:01:24.420> driving<00:01:24.659> gears<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.470> mainly<00:01:25.770> when

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
in those driving gears it's mainly when

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.380 
in those driving gears it's mainly when
I'm<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.189> park<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.640> neutral<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.150> there's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
I'm in park or neutral so when there's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.910 
I'm in park or neutral so when there's
no<00:01:27.509> load<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> engine<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.439> seems<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> really

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
no load on the engine it seems to really

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
no load on the engine it seems to really
do<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> lot<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.060> I'll<00:01:30.150> demonstrate<00:01:30.360> right

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
do it a lot and I'll demonstrate right

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
do it a lot and I'll demonstrate right
now<00:01:31.009> what<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.130> doing<00:01:32.430> when<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.700> doing<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> how

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
now what is doing when is doing it how

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.149 
now what is doing when is doing it how
it's<00:01:33.329> doing<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.960> I'll<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.829> start<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it's doing it so I'll going to start it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.719 
it's doing it so I'll going to start it
up<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> watch<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.470> watch<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.500> tack<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.159> you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
up and watch the watch the tack and you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.740 
up and watch the watch the tack and you
can<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.030> what's<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.360> on

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.590 

so<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.870> starts<00:01:47.170> right<00:01:47.350> up

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so it starts right up

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.930 
so it starts right up
you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.680> right<00:01:50.400> out<00:01:50.520> there<00:01:50.640> doing

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
you can see it's right out there doing

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.410 
you can see it's right out there doing
this<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.409> just<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.680> supposed<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
this thing just like it's supposed to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.960 
this thing just like it's supposed to
and<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.720> comes<00:01:54.900> down<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:56.310> feel<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.760> miss

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
and as it comes down I can feel the miss

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.640 
and as it comes down I can feel the miss
you<00:01:57.240> might<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.510> be<00:01:57.600> able<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:57.750> hear<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.050> or<00:01:58.620> see

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
you might not be able to hear it or see

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.300 
you might not be able to hear it or see
it<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.400> I<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.700> definitely<00:01:59.850> feel<00:02:00.120> it<00:02:00.330> just

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
it but I can definitely feel it just

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.469 
it but I can definitely feel it just
there's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> couple<00:02:02.729> right<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
there's a couple right there you see the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.170 
there's a couple right there you see the
needle<00:02:03.690> dropping<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.229> bit<00:02:04.940> it's<00:02:05.940> pretty

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
needle dropping a little bit it's pretty

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.920
