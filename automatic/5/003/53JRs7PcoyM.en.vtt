time<00:02:34.110> consuming<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:36.410> think<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.470> was<00:02:37.590> trying<00:02:37.800> to

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
time consuming I think I was trying to

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.400 
time consuming I think I was trying to
say<00:02:38.010> consuming<00:02:38.580> they're<00:02:39.830> doing<00:02:42.260> tons<00:02:43.260> of

say consuming they're doing tons of
bronze<00:02:43.650> cards<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.220> felt<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.730> was

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.199 
bunch annie is the best receiver out of
the<00:04:00.989> three<00:04:01.290> in<00:04:01.500> my<00:04:01.709> opinion<00:04:01.950> he's<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.000> biggest

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
the three in my opinion he's the biggest

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.340 
the three in my opinion he's the biggest
one<00:04:03.570> also<00:04:04.560> 97<00:04:05.489> speed<00:04:05.730> 97<00:04:06.390> release<00:04:06.720> he's<00:04:07.320> uh

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
one also 97 speed 97 release he's uh

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.460 
one also 97 speed 97 release he's uh
he's<00:04:08.100> pretty<00:04:08.370> darn<00:04:08.640> good<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:09.090> played<00:04:10.019> one<00:04:10.230> game

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
he's pretty darn good I played one game

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.069 
he's pretty darn good I played one game
with<00:04:10.680> these<00:04:10.829> receivers<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.579> far<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.690> think

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
with these receivers so far and I think

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.259 
with these receivers so far and I think
Jerry<00:04:13.620> Rice<00:04:13.829> did<00:04:14.070> drop<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.549> pass<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.090> he

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
Jerry Rice did drop one pass that he

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.750 
Jerry Rice did drop one pass that he
that<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.380> thought<00:04:16.709> he<00:04:16.829> could<00:04:17.010> have<00:04:17.100> caught<00:04:17.370> but

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
that I thought he could have caught but

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.029 
that I thought he could have caught but
there's<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.329> cover<00:04:18.660> Larry<00:04:19.169> Fitzgerald<00:04:19.829> if<00:04:19.950> you

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
there's a cover Larry Fitzgerald if you

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.820 
there's a cover Larry Fitzgerald if you
wanted<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.310> see<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.760> cover<00:04:20.970> votes<00:04:21.830> they
