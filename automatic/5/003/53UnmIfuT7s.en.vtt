00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.170
 this brand new boxster has nothing 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.099
 to see with the old here maybe reviewed 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.900
 longer wheelbase wider track 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.059
 new drawing is obviously 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.049
 engine power up the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.580
 air inlets on the sides are 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.289
 much more pronounced than before and the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.960
 stylistic result is rather successful 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.210
 profile we even found forgers 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 of carrera gt here we try the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.470
 version s of 315 horsepower the engine is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.939
 in the rear center position in order to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.779
 benefit from a distribution of the masses 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.540
 almost perfect 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.040
 the version s enjoys a flat 6 2 3 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.510
 and 4 of displacement to the sound 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.559
 intoxicating 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.020
 losses announced by the manufacturer 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.969
 are honorable the 0 to 100 km time and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.489
 for example shot in 5 seconds a and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 the top speed is 2,179 km 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.960
 time the behavior has really evolved 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.520
 he too unfortunately the car is a little less 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.559
 fun to drive from by train 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.100
 rear - mobile but the road holding 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.750
 wins 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.920
 according to your desires it is possible to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.079
 juggle between different modes of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.969
 driving on board we get into a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.100
 refined universe dedicated to the well-being of the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.210
 driver the multiple settings in 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.500
 attest 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.090
 the ergonomics of the various commands 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.320
 is really ideal and the lever of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.570
 speed so perfectly at hand 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.010
 but you will need a little 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.390
 adaptation time before taking 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.180
 knowledge of the many buttons 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.830
 lining the center console 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.540
 equipment side the boxster's other 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.030
 including a system air conditioning system 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.860
 gps touch navigation or a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.939
 speed regulator 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 the hood as for it is entirely 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.630
 automated opening pushed you to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.009
 stopping or rolling up to 30 km 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.909
 hour 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.030
 the operation does not claim more than 9 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.030
 seconds 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.970
 the front chest relatively deep and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.730
 with a capacity of 150 drawn cube 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.500
 allows to board some luggage even 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.450
 thing for the rear compartment but 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.410
 the latter turns out to be narrower 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.860
