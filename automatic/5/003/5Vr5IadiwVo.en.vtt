00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello to all the girls welcome back today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.810
 as promised, I apologize for having 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.000
 really late that I had so many 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.790
 video in the lineup and I'm struggling 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.269
 organize the times I admit the radio 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.220
 on the step by step contor kate of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.060
 smash box I know it has many of you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.000
 interest 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.820
 I spend only two words on the step by 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.789
 step control stick trio then the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.130
 version for the cultivation in cream that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.119
 I use before throwing it with the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 powder 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.270
 I'll show you very quickly 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.219
 are three pencils for contouring 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.829
 just American so with the time 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.250
 disappearing definition warm color brown 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.719
 it's illuminating veils drips what 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.270
 crazy is the creaminess the pigment yield 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.090
 and the great on mobility that is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.829
 just proof of inexperienced hands is a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 kit that if you hold your hand a little bit 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.390
 light 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.489
 I then do so I apply not flat 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.670
 if not, langa too says not to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.610
 tip but flat between pine and smoked with 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 a flat kabuki or a brush in the evening 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.689
 cat's tongues 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 the effect is amazing believe me 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.640
 among other things they are very comfortable to file 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.009
 with touring even in parts where needed 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 precision like the nose the arch 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.869
 eyebrow control lips 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.880
 etc 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.710
 excellent good duration girls the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.439
 contouring set with powder view 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.689
 all day not like the palette 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.740
 of marc jacobs girls who after twenty 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.170
 minutes I did the contouring bye 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.150
 we come to the protagonist of the video then 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.390
 I state that you asked me if I have 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.479
 the shade light is the contraindicated scoop 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 with saying sky or different pallets from 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.840
 contouring I admit that for me this is 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.759
 the best I have the best in 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.799
 absolute in all price ranges 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.229
 I also really liked the palette on 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.770
 lancom team nothing this has won on 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.920
 all what the kit includes 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.950
 first of all you have one inside 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.060
 lock of indication on how does the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.830
 account for each type of 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.900
 because as you know for example a face 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.700
 valid a square face will still have a 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.470
 account rich slightly different in 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.080
 some areas because it serves a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.790
 rebalancing of the proportions in the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.620
 kit found I am not even taken off the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.500
 plastic because I don't want to ruin the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.980
 palette where you have inside in everything 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.670
 about 12 grams of product 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.910
 the three powders then cold medium hot 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.800
 and illuminating is the mirror where you have 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.590
 a practical indication on how 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.840
 also use them to train the thing 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.120
 super cool of the kit is that you have in 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.549
 tribute to the brush contouring 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.730
 smashbox that seen like this looks like a 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.890
 ciofeca is actually perfect for files 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.709
 with touring because being bison 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.319
 small and precise you succeed in just 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.420
 I do n't get perfect lines 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.010
 done contouring i have nothing 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.140
 earth and illuminating nothing just a little 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.959
 maybe those illuminating because I wanted to 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.459
 let you see it at work then use 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.040
 just his little brush and I take the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.049
 cold color then copil the bill 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.940
 because they are called against brawn and 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.840
 highlight 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.320
 the only slightly dusty defect la 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.019
 but this does not see, however, that it is 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.850
 the dusting effect on the face is fuss 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.970
 the waffle is not dusty at all on the 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.850
 face believe me it is exceptional costs 43 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.579
 euro inclusive of brush is a price 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.639
 however competitive 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.160
 then the best way to file with 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.530
 touring the account as you know it must be done 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.810
 here at 18 of the zygomatic bone but if you 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.639
 rest the brush on those pulling 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.290
 expands sure you brush 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.680
 you have the shadow slightly shifted 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.120
 because the shadow then ends up around here 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.700
 so the best way to do a 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.840
 account and I really precise it is 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.700
 place the shadow 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.889
 here where the tip of the hair is created 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.840
 you see that about two millimeters 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.700
 superior to the zygomatic bone because 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.930
 however you will have the brush dilated 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.609
 the shadow zone that coincides 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.459
 perfectly with the matic study 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.370
 so we support it this way 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.590
 let's start creating a definition 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.260
 I first create a clear line you see in 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.620
 this way so or proportions and then 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.919
 with the cutting brush 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.860
 if to work slightly upwards is 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.930
 a dust and very very very disabled 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.990
 managed to keep a shadow very much 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.639
 defined and dark or even very soft in 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.590
 based on the type of account you want 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.389
 carry out as you notice by pointing the 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.340
 brush here you see that it coincides 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.820
 perfectly where it was supposed to 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.729
 be and then you will use for example from 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.919
 using this brush the illuminant that 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.050
 being opaque they are all three born 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.030
 to further clean the line of 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.930
 contouring in this way wants to get 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.030
 a perfectly scaled line you see 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.180
 look how good it is after that me 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:10.250
 I take the dark and go right here to 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.020
 thin the outline and smoke with 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.690
 small strokes upwards so that 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.240
 don't be a clear line when you have it 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.889
 done this if you like the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.470
 against double then also with the 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.550
 part of the bronze you will take the second one 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.840
 waffle and you will just position it 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.960
 above where you made the account in 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.070
 cold with circular movements for 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.070
 heat the whole area 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.960
 in this way you see you get I don't know if 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.120
 link you see in dog at a check in 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.729
 gradual that from the dark goes towards the 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.139
 clear and then at the end of the cheek 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.720
 here you are going to position 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.190
 the illuminant clear if these are its own 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.289
 the illuminant as I told you the other 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.669
 time for perfect definition if it is 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.490
 you want to slap today what you can 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.190
 add it later 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.770
 I find this with this perfect palette 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.710
 also for nose control because 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.169
 being very very disabled not 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.580
 you risk making the car as it is 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.889
 success for example with the palette of 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.810
 kat von d because it is exceptional but it is 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.970
 so much pigmented that there is the 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.650
 risk that you find yourself a stain that 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.900
 then you can no longer fade because the 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.370
 dust settles with this take 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.440
 illuminating with this instead is 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.330
 practically impossible because it is 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.930
 so and usable that you don't risk it 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.490
 this kind of problem you see with 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.889
 take care how natural the beautiful is 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.990
 contouring then you don't want to file 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.710
 with touring take the hot waffle e 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.050
 use it 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.940
 browser I recommend if you want 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.200
 make full use of the paddle to use the 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:45.140
 cold powder for the nose and net lines 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.600
 edges to warm instead the contours is 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:55.640
 enough the warm medium one that gives a 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:58.400
 much more natural effect among other things 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.500
 sms style the beautiful wilderness that 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.080
 I greet with great affection 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.290
 recommended the opaque earth of 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.210
 smashbox I want to understand if it is different 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.790
 from the one that is contained in the kit I want 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.020
 talk because I love own smashbox 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.880
 that really has a quality 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.790
 excellent look with look at that 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.070
 beautiful the earth is not hot orange is 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.480
 simply warmer than the 3 look 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.300
 how do you get a definition of 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.280
 completely natural contours do not know 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.610
 if the line in the girls room believe me 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.480
 this fantastic palette I hope to be there 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.520
 was useful 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.290
 I send you a very big kiss and indeed 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.120
 since I am practically set with 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.070
 against in powder if you have any 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.440
 also low cost pallet to recommend 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.790
 please write me down there because to me 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.890
 interests and I believe interests also in 

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.890
 all of you a kiss or a weekend
