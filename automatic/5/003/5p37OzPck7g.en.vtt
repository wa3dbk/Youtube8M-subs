that it'll go to little pool by the
sounds<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> deal<00:01:32.670> could<00:01:32.939> be

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
sounds of it and that deal could be

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.030 
sounds of it and that deal could be
completed<00:01:33.570> very<00:01:33.750> soon<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.680> since<00:01:34.829> we've

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
completed very soon but since we've

terms of fpl if benteke were to go to
Liverpool<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.750> previous<00:01:40.020> video<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
Liverpool in a previous video in the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
Liverpool in a previous video in the
series<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.520> thought<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> would<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> interesting

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
series I thought it would be interesting

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.600 
series I thought it would be interesting
to<00:01:42.899> explore<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.530> possibility<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.159> him<00:01:44.490> moving

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
to explore the possibility of him moving

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.490 
to explore the possibility of him moving
to<00:01:44.880> manchester<00:01:45.090> united<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to manchester united in this one and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
to manchester united in this one and
what<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.159> mean<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.369> fpl<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.180> even<00:01:48.930> if

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
what that would mean for fpl and even if

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
what that would mean for fpl and even if
they<00:01:49.200> don't<00:01:49.350> sign<00:01:49.649> benteke<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.700> will<00:01:50.939> surely

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
they don't sign benteke they will surely

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.690 
they don't sign benteke they will surely
need<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> sign<00:01:51.780> another<00:01:51.930> striker<00:01:52.700> united

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
need to sign another striker united

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
need to sign another striker united
looks<00:01:53.880> set<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.090> continue<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> 433

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
looks set to continue with a 433

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
looks set to continue with a 433
formation<00:01:56.250> after<00:01:56.430> bolstering<00:01:57.390> their

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
formation after bolstering their

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
formation after bolstering their
midfield<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:58.140> Schneiderlin<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
midfield with Schneiderlin and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
midfield with Schneiderlin and
schweinsteiger<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.719> would<00:02:00.840> mean<00:02:00.990> that

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
schweinsteiger so that would mean that

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.139 
schweinsteiger so that would mean that
they<00:02:01.320> only<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.740> room<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.460> number<00:02:03.000> nine

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
they only have room for one number nine

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.910 
they only have room for one number nine
in<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.479> system<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.560> would<00:02:04.740> surely

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
in that system and that would surely

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.130 
in that system and that would surely
have<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.430> captain<00:02:05.670> Wayne<00:02:06.030> Rooney<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.110> I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
have to be captain Wayne Rooney so I

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
have to be captain Wayne Rooney so I
think<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.770> move<00:02:08.009> would<00:02:08.190> happen<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.179> would

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
think if this move would happen it would

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.540 
think if this move would happen it would
be<00:02:09.539> terrible<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.020> fpl<00:02:10.560> because<00:02:11.250> he<00:02:11.370> would

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
be terrible for fpl because he would

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.260 
be terrible for fpl because he would
almost<00:02:11.940> certainly<00:02:12.209> ruin<00:02:12.660> benteke

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
almost certainly ruin benteke

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.390 
almost certainly ruin benteke
as<00:02:13.450> an<00:02:13.660> option<00:02:13.990> because<00:02:14.590> he'd<00:02:14.920> be<00:02:15.010> stuck<00:02:15.250> on

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
as an option because he'd be stuck on

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.160 
as an option because he'd be stuck on
the<00:02:15.490> bench<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.850> lot<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.120> time<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:16.990> also

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the bench a lot of the time but also

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.170 
the bench a lot of the time but also
possibly<00:02:17.770> ruin<00:02:18.160> Wayne<00:02:18.310> Rooney<00:02:18.640> too<00:02:18.880> if

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
possibly ruin Wayne Rooney too if

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.000 
possibly ruin Wayne Rooney too if
benteke<00:02:19.840> started<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.290> steal<00:02:20.530> some<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.920> his

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
benteke started to steal some of his

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.470 
benteke started to steal some of his
minutes<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.520> really<00:02:21.940> became<00:02:22.210> no<00:02:22.450> longer

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
minutes and really became no longer

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.470 
minutes and really became no longer
nailed<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:24.100> whilst<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.700> real<00:02:24.880> life<00:02:25.120> terms

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
nailed on so whilst in real life terms

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.420 
nailed on so whilst in real life terms
this<00:02:26.230> would<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> solid<00:02:26.860> move<00:02:27.160> for<00:02:27.340> Man

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
this would be a solid move for Man

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.850 
this would be a solid move for Man
United<00:02:27.690> because<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.020> implications<00:02:29.260> for

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
United because of the implications for

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.400 
United because of the implications for
fpl<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.520> would<00:02:30.940> kind<00:02:31.210> of<00:02:31.300> prefer<00:02:31.360> benteke<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.290> go

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
fpl I would kind of prefer benteke to go

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.530 
fpl I would kind of prefer benteke to go
to<00:02:32.470> Liverpool<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.280> for<00:02:33.820> United<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.300> sign<00:02:34.510> a

to Liverpool and for United to sign a

if Fabregas was pushed forward you'd be

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.660 
if Fabregas was pushed forward you'd be
