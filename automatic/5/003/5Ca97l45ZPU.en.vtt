00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello take direct personal from the well 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.760
 we are here with the application well 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.150
 interesting to use the vibration of the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.480
 your smartphone to massage is in vab 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.580
 He's thirsty and interesting. 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 vibration duration options 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 you can choose one of the types of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.240
 vibration a vibration quickly I live 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 the slower I'll support him here he 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:34.860
 has several types of vibration ours 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.399
 There are several types I'm going to leave this 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.950
 here ok 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.040
 coming back for the duration we will choose 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:52.520
 a duration of one minute 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:55.230
 activate observe is vibrating of course 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.629
 and this idea the application will stay 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.180
 vibrating until the end of time let's go 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.370
 Disable here is from my experience 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 with other smartphones I recommend 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.720
 you do not use app for a long time 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 not to unnecessarily force a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.170
 vibration module of your device nothing 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 but nothing less is a small 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.630
 motor so not worth stressing 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.100
 it too much but the healthy use of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 application is recommended right 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.549
 I realize that it vibrates is what it does 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.590
 is this the goal of the program you 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.990
 You need your phone vibrate it will 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.240
 vibrate by a party hands feet back 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.189
 so that it turns here in the options 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.380
 of the program we can leave the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.689
 active ads because the paid version that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 lets you turn them off your time it me 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.390
 I was talking about buying the program, come on. 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.880
 cancel 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.820
 but I can leave the ads off 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.070
 based on the right location 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.710
 you can let it rotate under the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.380
 lock screen to make it work 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.189
 with the screen off and leave it off 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.560
 OK 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.390
 this is the application will vibrate your 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.430

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.159

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.540

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.610
