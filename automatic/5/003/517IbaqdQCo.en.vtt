00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
O'Neill than you might have imagined for

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.530 
O'Neill than you might have imagined for
a<00:03:17.190> manager<00:03:17.550> with<00:03:17.760> his<00:03:17.910> track<00:03:18.120> record

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
a manager with his track record

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.479 
a manager with his track record
sometimes<00:03:19.050> big<00:03:19.260> club<00:03:19.530> big<00:03:19.799> stadium<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.459> he

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
sometimes big club big stadium and he

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.220 
sometimes big club big stadium and he
might<00:03:20.700> have<00:03:20.730> thought<00:03:21.000> at<00:03:21.120> his<00:03:21.239> age<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:22.019> could

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
might have thought at his age this could

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.960 
might have thought at his age this could
be<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.500> last<00:03:22.650> chance<00:03:23.010> saloon<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.670> might<00:03:23.880> as

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
be the last chance saloon so I might as

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.060 
be the last chance saloon so I might as
well<00:03:24.060> jump<00:03:24.329> on<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.630> now<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.989> also<00:03:25.530> they<00:03:25.799> look

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
well jump on it now and also they look

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.680 
well jump on it now and also they look
when<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.549> look<00:03:26.579> at<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.940> other<00:03:27.060> clubs<00:03:27.480> around

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
when you look at the other clubs around

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.420 
when you look at the other clubs around
them<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.410> him<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.680> charge<00:03:28.920> they<00:03:29.100> look<00:03:29.310> like

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
them with him in charge they look like

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.590 
them with him in charge they look like
they've<00:03:29.579> got<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.790> squad<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.150> get<00:03:30.239> out<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.540> it

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
they've got the squad to get out of it

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.420 
they've got the squad to get out of it
so<00:03:30.750> it's<00:03:30.900> not<00:03:31.110> like<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> terrible<00:03:31.860> scenario<00:03:32.130> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
so it's not like a terrible scenario to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.340 
so it's not like a terrible scenario to
be<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.209> know<00:03:33.329> it'll<00:03:33.600> probably<00:03:33.630> be<00:03:34.170> more

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
be and you know it'll probably be more

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
be and you know it'll probably be more
like<00:03:34.560> two<00:03:34.769> seasons<00:03:34.980> down<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.549> line<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.970> think

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
like two seasons down the line you think

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.970 
like two seasons down the line you think
how<00:03:36.360> far<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.810> Sunderland<00:03:37.290> go<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> think

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
how far can Sunderland go but I think

Redknapp<00:04:05.370> said<00:04:05.609> this<00:04:05.760> weekend<00:04:06.120> says<00:04:06.269> he

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
Redknapp said this weekend says he

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.180 
Redknapp said this weekend says he
hasn't<00:04:06.510> had<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.049> popular<00:04:07.440> referee<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:07.799> 30<00:04:08.070> years

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
hasn't had a popular referee in 30 years

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.220 
hasn't had a popular referee in 30 years
which<00:04:08.609> is<00:04:08.730> interesting<00:04:08.940> claims<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.600> think<00:04:09.630> I

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
which is interesting claims I think I

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.930 
which is interesting claims I think I
mean<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.769> know<00:04:10.799> Redknapp's<00:04:11.340> always<00:04:11.700> he's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
mean it you know Redknapp's always he's

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.610 
mean it you know Redknapp's always he's
it's<00:04:12.359> not<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.630> he<00:04:12.720> doesn't<00:04:12.810> have<00:04:13.019> excuses

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
it's not that he doesn't have excuses

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.530 
it's not that he doesn't have excuses
but<00:04:13.859> his<00:04:14.040> instinct<00:04:14.489> is<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.760> usually<00:04:15.120> blame<00:04:15.359> his

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
but his instinct is to usually blame his

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.810 
but his instinct is to usually blame his
own<00:04:15.690> chairman<00:04:16.229> or<00:04:16.680> one<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.160> his<00:04:17.280> own<00:04:17.489> players

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
own chairman or one of his own players

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.360 
own chairman or one of his own players
when<00:04:18.630> something<00:04:18.989> goes<00:04:19.140> wrong<00:04:19.440> his<00:04:19.859> side<00:04:20.100> so

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
when something goes wrong his side so

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.680 
when something goes wrong his side so
it's<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.549> new<00:04:20.729> one<00:04:20.910> for<00:04:21.090> him<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.299> turn<00:04:21.419> on<00:04:21.479> the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
it's a new one for him to turn on the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.949 
it's a new one for him to turn on the
ref

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
ref

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.450 
ref
although<00:04:22.229> I'm<00:04:22.350> pretty<00:04:22.590> sure<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.160> he<00:04:23.280> has

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
although I'm pretty sure that he has

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.159 
although I'm pretty sure that he has
turned<00:04:23.789> on<00:04:23.940> referees<00:04:24.360> in<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.630> past<00:04:24.810> at<00:04:25.020> some

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
turned on referees in the past at some

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.930 
turned on referees in the past at some
point<00:04:25.380> but<00:04:25.500> it's<00:04:25.979> right<00:04:26.220> it's<00:04:26.400> not<00:04:26.550> his<00:04:26.729> usual

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
point but it's right it's not his usual

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.420 
point but it's right it's not his usual
first<00:04:27.419> instinct

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
first instinct

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.129 
first instinct
you<00:04:28.639> know<00:04:28.759> easy<00:04:28.940> likes<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.539> point<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.870> finger

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
you know easy likes to point the finger

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.810 
you know easy likes to point the finger
of<00:04:30.229> blame<00:04:30.259> at<00:04:30.590> anyone<00:04:30.800> other<00:04:30.919> than<00:04:31.039> himself<00:04:31.280> so

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
of blame at anyone other than himself so

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.890 
of blame at anyone other than himself so
what<00:04:31.970> do<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.150> think<00:04:32.419> do<00:04:32.479> you<00:04:32.539> think<00:04:32.600> the

what do you think do you think the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.990 
what do you think do you think the
standard<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.440> refereeing<00:04:33.860> has<00:04:34.460> gone<00:04:34.699> down

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
standard of refereeing has gone down

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.909 
standard of refereeing has gone down
it's<00:04:35.840> had<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.289> be<00:04:36.410> in<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.590> Premier<00:04:36.889> League

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
it's had to be in the Premier League

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.080 
it's had to be in the Premier League
this<00:04:37.100> season<00:04:37.160> or<00:04:37.370> even<00:04:37.400> compare<00:04:37.850> it<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.000> the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
this season or even compare it to the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.189 
this season or even compare it to the
championship<00:04:38.570> which<00:04:38.660> you're<00:04:38.780> watching<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:39.080> lot

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
championship which you're watching a lot

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.120 
championship which you're watching a lot
of<00:04:39.320> what<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.530> genuinely<00:04:39.919> think<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:41.080> the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
of what I genuinely think is that the

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.770 
of what I genuinely think is that the
there<00:04:43.130> are<00:04:43.370> mistakes<00:04:43.910> every<00:04:44.360> weekend

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
there are mistakes every weekend

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.540 
there are mistakes every weekend
inevitably<00:04:45.320> but<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:45.620> genuinely<00:04:45.919> think<00:04:46.460> that

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
inevitably but I genuinely think that

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.180 
inevitably but I genuinely think that
the<00:04:46.880> media<00:04:47.090> at<00:04:47.570> certain<00:04:48.050> point<00:04:48.350> which<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:49.009> am

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
the media at certain point which I am

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.800 
the media at certain point which I am
obviously<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.610> member<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:50.120> think<00:04:50.449> at<00:04:50.509> certain

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
obviously a member I think at certain

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.719 
obviously a member I think at certain
points<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.199> year<00:04:51.440> it's<00:04:51.919> just<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.340> thing<00:04:52.550> that

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
points the year it's just the thing that

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.279 
points the year it's just the thing that
we<00:04:52.820> all<00:04:52.940> become<00:04:53.180> obsessed<00:04:53.570> with<00:04:53.780> because

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
we all become obsessed with because

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.749 
we all become obsessed with because
there<00:04:54.800> if<00:04:54.919> there's<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.160> couple<00:04:55.400> of<00:04:55.610> bad

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
there if there's a couple of bad

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.969 
there if there's a couple of bad
decisions<00:04:56.000> in<00:04:56.479> one<00:04:56.600> weekend<00:04:57.080> suddenly<00:04:57.710> that's

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
decisions in one weekend suddenly that's

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.620 
decisions in one weekend suddenly that's
the<00:04:58.250> talking<00:04:58.639> point<00:04:58.850> we<00:04:58.970> all<00:04:59.090> latch<00:04:59.240> onto<00:04:59.479> it

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
the talking point we all latch onto it

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.909 
the talking point we all latch onto it
because<00:04:59.720> if<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.199> are<00:05:00.350> looking<00:05:00.680> for

because if you are looking for

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.680 
because if you are looking for
refereeing<00:05:01.250> mistakes<00:05:01.610> you<00:05:02.060> don't<00:05:02.300> have<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.570> go

refereeing mistakes you don't have to go

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.930 
refereeing mistakes you don't have to go
far<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:02.930> find<00:05:03.229> them<00:05:03.410> at<00:05:03.560> any<00:05:03.860> point<00:05:04.280> any<00:05:04.460> season

Spurs<00:05:30.770> bear<00:05:31.370> in<00:05:31.520> mind<00:05:31.699> I<00:05:31.880> don't<00:05:32.090> have<00:05:32.270> much

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
love for Spurs but I thought if I had

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.350 
love for Spurs but I thought if I had
been<00:05:34.250> a<00:05:34.310> Spurs<00:05:34.580> fan<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.849> would<00:05:35.060> have<00:05:35.180> definitely

been a Spurs fan I would have definitely

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.180 
been a Spurs fan I would have definitely
thought<00:05:35.780> Cahill<00:05:36.770> should<00:05:36.919> have<00:05:37.039> gone<00:05:37.130> off

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
thought Cahill should have gone off

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.100 
thought Cahill should have gone off
Scott<00:05:37.909> Parker<00:05:38.360> with<00:05:38.539> his<00:05:38.659> legendary

Lightning's<00:05:39.860> pace<00:05:40.190> was<00:05:40.880> breaking<00:05:41.750> straight

Lightning's pace was breaking straight

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.170 
Lightning's pace was breaking straight
to<00:05:42.320> her<00:05:42.380> own<00:05:42.530> goal<00:05:42.770> had<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:43.580> go<00:05:43.760> down<00:05:43.970> as<00:05:44.150> a

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
to her own goal had to go down as a

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.850 
to her own goal had to go down as a
cynical<00:05:44.659> challenge<00:05:45.050> I<00:05:45.110> thought<00:05:45.229> spearing

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
cynical challenge I thought spearing

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.040 
cynical challenge I thought spearing
against<00:05:46.310> Fulham<00:05:47.030> was<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.240> definite<00:05:47.690> sending

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050

against Fulham was a definite sending
off<00:05:48.229> I<00:05:48.440> thought<00:05:49.039> moderate<00:05:49.520> sure<00:05:49.639> was<00:05:49.760> a

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
off I thought moderate sure was a

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.060 
off I thought moderate sure was a
penalty<00:05:50.060> yesterday<00:05:50.780> I<00:05:50.960> think<00:05:51.620> referees<00:05:51.949> are

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
penalty yesterday I think referees are

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.360 
penalty yesterday I think referees are
better<00:05:52.220> than<00:05:52.340> ever
