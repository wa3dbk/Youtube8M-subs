we<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.469> industrialized<00:00:40.469> rubber<00:00:41.040> feet<00:00:41.370> so

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
we have industrialized rubber feet so

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.250 
we have industrialized rubber feet so
that<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.180> put<00:00:42.329> them<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.540> any<00:00:42.780> surface

XV ms4 on the inside of the lid you'll
notice<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.090> phone<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
notice that we have phone now this is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.520 
notice that we have phone now this is
for<00:00:52.710> security<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.989> laptops

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
for security so that way the laptops

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
for security so that way the laptops
then<00:00:55.829> stays<00:00:56.489> secure<00:00:57.000> during<00:00:57.270> transportation

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
then stays secure during transportation

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.639 
then stays secure during transportation
and<00:00:58.260> doesn't<00:00:58.590> slide<00:00:59.750> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> inside<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> the
