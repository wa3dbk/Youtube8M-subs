00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello and welcome to hard parat in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.720
 this video the technology news of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.030
 calendar week 28 2013 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.330
 Last week I reported that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.639
 stroke a bios update for their h 87 and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.839
 b provides 85 ports with it 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.750
 you can overclock 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 et ass gigabyte biostar and assist do 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.660
 this as well 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 That's why there are hardly any reasons left 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.609
 to buy 187 construction overclockers 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.650
 she wants less for around 50 euros 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 get a b85 board 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.090
 and who a little more equipment 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.550
 want a hair 87 is questionable board 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.070
 but whether through this story the b85 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.090
 and h 87 boards maybe not too 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.940
 become more expensive 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.850
 on 22 august the pc game will be released 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.579
 splinter cell blacklist and this one gives 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 it in the deluxe variant with the purchase of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.280
 certain nvidia graphics cards for free 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.930
 also 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:01.770
 it is at the gtx 660 660 de 670 680 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.239
 760 770 and 780 you have to 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.339
 However, further choice of the dealer 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.500
 pay attention to not every dealer at 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.479
 this action joins the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.420
 Managing director of racing has been on 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.150
 twitter asked why peripherals for pc 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.960
 and xbox 360 does not manufacture for 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.659
 the playstation 3 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.939
 He replied that this simply because 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.920
 that he is a ps3 himself 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.409
 but own you to the dust collector 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 perfect he had two complete 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.549
 days with the game infamous is a 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.590
 Playstation 3 exclusive titles spent 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.900
 since then, never had the urge again 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.180
 feels the playstation 3 to take a snap 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 in other words he finds the playstation 3 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.360
 crappy 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.009
 in retrospect, he admitted that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.530
 some gamblers are disappointed 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.299
 but he could hope he could 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.799
 would have to be on the playstation 3 level 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.880
 Games I really do 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.310
 want to play 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.810
 i like infamous him and hopefully i can 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.180
 I'll get that up soon, too 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.180
 testify to the allegations of an xbox 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.729
 he replied that he was now fanboy 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.770
 sometimes peripheral to gamers and gamers 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.600
 make and decide differently than big ones 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.640
 Companies that only pay attention 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 you already look at the playstation 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.140
 4 more closely and should race around 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.459
 employees and get excited about it 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.780
 one for the console too 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 peripherals 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.520
 wrap sapphire has two new ones 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.810
 announced graphics cards and indeed 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.910
 twice a 77 30 the two 77 30 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.209
 only differ from the memory 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.720
 one has two gigabytes of ddr3 memory and 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.550
 the other 1 gb gddr5 memory with it 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.540
 should the 1 gigabyte with a whole 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.120
 be a bit brisker 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.069
 besides, that should be the last hd 7000 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.160
 that be for this year yes 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.470
 still the hd 9000 the games for the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.930
 new consoles can be more expensive if 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.940
 it stops after the nose of ea so far 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.459
 was this so when a new game came out 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.040
 has this for the consoles in the shop 60 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.170
 euro cost now ea has announced 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.880
 that you have this price yes to 65 eur 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.350
 it will be even more 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.870
 probably that other publisher 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.850
 follow suit who does not want to buy 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.560
 s.besten a new pc because 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.660
 online there are new games often 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.150
 already for less than 40 euros to buy 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.970
 kim schmitz the former vice to 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.220
 megaupload the current owner of mega 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.470
 would like an encrypted chat and e 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.299
 mail service start his relationship with 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.489
 the big security agencies is the 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.100
 traditionally not the best now wants 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.049
 use the press favor of the hour and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.030
 new services an established 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.950
 encrypted chat and e-mail service 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.570
 should promptly ensure that 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.150
 communication is a bit safer 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.799
 The web-based will measure Scottin 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.700
 should be available this summer 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.560
 be made 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.660
 because the e-mail service is encrypted 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.269
 Binder next six to nine months 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.310
 mega wants to follow through with that 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.040
 press revealing drastically increased 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.680
 Demand for appropriate offers 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.450
 Reactive contains silver moon architecture 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.609
 it is mainly for smartphones and 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.420
 he thought he was using the tablets 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.049
 Battery benchmark tested and achieved 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.209
 43,000 points 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.190
 to compare the qualcomm snapdragon 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.340
 such as in the Korean galaxy 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.620
 s 4 reached up to 30,000 points 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.690
 that means the silver moon of intel 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.640
 is about 40 percent faster than that 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.590
 current flagship on the mobile 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.530
 market but now comes the cool thing about the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.950
 whole thing the qualcomm snapdragon 800 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.590
 has four times 2 3 gigahertz and the intel 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.020
 just two times 1 1 gigahertz 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.849
 beside them the amd bulldozer 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.740
 sometimes so shit off now just has to 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.060
 still the power consumption and vote 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.650
 Intel would be in the mobile market 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.229
 hit like a bomb 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.090
 the steam summer sales are back 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.159
 who does not know what that is 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.110
 be on the game platform steam 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.419
 every summer for a few weeks 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.479
 play as cheap bioshock infinite to 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.979
 for example, there were 25 euros and skyrim 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.159
 for 23 euros 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.870
 and now it's Saturday, the 13th 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.710
 just cause 2 43 euro 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.470
 the walking dead 46 eur 24 sniper ghost 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.500
 warrior for six euros and darksiders 2 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.970
 14 euro then I thank you for what 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.479
 I hope the video has you 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.310
 like 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.020
 if yes, give them a thumbs up 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.560
 if you have a question she writes 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.780
 among them 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.169
 then I would say until the next 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.169
 Video
