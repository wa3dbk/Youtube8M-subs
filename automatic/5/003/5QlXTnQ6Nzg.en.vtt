use should cover that so we're just

use should cover that so we're just
going<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.020> brown<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.590> up

unflavored<00:02:08.850> beat<00:02:09.270> because<00:02:09.750> I'm<00:02:10.110> probably

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
unflavored beat because I'm probably

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.520 
unflavored beat because I'm probably
gonna<00:02:10.590> cook<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:12.080> especially<00:02:13.080> when<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.290> do<00:02:13.380> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

to<00:02:32.670> make<00:02:32.820> smaller<00:02:33.120> portions<00:02:33.720> since<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.110> just

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
to make smaller portions since it's just

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.860 
to make smaller portions since it's just
the<00:02:34.320> two<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> us<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> made<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.150> pints

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the two of us so I made it in a pints

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.910 
the two of us so I made it in a pints
this<00:02:37.020> time<00:02:37.970> basically<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:40.050> was<00:02:40.260> one<00:02:40.440> package

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
this time basically this was one package

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.680 
this time basically this was one package
and<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.160> was<00:02:41.460> one<00:02:41.610> package<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> packages

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
and that was one package the packages

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.640 
and that was one package the packages
were<00:02:42.840> about<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.320> pound<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.610> quarter<00:02:44.850> piece

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
were about a pound and a quarter piece

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.370 
were about a pound and a quarter piece
so<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.680> get<00:02:47.310> about<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> little<00:02:49.140> over

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
so you get about you know a little over

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.750 
so you get about you know a little over

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
half a pound of meat in each jar and I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.710 
half a pound of meat in each jar and I
did<00:02:54.510> put<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> little<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.490> dried<00:02:56.720> minced

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
down now because this is a pint

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.600 
down now because this is a pint
processor<00:03:25.650> towns<00:03:26.010> going<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.430> little

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
processor towns going to be a little

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.260 
processor towns going to be a little
shorter<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.720> gonna<00:03:27.900> be<00:03:28.080> about<00:03:28.170> 75<00:03:28.860> minutes

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
shorter it's gonna be about 75 minutes

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.670 
shorter it's gonna be about 75 minutes
but<00:03:30.270> unlike<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.780> other<00:03:30.930> stuff<00:03:31.230> we<00:03:31.410> pressure

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
but unlike the other stuff we pressure

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.400 
but unlike the other stuff we pressure
camp<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.790> pressure<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.720> going<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.020> be<00:03:34.110> up<00:03:34.260> a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
camp the pressure is going to be up a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.080 
camp the pressure is going to be up a
little<00:03:34.560> bit<00:03:34.770> we're<00:03:34.980> going<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.459> at<00:03:35.670> 11

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
little bit we're going to do this at 11

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.530 
little bit we're going to do this at 11
pounds<00:03:36.330> so<00:03:36.630> 11<00:03:37.110> pounds<00:03:37.560> for<00:03:38.070> 75<00:03:38.820> minutes

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:54.610 

I<00:03:51.439> really<00:03:52.439> hate<00:03:52.590> doing<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:53.099> we<00:03:53.340> just<00:03:53.579> four

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
jars usually I do a lot more get up to

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:27.930 
jars usually I do a lot more get up to
about<00:04:01.470> two<00:04:01.680> inches<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:02.189> water

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.980

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
water in there I've got the heat on

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.180 
water in there I've got the heat on
once<00:04:47.660> it<00:04:47.810> starts<00:04:48.169> simmering<00:04:48.380> because<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.010> was

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
once it starts simmering because it was

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.170 
once it starts simmering because it was
cold<00:04:49.490> jars<00:04:50.060> with<00:04:50.450> cold<00:04:50.750> water<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.850> we'll<00:04:53.000> put

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180

coming out till I put the weight on

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.980 
coming out till I put the weight on
there<00:04:59.840> get<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.919> up<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.160> temperature<00:05:01.810> cook<00:05:02.810> it

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
there get it up to temperature cook it

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.420 
there get it up to temperature cook it
at<00:05:03.140> 11<00:05:03.560> pounds<00:05:03.940> for<00:05:04.940> 75<00:05:05.720> minutes<00:05:06.230> we'll<00:05:07.220> let<00:05:07.400> it

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
at 11 pounds for 75 minutes we'll let it

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.850 
at 11 pounds for 75 minutes we'll let it
cool<00:05:07.669> on<00:05:07.730> its<00:05:08.090> own<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:09.110> then<00:05:09.260> pull<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.560> out<00:05:09.650> and

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
cool on its own and then pull it out and

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.940 
cool on its own and then pull it out and
see<00:05:10.010> if<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.250> tops<00:05:10.520> pop<00:05:11.530> just<00:05:12.530> like<00:05:12.740> you'd

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
see if the tops pop just like you'd

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.520 
see if the tops pop just like you'd
normally<00:05:13.130> do<00:05:13.580> with<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.360> pressure<00:05:14.690> canner<00:05:15.020> so

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
normally do with a pressure canner so

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.770 
normally do with a pressure canner so
we'll<00:05:16.130> come<00:05:16.370> back<00:05:16.580> in<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:16.880> couple<00:05:16.910> hours<00:05:17.330> and

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
we'll come back in a couple hours and

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.930 
we'll come back in a couple hours and
we'll<00:05:18.169> see<00:05:18.440> what<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:18.680> looks<00:05:18.710> like

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.300 

I'd<00:05:22.940> use<00:05:23.180> our<00:05:23.360> cam<00:05:23.600> meat<00:05:23.900> after<00:05:24.290> it<00:05:24.410> came<00:05:25.130> out

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
I'd use our cam meat after it came out

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.450 
I'd use our cam meat after it came out
of<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.639> pressure<00:05:26.300> washer<00:05:27.910> lid<00:05:28.910> sealed<00:05:30.460> got

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
of the pressure washer lid sealed got

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.130 
of the pressure washer lid sealed got
some<00:05:31.669> good<00:05:31.880> good<00:05:32.840> broth<00:05:33.110> room<00:05:33.410> there

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
some good good broth room there

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.390 
some good good broth room there
doesn't<00:05:36.140> look<00:05:36.229> like<00:05:36.290> much<00:05:36.500> but<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:37.100> doesn't

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
doesn't look like much but it doesn't
