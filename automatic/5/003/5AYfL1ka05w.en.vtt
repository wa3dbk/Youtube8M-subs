really warm outside and really sunny if

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.100 
really warm outside and really sunny if

you can do it early in the morning or in

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.590 
you can do it early in the morning or in
the<00:03:34.290> evening<00:03:34.410> before<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.880> know<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> Sun<00:03:36.390> Goes

the evening before you know the Sun Goes

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.670 
the evening before you know the Sun Goes
Down<00:03:37.520> then<00:03:38.520> that<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.850> what<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.090> recommend<00:03:39.680> also

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
Down then that is what I recommend also

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.160 
Down then that is what I recommend also
an<00:03:41.220> overcast<00:03:41.700> day<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.240> actually<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:42.960> the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
an overcast day is actually like the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.270 
an overcast day is actually like the
perfect<00:03:43.500> day<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.920> spray<00:03:44.640> if<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.740> are<00:03:46.740> able<00:03:46.920> to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
perfect day to spray if you are able to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.970 
perfect day to spray if you are able to
now<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.360> do<00:03:48.480> still<00:03:49.050> think<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.380> it's<00:03:49.650> best<00:03:49.860> to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
now I do still think that it's best to

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.160 
now I do still think that it's best to
avoid<00:03:50.130> doing<00:03:50.610> this<00:03:50.760> when<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:51.630> super<00:03:51.810> hot

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
avoid doing this when it's super hot

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.710 
avoid doing this when it's super hot
outside<00:03:52.490> because<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.970> burn<00:03:57.210> your<00:03:57.480> leaves

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
outside because you can burn your leaves

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
I've conducted an experiment this year

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.420 
I've conducted an experiment this year
I've<00:04:30.090> planted<00:04:30.600> cucumbers<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.590> spot<00:04:31.830> for

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
I've planted cucumbers in this spot for

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.050 
I've planted cucumbers in this spot for
several<00:04:32.880> seasons<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:34.040> honestly

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
several seasons and honestly

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.030 
several seasons and honestly
can't<00:04:36.690> say<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.080> I've<00:04:37.170> had<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.500> best<00:04:37.650> success

can't say that I've had the best success

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.400 
can't say that I've had the best success
I<00:04:38.340> thought<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.330> was<00:04:39.450> because<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.780> was<00:04:40.020> planting

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
I thought it was because I was planting

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.990 
I thought it was because I was planting
more<00:04:40.590> than<00:04:40.710> one<00:04:40.830> variety<00:04:40.980> but<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.580> turns<00:04:41.790> out

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
more than one variety but it turns out

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.870 
more than one variety but it turns out
maybe<00:04:42.300> it's<00:04:42.720> just<00:04:42.930> this<00:04:43.170> area<00:04:43.440> up<00:04:43.680> here<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.520> I

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
maybe it's just this area up here so I

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.700 
maybe it's just this area up here so I
have<00:04:45.090> cucumbers<00:04:45.630> in<00:04:45.750> another<00:04:46.020> section<00:04:46.380> of<00:04:46.650> the
