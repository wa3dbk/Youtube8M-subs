00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
we'll get to that shortly the reason why

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.580 
we'll get to that shortly the reason why
I<00:01:18.910> could<00:01:19.240> see<00:01:19.390> good<00:01:19.599> things<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.140> having<00:01:20.319> wall

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
to go beyond the traditional flat

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.809 
to go beyond the traditional flat

let's<00:01:35.610> start<00:01:35.880> by<00:01:36.090> breaking<00:01:36.450> down<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:37.170> stage

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
let's start by breaking down a stage

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.070 
let's start by breaking down a stage
into<00:01:37.860> wireframes<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.450> whole<00:01:39.690> situation

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
into wireframes so the whole situation

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.620 
into wireframes so the whole situation
is<00:01:40.620> easier<00:01:41.010> to<00:01:41.130> grasp<00:01:41.370> we've<00:01:42.330> got<00:01:42.510> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
is easier to grasp we've got the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050 
is easier to grasp we've got the
wireframes<00:01:43.140> illustrating<00:01:43.950> surfaces<00:01:44.729> lined

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
out in space in this example we have a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
out in space in this example we have a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.220 
to universe the way I see it becoming
possible<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.459> by<00:02:11.640> having<00:02:11.850> active<00:02:12.450> surfaces<00:02:13.050> on

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
possible is by having active surfaces on

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.380 
possible is by having active surfaces on
the<00:02:13.470> wall<00:02:13.620> boundaries<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.640> stages<00:02:15.060> there

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the wall boundaries in the stages there

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.960 
the wall boundaries in the stages there
are<00:02:15.600> more<00:02:16.290> naturally<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.280> those<00:02:17.519> active

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
are more naturally I see those active

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.600 
are more naturally I see those active
surfaces<00:02:18.540> becoming<00:02:18.989> useful<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.590> places<00:02:20.010> where

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
surfaces becoming useful in places where

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.270 
surfaces becoming useful in places where
there<00:02:20.820> are<00:02:20.940> high<00:02:20.970> trees<00:02:21.900> crossing<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.190> out

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
there are high trees crossing in and out

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.900 
there are high trees crossing in and out
of<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.910> wall<00:02:24.570> boundaries<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.320> status

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
of the wall boundaries in the status

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.490 
of the wall boundaries in the status
although<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.570> same<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.110> using

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
although it's the same as using

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.890 
although it's the same as using
traditional<00:02:29.130> walls<00:02:29.700> sticking<00:02:30.420> up<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.690> this

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
traditional walls sticking up in this

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.020 
traditional walls sticking up in this
guy<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.800> just<00:02:31.950> about<00:02:32.190> using<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
guy so it's just about using the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.270 
guy so it's just about using the
surfaces<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.019> best<00:02:34.230> way<00:02:34.440> by<00:02:34.830> making<00:02:35.190> them

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
surfaces in the best way by making them

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.490 
surfaces in the best way by making them
active<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.269> can<00:02:36.420> use<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.989> surfaces

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
active so that you can use the surfaces

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.770 
active so that you can use the surfaces
for<00:02:37.680> new<00:02:37.860> extraordinary<00:02:38.850> moves<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.420> perform

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
for new extraordinary moves to perform

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.870 
for new extraordinary moves to perform

etc<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.690> walls<00:02:45.900> also<00:02:46.799> emphasizes<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.700> use

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
etc on the walls also emphasizes the use

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.880

of<00:02:47.940> large<00:02:48.360> ninja<00:02:48.810> jumps<00:02:49.110> which<00:02:49.440> basically

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
of large ninja jumps which basically

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.920 
of large ninja jumps which basically
means<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.670> makes<00:02:50.850> space<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.600> large

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
means that it makes space for large

let<00:03:29.609> me<00:03:29.730> show<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:29.910> an<00:03:30.150> example<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.690> how<00:03:31.109> I

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
let me show you an example of how I

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.650 
let me show you an example of how I
picture<00:03:31.769> some<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.880> already<00:03:33.480> existing

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
picture some of the already existing

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.610 
picture some of the already existing

first<00:03:42.200> they<00:03:42.590> need<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.920> map<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.550> stage<00:03:43.970> wall

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.600 
fighting on one flat surface I have the
