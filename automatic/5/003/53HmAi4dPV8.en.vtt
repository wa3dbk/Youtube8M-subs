cotton<00:00:59.320> or<00:00:59.740> but<00:01:00.250> it's<00:01:00.370> not<00:01:00.489> really<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:00.850> I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
cotton or but it's not really that I

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.300 
cotton or but it's not really that I
mean<00:01:01.360> if<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:01.720> see<00:01:01.989> my<00:01:02.260> angora<00:01:02.770> in<00:01:03.040> there

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
mean if you see my angora in there

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.109 
mean if you see my angora in there
you're<00:01:03.550> basically<00:01:04.140> supporting<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
you're basically supporting the

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.529 
you're basically supporting the
treatment<00:01:07.569> and<00:01:07.810> they<00:01:08.770> showed<00:01:09.009> me<00:01:09.189> the<00:01:09.310> hole

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
treatment and they showed me the hole

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.639 
treatment and they showed me the hole
they<00:01:10.539> tried<00:01:10.749> to<00:01:10.869> show<00:01:10.990> me<00:01:11.109> the<00:01:11.200> video<00:01:11.289> actually

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
they tried to show me the video actually

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.489 
they tried to show me the video actually
but<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.880> couldn't<00:01:13.210> watch<00:01:13.329> it<00:01:13.359> it<00:01:13.719> was<00:01:14.259> too

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:14.499 
but I couldn't watch it it was too

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.730 
but I couldn't watch it it was too
intense<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.429> was<00:01:15.549> too<00:01:15.789> traumatizing<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.259> I

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
intense it was too traumatizing and I

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.160 
intense it was too traumatizing and I
think<00:01:18.340> we<00:01:18.729> just<00:01:18.759> to<00:01:19.060> not<00:01:19.450> be<00:01:19.479> able<00:01:19.749> to<00:01:19.899> watch<00:01:20.139> it

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
think we just to not be able to watch it

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.870 
think we just to not be able to watch it
I<00:01:20.469> can't<00:01:20.710> imagine<00:01:20.799> what<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.520> animals

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
I can't imagine what the animals

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.779 
I can't imagine what the animals
actually<00:01:22.060> go<00:01:22.420> through<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:24.130> up<00:01:24.280> there<00:01:24.490> it

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
actually go through and it's up there it

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.669 
actually go through and it's up there it
was<00:01:24.939> really<00:01:25.179> not<00:01:25.329> fair<00:01:25.630> for<00:01:25.960> them<00:01:26.079> to<00:01:26.139> be

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
was really not fair for them to be

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.260 
was really not fair for them to be
treated<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.280> way<00:01:27.340> just<00:01:27.700> so<00:01:27.819> we<00:01:27.939> can<00:01:28.060> wear

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
treated that way just so we can wear

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.719 
treated that way just so we can wear
something<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:29.049> looks<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.889> little<00:01:29.979> anything

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
something that looks a little anything

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.989 
something that looks a little anything
oh<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:32.200> truly<00:01:32.709> believe<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.039> this<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.700> think

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
oh I I truly believe in this and I think

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:35.429 
oh I I truly believe in this and I think
it<00:01:34.179> takes<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.479> little<00:01:34.569> bit<00:01:34.719> of<00:01:34.840> work<00:01:35.049> from<00:01:35.259> our

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
it takes a little bit of work from our

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.219 
it takes a little bit of work from our
end<00:01:35.709> to<00:01:36.579> not<00:01:37.149> support<00:01:37.539> these<00:01:37.659> kind<00:01:37.929> of<00:01:37.990> clothes

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
end to not support these kind of clothes

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.830 
end to not support these kind of clothes
and<00:01:38.560> not<00:01:39.310> supposed<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.729> treatment<00:01:40.209> and<00:01:40.389> I

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
and not supposed to treatment and I

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.399 
and not supposed to treatment and I
think<00:01:41.259> in<00:01:41.499> time<00:01:41.740> we'll<00:01:42.310> be<00:01:42.490> able<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:43.409> ensure

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
think in time we'll be able to ensure

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.230 
think in time we'll be able to ensure
that<00:01:44.619> even<00:01:44.950> light<00:01:45.219> starts<00:01:45.579> with<00:01:45.670> rabbits<00:01:46.060> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
that even light starts with rabbits and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.080 
that even light starts with rabbits and
I<00:01:46.539> actually<00:01:47.109> believe<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.709> days<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.429> a<00:01:48.609> really

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
I actually believe the days of a really

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.929 
I actually believe the days of a really
good<00:01:49.299> happy<00:01:49.630> life<00:01:49.659> as<00:01:50.109> we<00:01:51.009> could<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.609> know<00:01:51.700> you

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939
