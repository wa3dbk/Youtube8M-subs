00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
times let me look at BP BP it's uh BP

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.610 
times let me look at BP BP it's uh BP
says<00:04:14.580> it's<00:04:14.760> 12<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.720> basically<00:04:16.200> it's<00:04:16.410> twelve

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
says it's 12 so basically it's twelve

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.930 
says it's 12 so basically it's twelve
o'clock<00:04:16.680> what<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.130> think<00:04:17.400> I'm<00:04:17.489> gonna<00:04:17.580> do<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.880> I'm

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
o'clock what I think I'm gonna do is I'm

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.599 
o'clock what I think I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.120> go<00:04:18.269> make<00:04:18.560> some<00:04:19.560> other<00:04:19.859> stuff<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:20.430> let

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
going to go make some other stuff so let

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.180 
going to go make some other stuff so let
me<00:04:20.700> make<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.880> fish<00:04:21.450> trap<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:22.229> guess<00:04:22.590> that'd<00:04:22.950> be<00:04:23.160> a

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
me make a fish trap I guess that'd be a

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.040 
me make a fish trap I guess that'd be a
good<00:04:23.700> start<00:04:23.760> I

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
good start I

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.529 
good start I
think<00:04:25.430> let<00:04:26.430> me<00:04:26.490> see<00:04:26.639> if<00:04:26.699> I<00:04:26.759> can<00:04:26.879> find<00:04:27.060> some<00:04:27.240> more

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
think let me see if I can find some more

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.140 
think let me see if I can find some more
rope<00:04:27.840> on<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.620> island<00:04:29.190> first<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:29.879> that<00:04:30.000> way<00:04:30.120> I

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
rope on the island first so that way I

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.270 
rope on the island first so that way I
can<00:04:30.330> make<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.449> fish<00:04:30.659> trap<00:04:30.919> okay<00:04:31.919> there's<00:04:32.099> no

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
can make a fish trap okay there's no

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.930 
can make a fish trap okay there's no
more<00:04:32.460> rope<00:04:32.699> but<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.419> island<00:04:34.169> is<00:04:34.319> riddled<00:04:34.710> with

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
more rope but the island is riddled with

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.460 
more rope but the island is riddled with
potato<00:04:35.940> plants<00:04:36.389> so<00:04:36.599> maybe<00:04:36.930> we<00:04:37.169> can<00:04:37.289> do

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
potato plants so maybe we can do

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.930 
potato plants so maybe we can do
something<00:04:37.710> with<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:37.979> I<00:04:38.310> don't<00:04:38.669> know<00:04:38.759> if<00:04:38.849> the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
something with that I don't know if the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.960 
something with that I don't know if the
potato<00:04:39.330> plants<00:04:39.990> grow<00:04:40.319> back<00:04:40.800> but<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.490> think<00:04:41.879> that

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
potato plants grow back but I think that

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.760 
potato plants grow back but I think that
they<00:04:42.360> should<00:04:42.389> that<00:04:43.289> would<00:04:43.349> be<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.530> cool

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
they should that would be a cool

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.680 
they should that would be a cool
addition<00:04:44.099> or<00:04:44.490> farming<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.210> think<00:04:45.389> that'd<00:04:45.539> be<00:04:45.659> a

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
addition or farming I think that'd be a

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.659 
addition or farming I think that'd be a
good<00:04:45.750> ad<00:04:46.110> if<00:04:46.530> they<00:04:46.770> add<00:04:46.919> that<00:04:47.220> in<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> game

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
good ad if they add that in the game

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.330 
good ad if they add that in the game
like<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.030> farming<00:04:48.599> aspect<00:04:49.259> that'd<00:04:50.069> be<00:04:50.099> pretty

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
like a farming aspect that'd be pretty

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.999 
like a farming aspect that'd be pretty
cool<00:04:50.460> but<00:04:51.360> um<00:04:51.539> I<00:04:51.900> got<00:04:52.470> I'm<00:04:52.650> gonna<00:04:52.830> start
