Heinie's<00:00:05.930> is<00:00:06.290> a<00:00:06.319> form<00:00:06.650> exercise<00:00:07.190> that

Heinie's is a form exercise that

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.129 
Heinie's is a form exercise that
primarily<00:00:07.940> developed<00:00:08.360> strength<00:00:08.900> and

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
primarily developed strength and

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.500 
primarily developed strength and

endurance of the hip flexors the muscles
that<00:00:11.690> lift<00:00:11.960> the<00:00:12.200> knees<00:00:12.379> and<00:00:12.650> prevent<00:00:13.160> plotting

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
in the running stride high knees can

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.830 
in the running stride high knees can
also<00:00:16.190> develop<00:00:16.580> strength<00:00:17.060> and<00:00:17.240> endurance<00:00:17.480> of

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
also develop strength and endurance of

we<00:00:40.730> recommend<00:00:41.059> teaching<00:00:41.629> it<00:00:41.750> in<00:00:41.930> four<00:00:42.199> phases

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
we recommend teaching it in four phases

the arms at the sides slowly lift the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.040 
the arms at the sides slowly lift the
knees<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.760> thighs<00:00:50.000> are<00:00:50.030> parallel<00:00:50.359> to<00:00:50.809> the
