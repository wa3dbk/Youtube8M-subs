(...) two months, made of various materials

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.100
made of cardboard, cloth and paint

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.640
and they are from D.F. (Mexico City)

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.220
Ok. Well...

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.320
As soon as they are ready ... come on, audio please

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.100
Group #3 ...

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.980
Fools! they do not know what awaits them...

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.340
With all the candy that Kagome gave me I feel so fed up!

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.600
why adults always make that funny face when I ask about love?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.320
I want somebody to fall in love with me, now!

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.240
Someone of you... maybe?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.940
What about me?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.080
¡Kagome! ¡Sango! ¡Beast! ¡Perverted monk!

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.940
¡HELP MEEE!

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.280
Shippou!!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.720
NOOO! He has stolen his inocence...

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.860
Naraku, you are such a pervert...

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.640
Look who says it!

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.620
Shippou! Dwarf traitor!

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.720
(prepares to attack)

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.300
Inuyasha! SIT!!

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.660
Naraku! You'll pay for this!!

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.640
No, no no no! WAIT!...

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.900
He kisses very well...

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.040
WHAT?!

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.800
AHH??!

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.480
EWWW! That's disgusting!!

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.080
At least, he doesn't kiss dead people...

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.760
Yes! That's even more disgusting, Inuyasha!

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.880
Now that I think about it, it's true...

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.440
Inuyasha, you like a dead one.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.360
You too, Sango?!

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.140
I see that love flows here

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.060
someone of you, beautiful ladies...

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.220
want to have my babies?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360
Oh! So many beauties here!

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.460
Maybe... you, precious?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.840
excellency! you are a womanizer!

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.320
well, at least he was honest about his feelings

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.440
why don't you do the same? Couple of fools!

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.140
Sango, (you are) my life...

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.760
Excellency...

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.300
yes...?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.160
Can't I...

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.480
...date both? (refering to Kikyo and Kagome)

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
No-no! Wait!

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.720
It was a joke!

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.140
You're such a fool!

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.360
You are never going to...!

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.400
...and everyone lived happily ever after.
