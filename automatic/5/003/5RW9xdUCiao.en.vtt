00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:23.320
 a few days ago there was a 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.710
 car driven by fish this is a 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.990
 automobile concept that incorporates a 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.419
 fish tank in the back of the car 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.160
 this car has seats 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.050
 able to rotate 365 degrees which does not 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.260
 only allows a descent with greater 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.020
 comfort but that also allows you 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.110
 admire fish comfortably 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.050
 included in this eccentric vehicle 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.720
 This car has been named as 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.470
 wind start and was presented in the lounge 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.320
 detroit 2015 where you could see 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.190
 that the role of fish is not only 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.290
 decorative have been trained so that 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.780
 with his own natural behavior in 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.660
 the water and with the help of the signals of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.590
 gps can drive the car in the 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.259
 more chaotic traffic situations 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.899
 The wing star also comes equipped with 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.509
 all radar sensors and cameras 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:28.020
 necessary to ensure safety 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.929
 in autonomous driving has 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.460
 very modern features both in its 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:37.119
 inside as on its outside 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.150
 It is also a hybrid vehicle which 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.900
 greatly reduces the use of 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.570
 gasoline 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.240
 now for all of us the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.090
 passionate in which I filia this 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.909
 type of vehicle will be good or bad 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.340
 although who would not like to drive 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.819
 a car and take your loved ones with you 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.259
 fish or even beyond who does not 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.140
 I would like them to be the ones 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.079
 drive the car this sounds 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.080
 fascinating and out of reality but 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.640
 little by little the technology is reaching 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.610
 our imagination 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.680
 the concept is very striking goes to the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.370
 vanguard with technology and 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.200
 comfort 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.890
 but the trousseau implemented in the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.800
 automobile will be good for fish 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.709
 think about the movement of the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.240
 car shake to considerable and 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.690
 constantly the aquarium 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.840
 when the vehicle is in the open 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.350
 temperature will constantly change 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.620
 causing diseases to fish 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.980
 the small space of only 20 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.320
 liters that gives the fish 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.490
 will cause stress deformities and a 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.319
 constant rise of monya and parameters 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.379
 unbalanced 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.719
 This concept car is very eye-catching 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.209
 and can be acquired by many 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:08.120

 a disappointment or a great joy with
