fine<00:00:21.590> Matthew<00:00:22.590> Macklin<00:00:25.160> in<00:00:26.160> my<00:00:26.369> opinion<00:00:26.550> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
fine Matthew Macklin in my opinion I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910 
fine Matthew Macklin in my opinion I
think<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.180> really<00:00:27.420> good<00:00:27.630> fight<00:00:27.920> this

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
think this is a really good fight this

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.189 
think this is a really good fight this
is<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> fight<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.550> wouldn't<00:00:29.699> mind<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.420> think

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
is a fight I wouldn't mind I think

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.950 
is a fight I wouldn't mind I think
Macklin<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.890> top<00:00:32.489> middleweight<00:00:33.120> fighter<00:00:33.660> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
Macklin is a top middleweight fighter so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.569 
Macklin is a top middleweight fighter so
this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> big<00:00:35.100> stud<00:00:35.550> step<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:37.579> galavan

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
this is a big stud step up for galavan

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.600 
this is a big stud step up for galavan
compared<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> cheetah<00:00:39.780> fight'<00:00:40.610> Macklin

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
compared to the cheetah fight' Macklin

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
compared to the cheetah fight' Macklin
will<00:00:41.850> probably<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.450> his<00:00:43.140> best<00:00:43.379> opponent<00:00:44.280> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
will probably be his best opponent so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.639 
will probably be his best opponent so
far<00:00:44.820> nothing's<00:00:45.480> official<00:00:45.600> yet<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.530> that
