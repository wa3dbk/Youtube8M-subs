00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 she 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 e 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.060
 that was how it sounds peace 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.040
 so ringer ut feels the ultra tremolos of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.830
 at behringer is a copy of the post 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.509
 and r2 so we find three settings 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.100
 relatively simple on it found 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:36.259
 theirs is the speed of the tremolo the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:40.310
 wave so waveform of the signal so 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.460
 triangular or rather to the right 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.020
 in squares and after the def name that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.799
 defines that the force of the effect 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.979
 with the mine and a max so here are some 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.220
 relatively simple settings for talking 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.890
 of this pedal so go relatively 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.320
 low solid dir it remains a shell in 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.060
 plastic the system to remove the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.090
 cash on to remove the pile of this 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.479
 done on the side there with the little zero 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.769
 it's because there is better 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.959
 the construction is a little cheap 1 but 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.090
 after that it's a pedal that is not 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.480
 not very expensive twice in the 35 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.150
 euros 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 we can find it at the price of 20 or 15 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.420
 euros in occasion 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.930
 which is still three to four 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.010
 times cheaper than the bump So here 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.190
 for those who have the utility of a 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.260
 tremolos very rarely 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.290
 will always be able to turn to this 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.600
 pedal bering so he picks up a few 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.090
 the shape of the pedals back except that 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.530
 feeding is on the side you place 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.440
 to be on the front on the front one 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.590
 has nothing of the pedal here so it was 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.180
 the test from there behringer ultra tremolos 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.180
 no how does it sound soon
