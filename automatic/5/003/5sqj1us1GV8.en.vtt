00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
dropout he went to the I guess it was a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.570 
dropout he went to the I guess it was a
derby<00:01:07.350> maybe<00:01:07.530> instead<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> final<00:01:08.369> exam

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

but<00:01:08.729> he<00:01:08.820> always<00:01:09.060> had<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> certain<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:10.470> of

but he always had a certain kind of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
but he always had a certain kind of
intellectual<00:01:11.400> dimension<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:12.750> was

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.420 
intellectual dimension which was
appropriate<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> new<00:01:14.250> generation

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
appropriate I think for a new generation

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280
