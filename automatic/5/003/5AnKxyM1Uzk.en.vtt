00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
right so that's perfect because I have a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240 
right so that's perfect because I have a
round<00:00:41.850> face<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.320> more<00:00:43.590> full<00:00:43.980> cheeks

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
round face so I have more full cheeks

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
round face so I have more full cheeks
and<00:00:44.610> where<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> want<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.540> place<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.870> bronzer

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and where you want to place the bronzer

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
and where you want to place the bronzer
is<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.470> little<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:46.890> different<00:00:47.400> what's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
is a little bit different what's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.100 
is a little bit different what's
important<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.390> where<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.660> Sun<00:00:48.930> would

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
important is where the Sun would

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.690 
important is where the Sun would
naturally<00:00:49.170> hit<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.830> planes<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.310> your<00:00:50.460> face

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
naturally hit the planes of your face

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.210 
naturally hit the planes of your face
and<00:00:51.150> so<00:00:51.630> I<00:00:51.660> definitely<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.560> bronzer<00:00:52.950> you

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
and so I definitely put the bronzer you

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.880 
and so I definitely put the bronzer you
know<00:00:53.340> across<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:53.910> forehead<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.560> you<00:00:55.710> can

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
know across my forehead and then you can

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.190 
know across my forehead and then you can
add<00:00:56.040> a<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.460> bit<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.880> into<00:00:57.630> this<00:00:57.900> cheek

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
add a little bit more into this cheek

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.930 
add a little bit more into this cheek
area<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.950> then<00:00:59.070> also<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.400> me<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.820> little

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
area but then also for me with a little

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.080 
area but then also for me with a little
bit<00:01:00.090> different<00:01:00.450> is<00:01:00.540> also<00:01:00.840> creating<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.350> jaw

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
bit different is also creating that jaw

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.820 
bit different is also creating that jaw
so<00:01:03.090> bringing<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.480> bronzer<00:01:03.840> down<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so bringing the bronzer down in here and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.350 
so bringing the bronzer down in here and
when<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> rounder<00:01:05.790> face<00:01:05.820> it's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
when you have a rounder face it's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
when you have a rounder face it's
important<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.049> accent<00:01:07.800> your<00:01:07.860> jaw<00:01:08.160> line

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
important to accent your jaw line

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850 
important to accent your jaw line
because<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.570> makes<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.870> face<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.200> appear<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
because that makes the face to appear a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.320 
because that makes the face to appear a
little<00:01:11.040> bit<00:01:11.160> more<00:01:11.370> square<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.940> would<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> use

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
little bit more square so would you use

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
little bit more square so would you use
the<00:01:12.480> same<00:01:12.690> powder<00:01:13.050> brush<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> smaller<00:01:13.920> brush

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the same powder brush or a smaller brush

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
the same powder brush or a smaller brush
for<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.640> definition<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:15.600> would<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.870> do

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
for more definition or what would you do

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.950 
for more definition or what would you do
yeah<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.950> would<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:18.090> more<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.450> an<00:01:18.540> oval<00:01:18.780> face

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
yeah I would for more of an oval face

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.360 
yeah I would for more of an oval face
like<00:01:19.200> yours<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.650> would<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.010> brush<00:01:20.190> that's

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
like yours I would use the brush that's

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.000 
like yours I would use the brush that's
maybe<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.730> little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.180> loose<00:01:21.770> but<00:01:22.770> when

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
maybe a little bit more loose but when

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.620 
maybe a little bit more loose but when
you're<00:01:23.159> trying<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> concentrate<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> color<00:01:24.480> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
you're trying to concentrate the color a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.149 
you're trying to concentrate the color a
little<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.050> little<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.470> using<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
little bit a little bit more using a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.680 
little bit a little bit more using a
brush<00:01:26.370> that<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.060> bit<00:01:27.180> tighter<00:01:27.420> so

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
brush that is a little bit tighter so

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.560 
brush that is a little bit tighter so
you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:28.800> precise<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.940> for<00:01:30.300> blush

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you can be more precise so for blush

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.590 
you can be more precise so for blush
from<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.860> round<00:01:32.070> face<00:01:32.370> what<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.330> want

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
from one of a round face what you want

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480 
from one of a round face what you want
to<00:01:33.690> do<00:01:33.870> is<00:01:34.080> I<00:01:34.290> would<00:01:34.440> actually<00:01:34.860> apply<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.190> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
to do is I would actually apply it a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.390 
to do is I would actually apply it a
little<00:01:35.729> bit<00:01:35.880> higher<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> cheekbone<00:01:37.400> more

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
little bit higher on the cheekbone more

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.490 
little bit higher on the cheekbone more
here<00:01:38.850> versus<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.450> Apple<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
here versus on the Apple because if you
