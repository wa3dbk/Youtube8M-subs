specifically<00:01:37.670> meant<00:01:37.850> for<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.060> feet<00:01:38.270> work

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
specifically meant for the feet work

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.410 
specifically meant for the feet work
best<00:01:38.869> because<00:01:39.350> they<00:01:39.560> are<00:01:39.770> much<00:01:40.430> stronger<00:01:40.790> so

wrong for me shave cream makes all the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.560

difference<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.769> put<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.220> all<00:02:22.430> over<00:02:22.459> my<00:02:22.850> legs<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
difference I put it all over my legs and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.350 
difference I put it all over my legs and
I<00:02:24.320> try<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.650> step<00:02:24.890> outside<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.760> shower<00:02:26.000> or

I try to step outside of the shower or

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.509 
I try to step outside of the shower or
away<00:02:26.840> from<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.110> water<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.560> then<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.010> go<00:02:28.310> in

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
away from the water and then I go in

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.280 
away from the water and then I go in
lines<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.510> reason<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.840> do<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.110> is

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
lines and the reason I do this is

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.930 
lines and the reason I do this is
because<00:02:30.320> it<00:02:30.709> helps<00:02:30.950> me<00:02:31.070> not<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.340> miss<00:02:31.489> any<00:02:31.670> hair

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
because it helps me not to miss any hair

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.789 
because it helps me not to miss any hair
and<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.570> also<00:02:32.750> provides<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.350> cushion<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.769> I

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
and it also provides a cushion so I

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.530 
and it also provides a cushion so I
don't<00:02:33.980> cut<00:02:34.130> myself<00:02:34.310> next<00:02:35.269> I'm<00:02:35.390> going<00:02:35.480> to

I like to rub the mitt together so I

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.170 
I like to rub the mitt together so I

to<00:06:46.210> a<00:06:46.300> mason<00:06:46.750> jar<00:06:46.780> now<00:06:47.380> you<00:06:47.440> can<00:06:47.650> use<00:06:47.770> flat

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
to a mason jar now you can use flat

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.800 
to a mason jar now you can use flat
water<00:06:48.220> but<00:06:48.490> I'm<00:06:48.610> gonna<00:06:48.730> use<00:06:48.940> sparkling<00:06:49.600> water

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
water but I'm gonna use sparkling water

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.630 
water but I'm gonna use sparkling water
because<00:06:50.140> I<00:06:50.170> love<00:06:50.590> it<00:06:50.770> and<00:06:50.890> it's<00:06:51.310> a<00:06:51.430> really

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640 
because I love it and it's a really

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.960 
because I love it and it's a really
yummy<00:06:52.090> refreshing<00:06:53.080> fizzy<00:06:53.740> drink<00:06:54.130> that<00:06:54.730> is<00:06:54.940> a

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
yummy refreshing fizzy drink that is a

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.330 
yummy refreshing fizzy drink that is a
great<00:06:55.270> alternative<00:06:55.420> to<00:06:55.840> soda<00:06:56.710> this<00:06:57.040> summer

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
great alternative to soda this summer

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.840 
great alternative to soda this summer
because<00:06:57.700> it<00:06:57.850> doesn't<00:06:58.090> have<00:06:58.210> any<00:06:58.360> sweetener

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
because it doesn't have any sweetener

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.340 
because it doesn't have any sweetener
so<00:07:01.850> that<00:07:02.000> pretty<00:07:02.150> much<00:07:02.270> sums<00:07:02.390> up<00:07:02.840> my<00:07:03.020> summer

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
so that pretty much sums up my summer

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.530 
so that pretty much sums up my summer
routine<00:07:03.830> but<00:07:04.220> I'm<00:07:04.430> just<00:07:04.610> really<00:07:04.820> excited<00:07:05.030> to
