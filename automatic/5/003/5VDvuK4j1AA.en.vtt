completely<00:01:35.159> wraps<00:01:35.549> around<00:01:36.590> unlike<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> new

completely wraps around unlike the new

completely wraps around unlike the new
spike<00:01:38.549> series<00:01:39.409> which<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:41.509> attach<00:01:42.509> the

side that this is actually rubberized so

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.369 
side that this is actually rubberized so
it's<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.899> step<00:01:46.349> up<00:01:47.720> from<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.929> old<00:01:49.050> spike

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:49.379 
it's a little step up from the old spike

it's a little step up from the old spike
series<00:01:49.709> we<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.099> wrap<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.729> we'll

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
series we have the wrap there but we'll

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.630 
series we have the wrap there but we'll
also<00:01:51.239> see<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.539> size<00:01:51.869> difference<00:01:52.349> here<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.739> like

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
also see a size difference here to like

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.469 
also see a size difference here to like
scimitars<00:01:54.390> specs<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:55.229> longer<00:01:56.149> go<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.330> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
scimitars specs much longer go with the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.089 
scimitars specs much longer go with the
the<00:01:57.899> buoy<00:01:58.700> new<00:01:59.700> spike<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.739> so<00:02:01.739> that<00:02:01.920> gives

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:02.099 
the buoy new spike here so that gives

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.680 
the buoy new spike here so that gives
you<00:02:02.220> an<00:02:02.280> idea<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.700> size<00:02:05.599> apparently<00:02:06.599> these

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
you an idea of the size apparently these

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.009 
you an idea of the size apparently these
large<00:02:07.170> hands<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.840> feels<00:02:09.840> pretty
