right now birds are trying to store that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.019 
right now birds are trying to store that
energy<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.010> up<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.220> us<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.550> provide<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
energy so it's up to us to provide the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.519 
energy so it's up to us to provide the
seed<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.300> them<00:00:21.750> because<00:00:21.960> they've<00:00:22.140> depleted
