with<00:00:39.090> him<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> best<00:00:41.160> match<00:00:41.460> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610

you're you're good teams as he is from
the<00:01:03.809> American<00:01:04.350> League<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.670> bit

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the American League so it's a little bit

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.370 
the American League so it's a little bit
more<00:01:06.000> difficult<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.570> back<00:01:06.750> chemistry<00:01:07.260> but

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
more difficult to get back chemistry but

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
more difficult to get back chemistry but
if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.619> sort<00:01:07.950> him<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.430> some<00:01:08.610> French

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
chem and it felt like it because he was

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
chem and it felt like it because he was
absolutely<00:01:15.240> phenomenal<00:01:15.390> his<00:01:16.080> finishing<00:01:16.470> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
absolutely phenomenal his finishing is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
in the air and he has great finishing

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
in the air and he has great finishing
and<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> four<00:01:46.170> star<00:01:46.409> weak<00:01:46.619> foot<00:01:46.829> means<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.220> he<00:01:47.310> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

on his weaker side his left foot you're

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.960 
on his weaker side his left foot you're
probably<00:01:49.590> gonna<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> few<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.549> shots<00:01:50.759> on
