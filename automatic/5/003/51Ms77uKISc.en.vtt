three well it's not a glitch but I just
learned<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.420> brand-new<00:01:35.540> glitch

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.730 

I'll<00:01:44.120> try<00:01:44.480> to<00:01:44.510> pull<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:44.870> off<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.320> different

I'll try to pull it off the different

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:55.180 
I'll try to pull it off the different
with<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.970> south<00:01:51.430> well<00:01:53.470> i'll<00:01:54.470> see<00:01:54.530> if<00:01:54.890> i<00:01:55.010> can

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
with the south well i'll see if i can

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.100 
with the south well i'll see if i can
get<00:01:55.280> between<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.850> rock

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.080 

you<00:02:00.110> might<00:02:00.350> not<00:02:00.560> be

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.490 

yes<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.640> now<00:02:09.849> he's<00:02:10.360> only<00:02:10.599> really<00:02:11.349> check

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.770 

we're<00:02:15.070> not<00:02:15.450> Wow<00:02:16.450> dog<00:02:17.260> away<00:02:17.560> from<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> glitch

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.270 

seriously<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.950> was<00:02:22.100> such<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.459> waste<00:02:24.069> maybe<00:02:25.069> I

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
seriously that was such a waste maybe I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.640 
seriously that was such a waste maybe I
think<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.910> can<00:02:26.120> jump<00:02:26.360> out<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.600> bounds<00:02:27.200> if<00:02:27.410> you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
think you can jump out of bounds if you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:37.840 
think you can jump out of bounds if you
jump<00:02:27.950> far<00:02:28.280> enough

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.440 

laughs<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:38.960> here<00:02:39.320> now<00:02:40.150> for<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.270> real

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
harder you have to do the cartwheel move

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:09.340 
harder you have to do the cartwheel move
on<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:05.950> man<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.550> entertain<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:09.080> keep

not<00:03:29.360> for<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.750> glitch<00:03:30.080> math<00:03:30.440> back<00:03:30.770> now<00:03:31.550> you

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
not for the glitch math back now you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.060 
not for the glitch math back now you
could<00:03:32.630> be<00:03:32.720> Patrick<00:03:33.230> by<00:03:33.410> going<00:03:33.710> all<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.980> way

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
could be Patrick by going all the way

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.190 
could be Patrick by going all the way
there<00:03:34.250> or<00:03:34.580> it'd<00:03:34.760> be<00:03:34.790> fun<00:03:35.210> stuff<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.720> just<00:03:36.020> for

contrast as your readiness he
practically<00:03:38.960> is<00:03:39.200> faster<00:03:39.710> and<00:03:40.070> and

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
practically is faster and and
