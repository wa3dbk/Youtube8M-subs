00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
that we have to read through them but

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.650 
that we have to read through them but
imagine<00:00:19.220> reading<00:00:19.430> through<00:00:19.880> a<00:00:19.940> manual<00:00:20.240> for<00:00:20.600> a

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
we want to kind of eliminate that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.070 
we want to kind of eliminate that
process<00:00:25.279> so<00:00:25.520> that<00:00:25.699> if<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.570> robot<00:00:26.869> can

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
process so that if the robot can

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.810 
process so that if the robot can
communicate<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.800> right<00:00:27.980> things<00:00:28.279> to<00:00:28.670> you

pr2 robot built by Willow Garage we

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.930 
pr2 robot built by Willow Garage we
named<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:45.499> charlie<00:00:45.889> we<00:00:46.159> wanted<00:00:46.459> to<00:00:46.579> look<00:00:46.729> at

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
named it charlie we wanted to look at

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.289 
named it charlie we wanted to look at
the<00:00:47.889> the<00:00:48.889> interaction<00:00:49.489> between<00:00:49.639> the<00:00:49.969> human

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
the the interaction between the human

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:51.939 
the the interaction between the human
and<00:00:50.359> the<00:00:50.449> robot<00:00:50.809> when<00:00:51.229> the<00:00:51.350> robot<00:00:51.649> is<00:00:51.679> trying

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
and the robot when the robot is trying

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.770 
and the robot when the robot is trying
to<00:00:52.100> give<00:00:52.399> you<00:00:52.579> something<00:00:53.119> like<00:00:53.299> a<00:00:53.479> water

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
to give you something like a water

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.779 
to give you something like a water
bottle<00:00:53.989> for<00:00:54.350> example<00:00:54.889> because<00:00:55.549> we<00:00:55.699> were

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
bottle for example because we were

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.329 
bottle for example because we were
interested<00:00:56.149> in<00:00:56.510> how<00:00:56.809> gaze<00:00:57.170> affects<00:00:57.619> handovers

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
interested in how gaze affects handovers

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.250 
interested in how gaze affects handovers
in<00:00:59.029> the<00:00:59.149> fluency<00:00:59.600> of<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.809> hand<00:01:00.019> every

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
in the fluency of the hand every

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.529 
in the fluency of the hand every
interaction<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:01.609> first<00:01:01.819> condition<00:01:02.269> that<00:01:02.389> we

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
interaction the first condition that we

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.840 
interaction the first condition that we
considered<00:01:03.319> is<00:01:03.499> maybe<00:01:03.859> we<00:01:04.519> shouldn't<00:01:04.820> have

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
considered is maybe we shouldn't have

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.149 
considered is maybe we shouldn't have
gaze<00:01:05.269> at<00:01:05.420> all<00:01:05.539> so<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:06.409> that<00:01:06.560> condition<00:01:06.859> the

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
gaze at all so in that condition the

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.130 
gaze at all so in that condition the
robot<00:01:07.430> picked<00:01:07.820> up<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.060> object<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.570> then<00:01:08.960> just

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
robot picked up the object and then just

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.929 
robot picked up the object and then just
continued<00:01:09.619> looking<00:01:09.770> down<00:01:10.100> like<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.399> shy<00:01:10.729> teen

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
continued looking down like a shy teen

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.420 
continued looking down like a shy teen
user<00:01:11.149> and<00:01:11.450> then<00:01:12.049> handed<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:12.979> over<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.280> the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
user and then handed it over to the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.719 
user and then handed it over to the
person<00:01:13.880> in<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.630> second<00:01:15.020> scenario<00:01:15.219> we<00:01:16.219> had<00:01:16.549> the

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
person in the second scenario we had the

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.539 
person in the second scenario we had the
most<00:01:16.939> human<00:01:17.509> inspired<00:01:18.200> version<00:01:18.439> where<00:01:19.159> the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
most human inspired version where the

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.370 
most human inspired version where the
robot<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.090> grab<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.479> object<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.049> then

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
robot and grab the object and then

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.200 
robot and grab the object and then
looked<00:01:21.649> up<00:01:21.740> at<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.369> projected<00:01:22.880> hand<00:01:23.090> of

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
looked up at the projected hand of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.419 
looked up at the projected hand of
relocation<00:01:23.630> as<00:01:23.960> it's<00:01:24.289> reaching<00:01:24.890> out<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.280> give

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
relocation as it's reaching out to give

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.700 
relocation as it's reaching out to give
it<00:01:25.549> to<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.789> person<00:01:25.909> in<00:01:26.359> the<00:01:27.020> third<00:01:27.229> condition

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
it to the person in the third condition

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.620 
it to the person in the third condition
it<00:01:28.280> was<00:01:28.340> more<00:01:28.549> of<00:01:28.609> a<00:01:28.700> fancy<00:01:28.909> version<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.509> that

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
it was more of a fancy version of that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.749 
it was more of a fancy version of that
so<00:01:30.049> it'll<00:01:30.259> do<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.469> same<00:01:30.499> thing<00:01:30.920> it'll<00:01:31.070> look<00:01:31.520> up

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
so it'll do the same thing it'll look up

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.719 
so it'll do the same thing it'll look up
at<00:01:31.999> the<00:01:32.689> handover<00:01:32.990> location<00:01:33.619> but<00:01:34.130> near<00:01:34.700> the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
at the handover location but near the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.639 
at the handover location but near the
end<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.270> interaction<00:01:35.749> the<00:01:36.229> robot<00:01:36.530> would

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
end of that interaction the robot would

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.789 
end of that interaction the robot would
also<00:01:36.829> look<00:01:37.310> up<00:01:37.520> at<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.880> person<00:01:38.270> as<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.259> making

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
also look up at the person as to making

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.469 
also look up at the person as to making
it<00:01:39.950> an<00:01:40.189> eye<00:01:40.369> contact<00:01:40.850> with<00:01:40.969> the<00:01:41.060> person<00:01:41.390> as

it an eye contact with the person as
well<00:01:41.659> we<00:01:42.320> found<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:42.950> when<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.460> robot

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
well we found is that when the robot

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.520 
well we found is that when the robot
doesn't<00:01:43.939> use<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:45.020> right<00:01:45.289> kind<00:01:45.499> of

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
doesn't use the right kind of

doesn't use the right kind of
communication<00:01:46.219> cues<00:01:46.460> or<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> human-like

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
communication cues or a human-like

communication cues or a human-like
communication<00:01:48.229> cues<00:01:48.409> then<00:01:49.219> people<00:01:50.179> tend<00:01:50.569> to

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
communication cues then people tend to

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.499 
communication cues then people tend to
hesitate<00:01:51.079> a<00:01:51.319> little<00:01:51.439> bit<00:01:51.829> but<00:01:52.460> when<00:01:52.969> we<00:01:53.149> got

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
hesitate a little bit but when we got

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.719 
hesitate a little bit but when we got
the<00:01:53.659> robot<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:54.049> do<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.469> most<00:01:54.799> human<00:01:55.310> inspired

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
the robot to do this most human inspired

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.389 
the robot to do this most human inspired
version<00:01:55.969> where<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:56.899> robot<00:01:57.229> would<00:01:57.560> look<00:01:58.009> up<00:01:58.189> at

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
version where the robot would look up at

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.489 
version where the robot would look up at
the<00:01:58.609> shared<00:01:58.850> attention<00:01:59.389> location<00:01:59.899> or<00:02:00.049> the

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:00.499 
the shared attention location or the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.249 
the shared attention location or the
projected<00:02:01.009> handover<00:02:01.429> location<00:02:01.880> then<00:02:02.539> people

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
projected handover location then people

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.679 
projected handover location then people
tended<00:02:03.679> to<00:02:03.710> reach<00:02:04.069> for<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.490> object<00:02:04.999> much

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
tended to reach for the object much

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.139 
tended to reach for the object much
earlier<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:07.159> even<00:02:07.429> before<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:07.969> robot

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
earlier and even before the robot

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.330 
earlier and even before the robot
stopped<00:02:08.569> moving<00:02:08.920> handover<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.039> really

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
stopped moving handover is a really

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.700 
stopped moving handover is a really
important<00:02:11.000> kind<00:02:11.239> of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
important kind of

work between a robot and the person is

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.550 
work between a robot and the person is
really<00:02:22.030> really<00:02:22.270> important<00:02:22.780> if<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.290> robots

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560
