so<00:04:01.269> on<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.599> from<00:04:02.079> it's<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.129> good<00:04:03.250> idea<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.639> have

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
so on that from it's a good idea to have

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.339 
so on that from it's a good idea to have
chainable<00:04:04.269> cards<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:04.900> things<00:04:05.169> like<00:04:05.290> a

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
chainable cards so things like a

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.650 
chainable cards so things like a
bottomless<00:04:05.620> trap<00:04:05.980> hole<00:04:06.010> again<00:04:06.579> so<00:04:07.120> if<00:04:07.419> he<00:04:07.510> goes

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
bottomless trap hole again so if he goes

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.900 
bottomless trap hole again so if he goes
to<00:04:07.870> target<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.410> trap<00:04:08.680> witting<00:04:09.129> things<00:04:09.639> like<00:04:09.879> a

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
to target the trap witting things like a

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.099 
to target the trap witting things like a
grand<00:04:10.660> marq<00:04:10.870> or<00:04:11.169> sias<00:04:12.209> then<00:04:13.209> he<00:04:13.569> wastes<00:04:13.959> its

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
grand marq or sias then he wastes its

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.680 
grand marq or sias then he wastes its
