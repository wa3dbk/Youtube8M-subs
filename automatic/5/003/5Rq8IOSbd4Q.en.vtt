00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.809
 wanted me in that goal launched at 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.849
 reason to the uncle that there would be now 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.830
 what to the brother you find yourself that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.029
 the bank will be able to see it because 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 math you should not write from one 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.490
 ball of leavening of the topics 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.490
 those you understand 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.700
 never been or want to work judges 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.800
 they must do it before they simplify 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:45.320
 media combines with the thing itself 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:51.320
 instead he had to take the border 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:57.710
 charge free to make news 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:00.280
 Seems like a room I didn't call I think 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:08.649
 that in this sector videos that you don't make them 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.649
 I also do not count the race and we 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.380
 not what you know in these 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:24.170
 weeks indeed in the museums why not 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:32.050
 you can take it into account because it is that 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:40.000
 the last time we confirm what 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:40.000
 I would never have it and that we must do 0 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:49.100
 when now he also exchanges Capresi 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:53.899
 mind for lack of reason then 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.720
 for which nickel and camouflage 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.460
 at the limit that this year we hope that 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.479
 this criticizes what the campaign 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.940
 dedicated wind events and are finally the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.619
 mayor will put it does not feel like not 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.009
 there are the obvious conflict rating afterwards 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.440
 but his life present in the process 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.209
 political would be this in my opinion is 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:23.030
 black point on the commitment that catalyzes 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:25.790
 tourist in those speaker said 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.390
 lester I'm sorry he didn't 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.079
 welcome the vague that it is not the time 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.560
 to be able to have that math is not 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.560
 been sabrina 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:52.510
 the party is that of widows and 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.670
 well for me he sees for example what 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:06.670
 because all the framed so 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:16.240
 certainly would be heard in the videos of the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:20.320
 mini times thought that you breathe part 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.540
 it will remain genetic crossing is not either 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.290
 from us critical 9 of avino photon that not 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.610
 they must beckham 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.980
 because I want you to ask yourself 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.430
 alanno's common escapement believes that 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.690
 did not do anything link at all 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.650
 director mister do not do well 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.030
 they go where it's not what they take 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.400
 but let's start a cinema from the many a 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.980
 present above me it seems so like 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.980
 are composed are good that speaks among the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.690
 young giggles comes from a small town in the 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.000
 executioner that with the police the police of it 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.709
 we know that there are I like bad and 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.290
 comes from those who come to the position 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.820
 they were pink as we please 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.590
 you know me for started while 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.739
 dialogue of way to the iter that will be these 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.540
 elements is not correct to say to faenza 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.880
 me that the purpose of the rule 15 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.600
 to these correct dinners is not that he does 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.600
 speak for him 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.140
 yes maybe for the date you wash clean 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.430
 the least among us we watch materials 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:42.330
 as variants as first line when 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.090
 is markedly his deputy is not that 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.210
 in the foundations I think it has to do with 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.990
 instead do Japanese type verification 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.990
 with stalking
