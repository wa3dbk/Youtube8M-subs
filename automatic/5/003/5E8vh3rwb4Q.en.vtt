00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.880
 hello ago saw a little I spent a few days in 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.990
 the echaurren and francis handed me the recipe 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.940
 of the cake plan 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.429
 it's really simple and it looks great 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.660
 Even making mistakes first 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.459
 what we are going to do is put a little 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.290
 butter in a pot and when you're 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.990
 undone we add a golden apple 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.330
 peeled and cut into cubes we cover it and 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.760
 we leave it about 10 minutes on low heat 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.580
 On the other hand we put in a bowl 75 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.170
 grams of raisins and cover them with rum and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.980
 we leave them like this while we prepare the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.320
 dough 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.179
 we need butter in ointment is very 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.460
 simple you have to take it out of the fridge a 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.200
 couple of hours before and that 's how soft 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.450
 so we can manipulate it 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.960
 we add the icing sugar and mix it 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.479
 all good 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.479
 [Music] 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.120
 If it suits us well, you can do it with the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.720
 hands 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.720
 [Music] 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:18.180
 Y 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:21.070
 [Music] 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.020
 when it is well mixed we add the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.640
 two eggs in two and you have to do 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.560
 case to francis that says they have to 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.869
 be well tempered because if you do not 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.520
 short is to say that you also have them 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.530
 to have out of the fridge already 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.030
 room temperature I did not listen 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.470
 and I have been cut 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:44.980
 still get the mix back 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.980
 [Music] 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.660
 see how it is cut and if it was good 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:02:04.769
 so imagine if it does not cut me 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:04.769
 [Music] 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.160
 now it's about adding the little flour 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.110
 a little in about 6 rounds and much better if 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.940
 the flour is sifted but as I am 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.220
 in the middle of a move I do not have here the 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.230
 sieve 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.400
 [Music] 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:37.159
 and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:37.159
 [Music] 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.700
 Y 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.500
 [Music] 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.480
 now is a good time to add the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.150
 bread yeast dissolved in a little 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.740
 of water and yeast powder you know 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.040
 at the end of the video you have all the 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.040
 ingredients 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.110
 two 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:14.569
 [Music] 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.260
 finally we will add the fruit well 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.640
 drained 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:40.210
 but mixed everything well 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:43.250
 [Music] 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.140
 and we pour it over a mold smeared with 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.140
 butter and sprinkled with flour 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.210
 [Music] 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.650
 [Music] 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.520
 and we're going to put it in the oven about 15 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.850
 minutes at 180 degrees and about 20 minutes at 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.250
 150 if you have crude left over 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.470
 last three or four minutes you can 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.720
 put the grill and hedge will be fine and the 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.610
 plum cake opens up not 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.130
 worry and this really is a breakfast 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.360
 of champions I hope you like a 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:28.239
 hug until then 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:28.239
