00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.519 

here's<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.900> McCulloch<00:00:01.700> inverter<00:00:02.700> generator

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:03.529 
here's a McCulloch inverter generator

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.419 
here's a McCulloch inverter generator
model<00:00:04.529> FDD<00:00:05.310> 210<00:00:06.319> the<00:00:07.319> guy<00:00:07.500> brought<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.189> me

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
model FDD 210 the guy brought it to me

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.330 
model FDD 210 the guy brought it to me
and<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.610> wasn't<00:00:08.960> putting<00:00:09.960> out<00:00:10.080> power<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:11.309> I

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
and it wasn't putting out power so I

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.930 
and it wasn't putting out power so I
ripped<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.790> all<00:00:11.910> apart<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:13.429> the<00:00:14.429> only<00:00:14.639> thing<00:00:14.849> I

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
ripped it all apart and the only thing I

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.060 
ripped it all apart and the only thing I
come<00:00:15.389> up<00:00:15.509> with<00:00:15.540> his<00:00:16.049> add<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> inverter<00:00:16.710> part

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
come up with his add the inverter part

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
come up with his add the inverter part
of<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:18.170> here<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.939> shot<00:00:20.939> there's<00:00:21.420> actually

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
of it here is shot there's actually

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.269 
of it here is shot there's actually
power<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.890> it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
power going to it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.050 
power going to it
but<00:00:23.970> there's<00:00:24.180> no<00:00:24.390> power<00:00:24.630> coming<00:00:25.199> out<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
but there's no power coming out of it

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.480 
but there's no power coming out of it
it's<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.180> 18<00:00:27.570> watt<00:00:27.810> digital<00:00:28.349> generator<00:00:28.890> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it's an 18 watt digital generator so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.380 
it's an 18 watt digital generator so
basically<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.390> does<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.309> makes<00:00:32.390> DC

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
basically what it does is it makes DC

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.229 
basically what it does is it makes DC
power<00:00:33.630> then<00:00:34.260> sends<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.070> box<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.790> just

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
power then sends it to that box I just

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.090 
power then sends it to that box I just
showed<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> right<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.649> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
showed you right here and then this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.680 
showed you right here and then this
converts<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.050> AC<00:00:40.050> power<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:42.180> problem<00:00:42.600> I'm

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
converts it to AC power the problem I'm

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.810 
converts it to AC power the problem I'm
running<00:00:43.020> into<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.890> these<00:00:44.399> generators

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
running into is that these generators

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.639 
running into is that these generators
are<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.420> hard<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.780> parts<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.350> while

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
are really hard to get parts for while

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.910 
are really hard to get parts for while
at<00:00:46.860> least<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.500> at<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.620> point

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
at least here it is and at this point

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.830 
at least here it is and at this point
I'm<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.309> quite<00:00:50.789> sure<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I'm not quite sure what to do with that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.560 
I'm not quite sure what to do with that
if<00:00:52.710> anybody<00:00:53.280> knows<00:00:53.489> where<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.239> apart

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
if anybody knows where I can get apart

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.099 
if anybody knows where I can get apart
for<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.500> let<00:00:55.710> me<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:56.539> but<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.870> may<00:00:58.079> not

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
for that just let me know but it may not

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.799 
for that just let me know but it may not
even<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.649> worth<00:00:58.800> fixing<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
even be worth fixing if I can get this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.889 
even be worth fixing if I can get this
part<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.410> would<00:01:01.680> imagine<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.660> it<00:01:03.660> would<00:01:03.719> be

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
part I would imagine that it would be

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.140 
part I would imagine that it would be
fairly<00:01:04.260> expensive<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:08.760> motor<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
fairly expensive the motor is a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.359 
fairly expensive the motor is a
four-stroke<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.170> runs<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.220> it's

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
four-stroke it runs like a top so it's

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.149 
four-stroke it runs like a top so it's
kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.880> kind<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> shame<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.130> scrap<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
kind of a kind of a shame to scrap a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
kind of a kind of a shame to scrap a
generator<00:01:14.760> because<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.240> can't<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
generator because you can't get the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.890 
generator because you can't get the
inverter<00:01:16.170> board<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.540> dashboard

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
inverter board this is the dashboard

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
inverter board this is the dashboard
I've<00:01:19.560> checked<00:01:19.920> everything<00:01:20.310> I've<00:01:20.670> tested<00:01:21.150> all

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I've checked everything I've tested all

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.320 
I've checked everything I've tested all
the<00:01:21.270> wires<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.430> wires<00:01:23.610> coming<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.180> at

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the wires and the wires coming out at

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.090 
the wires and the wires coming out at
the<00:01:24.450> engine<00:01:25.369> do<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.549> power<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.720> them

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
the engine do have power going to them

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
the engine do have power going to them
these<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> plugs<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
these are all the plugs I go to that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.800 
these are all the plugs I go to that
inverter<00:01:30.780> box<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.549> point<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.570> kind

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
inverter box and at this point I'm kind

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
inverter box and at this point I'm kind
of<00:01:33.900> stumped<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.920> everywhere<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.610> call

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
of stumped with that everywhere I call

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.090 
of stumped with that everywhere I call
nobody's<00:01:36.360> ever<00:01:36.509> heard<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.229> can't<00:01:38.009> even

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
nobody's ever heard of them I can't even

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.179 
nobody's ever heard of them I can't even
get<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> parts<00:01:38.670> list<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> internet<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
get a parts list on the internet for it

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
get a parts list on the internet for it
so<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.549> actually<00:01:41.880> spend<00:01:42.180> more<00:01:42.360> time<00:01:42.630> hunting

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
so you actually spend more time hunting

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.230 
so you actually spend more time hunting
down<00:01:42.990> parts<00:01:43.560> than<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.549> actual<00:01:44.939> work<00:01:45.149> itself

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
down parts than the actual work itself

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.580 
down parts than the actual work itself
anyways<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.450> anybody<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:49.079> any<00:01:49.320> information

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
anyways if anybody has any information

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010 
anyways if anybody has any information
just<00:01:50.220> send<00:01:50.850> me<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> private<00:01:51.180> message<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.990> post

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
just send me a private message or post

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.130 
just send me a private message or post
it<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> comments<00:01:53.490> area

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.410 

so<00:02:00.140> here's<00:02:00.740> one<00:02:00.979> quick<00:02:01.280> last<00:02:01.820> look<00:02:02.090> at<00:02:02.270> that

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
so here's one quick last look at that

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.020 
so here's one quick last look at that
inverter<00:02:02.750> box
