before<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.540> scribe<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.170> log<00:00:13.379> that<00:00:13.709> is<00:00:14.309> mark

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
before you can scribe a log that is mark

before you can scribe a log that is mark
where<00:00:15.629> to<00:00:15.750> cut<00:00:16.020> its<00:00:16.170> groove<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.949> notches<00:00:17.640> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
where to cut its groove and notches you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.960 
where to cut its groove and notches you
must<00:00:18.689> find<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.169> proper<00:00:19.619> setting<00:00:20.099> for<00:00:20.849> your

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
must find the proper setting for your

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.920 
must find the proper setting for your
scribers<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:22.460> like<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.640> use<00:00:23.880> an<00:00:24.240> inside

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
scribers I like to use an inside

scribers I like to use an inside
calipers<00:00:25.739> to<00:00:26.610> find<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> widest<00:00:27.480> gap<00:00:27.540> between

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
calipers to find the widest gap between

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.930 
calipers to find the widest gap between
the<00:00:28.349> two<00:00:28.529> logs<00:00:30.739> I've<00:00:31.739> tried<00:00:32.250> other<00:00:32.460> methods

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the two logs I've tried other methods

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.930 
the two logs I've tried other methods
but<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.410> way<00:00:34.680> because<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.579> fast

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
but I like this way because it's fast

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.079 
but I like this way because it's fast
and<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.989> accurate<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:41.219> calipers<00:00:41.730> are<00:00:41.910> not

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
and it's accurate the calipers are not

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.680 
and it's accurate the calipers are not
scribers<00:00:42.920> because<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.370> don't<00:00:44.609> have<00:00:44.699> pens<00:00:45.239> or

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
scribers because they don't have pens or

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.529 
scribers because they don't have pens or
pencils<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.530> their<00:00:46.920> legs<00:00:47.159> and<00:00:47.550> they're<00:00:48.390> not

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
pencils in their legs and they're not

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.380 
pencils in their legs and they're not
marking<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> locks<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.179> new

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
marking the locks so when we have a new

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
marking the locks so when we have a new
log<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> wall<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.920> has<00:00:56.069> a<00:00:56.100> gap

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
log up on the wall and it has a gap

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
log up on the wall and it has a gap
between<00:00:56.819> it<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> completed<00:00:58.499> logs<00:00:58.739> below

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
between it and the completed logs below

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.969 
between it and the completed logs below
it<00:00:59.460> like<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:02.089> start<00:01:03.089> at<00:01:03.269> one<00:01:03.569> end<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.979> drag

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it like this I start at one end and drag

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.149 
it like this I start at one end and drag
the<00:01:05.159> caliper<00:01:05.700> along<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> entire<00:01:07.560> distance

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the caliper along the entire distance

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.899 
the caliper along the entire distance
between<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.909> corner<00:01:09.240> notches<00:01:10.670> every<00:01:11.670> time<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
between the corner notches every time I

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.510 
between the corner notches every time I
fall<00:01:12.120> through<00:01:12.840> between<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> logs<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.860> open<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
fall through between the logs I open the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.480 
fall through between the logs I open the
caliper<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.149> a<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.619> then<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.740> continue<00:01:17.219> along

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
caliper up a bit then I continue along

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.969 
caliper up a bit then I continue along
again<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:20.810> spread<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> caliper<00:01:22.439> slightly

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
again I spread the caliper slightly

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.690 
again I spread the caliper slightly
whenever<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.759> fall<00:01:23.909> through<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:26.490> last

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
whenever I fall through and the last

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.959 
whenever I fall through and the last
place<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.329> fall<00:01:27.689> through<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.950> called<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
place that I fall through is called the

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:37.789 
place that I fall through is called the
widest<00:01:30.479> gap<00:01:35.539> here's<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.750> widest<00:01:37.110> gap<00:01:37.200> between

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
widest gap here's the widest gap between

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.520 
widest gap here's the widest gap between
these<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.520> logs<00:01:38.789> this<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:39.840> last<00:01:40.079> place

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
these two logs this is the last place

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.399 
these two logs this is the last place
that<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:41.009> calipers<00:01:41.549> fell<00:01:41.909> through<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.539> this

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that my calipers fell through and this

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.190 
that my calipers fell through and this
is<00:01:43.649> where<00:01:43.979> we'll<00:01:44.939> determine<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.869> scribe

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
is where we'll determine the scribe

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.679 
is where we'll determine the scribe
setting<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.130> lock<00:01:47.369> put<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> caliper

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
setting for this lock put the caliper

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.599 
setting for this lock put the caliper
away<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.079> get<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> scriber<00:01:49.680> at<00:01:49.950> first

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
away and get a scriber at first

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.730 
away and get a scriber at first
describer<00:01:51.149> falls<00:01:51.600> through<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> widest

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
describer falls through with the widest

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.419 
describer falls through with the widest
gap<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.299> open<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.109> little<00:01:55.310> until<00:01:56.310> it

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
gap so I open it up a little until it

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.940 
gap so I open it up a little until it
doesn't<00:01:56.820> fall<00:01:57.060> through<00:01:57.590> and<00:02:00.079> then<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.109> scribe<00:02:01.679> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
doesn't fall through and then I scribe a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.569 
doesn't fall through and then I scribe a
few<00:02:02.399> inches<00:02:02.609> of<00:02:02.939> scribe<00:02:03.240> line<00:02:03.829> maybe<00:02:04.829> six<00:02:05.340> or

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
few inches of scribe line maybe six or

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.590 
few inches of scribe line maybe six or
seven<00:02:05.969> inches<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.570> both<00:02:06.890> sides<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:09.210> widest

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
seven inches on both sides of the widest

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.040 
seven inches on both sides of the widest
gap<00:02:10.400> we<00:02:11.400> need<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.760> scribe<00:02:12.030> both<00:02:12.330> sides<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.990> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
gap we need to scribe both sides of the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.620 
gap we need to scribe both sides of the
log<00:02:13.290> there's<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.310> scribe<00:02:14.700> line<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> inside

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
log there's a scribe line on the inside

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.630 
log there's a scribe line on the inside
of<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.810> wall<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.290> another<00:02:16.620> scribe<00:02:17.069> line<00:02:17.370> on

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
of the wall and another scribe line on

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.710 
of the wall and another scribe line on
the<00:02:17.970> outside<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.599> wall

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
the outside of the wall

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.890 
the outside of the wall
and<00:02:21.819> then<00:02:22.819> measure<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.269> distance<00:02:23.810> between

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
and then measure the distance between

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.119 
and then measure the distance between
the<00:02:24.290> inside<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> outside<00:02:26.000> scribe<00:02:26.750> lines

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
the inside and the outside scribe lines

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.160 
the inside and the outside scribe lines
this<00:02:28.129> measurement<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.909> the<00:02:29.299> width<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
this measurement is the width of the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.800 
this measurement is the width of the
groove<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.830> like<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.970> groove<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.239> be<00:02:32.569> about

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
groove I like the groove to be about

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.069 
groove I like the groove to be about
three<00:02:33.170> inches<00:02:33.500> wide<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:34.670> if<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:35.780> less<00:02:36.049> than

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
three inches wide here if it's less than

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.440 
three inches wide here if it's less than
three<00:02:36.560> inches<00:02:36.709> then<00:02:37.370> open<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.879> scribers<00:02:38.420> a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
three inches then open the scribers a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:53.059 
three inches then open the scribers a
little<00:02:38.810> bit<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.170> scribe<00:02:39.769> again

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.140 

and<00:02:53.549> measure<00:02:54.329> again

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.539 

this<00:03:00.659> looks<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.409> just<00:03:01.709> about<00:03:02.099> two

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
this looks like it's just about two

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.330 
this looks like it's just about two
inches<00:03:02.909> wide<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.540> that's<00:03:04.049> not<00:03:04.260> enough<00:03:04.560> yet<00:03:04.860> so

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
inches wide and that's not enough yet so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.160 
inches wide and that's not enough yet so
we'll<00:03:05.549> open<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.970> scrubbers<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.510> little<00:03:07.019> bit

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
we'll open the scrubbers a little bit

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:15.920 
we'll open the scrubbers a little bit
more<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:09.739> scribe<00:03:10.739> again<00:03:14.540> I've<00:03:15.540> been<00:03:15.599> using

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
more and scribe again I've been using

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.809 
more and scribe again I've been using
this<00:03:16.170> technique<00:03:16.620> for<00:03:16.890> setting<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> scribers

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
this technique for setting the scribers

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.399 
this technique for setting the scribers
o<00:03:18.349> for<00:03:19.519> maybe<00:03:20.519> twenty<00:03:21.030> years<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:22.319> the

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
o for maybe twenty years and it's the

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.009 
o for maybe twenty years and it's the
best<00:03:22.799> method<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.519> know<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:24.060> though

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
best method that I know of though

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.559 
best method that I know of though
usually<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.799> do<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.189> by<00:03:26.370> myself<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:27.180> I'm

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
usually I do this by myself and I'm

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.270 
usually I do this by myself and I'm
getting<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.959> little<00:03:28.079> help<00:03:28.379> here<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.040> speed

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
getting a little help here just to speed

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:38.809 
getting a little help here just to speed
things<00:03:29.489> up

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.449 

once<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.019> two<00:03:40.200> scribe<00:03:40.560> lines<00:03:40.890> are<00:03:41.189> about

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
once the two scribe lines are about

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.390 
once the two scribe lines are about
three<00:03:41.909> inches<00:03:42.150> apart<00:03:42.890> then<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.280> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
three inches apart then you have the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.920 
three inches apart then you have the
scribe<00:03:44.700> setting<00:03:45.150> for<00:03:45.329> this<00:03:45.450> log

tighten your scribers and treat them

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.449 
tighten your scribers and treat them
gently<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.290> setting<00:03:49.650> won't<00:03:49.859> change<00:03:52.459> with

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
gently so this setting won't change with

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.729 
gently so this setting won't change with
the<00:03:53.549> last<00:03:53.790> camera<00:03:54.209> angle<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.109> couldn't<00:03:55.470> see

what<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.069> was<00:03:56.340> measuring<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:57.480> here<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.109> again

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
what I was measuring so here it is again

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.210 
what I was measuring so here it is again
we<00:04:00.090> scribed<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.750> bit<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.079> long<00:04:01.290> groove<00:04:01.680> measured

we scribed a bit of long groove measured

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.490 
we scribed a bit of long groove measured
it<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.700> groove<00:04:02.939> was<00:04:03.209> not<00:04:03.420> wide<00:04:03.780> enough<00:04:03.810> so

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
it and the groove was not wide enough so

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.640 
it and the groove was not wide enough so
we<00:04:05.400> opened<00:04:05.939> the<00:04:06.030> scribers<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:06.840> scribed<00:04:07.260> again

we opened the scribers and scribed again

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.530 
we opened the scribers and scribed again
and<00:04:07.920> got<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.549> scribe<00:04:08.879> lines<00:04:09.180> marked<00:04:10.049> too

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
groove gets wider we opened the scribers

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.200 
groove gets wider we opened the scribers
again<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.570> scribed<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.979> section<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.669> scribe

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
again and scribed the section of scribe

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.330 
again and scribed the section of scribe
lines<00:04:24.509> marked<00:04:24.990> three<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:28.500> groove<00:04:28.770> went<00:04:29.099> from

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.550 
shape like this then the groove might
get<00:05:31.710> narrower<00:05:32.250> than<00:05:32.610> three<00:05:32.970> inches<00:05:33.300> here<00:05:33.659> even

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
get narrower than three inches here even

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.040 
get narrower than three inches here even

so<00:05:37.979> before<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:38.430> scribe<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.120> log<00:05:39.380> look<00:05:40.380> at<00:05:40.590> it

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
so before you scribe a log look at it

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.149 
so before you scribe a log look at it
inside<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.909> out<00:05:42.090> to<00:05:42.419> see<00:05:42.810> if<00:05:42.930> it<00:05:43.080> has<00:05:43.259> special
