how to set one up we're gonna do it here

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.760 
how to set one up we're gonna do it here
on<00:00:16.630> the<00:00:16.810> table<00:00:16.990> but<00:00:17.290> we're<00:00:17.380> gonna<00:00:17.470> show<00:00:17.590> you

on the table but we're gonna show you
some<00:00:17.950> pictures<00:00:18.070> of<00:00:18.400> how<00:00:18.490> it's<00:00:18.670> actually<00:00:18.849> done

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
some pictures of how it's actually done

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.150 
some pictures of how it's actually done
normally<00:00:19.720> we<00:00:19.960> set<00:00:20.140> up<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.349> kiln<00:00:20.619> on<00:00:20.770> a<00:00:20.800> rack<00:00:21.130> of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
normally we set up the kiln on a rack of

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.339 
normally we set up the kiln on a rack of
some<00:00:21.580> sort<00:00:21.849> and<00:00:22.060> then<00:00:22.570> what<00:00:22.810> you<00:00:22.930> want<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.200> use

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
some sort and then what you want to use

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.040 
some sort and then what you want to use
is<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:23.529> kiln<00:00:23.860> that<00:00:24.130> is<00:00:24.730> segmented<00:00:25.510> that<00:00:25.660> can

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
is a kiln that is segmented that can

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.540 
is a kiln that is segmented that can
come<00:00:26.199> apart<00:00:26.320> this<00:00:26.770> particular<00:00:27.039> kiln<00:00:27.430> the

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
come apart this particular kiln the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.029 
come apart this particular kiln the
bottom<00:00:27.880> comes<00:00:28.119> off<00:00:28.300> it<00:00:28.570> by<00:00:29.020> just<00:00:29.199> on<00:00:29.380> blanching

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
bottom comes off it by just on blanching

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.119 
bottom comes off it by just on blanching
it<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.449> I'm<00:00:31.510> going<00:00:31.660> on<00:00:31.720> latch<00:00:31.960> this<00:00:32.290> kiln<00:00:32.590> and

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
it so I'm going on latch this kiln and

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.509 
it so I'm going on latch this kiln and
then<00:00:33.309> that<00:00:33.430> way<00:00:33.550> we<00:00:33.730> can<00:00:33.879> just<00:00:33.910> separate<00:00:35.519> the

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
then that way we can just separate the

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.100 
then that way we can just separate the
kiln<00:00:36.790> from<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.180> bottom<00:00:37.540> there's<00:00:37.960> another

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
kiln from the bottom there's another

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.140 
kiln from the bottom there's another
kiln<00:00:38.559> that<00:00:38.710> comes<00:00:39.070> apart<00:00:39.430> so<00:00:39.610> we<00:00:39.699> can<00:00:39.850> use<00:00:39.970> for

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
kiln that comes apart so we can use for

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.729 
kiln that comes apart so we can use for
the<00:00:40.239> pitcher<00:00:40.480> grab<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:41.079> top<00:00:41.290> comes<00:00:41.559> off

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
the pitcher grab the top comes off

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.470 
the pitcher grab the top comes off
you'll<00:00:42.280> see<00:00:42.489> that<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.760> center<00:00:43.120> then<00:00:43.270> is

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
you'll see that the center then is

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.319 
you'll see that the center then is
removed<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:44.320> then<00:00:44.710> we<00:00:44.860> have<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.190> bottom<00:00:45.399> so

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
removed and then we have the bottom so

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.180 
removed and then we have the bottom so
what<00:00:46.540> we're<00:00:46.750> gonna<00:00:47.170> do<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.590> set<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:47.920> kiln

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
what we're gonna do is set the kiln

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.580 
what we're gonna do is set the kiln
first<00:00:48.550> on<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.879> fiber<00:00:49.360> board<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:50.230> you<00:00:50.290> can<00:00:50.410> see

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
first on a fiber board and you can see

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.709 
first on a fiber board and you can see
this<00:00:50.770> fiber<00:00:51.100> board<00:00:51.430> here<00:00:51.760> has<00:00:51.969> a<00:00:52.000> hole<00:00:52.329> in<00:00:52.360> it

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
this fiber board here has a hole in it

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.540 
this fiber board here has a hole in it
so<00:00:52.899> what<00:00:53.320> we're<00:00:53.440> gonna<00:00:53.530> do<00:00:53.739> is<00:00:53.890> set<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.280> Majan

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
so what we're gonna do is set the Majan

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.979 
so what we're gonna do is set the Majan
that<00:00:54.670> we're<00:00:54.760> gonna<00:00:54.850> put<00:00:55.059> this<00:00:55.180> on<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.390> rack<00:00:55.629> that

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
that we're gonna put this on a rack that

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.020 
that we're gonna put this on a rack that
goes<00:00:56.500> on<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.770> rack<00:00:56.950> then<00:00:57.789> we're<00:00:57.879> going<00:00:58.000> to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
goes on the rack then we're going to

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.420 
goes on the rack then we're going to
take<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.360> center<00:00:58.660> part<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.410> kiln<00:00:59.710> this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
take the center part of the kiln this

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.270 
take the center part of the kiln this
goes<00:01:00.730> on<00:01:01.149> top<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:01.780> so<00:01:02.469> the<00:01:02.649> fiber<00:01:03.039> board

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
goes on top of that so the fiber board

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.189 
goes on top of that so the fiber board
access<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.000> bottom<00:01:04.210> of<00:01:04.539> the<00:01:04.629> kiln<00:01:04.899> in<00:01:05.050> this

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
access to the bottom of the kiln in this

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.020 
access to the bottom of the kiln in this
situation<00:01:05.800> then<00:01:06.369> we're<00:01:06.490> going<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.670> put<00:01:06.850> the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
situation then we're going to put the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.150 
situation then we're going to put the
top<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.539> on<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:08.020> we're<00:01:08.710> gonna<00:01:08.800> assemble

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
top of it on and we're gonna assemble

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.880 
top of it on and we're gonna assemble
everything<00:01:09.640> inside<00:01:09.970> here<00:01:10.030> now<00:01:10.509> what<00:01:11.410> goes<00:01:11.619> in

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
everything inside here now what goes in

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.320 
everything inside here now what goes in
first<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.520> though<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.760> going<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:12.970> be<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.090> flower

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
first and though is going to be a flower

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330 
first and though is going to be a flower
pot<00:01:13.659> so<00:01:13.960> we're<00:01:14.439> going<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.619> put<00:01:14.830> pieces<00:01:15.220> of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
pot so we're going to put pieces of

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.310 
pot so we're going to put pieces of
glass<00:01:15.549> into<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.880> flower<00:01:16.150> pot<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.720> that's<00:01:17.170> why

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
glass into a flower pot and that's why

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.870 
glass into a flower pot and that's why
there's<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.590> hole<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.010> board<00:01:18.220> so<00:01:18.490> that<00:01:18.520> when

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
there's a hole in the board so that when

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.190 
there's a hole in the board so that when
the<00:01:19.000> glass<00:01:19.119> drips<00:01:19.510> out<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.780> bottom<00:01:20.049> of<00:01:20.140> the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
the glass drips out of the bottom of the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.810 
the glass drips out of the bottom of the
flower<00:01:20.439> pot<00:01:20.680> it's<00:01:20.860> going<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.070> come<00:01:21.430> out<00:01:21.549> and<00:01:21.760> we

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
flower pot it's going to come out and we

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.700 
flower pot it's going to come out and we
can<00:01:22.000> manipulate<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.570> that<00:01:22.750> way<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.590> only

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
can manipulate it that way the only

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.960 
can manipulate it that way the only
thing<00:01:23.799> you<00:01:24.009> want<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.189> be<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> little<00:01:24.430> careful<00:01:24.640> of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
thing you want to be a little careful of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.850 
thing you want to be a little careful of
in<00:01:25.150> this<00:01:25.659> situation<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.590> want<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.770> make

in this situation is you want to make

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.560 
in this situation is you want to make
sure<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.280> glass<00:01:27.460> doesn't<00:01:27.820> stick<00:01:28.090> up<00:01:28.270> out

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
sure that the glass doesn't stick up out

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.289

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
usually you can't get the lid on or in

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.249 
usually you can't get the lid on or in
some<00:01:34.180> kilns<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:34.540> might<00:01:34.659> run<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.930> risk<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.170> the

glass sticking to the lid usually I'll

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.270 
glass sticking to the lid usually I'll
just<00:01:37.240> come<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.689> cut<00:01:37.869> them<00:01:38.020> out<00:01:38.280> another

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
just come in and cut them out another

just come in and cut them out another
little<00:01:39.549> trick<00:01:39.909> here<00:01:40.150> about<00:01:40.360> using<00:01:40.810> glass<00:01:41.049> in

the<00:01:41.320> flower<00:01:41.500> pot<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:41.979> don't<00:01:42.100> want<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.280> use

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
the flower pot is you don't want to use

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.190 
the flower pot is you don't want to use
too<00:01:42.400> many<00:01:42.729> colors<00:01:43.180> because<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.600> can<00:01:43.840> muddy

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
too many colors because you can muddy

too many colors because you can muddy
that<00:01:44.500> your<00:01:45.280> stringer<00:01:46.270> up<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.509> little<00:01:46.689> bit<00:01:46.869> so

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
that your stringer up a little bit so

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.990 
that your stringer up a little bit so
what<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.590> try<00:01:47.829> to<00:01:47.860> do<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.220> use<00:01:48.369> just<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.670> couple<00:01:48.700> of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
what I try to do is use just a couple of

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.120 
what I try to do is use just a couple of
colors<00:01:49.119> I<00:01:49.509> try<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.259> choose<00:01:50.439> more<00:01:50.680> than<00:01:50.829> three

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
if I can and adding clear to it is a

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.929 
if I can and adding clear to it is a
great<00:01:53.500> way<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.710> just<00:01:53.860> getting<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.700> lighten

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939

up<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.240> little<00:01:55.270> bit<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.720> doesn't<00:01:55.930> look<00:01:56.020> so

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
up a little bit so it doesn't look so

up a little bit so it doesn't look so
muddy<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.799> often<00:01:57.670> will<00:01:57.790> just<00:01:57.820> kind<00:01:58.060> of

muddy I often will just kind of

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.700 
muddy I often will just kind of
segregate<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.869> color<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.200> little<00:01:59.470> bit<00:01:59.590> you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
segregate the color a little bit you

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.590 
segregate the color a little bit you
