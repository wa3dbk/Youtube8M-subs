lens yeah so what we've done with this
camera<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> mark<00:00:38.100> 2<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:39.000> use<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> same

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
camera the the mark 2 is we use the same

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.990 
camera the the mark 2 is we use the same
exact<00:00:40.200> same<00:00:40.379> lens<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.160> we've<00:00:41.309> used<00:00:41.850> in

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
exact same lens as what we've used in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440 
exact same lens as what we've used in
the<00:00:42.090> rx100<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> carl<00:00:44.460> zeiss<00:00:44.520> 20

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the rx100 so this is a carl zeiss 20

f 1.8 lens and that's really the secret
of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> rx100<00:00:50.640> performance<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.809> use<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.170> 1

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
of the rx100 performance we use the 1

picture<00:00:59.760> quality<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.300> we've<00:01:00.449> done<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.870> we've

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
picture quality what we've done is we've

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.170 
picture quality what we've done is we've
improved<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.100> image<00:01:02.399> sensor<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.820> little<00:01:03.059> bit

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
improved the image sensor a little bit

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.230 
improved the image sensor a little bit
still<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> same<00:01:04.229> 1-inch<00:01:05.040> type<00:01:05.280> 20<00:01:05.700> megapixel

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
still the same 1-inch type 20 megapixel

still the same 1-inch type 20 megapixel
image<00:01:06.540> sensors<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> hasn't<00:01:07.409> changed<00:01:07.830> but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
image sensors so that hasn't changed but

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.070 
image sensors so that hasn't changed but
we've<00:01:08.400> increased<00:01:08.909> its<00:01:09.119> sensitivity<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.840> little

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
we've increased its sensitivity a little

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
we've increased its sensitivity a little
bit<00:01:10.200> by<00:01:10.350> about<00:01:10.530> 40%

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
bit by about 40%

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.410 
bit by about 40%
because<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.479> use<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.990> backside<00:01:13.530> illuminated

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420

our<00:03:36.100> first<00:03:36.310> digital<00:03:36.700> camera<00:03:37.000> which<00:03:37.180> uses<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
our first digital camera which uses the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.570 
our first digital camera which uses the
NFC<00:03:38.020> technology<00:03:38.170> could<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.100> give<00:03:39.250> me<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.370> quick

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
NFC technology could you give me a quick

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.880 
NFC technology could you give me a quick
demo<00:03:39.940> on<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.390> near-field<00:03:40.840> communication<00:03:41.590> and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
demo on the near-field communication and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.250 
demo on the near-field communication and
how<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.220> works<00:03:42.520> exactly<00:03:42.880> with<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.360> rx100

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
how this works exactly with the rx100

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.470 
how this works exactly with the rx100
mark<00:03:44.680> -<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.340> let's<00:03:45.580> say<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:46.030> near<00:03:46.240> field

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
mark - and let's say a near field

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.900 
mark - and let's say a near field
communication<00:03:47.110> enabled<00:03:47.470> phone<00:03:47.740> sure<00:03:48.250> they

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
communication enabled phone sure they

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.460 
communication enabled phone sure they
have<00:03:49.090> my<00:03:49.270> Sony<00:03:49.570> phone<00:03:49.810> right<00:03:50.050> here<00:03:50.290> alright

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
models feature 10 f8 FPS shooting can we

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.280 
models feature 10 f8 FPS shooting can we
cover<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.090> ports<00:05:16.390> yeah<00:05:16.870> well<00:05:17.080> they're<00:05:17.200> all

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
cover the ports yeah well they're all

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.750 
cover the ports yeah well they're all
pretty<00:05:17.440> much<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.650> exact<00:05:18.040> same<00:05:18.070> like<00:05:18.430> you<00:05:18.550> said

pretty much the exact same like you said
yeah<00:05:18.970> pretty<00:05:19.150> much<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.390> connectivity<00:05:20.050> is<00:05:20.170> the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
yeah pretty much the connectivity is the

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.670 
yeah pretty much the connectivity is the
same<00:05:20.860> however<00:05:21.130> we<00:05:21.550> did<00:05:21.820> add<00:05:22.090> one<00:05:23.050> port<00:05:23.350> here

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
same however we did add one port here

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.430 
same however we did add one port here
we've<00:05:24.610> changed<00:05:24.940> over<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.540> USB<00:05:25.810> port<00:05:26.200> to<00:05:26.260> our

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
we've changed over the USB port to our

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.920 
we've changed over the USB port to our
multi<00:05:26.830> interface<00:05:27.490> port<00:05:27.790> okay<00:05:28.210> so<00:05:28.480> this<00:05:28.600> this

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
multi interface port okay so this this

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.380 
multi interface port okay so this this
port<00:05:29.200> now<00:05:29.380> not<00:05:29.740> only<00:05:29.860> acts<00:05:30.190> as<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.640> USB<00:05:30.940> port

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
port now not only acts as the USB port

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.600 
port now not only acts as the USB port
and<00:05:32.140> also<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.650> way<00:05:33.010> you<00:05:33.070> charge<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.580> battery

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
and also the way you charge the battery

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.400 
and also the way you charge the battery
which<00:05:34.300> is<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.540> same<00:05:34.720> as<00:05:34.840> what<00:05:34.990> we've<00:05:35.140> done<00:05:35.260> in

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
which is the same as what we've done in

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.010 
which is the same as what we've done in
the<00:05:35.470> rx100<00:05:35.890> but<00:05:36.610> we've<00:05:36.730> also<00:05:36.940> added<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:37.600> multi

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
the rx100 but we've also added the multi

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.440 
the rx100 but we've also added the multi
interface<00:05:38.400> capability<00:05:39.400> so<00:05:39.580> our<00:05:39.850> wired<00:05:40.150> remote

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
interface capability so our wired remote

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.930 
interface capability so our wired remote
control<00:05:41.080> can<00:05:41.830> now<00:05:41.980> operate<00:05:42.370> with<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.670> camera

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
control can now operate with the camera

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.700 
control can now operate with the camera
so<00:05:43.120> that's<00:05:43.240> a<00:05:43.420> little<00:05:43.570> bit<00:05:43.750> new<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.440> there's

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
so that's a little bit new and there's

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.590 
so that's a little bit new and there's
some<00:05:45.190> other<00:05:45.340> detail<00:05:45.670> functions<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.450> features

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
some other detail functions and features

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.140 
some other detail functions and features
that<00:05:46.990> we've<00:05:47.140> changed<00:05:47.470> we've<00:05:48.430> added<00:05:48.610> a<00:05:48.820> step

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
that we've changed we've added a step

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.450 
that we've changed we've added a step
zoom<00:05:49.480> to<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:49.810> control<00:05:50.230> ring<00:05:50.470> okay<00:05:50.830> so<00:05:51.250> does

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
zoom to the control ring okay so does

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.380 
zoom to the control ring okay so does
that<00:05:51.490> mean<00:05:51.790> by<00:05:52.030> turning<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:52.660> ring<00:05:52.930> you<00:05:53.530> can

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
that mean by turning the ring you can

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.020 
that mean by turning the ring you can
select<00:05:55.390> any<00:05:55.750> of<00:05:56.080> four<00:05:56.380> preset<00:05:57.250> focal<00:05:57.760> lengths

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
select any of four preset focal lengths

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.970 
select any of four preset focal lengths
in<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.390> 28<00:05:58.780> millimeter<00:05:59.140> 200<00:05:59.650> millimeter

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
in the 28 millimeter 200 millimeter

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.520 
in the 28 millimeter 200 millimeter
range<00:06:00.220> so<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.150> can<00:06:01.510> if<00:06:01.990> you<00:06:02.140> want<00:06:02.260> to<00:06:02.350> choose

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
range so you can if you want to choose

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.590 
range so you can if you want to choose
28<00:06:02.950> millimeters<00:06:03.370> 35<00:06:03.850> millimetres<00:06:04.240> 70

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
28 millimeters 35 millimetres 70

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.720 
28 millimeters 35 millimetres 70
millimetres<00:06:04.990> or<00:06:05.020> 100<00:06:05.410> millimeters<00:06:05.800> just<00:06:06.640> a

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
millimetres or 100 millimeters just a

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.390 
millimetres or 100 millimeters just a
slight<00:06:07.000> twist<00:06:07.360> of<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.810> ring<00:06:08.050> will<00:06:08.860> call<00:06:09.220> up

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
slight twist of the ring will call up

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.100 
slight twist of the ring will call up
each<00:06:09.640> of<00:06:09.850> those<00:06:10.000> focal<00:06:10.450> lengths<00:06:10.690> if<00:06:10.780> you<00:06:10.960> don't

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
each of those focal lengths if you don't

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.770 
each of those focal lengths if you don't
have<00:06:11.350> to<00:06:11.530> adjust<00:06:11.950> it<00:06:12.130> very<00:06:12.340> very<00:06:12.520> precisely

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
have to adjust it very very precisely

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.420 
have to adjust it very very precisely
that's<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:13.900> quick<00:06:14.170> way<00:06:14.440> to<00:06:14.470> get<00:06:14.890> to<00:06:14.950> a

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
that's a quick way to get to a

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.170 
that's a quick way to get to a
pre-designated<00:06:16.120> focal<00:06:16.870> length<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:18.120> there's<00:06:19.120> a

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
pre-designated focal length so there's a

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.880 
pre-designated focal length so there's a
couple<00:06:19.390> of<00:06:19.540> minor<00:06:19.780> feature<00:06:20.230> changes<00:06:20.710> we've

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
couple of minor feature changes we've

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.860 
couple of minor feature changes we've
added<00:06:21.070> 24p<00:06:21.820> to<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:22.030> movie<00:06:22.270> capability

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
added 24p to the movie capability

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.950 
added 24p to the movie capability
obviously<00:06:23.500> rx100<00:06:24.220> had<00:06:24.640> full<00:06:24.910> HD<00:06:25.270> capture

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
obviously rx100 had full HD capture

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.920 
obviously rx100 had full HD capture
capability<00:06:26.530> up<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.770> 60<00:06:27.070> P<00:06:27.310> but<00:06:28.150> we've<00:06:28.270> added<00:06:28.419> 24

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
capability up to 60 P but we've added 24

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.690 
capability up to 60 P but we've added 24
P

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
P

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.910

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
and availability mark yeah so the Yellin

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.260 
and availability mark yeah so the Yellin
the<00:06:37.680> mark<00:06:37.890> -<00:06:38.100> is<00:06:38.280> really<00:06:38.490> sort<00:06:38.790> of<00:06:38.850> a<00:06:38.910> step<00:06:39.180> up

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
the mark - is really sort of a step up

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.750 
the mark - is really sort of a step up
model<00:06:39.630> from<00:06:39.840> the<00:06:39.990> rx100<00:06:40.440> it<00:06:40.800> really<00:06:41.130> has<00:06:41.610> the

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
model from the rx100 it really has the

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.510 
model from the rx100 it really has the
same<00:06:41.790> sort<00:06:42.240> of<00:06:42.330> performance<00:06:43.320> as<00:06:43.560> a<00:06:43.590> camera<00:06:44.130> it

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
same sort of performance as a camera it

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.120 
same sort of performance as a camera it
really<00:06:44.820> achieved<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.420> same<00:06:45.600> ideals<00:06:46.050> of<00:06:46.410> lens

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
really achieved the same ideals of lens

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.030 
really achieved the same ideals of lens
sensor<00:06:47.610> and<00:06:47.880> compactness<00:06:48.870> but<00:06:49.680> it<00:06:49.800> is<00:06:49.890> gonna

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
sensor and compactness but it is gonna

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.230 
sensor and compactness but it is gonna
be<00:06:50.160> a<00:06:50.190> little<00:06:50.370> bit<00:06:50.490> more<00:06:50.580> expensive<00:06:50.850> than<00:06:51.060> the

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
be a little bit more expensive than the

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.290 
be a little bit more expensive than the
rx100<00:06:51.660> the<00:06:51.990> rx100<00:06:52.410> is<00:06:52.680> currently<00:06:53.070> 649<00:06:53.670> the

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
rx100 the rx100 is currently 649 the

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.570 
rx100 the rx100 is currently 649 the
rx100<00:06:54.840> mark<00:06:55.650> ii<00:06:55.860> is<00:06:56.010> going<00:06:56.190> to<00:06:56.250> be<00:06:56.310> positioned

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
rx100 mark ii is going to be positioned

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.690 
rx100 mark ii is going to be positioned
as<00:06:56.910> 749<00:06:57.660> so<00:06:58.080> about<00:06:58.260> $100<00:06:58.710> difference<00:06:59.100> but<00:06:59.220> $100

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
as 749 so about $100 difference but $100

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.920 
as 749 so about $100 difference but $100
different<00:07:00.060> and<00:07:00.150> then<00:07:00.240> you<00:07:00.330> get<00:07:00.480> again<00:07:00.690> those

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
different and then you get again those

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.230 
different and then you get again those
more<00:07:01.710> versatility<00:07:02.100> yeah<00:07:02.730> versatility

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
more versatility yeah versatility

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.850 
more versatility yeah versatility
nutshell<00:07:03.780> and<00:07:03.960> also<00:07:04.410> the<00:07:04.500> low-light

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
nutshell and also the low-light

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.830 
nutshell and also the low-light
performance<00:07:04.890> that'll<00:07:05.700> be<00:07:05.790> an<00:07:05.880> advantage<00:07:06.180> in

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
performance that'll be an advantage in

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.020
