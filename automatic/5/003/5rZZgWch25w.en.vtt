00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.160
 Vienna at number 10 is tekken 5 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.240
 It's a good game until the first five minutes of playing it because they believe 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.290
 which is called tekken 5 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.220
 this guy fights 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.960
 its history is not very good control management is crap is not understood 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.160
 my ass unless it is in Spanish and that is not so much its difficulty is so 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.780
 easy that the third level or you have to repeat 44 times xd the little good and your 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.090
 graphics and their characters and see that you have to unlock each of them 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.120
 fulfilling each story of each character 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.410
 a friend recommended it to us today I wanted to throw that game out the window 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.450

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.600

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:09.519

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.389
 good in ninth place is transformers 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.930

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.640
 repetitive repetitive xd many mistakes of shit two more difficult stories 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.890
 that the fucking shit unintelligible levels luckily could be changed from 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.249
 transformer to car 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.290

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.269
 enemies from before 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.959
 the control is already unmanageable 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.580
 you can no longer change car to transformer when you want 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.279
