00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.880
 I ever with the fifth game without highlights the TuS a purely hangs around 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.989
 Bicycle tourists against 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:11.570
 Papers from moody's see people go great but I have that 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.829
 House found a full tank is 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:15.129
 first time 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.129
 Just spank a machine 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.080
 Per cent washing machine then you need one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 Screen at his title Screen 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.619
 he is with two thick plasma screens in plus at Munich 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.780
 he should keep it that way 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.860
 here too, they would be 16 immigrants 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.929
 So I'm here now 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.189
 wide 64 pixels and for much to offer 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.010
 Thurber there 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.820
 after that 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.069
 Holes again 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:49.670
 for promoter chips 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.070
 Aurich metier Schiltz and an increase with the crisis takes we already know 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.070
 Somewhere Ruhl to see this price at Piqué 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.550
 to Dessau 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.010
 it was necessary 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 now tilt 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.610
 a multiplex Chapman 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
 and at constant at 0 even with 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.610
 Sum 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.590
 two service 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
 and twice 255 and 1 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.110
 even if it's lost 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.600
 more 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 now custom fit a seat 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.690
 that's why Nucleus comes out of it so that everything is nice and Ricard and pretty much in the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.840
 fifa ranking had game 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 HSG dressed 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.810
 and then around 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.000
 was required now 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.750
 Pot controller 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.730
 He comes to the Gentiles 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.710
 and 2 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.140
 Pharm 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.100
 yes I think then come 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.140
 so there first 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.470
 around 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.130
 Pixels x 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 when to make it easier 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.089
 despite the fact that they enjoyed Pixel x 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.689
 increasingly comes an increase in the crisis with chip 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:16.710
 and 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.049
 change children 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.689
 then come to the others 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.089
 provides 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.999
 and now at the War Band the Crickets nand chips 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.270
 soon it became the concept of Uni deployment ears that was 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.559
 also from the priests the chefs 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.359
 Head to scratch Berlin 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.559
 and then in the second round one is what you others too 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.139
 now the multiples pieces 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.420
 Arthur arguably the bankruptcy comes so constantly on Android's first LED Warner for the 50th 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.979
 I do that now because pixel g is quasi for the color 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:01.349
 So actually which herb duo which Kraus is when you know it completely 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.129
 the second 5 40 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.129
 See Roman Weger behind the bars 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.469
 around 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.700
 a pixel g 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.700
 then stop so meant Nolte whip 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.569
 I think it's wrong 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.589
 neither not 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:23.339
 and then multiplayer b gives it 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.859
 Antoine is 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.799
 whether controller and saving mau from once the output want to get out and show 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.389
 Munich 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.259
 with Ronny a century 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.209
 So first from percent approximates 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.209
 on the screen SEL Corner 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.749
 So placement and the trader died 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:54.239
 but I think that pit later I'll do the word German 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.569
 Actually I pass that I am a professional 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.209
 takes care of 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.209
 exceeded bets 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.240
 so 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.240
 Ali said Tanner 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.469
 the transport control was 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.810
 comes too late that's quasi 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.679
 Navas painted was great so delete everything 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.679
 under so Horner too so pm 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.360
 It is best to do something first 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.099
 Percent Barmstedt 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.610

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.219
 Project is now closed 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.250
 Percent the about spot controller should be times left with the seat 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.129
 on the right you do that 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.129
 that you do not walk much 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.159
 around 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.319
 Crisis country in crisis country 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.639
 I'm always so sure I like watching 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.300
 So I believe in the Peaks 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.300
 x in crises the kitchens and 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.300
 comment 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.539
 So he's going over left and right that's women 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.430
 I'm just not sure which order 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.879
 I think 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.879
 first the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.700
 In crises away lies chip corporation 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.569

 Jörg Pott Control Output d 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.259
 Drachselsried Sorg and then 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.150
 like crisis country 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
 comes worry 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800
 11 had been transported »Output 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.229
 and 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.490
 sometimes in crisis country 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.199
 around 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.370
 Percent Zuma have output 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.330
 Kurth was here, too 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.080
 correct buy today got up early at half past eleven 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.960
 around 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.119
 I think I wanted "My mistake was right 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.979
 rather 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.100
 the crisis is taking 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.740
 chewing Anhalt to St 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.930
 Now I look warm from 1 pressed left mouse button 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.759
 then you would have to give up in the corner suv-ripe point 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.210
 because then you have the 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.610
 which, mind you, are wrong 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.960
 moves Euro yes 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.910
 here were percent and IVG Fries will be the first and then depressive 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.910
 reference point 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:32.599
 as is 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.719
 and how you can paint that but only if the mouse button is held down 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.309
 The artist flashes once briefly to see strain is the Russian 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.099
 if they do not hold 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.939
 then percent 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.659
 then he is just black and so could because they are so minor mistakes 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.749
 correct again 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:58.139
 Sometimes there is a way when space then pushes then everything is gone 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:03.119
 Janes probably get up and start hanging out on them 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.169
 Kühn calls Scans accused 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.249
 according to the Leyen, although she is actually feeling nothing 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.029
 I think Springs in the air
