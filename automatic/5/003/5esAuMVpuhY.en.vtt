00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hi there, this is all the answer book video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:13.139
 About the navigator 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:16.199
 us navigator as if he seemed to me 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:25.970
 as if universal enough I 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.970
 I bought this one here on 6 doses 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:35.930
 Here the battery for 1 amp hour is pronounced 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.149
 promises 3 hours of battery life 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.500
 we have an audio output charging output and 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.879
 knocked down and the computer connects 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.329
 Naturally, such an intellect 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.610
 such a little charge is usually nothing 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:59.239
 noteworthy for cars there found this 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.960
 thing here she was not metal 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.360
 plastics 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.930
 she's like a thousand kilometers somewhere 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.280
 I wound it burst just and everything 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.140
 and I had to glue you to the next 3 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.049
 loop there then came just changed from 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.990
 Another charge put on like this 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.409
 same empty that unnecessary zero 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.840
 I will bite here such usual standard 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.610
 motorola vsr asians 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.869
 bundled broken into 7 daoud usually 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.380
 quite normal 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.530
 charging 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.980
 quite normally charge got out 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.390
 any problems you can charge it from 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.970
 ordinary sockets here from such jambs 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.310
 He then light and glass I like it 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.310
 would not like because 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.090
 that is, when it charges if 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.159
 the machine for example from permanently connected 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.850
 Here we have such a light bulb which is so 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.500
 that's very very bright think it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.500
 not much visible but here so here I am 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.810
 almost invisible 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.330
 how would you look at him at all 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.069
 not visible on here and so if we look 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.069
 that almost every light is very very 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.230
 shines vlohov beats secret that is 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.880
 not really cool by the way this is the same 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.519
 sailor flour charging socket with here is 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.190
 if we have mudguards 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:40.220
 way to study why this thing here 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.810
 not for nothing is exactly as it turn out 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.459
 that again such rubbing and at three o'clock 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.810
 we have enough for all that only 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.000
 can by and large 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.709
 You are certainly not garmin tourist 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.420
 which day tailoring yes without shutdown 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.760
 quite enough and I 'll get literally 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.319
 enabled for a couple of minutes to determine where 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.790
 us go to center the map north 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.630
 took directions calmly 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.319
 go where we need then 5 included 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.060
 in such a spirit, here is a forest very best for tourists 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.540
 direction everything was like a bag with this 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.940
 ok keeps smash here we are only 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.440
 selling them to pine warriors here quite 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.690
 maybe under some kind of empty 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.150
 cover of deciduous forest can be 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.980
 will and lose in the car in the woods like 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.109
 Already bad holds 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.090
 is lost often enough and as it should 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.780
 already almost well and the glass like your ip it 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.260
 at least somehow 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.260
 stroked okay that's about that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.360
 what is not tired of the kit is still such a thing 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.550
 or as a principle at all in plain sight 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:48.410
 Well, here is when there is such a nuance 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:51.350
 him, the simus is still an additional such 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.180
 but if only there was such a telescopic 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:00.050
 I have not eaten passive somewhere already here 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.540
 It seems in principle the whole map is normal 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.660
 go loaded navitel goes about it 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.690
 will leave garmin too you can run by 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.190
 all kinds of desire to the world and so on too 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.950
 all well in general, everything is basically all that 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.250
 you can run compare here 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.600
 unity and started stopped here this 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.150
 she settled on his 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.560
 for the city and country trips 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.010
 how he didn't turn out he is more accurate not 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.930
 here in all the nuances 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.030
 there are some places that even have dirt roads 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.740
 such country all the rest that is 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.070
 Well, how could he be more precise on the vital she 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.390
 about here and most like others 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.810
 programs such where in general 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.419
 some friend there is no here but out of town 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.070
 Of course , visit the skin that you need here 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.090
 general staff sun key card kilometers and 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.090
 usual hours in the gar 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.290
 is loading 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.150
 loaded satellites trying to look at the 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.040
 him it does not work true it can 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.260
 be just a little bit this signal conditions 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:22.180
 such indoors shielded from it 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:24.730
 almost invisible this business works 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.000
 may not be very fast but more than 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.930
 for hiking weights in principle 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.820
 it will not be possible to notice quite a 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.720
 class tanks tattoo put it somewhere 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.290
 in the forest there is a bunch of different chic 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.110
 Diana 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:45.580
 Well, still on the general staff there is ushu all 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.650
 Partially, I can partially forest there 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.630
 put the mushrooms went back came back 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.860
 in everyday life from well, everything is normal direction 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:06:00.120
 took on this thing you are almost a meter to a meter 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.120
 no problem here 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.410
 such a thing is enough for me 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.700
 universal unless of course for some 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.480
 weekly course 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.480
 deus 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.449
 Here is a little small holding well 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.960
 battery if there are no cell phones 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:25.259
 navigator on like mine for example here a 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.069
 quite more than normal its functions 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:31.430
 perform like one hundred percent not all 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.430
 bye everyone
