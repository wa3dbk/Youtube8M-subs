00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.790
 there are giuseppe di ragusa 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 I am Giulia from the province of 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.410
 milan but i also live in ragusa 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.580
 then today 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.559
 we explain the basic passing pattern 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:08.580
 with the clubs that is the four counts 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:10.259
 let's see immediately we hold a club 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.369
 we prefer to use these clubs and they are 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.950
 of the Milan that an intermediate class between 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.340
 a fast club a club albatros that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.000
 it was a very slow club a bit too 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.830
 past 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 these are the pirouettes that are more 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.490
 fast then for those who want to buy the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.860
 clave since we are not cheap 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.610
 a faster circus type game then 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.610
 a little this way 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.060
 the pirouette differences are more suitable 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.220
 of the mirage the albatrosses that are more 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.040
 big ones are slower we like them than 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.810
 the more they are more visible and they are also a bit 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.160
 better than outside for when it's there 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.340
 the wind well to see the first 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.230
 exercise for porters counts four the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.900
 passing then you do as you well 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.080
 first seen by two people 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.230
 that we are going to coordinate with the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.120
 rhythm then we play and important 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.120
 look always accompanies you to try to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.580
 take the same pace they 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.580
 looking at us he finds launching together 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.810
 we often see people trying 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:38.440
 to do the passing but one is not very fast 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:40.240
 1 but very slow so in the moment in 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.370
 which is counted for does not coincide but 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.770
 time jump then first exercise 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.770
 Once again 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.000
 second step we learn to throw 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.790
 from side to side 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.630
 the companion approaching the a.d the point 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.580
 of arrival of the club then we aim more 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.580
 or less next to the shoulder 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:20.130
 we will call this pitch step il 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:27.050
 step is this self throw steps 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.050
 chosen pass pass 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:37.300
 to give ourselves the initial rhythm we do 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.300
 let's get up lower and throw together 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.209
 as in the initial rhythm game 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.180
 we keep our gaze forward and look 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.489
 the club we pass this way 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:01.060
 we will also go to the visual field 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:02.800
 we get there we can also train 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.080
 passages with the left hand there 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.080
 will serve to make different patterns 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:22.380
 next exercise we call it snake 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.830
 32 of different color so it looks better 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.830
 the game 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.040
 let's pass the following clubs and that 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:37.490
 I always throw it red first 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.490
 then red white red white 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.370
 5 serious 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.140
 brought before we did here we start a 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.690
 keep the true rhythm of passing that 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.190
 therefore it counts four in four times 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:31.180
 the first is always a launch of port 1 2 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:32.710
 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 32 34 last one 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.020
 time we can do this 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.730
 this exercise we can pass 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:50.440
 directly with the six clubs and therefore there 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:54.930
 let 's start and leave for cc 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.930
 Possible may be playing nearby 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:03.390
 to improve control or away 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.979
 to play far away is important not 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:16.219
 bring the hand inside towards the 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:18.740
 leg but bring it back so as to 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:20.749
 being able to load well launch and be able to 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.439
 get even far but now 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.439
 let's see 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:29.209
 starting from the rhythm as we get to 6 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:31.969
 key this is important because in the 

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:34.339
 passing is the key thing to maintain 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:38.619
 the rhythm to the relationship with the partner e 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:38.619
 don't get lost in your games 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:44.800
 1 2 3 4 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.310
 we show a landfill scheme a 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.800
 an account 3 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.540
 we show it with a ploy for 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 make it easier at the beginning in 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.230
 this is both the right and the 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.690
 left because instead of counting 4 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.120
 we count 3 to make it easier 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:32.420
 at the beginning without thinking 12 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.670
 step 12 step just take two clubs is 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.610
 of a different color that will be the 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:41.740
 first we launch let's see that 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.740
 more simple sense
