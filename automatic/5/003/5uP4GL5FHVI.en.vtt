can<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.810> even<00:01:18.960> cooler<00:01:19.229> things<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.860> phase

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
can do even cooler things with phase

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.719 
can do even cooler things with phase
lock<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.610> example<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.450> put<00:01:21.720> points<00:01:22.080> into

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
lock for example if you put points into

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.020 
lock for example if you put points into
helio<00:01:23.729> skill<00:01:24.150> each<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:26.070> phase<00:01:26.490> lock<00:01:26.790> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
helio skill each use of phase lock is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510 
helio skill each use of phase lock is
joined<00:01:27.390> by<00:01:27.570> damage<00:01:28.140> dealing<00:01:28.439> explosion<00:01:29.189> see

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
joined by damage dealing explosion see

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.630 
joined by damage dealing explosion see
that's<00:01:29.880> that's<00:01:30.090> cool<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.900> you'd<00:01:31.829> rather<00:01:32.070> focus

that's that's cool if you'd rather focus

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.270 
that's that's cool if you'd rather focus
on<00:01:32.759> healing<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.110> gain<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> ability<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
on healing you can gain the ability to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.420 
on healing you can gain the ability to
use<00:01:35.460> phase<00:01:35.729> lock<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.360> resurrect<00:01:36.930> allies<00:01:37.860> from

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
