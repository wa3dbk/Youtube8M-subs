00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
obviously I don't use it but it was a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.340 
obviously I don't use it but it was a
pretty<00:01:22.320> nice<00:01:22.530> UI<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.850> stuff<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.930> problem

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
pretty nice UI and stuff but the problem

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
pretty nice UI and stuff but the problem
was<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.710> seemed<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.189> OD<00:01:26.369> racier<00:01:26.820> number<00:01:27.210> if

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
was it seemed like a OD racier number if

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
was it seemed like a OD racier number if
you<00:01:27.630> did<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.990> use<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.770> week<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.369> think

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you did not use it for a week I think

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.609 
you did not use it for a week I think
that's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.090> little<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:30.329> crazy<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:31.229> maybe<00:01:31.470> if

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that's a little bit crazy now maybe if

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.219 
that's a little bit crazy now maybe if
you<00:01:31.710> use<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> long<00:01:32.400> term<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:34.140> won't

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you use it for a long term then it won't

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 
you use it for a long term then it won't
delete<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.710> number<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.130> fast<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> did

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
delete you number that fast but it did

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.700
