current you know CDC category 5 pandemic

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.349 
current you know CDC category 5 pandemic
definition<00:03:14.099> is<00:03:14.219> a<00:03:14.280> two<00:03:14.760> percent<00:03:15.180> mortality

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.229 
definition is a two percent mortality
virus<00:03:16.049> like<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.439> 1918<00:03:17.189> pandemic<00:03:17.939> which<00:03:17.970> is

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
virus like the 1918 pandemic which is

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.670 
virus like the 1918 pandemic which is
the<00:03:18.389> deadliest<00:03:18.750> plague<00:03:19.049> in<00:03:19.229> human<00:03:19.530> history

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the deadliest plague in human history

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.759 
the deadliest plague in human history
and<00:03:20.189> that<00:03:20.310> was<00:03:20.430> 2<00:03:20.549> percent<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:21.239> was<00:03:21.419> 2.5%<00:03:22.229> and

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
and that was 2 percent that was 2.5% and

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.309 
and that was 2 percent that was 2.5% and
now<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:24.120> have<00:03:24.150> something<00:03:24.569> at<00:03:24.659> sixty<00:03:25.169> percent

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
now we have something at sixty percent

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.409 
now we have something at sixty percent
so<00:03:25.650> regular<00:03:26.400> seasonal<00:03:26.759> flu<00:03:26.939> is<00:03:27.000> about<00:03:27.180> point

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
so regular seasonal flu is about point

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.140 
so regular seasonal flu is about point
one<00:03:27.569> percent<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.259> 25<00:03:28.650> deadly<00:03:29.280> 25<00:03:29.909> times

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
one percent so 25 deadly 25 times

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.140 
one percent so 25 deadly 25 times

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
influenza is that for SARS you become

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.530 
influenza is that for SARS you become
symptomatic<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.790> then<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.239> become
