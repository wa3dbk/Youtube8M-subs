00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.220
 and finally the nikon d4 s arrived 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.519
 the evolution of the award-winning nikon 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.080
 d4 nikon d4 which was studied together 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.090
 the professionals and among other things just 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.309
 returned from the Olympic Games for members 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.229
 precisely because it was attested by 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.839
 professional photographers that more 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.180
 require autofocus performance e 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.739
 therefore high level performance either 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.239
 as for the framerate than for 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.699
 every single setting included 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.799
 that of the transmission of the 4 e 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.930
 then a camera and with the 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.309
 devolution of the d 4s studied with i 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.739
 professionals of each individual 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.659
 particularly the philosophy that starts 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.119
 therefore also from the choice of the sensor 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.670
 then the evolution of the sensor from 16 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:07.580
 million pixels of the four 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 we find improved with an extension 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.469
 of range 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.880
 very interesting we will get to 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.350
 absolutely iso sensitivity 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.929
 surprising but we will see it later in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.719
 detail informs general therefore also 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.709
 ergonomics has been optimized for 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.549
 indulge or otherwise listen 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:28.619
 every single suggestion that comes from 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.549
 any sector of photography 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.250
 professional 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.340
 undoubtedly the flagship the queen 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.929
 of the night for the abilities of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.429
 photography at high ISO 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.159
 but it is also the flagship for how much 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.679
 regards the burst of frames to the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.110
 second and the ability to capture e 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.539
 follow the subject in auto focus 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.969
 so there will be many and now we will see it 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.789
 in detail the innovations introduced on 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.189
 of 4s that in short was very expected to 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.700
 professional level and leads to 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.709
 definitely a breath of fresh air 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.599
 optimized the sensor then 16 million 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.250
 of pixels and in which it has been enhanced 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.349
 the quality level of the range 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.039
 dynamic and therefore a step of 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:14.750
 ISO sensitivity 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.269
 reached up to 25,000 iso and in h4 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.950
 even to the ISO sensitivity of 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.409
 over 400,000 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.659
 undoubtedly it is the flagship then the 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.060
 queen of the dark that will allow levels 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.609
 high- quality qualitative even at high 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.099
 sensitivity for performance certainly 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.019
 very high 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.629
 the system was therefore increased 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.760
 improved compared to the four 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.620
 subject tracking ability 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.230
 we said 11 frames per second in 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.480
 auto focus and a new one has been added 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.359
 function the ability to choose 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.739
 within the 51 areas which are the 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.409
 new areas to be used for 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.950
 the pursuit of the subject then the 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.230
 new group function f selectable 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.540
 from the point of view therefore of the commissioning 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.310
 focus of the improvements that as I said 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.859
 they have been absolutely certified 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.019
 we also don't forget about members 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.010
 enhanced video performance on the 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.389
 4s 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.730
 we already inherit from the four 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.530
 possibility to choose areas 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.989
 inside the sensor then not 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.669
 necessarily 24 hours from six precisely 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.919
 very important when searching 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.870
 obviously more expressive with 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.659
 the field angle 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.180
 now also in full hd in fifty e 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.669
 then sixty progressive to be able to 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.549
 also obtain subsequent slow motion 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.500
 qualitative level also to others 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.680
 sensitivity has grown a lot thanks to 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 a dedicated further 3D reduction reduction 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.510
 which therefore works perfectly for 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.049
 achieve quality levels to others 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.569
 certainly a record sensitivity yes 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.250
 studied and could not be outdone 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.049
 through those who are i 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.269
 field professionals use it e 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.379
 they squeeze it and require characteristics 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.620
 absolutely at the top 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.329
 we all said photography in the field 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.630
 sporty formula 1 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.910
 MotoGP 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.050
 the famous soccer or all sports 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.820
 even indoors 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.350
 let's not forget about basketball and 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.570
 other sports that are definitely not 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.300
 less important including that of 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.890
 empty but not just obviously in everything 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.660
 what is very important in 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.760
 ceremony for example in the whole 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.910
 professional wedding photography 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.330
 being able to shoot at high sensitivity 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.030
 with the high quality level opens 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.220
 obviously a photographic expression a 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.170
 qualitative expression certainly from 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.860
 primacy at this time with the d 4s 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.240
 the range of sensitivity certainly opens up 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.670
 incredible potentials in what he can 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.510
 be photography in the field 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.010
 scientific in medicine included 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.980
 also in everything related to 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.050
 example the investigation because nikon d4 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.330
 they will make you recognize a face 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.000
 in short, even in almost complete darkness it is 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.470
 definitely a new record he has 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.470
 set in quality
