now we're going to remove our antenna
from<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.930> fender<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:00.739> got<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:00.920> remove<00:01:01.039> this

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
from the fender you got to remove this

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.920 
from the fender you got to remove this
retaining<00:01:01.370> nut<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.180> best<00:01:02.390> way<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.539> do<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.840> is

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
retaining nut the best way to do it is

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:18.590 
retaining nut the best way to do it is
with<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.079> crescent

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300 

and<00:01:19.260> even<00:01:19.470> though<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.650> toss<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.040> aside<00:01:20.130> earlier

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
and even though we toss it aside earlier

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.760 
and even though we toss it aside earlier
good<00:01:21.180> idea<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.510> keep<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> antenna<00:01:22.080> Mescon<00:01:22.530> for

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
good idea to keep the antenna Mescon for

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.140 
good idea to keep the antenna Mescon for
this<00:01:22.890> step<00:01:24.380> once<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> remove<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.800> nut<00:01:26.150> now

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
this step once you remove the nut now

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.260 
this step once you remove the nut now
you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.330> slide<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> base<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> top<00:01:29.270> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you can slide the base over the top you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.730 
you can slide the base over the top you
want<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> make<00:01:30.570> sure<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.840> hold<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.410> antenna

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
want to make sure to hold on the antenna

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
want to make sure to hold on the antenna
because<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.010> you<00:01:32.070> don't<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.580> will<00:01:32.760> fall<00:01:33.060> down

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
because if you don't it will fall down

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.490 
because if you don't it will fall down
into<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> fender<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:36.540> brackets<00:01:37.080> would<00:01:37.260> hold

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
into the fender this brackets would hold

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
into the fender this brackets would hold
the<00:01:37.680> antenna<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.190> place<00:01:38.550> I<00:01:38.910> want<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> slide<00:01:39.660> the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
through now we're going to fish it

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.950 
through now we're going to fish it
across<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.490> our<00:04:52.520> radio<00:04:55.540> we'll<00:04:56.540> plug<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.930> back

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
across to our radio we'll plug it back

our<00:05:09.669> shorty<00:05:10.059> antenna<00:05:10.149> is<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.509> huge<00:05:10.779> improvement

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
our shorty antenna is a huge improvement

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.929 
our shorty antenna is a huge improvement
over<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.529> one<00:05:11.559> that<00:05:11.709> we<00:05:11.919> removed<00:05:12.249> even<00:05:12.699> have

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:12.939 
over the one that we removed even have

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:14.999 
over the one that we removed even have
better<00:05:13.059> reception<00:05:13.449> than<00:05:13.629> we<00:05:13.779> did<00:05:13.899> before<00:05:14.050> the

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
better reception than we did before the

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.529 
better reception than we did before the
installation<00:05:15.159> is<00:05:15.459> not<00:05:15.580> too<00:05:15.729> difficult<00:05:15.969> the

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
installation is not too difficult the

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.269 
installation is not too difficult the
only<00:05:16.689> trick<00:05:16.929> is<00:05:17.110> holding<00:05:17.439> the<00:05:17.499> antenna<00:05:17.889> when

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:18.279 
only trick is holding the antenna when

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.399 
only trick is holding the antenna when
you<00:05:18.369> install<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.819> mask<00:05:19.059> by<00:05:19.659> using<00:05:19.869> our<00:05:20.050> string

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
you install the mask by using our string

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:21.839 
you install the mask by using our string
trick<00:05:20.619> or<00:05:20.800> by<00:05:20.919> using<00:05:21.099> a<00:05:21.249> speaker<00:05:21.550> wire<00:05:21.729> we

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
trick or by using a speaker wire we

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:22.949 
trick or by using a speaker wire we
