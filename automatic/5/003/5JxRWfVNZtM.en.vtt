loom<00:00:08.610> Christmas<00:00:09.420> wreath<00:00:09.660> now<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.380> pattern<00:00:10.620> is

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
loom Christmas wreath now the pattern is

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.990 
loom Christmas wreath now the pattern is
one<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.160> came<00:00:11.309> up<00:00:11.460> with<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.730> summer

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
one that we came up with in the summer

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.360 
one that we came up with in the summer
and<00:00:12.360> I'm<00:00:13.080> pretty<00:00:13.469> certain<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.950> doesn't<00:00:14.190> exist

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
and I'm pretty certain it doesn't exist

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.070 
and I'm pretty certain it doesn't exist
but<00:00:14.580> I'm<00:00:14.639> not<00:00:14.759> sure<00:00:15.000> I've<00:00:15.150> asked<00:00:15.450> around<00:00:15.660> to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
but I'm not sure I've asked around to

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.599 
but I'm not sure I've asked around to
see<00:00:16.350> if<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.560> has<00:00:16.680> got<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> name<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.369> no<00:00:17.460> one's

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
see if this has got a name and no one's

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.460 
see if this has got a name and no one's
ready<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.880> come<00:00:18.000> up<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.240> anything<00:00:18.630> yet<00:00:18.779> it

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
ready to come up with anything yet it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.870 
ready to come up with anything yet it
works<00:00:19.740> really<00:00:19.949> well<00:00:20.039> also<00:00:20.310> has<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> little

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
works really well also has a little

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.210 
works really well also has a little
bracelet<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.480> two<00:00:21.689> colors<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.710> here's<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.070> we

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
bracelet in two colors so here's one we

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.040 
bracelet in two colors so here's one we
did<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> summer<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:24.029> two<00:00:24.210> colors<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
did in the summer with two colors and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.710 
did in the summer with two colors and
it's<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.380> nice<00:00:25.710> round<00:00:26.300> feeling<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it's got this nice round feeling to it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
it's got this nice round feeling to it
and<00:00:27.960> when<00:00:28.560> you've<00:00:28.680> got<00:00:28.800> two<00:00:28.949> colors<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.369> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and when you've got two colors at this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.580 
and when you've got two colors at this
really<00:00:29.730> nice<00:00:29.849> pattern<00:00:30.150> emerges<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.990> here's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
really nice pattern emerges and here's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.190 
really nice pattern emerges and here's
an<00:00:31.769> example<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.969> looks<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
an example of what it looks like in in

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.959 
an example of what it looks like in in
different<00:00:34.350> colors<00:00:34.829> sort<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.070> maybe<00:00:35.399> less<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
different colors sort of maybe less you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.580 
different colors sort of maybe less you
know<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> bit<00:00:36.239> more<00:00:36.420> feminine<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.200> want<00:00:37.410> but

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
know a bit more feminine if you want but

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
know a bit more feminine if you want but
obviously<00:00:37.950> any<00:00:38.070> color<00:00:38.340> works<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.760> anybody<00:00:38.940> so

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
obviously any color works for anybody so

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.209 
obviously any color works for anybody so
I<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> texture<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
I just like the texture and the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
I just like the texture and the
thickness<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.790> these<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.660> think<00:00:42.840> they

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
thickness of these and I think they

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.090 
thickness of these and I think they
worked<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.140> well<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.680> make<00:00:43.739> these<00:00:43.950> little

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
worked really well to make these little

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.889 
worked really well to make these little
wreaths<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.360> well<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:45.750> these

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
wreaths now as well with all these

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.660 
wreaths now as well with all these
things<00:00:46.170> finger<00:00:47.070> looming<00:00:47.340> often<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
things finger looming often in the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.950 
things finger looming often in the
beginning<00:00:47.789> looks<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:48.300> tricky<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.840> once

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
beginning looks a bit tricky but once

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.150 
beginning looks a bit tricky but once
you<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> hang<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:49.980> easy

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you get the hang of it it's really easy

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.639 
you get the hang of it it's really easy
and<00:00:50.489> using<00:00:51.329> two<00:00:51.510> colors<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.960> actually<00:00:52.230> easier

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and using two colors is actually easier

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.580 
and using two colors is actually easier
than<00:00:52.710> using<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> green<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:55.020> know

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
than using just the green so you know

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.810 
than using just the green so you know
maybe<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.190> give<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.640> with

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
maybe you just want to give it a go with

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.660 
maybe you just want to give it a go with
two<00:00:56.940> colors<00:00:57.239> first<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:58.199> how<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> goes<00:00:58.670> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
two colors first and see how it goes so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.250 
two colors first and see how it goes so
to<00:00:59.730> begin<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> use<00:01:00.960> four

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to begin with you're going to use four

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.389 
to begin with you're going to use four
fingers<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.829> you're<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.250> on

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
fingers so if you're going to do this on

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.509 
fingers so if you're going to do this on
a<00:01:02.430> pegboard<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.780> use<00:01:03.989> four<00:01:04.229> pegs

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
a pegboard you can just use four pegs

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
a pegboard you can just use four pegs
and<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.580> start<00:01:05.850> off<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.270> putting<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.020> red<00:01:07.229> one

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and you start off with putting a red one

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.859 
and you start off with putting a red one
at<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.040> middle<00:01:08.670> too<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
at the middle too and this is going to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.380 
at the middle too and this is going to
be<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> little<00:01:10.350> loop<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> top<00:01:11.060> then<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
be the little loop at the top then you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.109 
be the little loop at the top then you
get<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.049> green<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.250> put<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.520> over<00:01:14.580> three

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
get a green one and put it over three

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.060 
get a green one and put it over three
fingers<00:01:16.040> another<00:01:17.040> green<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:18.170> over<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
fingers another green one over and the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820 
fingers another green one over and the
other<00:01:20.250> three<00:01:20.700> fingers<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.619> then<00:01:22.619> you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
other three fingers like this then you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
other three fingers like this then you
release<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.729> speak<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.330> red<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
release so to speak the red one this is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.980 
release so to speak the red one this is
you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> start<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.119> off<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.810> then

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you know you start it off and then

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
you know you start it off and then
you've<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.380> sort<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.650> crisscross

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you've got this sort of crisscross

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.140 
you've got this sort of crisscross
pattern<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.170> take<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.380> next<00:01:31.850> loom<00:01:32.850> band

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
pattern and you take your next loom band

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
pattern and you take your next loom band
again<00:01:33.570> pop<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> over<00:01:34.110> always<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
again pop it over always do it in the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
again pop it over always do it in the
same<00:01:34.920> orders<00:01:35.250> always<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> left<00:01:36.840> side

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
same orders always go on the left side

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.060 
same orders always go on the left side
and<00:01:37.939> then<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.659> side<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> lower

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and then on the right side or the lower

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
and then on the right side or the lower
top<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> lower<00:01:42.000> depending<00:01:42.540> how<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.720> look<00:01:42.899> at

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
top and lower depending how you look at

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.719 
top and lower depending how you look at
it<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.490> you've<00:01:44.579> got

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it there we go so you know you've got

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.370 
it there we go so you know you've got
this<00:01:44.850> crisscross<00:01:45.329> pattern<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:45.869> four<00:01:46.140> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
this crisscross pattern with all four I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.420 
this crisscross pattern with all four I
always<00:01:46.979> begin<00:01:47.159> with<00:01:47.310> left<00:01:48.590> bottom<00:01:49.590> right

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.920 

bottom<00:01:53.430> or<00:01:53.909> inner<00:01:54.329> whatever<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.750> want<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
bottom or inner whatever you want to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.160 
bottom or inner whatever you want to
call<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.340> left<00:01:57.350> outer<00:01:59.509> right<00:02:00.509> out

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
call it and you go left outer right out

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.749 
call it and you go left outer right out
and<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> always<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.159> easiest<00:02:02.610> if

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
and I always think it's just easiest if

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.389 
and I always think it's just easiest if
you<00:02:02.790> keep<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.380> gonna<00:02:04.500> pull<00:02:05.280> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
you keep going I'm just gonna pull that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
you keep going I'm just gonna pull that
red<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.640> down<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:05.969> always<00:02:06.180> good<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.750> you're

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
red one down it's always good if you're

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.800 
red one down it's always good if you're
keeping<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.290> order

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.840 

I<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:10.080> how<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.350> one<00:02:10.500> got<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.700> always

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
I know how that one got back it's always

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.120 
I know how that one got back it's always
left<00:02:12.480> right<00:02:12.810> left<00:02:13.020> right<00:02:13.350> left<00:02:13.500> right<00:02:13.950> and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
left right left right left right and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.040 
left right left right left right and
that<00:02:14.459> really<00:02:14.640> helps<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.450> there<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.690> go

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
that really helps so there you go

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.380 
that really helps so there you go
so<00:02:16.319> again<00:02:16.800> next<00:02:17.190> once<00:02:17.490> we<00:02:17.640> get<00:02:17.730> all<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.240> all

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
so again next once we get all that all

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.490 
so again next once we get all that all
we<00:02:18.780> put<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.050> over<00:02:19.260> all<00:02:19.410> three<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.200> then<00:02:22.350> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
we put it over all three and then the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.440 
we put it over all three and then the
next<00:02:22.770> one<00:02:22.950> over<00:02:23.280> or<00:02:23.430> three<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.240> left

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
next one over or three so on the left

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.449 
next one over or three so on the left
side<00:02:24.569> first<00:02:25.020> then<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.530> right<00:02:25.740> always<00:02:26.250> just

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
side first then the right always just

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.120 
side first then the right always just
keep<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.790> order<00:02:27.150> then<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.870> go<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> left<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.950> a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
keep the order then you go the left in a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.380 
keep the order then you go the left in a
move<00:02:29.880> right<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.569> there<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.050> left<00:02:31.950> outer<00:02:32.390> the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
circular loopy emerging it was quite

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.949 
circular loopy emerging it was quite
neat<00:03:02.250> already<00:03:02.519> doesn't<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:02.940> now<00:03:03.690> I'm<00:03:03.840> not

you know it would make this video really
long<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:07.680> really<00:03:07.860> boring<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:09.060> just

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
