models<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.689> vg10<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.590> believe<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.430> one

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
models have like vg10 I believe at one

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.440 
models have like vg10 I believe at one
point<00:01:44.759> they<00:01:45.000> did<00:01:45.149> 18<00:01:45.390> 440c<00:01:46.229> stainless<00:01:47.450> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
point they did 18 440c stainless you

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.130 
point they did 18 440c stainless you
know<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.720> there's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> couple<00:01:49.020> different

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
know so there's a couple different

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.440 
know so there's a couple different
generations<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.159> there's<00:01:50.759> my<00:01:51.299> new

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
generations and there's my new

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.760 
generations and there's my new
differences<00:01:51.960> between<00:01:52.140> them<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:52.649> basically

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
differences between them but basically

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
differences between them but basically
it's<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.220> same<00:01:53.430> overall<00:01:54.270> design<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:57.270> knife

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it's the same overall design this knife

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.830 
it's the same overall design this knife
is<00:01:57.719> uh<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:59.460> appears<00:01:59.610> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.119> slightly

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
is uh you know it appears to be slightly

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170 
is uh you know it appears to be slightly
used<00:02:01.229> which<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.680> fine<00:02:01.890> because<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.280> mean<00:02:02.579> use

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
used which is fine because I mean use

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.609 
used which is fine because I mean use
the<00:02:03.210> heck<00:02:03.450> out<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> great

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the heck out of this one it's a great

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.199 
the heck out of this one it's a great
great<00:02:04.950> user<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:06.450> looks<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.990> he<00:02:08.209> sharpened

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
great user it looks like he sharpened

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.729 
great user it looks like he sharpened
this<00:02:09.300> he<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:09.780> changed<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.289> edge

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
this he actually changed the edge

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.410 
this he actually changed the edge
geometry<00:02:11.270> slightly<00:02:12.270> made<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> kind<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
geometry slightly made it kind of

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.900 
geometry slightly made it kind of
an<00:02:13.569> acute<00:02:13.870> angle<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.069> can<00:02:15.190> imagine<00:02:15.370> this

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
an acute angle if you can imagine this

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.820 
an acute angle if you can imagine this
being<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.300> original<00:02:16.630> angle<00:02:16.840> kind<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.590> brought

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
being the original angle kind of brought

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.589 
being the original angle kind of brought
down<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> little<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.430> makes<00:02:19.180> for<00:02:19.330> an<00:02:19.420> even

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
down a little bit makes for an even

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.260 
down a little bit makes for an even
sharper<00:02:19.870> edge<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.610> s30v

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
sharper edge because this is s30v

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.580 
sharper edge because this is s30v
stainless<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.440> will<00:02:23.620> actually<00:02:24.040> hold<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.090> edge

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
stainless it will actually hold the edge

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.990 
stainless it will actually hold the edge
one<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> its<00:02:26.830> benefits<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.400> because<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:27.910> such

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
one of its benefits is because it's such

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.559 
one of its benefits is because it's such
a<00:02:28.030> hard<00:02:28.270> steel<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.640> can<00:02:30.819> you<00:02:30.970> can<00:02:31.150> change<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
a hard steel you can you can change the

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.690 
a hard steel you can you can change the
edge<00:02:31.660> geometry<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.620> little<00:02:32.860> bit<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.580> make

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
edge geometry a little bit you can make

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.100 
edge geometry a little bit you can make
that<00:02:33.880> edge<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:34.630> bit<00:02:34.720> thinner<00:02:34.989> and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
that edge just a little bit thinner and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.900 
that edge just a little bit thinner and
a<00:02:35.290> little<00:02:35.319> bit<00:02:35.560> sharper<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.190> it'll<00:02:36.790> actually

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
a little bit sharper and it'll actually

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.970 
a little bit sharper and it'll actually
still<00:02:37.390> maintain<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.989> edge<00:02:38.140> for<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.440> while<00:02:38.590> for

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
still maintain that edge for a while for

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.430 
still maintain that edge for a while for
you<00:02:39.160> know<00:02:39.250> pretty<00:02:39.489> good<00:02:39.670> time<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:41.050> again<00:02:41.260> one

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
you know pretty good time so again one

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.050 
you know pretty good time so again one
of<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.590> benefits<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.370> really<00:02:42.910> like

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
of the benefits of that I really like

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.290 
of the benefits of that I really like
what<00:02:43.239> he<00:02:43.300> did<00:02:43.420> with<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.200> believe<00:02:44.620> he<00:02:44.830> used

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
what he did with this I believe he used

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.840 
what he did with this I believe he used
edge<00:02:46.300> Pro<00:02:46.810> apex<00:02:47.200> system<00:02:47.610> similar<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.640> what<00:02:48.790> I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
edge Pro apex system similar to what I

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.699 
edge Pro apex system similar to what I
have<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:50.170> awesome

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
have so awesome

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.170 
have so awesome

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
I actually was carrying this all day

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.059 
I actually was carrying this all day
today<00:02:58.299> I've<00:02:59.170> had<00:02:59.319> this<00:02:59.470> for<00:02:59.650> about<00:02:59.799> two<00:02:59.950> days

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
today I've had this for about two days

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.160 
today I've had this for about two days
now<00:03:00.130> first<00:03:01.000> day<00:03:01.209> couldn't<00:03:01.690> stop<00:03:01.840> playing<00:03:01.870> with

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
now first day couldn't stop playing with

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.039 
now first day couldn't stop playing with
it<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:03.459> know<00:03:03.640> it's<00:03:03.790> been<00:03:03.910> probably<00:03:04.150> maybe<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
it you know it's been probably maybe a

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.059 
it you know it's been probably maybe a
month<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.440> half<00:03:05.470> since<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.830> had<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:05.980> new

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
month and a half since I had a new

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.090 
month and a half since I had a new
Spyderco<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.819> have<00:03:07.600> had<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.049> native<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.680> had

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
Spyderco I have had the native I had

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100 
Spyderco I have had the native I had
original<00:03:09.790> native<00:03:10.090> when<00:03:10.360> they<00:03:10.450> first<00:03:10.720> came<00:03:10.930> out

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
original native when they first came out

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.009 
original native when they first came out
in<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.890> 440<00:03:12.670> seat<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.630> was<00:03:13.780> an<00:03:13.870> awesome

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
in the 440 seat and I was an awesome

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.050 
in the 440 seat and I was an awesome
knife<00:03:14.580> can't<00:03:15.580> beat<00:03:15.790> it

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
knife can't beat it

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.240 
knife can't beat it
I<00:03:16.090> love<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.480> upgrade<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:16.810> steel<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:18.130> is

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
I love the upgrade and steel this is

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.849 
I love the upgrade and steel this is
definitely<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.700> new<00:03:19.030> favorite<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.480> mine<00:03:19.859> see

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
definitely a new favorite of mine see

definitely a new favorite of mine see
here<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.160> have<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.459> lock<00:03:22.359> back<00:03:22.600> design<00:03:22.780> I

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
here you have the lock back design I

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.330 
here you have the lock back design I
forget<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.790> think<00:03:25.299> it's<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:26.100> well<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.130> don't

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
forget the I think it's a well I don't

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.440 
forget the I think it's a well I don't
want<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.549> I<00:03:27.579> don't<00:03:27.670> want<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.910> make<00:03:27.970> anything<00:03:28.269> up

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
want to I don't want to make anything up

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.410 
want to I don't want to make anything up
because<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.660> don't<00:03:28.720> remember<00:03:28.959> but<00:03:30.269> there's<00:03:31.269> an

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
and you use this kind of a little bit of

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.469 
and you use this kind of a little bit of
a<00:05:52.659> toil<00:05:52.930> here<00:05:53.169> cut<00:05:53.440> out<00:05:53.789> my<00:05:54.789> only<00:05:55.000> problem<00:05:55.180> is

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
a toil here cut out my only problem is

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.129 
a toil here cut out my only problem is
that<00:05:55.719> it's<00:05:56.500> not<00:05:56.740> really<00:05:57.300> circular<00:05:58.300> I<00:05:58.479> mean<00:05:59.050> the

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
that it's not really circular I mean the

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:00.629 
that it's not really circular I mean the
bottom<00:05:59.289> of<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.500> base<00:05:59.620> of<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.860> blade<00:05:59.949> is<00:06:00.580> a

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
bottom of the base of the blade is a

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.309 
bottom of the base of the blade is a
circular<00:06:01.180> pattern<00:06:01.389> but<00:06:01.659> then<00:06:01.779> here<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.139> comes

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
circular pattern but then here it comes

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.379 
circular pattern but then here it comes
straight<00:06:02.620> out<00:06:02.680> so<00:06:03.610> for<00:06:03.849> me<00:06:03.969> maybe<00:06:04.270> just

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
straight out so for me maybe just

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.180 
straight out so for me maybe just
because<00:06:04.719> I'm<00:06:04.870> you<00:06:05.289> know<00:06:05.379> a<00:06:05.409> bigger<00:06:05.620> guy<00:06:05.830> I<00:06:05.860> have
