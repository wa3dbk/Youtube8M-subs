00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.830 
I'm going to attach some grommets to it
so<00:00:33.000> first<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:34.320> take<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> modesty<00:00:36.180> panel<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840

so first you take the modesty panel and
you<00:00:37.530> put<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> underneath<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.059> corset<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
you put it underneath the corset and in

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.010 
you put it underneath the corset and in
the<00:00:41.100> exact<00:00:41.520> spot<00:00:41.760> where<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.559> want<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.920> sit

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
the exact spot where you want it to sit

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
the exact spot where you want it to sit
so<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.260> nice<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.469> adjusted<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.579> then

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so get it nice and adjusted here then

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.930 
so get it nice and adjusted here then
you<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> pick<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.770> set<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> laces<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
you have to pick out a set of laces that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.410 
you have to pick out a set of laces that
is<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.620> under<00:00:52.620> X<00:00:52.890> here<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.210> see

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
is an under X here so you can see

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900 
is an under X here so you can see
there's<00:00:54.629> an<00:00:54.809> X<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.670> it's<00:00:56.670> slightly

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
there's an X here it's slightly

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.639 
there's an X here it's slightly
complicated<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.469> are

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
complicated because they these are

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.369 
complicated because they these are
ribbons<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.370> harder<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.930> X<00:01:01.170> is

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
ribbons it's harder to see but this X is

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.329 
ribbons it's harder to see but this X is
coming<00:01:01.680> out<00:01:01.800> from<00:01:01.980> under<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> corset<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
coming out from under the corset so you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.789 
coming out from under the corset so you
want<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.150> X<00:01:06.479> that's<00:01:06.810> close<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.409> bottom<00:01:07.680> then

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
want a X that's close to the bottom then

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.289 
want a X that's close to the bottom then
we're<00:01:07.920> gonna<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.130> an<00:01:08.220> X<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.549> close<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> top

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
we're gonna do an X so close to the top

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.830 
we're gonna do an X so close to the top
so<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:12.630> gonna<00:01:12.720> make

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so all you to do is we're gonna make

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
so all you to do is we're gonna make
four<00:01:13.619> grommets<00:01:14.070> per<00:01:14.580> X<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> when<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.310> lace<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
four grommets per X so when you lace it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.719 
four grommets per X so when you lace it
up<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.240> X<00:01:18.570> part<00:01:18.900> will<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.320> under<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> modesty

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
up the X part will go under the modesty

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.090 
up the X part will go under the modesty
panel<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.820> make<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.090> mark

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
panel so you just make a little mark

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.749 
panel so you just make a little mark
move<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> X<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.890> I'm<00:01:28.890> using

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
move the X is out of the way I'm using

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
move the X is out of the way I'm using
pencil<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.990> shows<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.530> easily

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
pencil because it shows up really easily

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.120 
pencil because it shows up really easily
on<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.909> way<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> it'll<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:34.009> taking<00:01:35.009> off

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
on the way and it'll just be taking off

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.109 
on the way and it'll just be taking off
anyways<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.299> put<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> hole<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:38.119> I've

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
with each other so I'll have to think

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.760 
with each other so I'll have to think

she<00:02:41.140> put<00:02:42.140> her<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:44.620> thought<00:02:45.620> would<00:02:45.860> call<00:02:46.130> but<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
she put her I thought would call but it

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.979 
she put her I thought would call but it
this<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.060> thing<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.270> makes<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.750> holes

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
this is the thing that makes the holes

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.110 
this is the thing that makes the holes
where<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.470> would<00:02:48.709> normally<00:02:48.860> hammer<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.940> make

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
where I would normally hammer it to make

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.350 
where I would normally hammer it to make
the<00:02:50.300> holes<00:02:50.510> she<00:02:51.290> put<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.790> drill<00:02:53.330> press

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
the holes she put it in to a drill press

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.830 
the holes she put it in to a drill press
and<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.380> happen<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.799> have<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.070> drill<00:02:55.430> press<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.810> I

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
and I happen to have a drill press so I

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.520 
and I happen to have a drill press so I
put<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:59.450> just<00:02:59.870> turn<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.470> and

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
put it in and you just turn it on and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.300 
put it in and you just turn it on and
then<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.040> just<00:03:02.380> put<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:03.500> up<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.769> down<00:03:03.950> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
then you just put this up and down and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.979 
then you just put this up and down and
it<00:03:04.489> makes<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.820> little<00:03:04.940> hole<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.420> I'm<00:03:05.720> going<00:03:05.930> to

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
it makes a little hole so I'm going to

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.449 
it makes a little hole so I'm going to
do<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.290> really<00:03:06.500> quick<00:03:06.799> hopefully<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.310> not

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
do that really quick hopefully it's not

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:23.080 
do that really quick hopefully it's not
too<00:03:07.519> about

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.770 

so<00:03:24.440> as<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.370> see<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:27.750> made<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> little<00:03:28.650> hole

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
so as you can see it made a little hole

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.870 
so as you can see it made a little hole
perfect<00:03:30.780> little<00:03:30.930> hole<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.980> much<00:03:32.280> easier

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
perfect little hole have so much easier

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.720 
perfect little hole have so much easier
than<00:03:33.360> doing<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.960> hole<00:03:34.260> hammer<00:03:34.620> thing<00:03:35.040> I'm

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
than doing the hole hammer thing I'm

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.010 
than doing the hole hammer thing I'm
going<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.000> do<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.240> for<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> rest<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
going to do that for the rest of the

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.130 
going to do that for the rest of the
holes<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.740> marked<00:03:37.980> here<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:39.810> you're

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140
