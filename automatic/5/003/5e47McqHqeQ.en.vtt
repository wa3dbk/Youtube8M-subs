00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.839 
out even though this is for an iphone 5
this<00:00:25.150> is<00:00:25.329> one<00:00:25.570> of<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:25.869> older<00:00:26.439> model<00:00:26.919> cases<00:00:27.490> and

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
this is one of the older model cases and

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.359 
this is one of the older model cases and
that<00:00:28.720> may<00:00:28.869> be<00:00:28.899> why<00:00:29.230> was<00:00:29.439> a<00:00:29.470> little<00:00:29.770> bit<00:00:29.919> cheaper

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
this and bling it out I think everything

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.810

is<00:00:40.719> going<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:40.899> be<00:00:40.960> gold<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:41.829> that's<00:00:42.579> why<00:00:42.760> this

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
is going to be gold so that's why this

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.759 
is going to be gold so that's why this
is<00:00:43.149> like<00:00:43.390> going<00:00:43.719> to<00:00:43.809> be<00:00:43.960> all<00:00:44.200> gold<00:00:44.559> everything

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769

is like going to be all gold everything
so<00:00:45.730> all<00:00:45.910> I've<00:00:46.149> done<00:00:46.359> to<00:00:46.629> prep<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.109> is<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.410> wipe

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
so all I've done to prep it is to wipe

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.860 
so all I've done to prep it is to wipe
it<00:00:47.739> down<00:00:47.859> with<00:00:47.920> alcohol<00:00:48.550> also<00:00:49.420> in<00:00:49.510> these<00:00:49.600> cases

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870
