this plastic cap on it and it kind of is
I<00:04:01.690> would<00:04:02.080> suggest<00:04:02.350> in<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.739> beginning<00:04:02.890> you

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
I would suggest in the beginning you

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.430 
I would suggest in the beginning you
know<00:04:03.520> just<00:04:03.790> taking<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.209> cap<00:04:04.420> off<00:04:04.660> but<00:04:04.989> hang<00:04:05.290> on

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
know just taking the cap off but hang on

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.790 
know just taking the cap off but hang on
to<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.830> because<00:04:06.250> when<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:06.910> get<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.390> bottom

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
to it because when you get to the bottom

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.350 
to it because when you get to the bottom
being<00:04:08.800> able<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.070> put<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.430> cap<00:04:09.610> back<00:04:09.640> on<00:04:09.880> and

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
being able to put the cap back on and

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.540 
being able to put the cap back on and
then<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.780> can<00:04:10.959> rest<00:04:11.200> this<00:04:11.470> in<00:04:11.739> your<00:04:11.860> shower<00:04:12.100> so

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
then you can rest this in your shower so

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.430 
then you can rest this in your shower so
that<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:13.150> can<00:04:13.360> get<00:04:13.450> all<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.600> product<00:04:14.050> out<00:04:14.200> it

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
that you can get all the product out it

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.349 
that you can get all the product out it
kind<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.680> makes<00:04:14.830> sense<00:04:15.070> for<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.670> reason<00:04:15.880> but

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
kind of makes sense for that reason but

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.760 
kind of makes sense for that reason but
other<00:04:16.660> than<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.200> don't<00:04:17.380> really<00:04:17.500> need

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
other than that you don't really need

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.949 
other than that you don't really need
this<00:04:17.919> on<00:04:18.270> you<00:04:19.270> know<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.390> guess<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:19.750> could<00:04:19.930> be

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
this on you know I guess it could be

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.680 
this on you know I guess it could be
handy<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.549> if<00:04:21.549> you're<00:04:21.729> traveling<00:04:22.240> with<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.510> so

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
handy to if you're traveling with it so

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.900 
handy to if you're traveling with it so
nothing<00:04:23.020> can<00:04:23.050> leak<00:04:23.410> out<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.430> don't<00:04:24.820> know

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
nothing can leak out but I don't know

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.340 
nothing can leak out but I don't know
who<00:04:25.090> would<00:04:25.240> travel<00:04:25.450> with<00:04:25.660> such<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.900> lure

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
who would travel with such a lure

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.310 
who would travel with such a lure
to<00:04:27.070> date<00:04:27.280> her<00:04:27.400> anyway<00:04:27.480> what<00:04:28.480> I<00:04:28.510> actually<00:04:28.900> did<00:04:29.290> I

kind<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.770> decanted<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.610> into<00:04:30.970> like<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.150> small

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
kind of decanted this into like a small

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.860 
kind of decanted this into like a small
squeeze<00:04:32.800> tube<00:04:33.100> that's<00:04:33.310> in<00:04:33.520> my<00:04:33.670> shower<00:04:33.880> just

I<00:04:38.290> just<00:04:38.530> kind<00:04:38.710> of<00:04:38.740> wanted<00:04:38.920> to<00:04:39.010> pare<00:04:39.250> down<00:04:39.280> and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
I just kind of wanted to pare down and

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.360 
I just kind of wanted to pare down and
not<00:04:40.600> have<00:04:40.840> such<00:04:41.260> a<00:04:41.290> bulky<00:04:41.710> container<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:42.340> I

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
not have such a bulky container so I

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.880 
not have such a bulky container so I
squeezed<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:43.000> into<00:04:43.390> a<00:04:43.420> smaller<00:04:44.050> container<00:04:44.320> and

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
squeezed it into a smaller container and

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.380 
squeezed it into a smaller container and
then<00:04:45.010> I've<00:04:45.310> just<00:04:45.340> been<00:04:45.580> storing<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.090> upside

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
then I've just been storing it upside

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.230 
then I've just been storing it upside
down<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.570> refilling<00:04:47.230> it<00:04:47.350> as<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.620> needed<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.240> um

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
down and refilling it as I needed to um

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.420 
down and refilling it as I needed to um
so<00:04:49.570> that's<00:04:49.810> as<00:04:50.260> far<00:04:50.440> as<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.710> packaging<00:04:51.250> goes
