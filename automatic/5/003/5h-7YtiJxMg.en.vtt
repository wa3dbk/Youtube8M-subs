00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.120
 after the return to the big screen 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.560
 of the ninja turtles it would be natural for 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.620
 we saw games of this franchise 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.240
 Inspired by the movie 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.759
 unfortunately we only had one in 3ds 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.410
 very improvised apparently the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.359
 developers did not have much faith to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.930
 the movie or were waiting to see if 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.519
 it was successful fortunately it was and already 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.560
 we have a sequel at the door in a couple 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.510
 of years for which it is very likely that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 by then we have a list of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.529
 new games when it arrives but 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.260
 meanwhile so is this like this 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.960
 you with good games of the turtles 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 these are the five best games of 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.390
 the ninja turtles on platforms 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.390
 Nintendo 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.790
 number 5 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.040
 a time when it seemed that the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.260
 ninja turtles had lost their 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.750
 charm the original television series 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.450
 it was over and there were no more movies 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.430
 pronounce yourself in the near future without 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.050
 But turtles never left 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.790
 youth culture and an animated series 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.980
 that although it was not great as the 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.290
 original was not bad and brought us this 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.300
 game of the clean world which counted 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.370
 with exclusive animated shorts for the 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.020
 game had charts of types of 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.180
 henning to assimilate the graphs of the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.130
 caricature and many signs of 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.130
 onomatopoeia every time I performed 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.900
 some blow or some action game this 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.060
 besides being a very alive game in voices 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.710
 and allow you to play the adventure with another 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.750
 player this made it a game 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.750
 simple and linear but fun 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.960
 number 4 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.730
 just like mario kart has inspired many 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.460
 other caricature racing games 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.740
 with local items and careers 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.840
 Reuters is not left behind after 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.580
 so successful was it natural that they copied the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.460
 formula and there was a game in particular 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.920
 that he did it very well and it turns out that he's from 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.100
 the average tattoo we are talking about 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.960
 tmt smash of the week the game is 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.460
 basically the same thing that is more roberts 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.320
 fight up to four players 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.240
 simultaneous with the use of items and the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.140
 basically button configuration 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.090
 in environments 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.100
 in fact the game is so similar that it does not 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.830
 they care to use in the name the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.300
 Same term is more but of course 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.220
 of the obvious difference that the cast 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.350
 of fighters and scenarios instead of 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.300
 be of the world and nintendo were of the world 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.100
 of the 3-d cartoons that the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.800
 ninja turtles there were also some 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.900
 minor but significant changes a 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.150
 additional button for intimate combos 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.310
 more complex didactic sequences in 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.750
 grab them and win the combat by emptying 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.520
 the energy of the enemy instead of 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.500
 taking it off the stage everything has been a 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.600
 very different game and an excellent game 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.890
 pity that it feels a bit old-fashioned 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.959
 because it is based on a 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.220
 caricature that is no longer valid and that 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.180
 lives in the shadow of a game that 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.180
 number 4 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.430
 number 3 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.769
 there was a time where games of 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.530
 Machines were more important than 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.000
 that are now besides snk there was another 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.680
 excellent company in making games 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.540
 arcade and we refer clearly to konami 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.489
 they were responsible for making 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.620
 the first good games based on 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.840
 the ninja turtles the first arcades 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.640
 what they did was so good that I begged 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.299
 a console version and that's how 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.739
 the jewel of tnt 2 arrived for nintendo a 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.840
 Although the game had 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.090
 more modest graphics to its counterpart 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.430
 in arcade and that could not be played with more 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.680
 two players were able to capture 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.209
 the essence of the game and convert it not 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.340
 only in the best games of the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.700
 turtles but in one of the best 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.909
 games of you because in your moment number 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.909
 3 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.110
 number 2 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.159
 a time where if I wanted to play a game 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.430
 of fights the title par excellence by 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.109
 all was super street fighter 2 was made 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.299
 so famous that it unleashed a wave of 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.010
 similar games wanting to eat a 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.590
 slice of the profit pie that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.560
 I was having field one that did it 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.980
 very well it was precisely tmt tournament 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.629
 fighters for nintendo and super nintendo 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.579
 this game was not only fun and very 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.040
 competitive had excellent 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.930
 graphics speed options powers 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.519
 specials a story mode and a 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.680
 playability that could even be 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.230
 enjoy more than the aforementioned 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.480
 street fighter 12 was available in 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.709
 the same dates and obviously the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.780
 super nintendo version of the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.519
 fight turtles was better however 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.320
 the version of nes had characters 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.229
 best known of the caricature as a 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.759
 alive and rocky and casey jones in addition to 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.380
 that if you did not have super nintendo it was 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.780
 maybe the best support game for 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.060
 nintendo since there was no competition 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.060
 in that console number 2 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.380
 number 1 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.389
 if you are a follower of the ninja turtles and 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.389
 of your games you probably already have 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.979
 guessed the number 1 on this list if 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.389
 there was a great game that exceeded the game 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.099
 original of the arcadias made by 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.889
 konami was nothing less than his own 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.009
 sequel made by the same company the 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.319
 which had its adaptation to super nintendo 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.419
 pm network consulting time for your 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.669
 translation turtles in time was the 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.139
 cusp of franchise games and 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.240
 unlike its predecessor 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.650
 nintendo that was also adapted from the 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.380
 arcadias but with obvious limitations 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.110
 with the power of the console this was not 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.759
 the case for terminal t4 where the super 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.590
 Nintendo was also seen as the 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.080
 original and even with better effects 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.550
 one obvious obvious disadvantage I had was 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.560
 can not play more than two people 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.139
 and even though he had a 3d remake 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.669
 for xbox 360 unfortunately they had 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.590
 legal problems and they had to 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.240
 remove from the market but this was not a 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.979
 so lamentable loss because no 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.529
 exceeds its original version of super 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.359
 nintendo number one 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.189
