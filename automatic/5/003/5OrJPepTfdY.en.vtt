last<00:00:00.989> time<00:00:01.230> on<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.650> bill

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.790 

there<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.500> go<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.949> got<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.130> good<00:00:20.369> fit<00:00:21.619> looks<00:00:22.619> like

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
there we go we got a good fit looks like

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.290 
there we go we got a good fit looks like
when<00:00:22.950> welded<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.640> then<00:00:23.730> we've<00:00:23.880> got<00:00:24.090> right

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
when welded in and then we've got right

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.089 
when welded in and then we've got right
up<00:00:24.450> in<00:00:24.599> here<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.259> got<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> put<00:00:25.650> another<00:00:25.740> piece

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
up in here we got to put another piece

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.740 
up in here we got to put another piece
in<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.520> we'll<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.759> that<00:00:26.789> after<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.419> weld<00:00:27.599> this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
in but we'll do that after we weld this

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:37.530 
in but we'll do that after we weld this
one<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.460> but<00:00:29.460> looking<00:00:29.730> good

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.720 

absolutely<00:00:38.540> perfect<00:00:38.990> so<00:00:39.710> what<00:00:40.370> I'm<00:00:40.460> doing<00:00:40.640> is

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
absolutely perfect so what I'm doing is

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.100 
absolutely perfect so what I'm doing is
I'm<00:00:40.820> taking<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.150> piece<00:00:41.300> of<00:00:41.450> cardboard<00:00:41.750> just

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
I'm taking a piece of cardboard just

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.860 
I'm taking a piece of cardboard just
trace<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.530> out<00:00:42.590> exactly<00:00:43.240> rough<00:00:44.240> measurements

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
trace it out exactly rough measurements

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.260 
trace it out exactly rough measurements
of<00:00:44.990> what<00:00:45.200> we<00:00:45.350> need<00:00:45.560> for<00:00:45.830> the<00:00:45.950> for<00:00:46.310> the<00:00:46.460> for<00:00:47.150> the

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
of what we need for the for the for the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.540 
of what we need for the for the for the
for<00:00:47.450> panel<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:48.380> replace<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.920> missing<00:00:49.070> the

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
for panel to replace the missing the

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.270 
for panel to replace the missing the
metal<00:00:49.940> there<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:50.600> I'll<00:00:50.780> cut<00:00:50.990> it<00:00:51.080> out<00:00:51.280> transfer

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
metal there so I'll cut it out transfer

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.240 
metal there so I'll cut it out transfer
it<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.400> this<00:00:52.610> metal<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:53.180> use<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.250> shears

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
it to this metal and then use the shears

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.820 
it to this metal and then use the shears
here<00:00:55.580> and<00:00:55.730> make<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.750> fit<00:00:56.990> level<00:00:57.290> it'll<00:00:57.410> overlap

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
here and make it fit level it'll overlap

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.400 
here and make it fit level it'll overlap
so<00:00:58.100> we<00:00:58.190> can<00:00:58.340> weld<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:58.640> in<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.260> make<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:00.290> look

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
so we can weld it in and make it look

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.530 
so we can weld it in and make it look
perfect<00:01:00.950> so<00:01:01.190> now<00:01:01.580> we've<00:01:01.880> created<00:01:02.060> a<00:01:02.300> patch

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
perfect so now we've created a patch

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.360 
perfect so now we've created a patch
panel<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.110> our<00:01:03.560> next<00:01:03.830> step<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.190> actually

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
panel and our next step is actually

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.390 
panel and our next step is actually
place<00:01:04.970> to<00:01:05.720> do<00:01:05.840> a<00:01:05.870> little<00:01:06.020> tack<00:01:06.230> welding<00:01:06.620> so<00:01:07.310> you

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
place to do a little tack welding so you

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.580 
place to do a little tack welding so you
get<00:01:07.940> it<00:01:08.030> held<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.270> place<00:01:08.480> and<00:01:08.810> then<00:01:09.320> we'll<00:01:09.440> come

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
get it held in place and then we'll come

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.850 
get it held in place and then we'll come
in<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:09.860> smooth<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:10.250> all<00:01:10.340> out<00:01:10.369> when<00:01:10.640> we're<00:01:10.760> done

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.530 

and<00:01:18.400> right<00:01:18.580> now<00:01:18.700> we're<00:01:18.820> trying<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.150> Jack<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
and right now we're trying to Jack the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.590 
and right now we're trying to Jack the
floor<00:01:19.780> up<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.050> meet<00:01:20.230> the<00:01:20.500> shifter<00:01:21.600> shifter

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
floor up to meet the shifter shifter

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.810 
floor up to meet the shifter shifter
plate<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.230> that<00:01:23.260> way<00:01:23.620> we<00:01:24.370> can<00:01:24.490> get<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.610> good

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
plate so that way we can get a good

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.720 
plate so that way we can get a good
solid<00:01:25.060> well<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:26.680> on<00:01:26.980> it<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.280> tack<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.610> in

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
solid well going on it and tack it in

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.790 
solid well going on it and tack it in
place<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.990> now<00:01:29.110> there's<00:01:29.290> too<00:01:29.410> much<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.590> a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
place right now there's too much of a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.180 
place right now there's too much of a
gap<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.970> do<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.300> so<00:01:31.570> just<00:01:31.840> with<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.740> floor<00:01:32.950> jack

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
gap to do that so just with a floor jack

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.070 
gap to do that so just with a floor jack
and<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.400> couple<00:01:33.640> three<00:01:33.790> by<00:01:33.940> fours<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.510> should<00:01:34.960> get

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
and a couple three by fours I should get

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:47.040 
and a couple three by fours I should get
us<00:01:35.200> ready<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.710> go<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.970> looks<00:01:46.180> good<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:46.480> all<00:01:46.780> we

okay we have our patch panel in and we
have<00:02:58.160> our<00:02:58.250> shifter<00:02:58.580> hump<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:58.940> we<00:02:59.270> did<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
have our shifter hump in we did the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.050 
have our shifter hump in we did the
bodywork<00:02:59.930> all<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.290> way<00:03:00.380> around<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:01.070> now<00:03:01.820> it's
