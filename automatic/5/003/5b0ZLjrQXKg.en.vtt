00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
to answer a partially answer a question

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.810 
to answer a partially answer a question
that<00:00:22.990> I've<00:00:23.320> been<00:00:23.560> asked<00:00:24.070> in<00:00:24.160> a<00:00:24.250> question<00:00:24.610> that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
that I've been asked in a question that

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.810 
that I've been asked in a question that
I<00:00:24.849> had<00:00:25.500> when<00:00:26.500> I<00:00:26.529> made<00:00:26.860> these<00:00:27.009> garden<00:00:27.400> beds<00:00:27.610> and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
I had when I made these garden beds and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.600 
I had when I made these garden beds and
the<00:00:27.880> question<00:00:28.329> is<00:00:28.540> how<00:00:29.230> long<00:00:29.470> does<00:00:29.770> non<00:00:30.130> treat

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
the question is how long does non treat

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.360 
the question is how long does non treat
an<00:00:30.790> untreated<00:00:31.689> lumber<00:00:31.840> lasts<00:00:32.380> at<00:00:32.829> a<00:00:32.980> garden

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
an untreated lumber lasts at a garden

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.770 
an untreated lumber lasts at a garden
bed<00:00:33.640> and<00:00:34.570> I<00:00:35.700> don't<00:00:36.700> really<00:00:37.030> know<00:00:37.210> but<00:00:37.450> I<00:00:37.510> have

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
bed and I don't really know but I have

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.369 
bed and I don't really know but I have
some<00:00:38.110> clues<00:00:38.590> now<00:00:38.980> after<00:00:39.520> two<00:00:39.700> years<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:41.200> the

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
some clues now after two years what the

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.270 
some clues now after two years what the
answer<00:00:41.710> might<00:00:41.950> be<00:00:41.980> so<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:42.969> wanted<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.450> show<00:00:44.280> this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
answer might be so I wanted to show this

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.470 
answer might be so I wanted to show this
bed<00:00:45.550> is<00:00:45.699> a<00:00:45.730> really<00:00:45.999> good<00:00:46.179> demonstration

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
bed is a really good demonstration

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.520 
bed is a really good demonstration
because<00:00:47.050> I<00:00:47.530> took<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.190> lot<00:00:48.339> of<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> soil<00:00:48.789> out<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
because I took a lot of the soil out the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.189 
because I took a lot of the soil out the
reason<00:00:50.829> I<00:00:50.890> took<00:00:50.949> it<00:00:51.190> out<00:00:51.309> was<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.449> was<00:00:52.780> growing

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
reason I took it out was I was growing

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.619 
reason I took it out was I was growing
sweet<00:00:53.320> potatoes<00:00:53.859> in<00:00:54.070> here<00:00:54.280> one<00:00:54.699> year<00:00:54.969> and<00:00:55.149> then

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
sweet potatoes in here one year and then

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.959 
sweet potatoes in here one year and then
the<00:00:55.780> next<00:00:55.809> year<00:00:56.230> they<00:00:56.409> they<00:00:57.159> came<00:00:57.399> back<00:00:57.609> which

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
the next year they they came back which

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.729 
the next year they they came back which
is<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.149> good<00:00:58.420> thing<00:00:58.449> in<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.870> lot<00:00:59.019> of<00:00:59.050> cases<00:00:59.350> but<00:00:59.679> I

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
is a good thing in a lot of cases but I

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.860 
is a good thing in a lot of cases but I
don't<00:01:00.280> want<00:01:00.489> sweet<00:01:00.730> potatoes<00:01:01.149> in<00:01:01.300> this<00:01:01.420> bed<00:01:01.659> so

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
don't want sweet potatoes in this bed so

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.760 
don't want sweet potatoes in this bed so
I<00:01:01.899> dug<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:02.319> all<00:01:02.469> out<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.600> piled<00:01:04.900> I<00:01:05.290> took<00:01:05.710> a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
I dug it all out and I piled I took a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.200 
I dug it all out and I piled I took a
lot<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.100> soil<00:01:06.250> out<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.700> used<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:07.030> in<00:01:07.120> other

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
lot of the soil out and used it in other

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.120 
lot of the soil out and used it in other
places<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:07.900> I<00:01:07.990> piled<00:01:08.229> some<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:08.680> soil<00:01:08.890> up

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
places and I piled some of the soil up

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.030 
places and I piled some of the soil up
in<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.310> middle<00:01:09.580> but<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.420> also<00:01:10.840> wanted<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.830> leave

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
in the middle but I also wanted to leave

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.610 
in the middle but I also wanted to leave
the<00:01:12.280> outsides<00:01:13.060> exposed<00:01:13.659> so<00:01:14.260> I<00:01:14.290> could

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
the outsides exposed so I could

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.980 
the outsides exposed so I could
demonstrate<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:16.000> damage<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:16.630> has<00:01:16.750> already

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
demonstrate the damage that has already

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.340 
demonstrate the damage that has already
been<00:01:17.409> done<00:01:17.649> now<00:01:17.979> after<00:01:18.399> two<00:01:18.610> years<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:19.990> beds

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
been done now after two years these beds

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.130 
been done now after two years these beds
were<00:01:21.189> put<00:01:21.549> in<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.060> can<00:01:22.600> go<00:01:22.689> back<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.049> look

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
were put in and you can go back and look

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.639 
were put in and you can go back and look
at<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.380> video<00:01:23.619> in<00:01:24.509> February<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.659> 2013<00:01:26.020> I

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
at the video in February of 2013 I

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.590 
at the video in February of 2013 I
believe<00:01:27.009> that's<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.310> correct<00:01:27.549> date<00:01:28.210> time

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
believe that's the correct date time

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.740 
believe that's the correct date time
frame<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.700> can<00:01:30.729> see<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.360> damage

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
frame and you can see that the damage

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
frame and you can see that the damage
that<00:01:31.960> has<00:01:32.079> been<00:01:32.110> done<00:01:32.320> over<00:01:32.500> two<00:01:32.920> years<00:01:34.229> is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that has been done over two years is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.730 
that has been done over two years is
it's<00:01:36.610> significant<00:01:37.329> but<00:01:37.509> it's<00:01:37.659> not<00:01:37.869> it's<00:01:38.590> not

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
it's significant but it's not it's not

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.929 
it's significant but it's not it's not
as<00:01:38.890> much<00:01:39.039> as<00:01:39.189> I<00:01:39.280> thought<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.640> would<00:01:39.759> be

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
as much as I thought it would be

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.109 
as much as I thought it would be
actually<00:01:40.560> these<00:01:41.560> are<00:01:41.829> on<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.609> lower<00:01:42.850> half<00:01:43.090> of

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
actually these are on the lower half of

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.480 
actually these are on the lower half of
everything<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.659> was<00:01:43.840> under<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.859> soil<00:01:45.130> line

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
everything that was under the soil line

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.770 
everything that was under the soil line
has<00:01:46.479> probably<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.770> quarter<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.939> one<00:01:49.210> half<00:01:49.240> of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
has probably a quarter to one half of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.090 
has probably a quarter to one half of
the<00:01:49.899> wood<00:01:50.170> material<00:01:52.560> degraded<00:01:53.560> where<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:53.979> has

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
the wood material degraded where it has

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.850 
the wood material degraded where it has
been<00:01:54.250> eaten

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
been eaten

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520 
been eaten
you<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.550> maybe<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:56.940> was<00:01:57.090> decomposed<00:01:57.960> or

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you know maybe it was decomposed or

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.230 
you know maybe it was decomposed or
maybe<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.890> eaten<00:01:59.190> by<00:01:59.220> termites<00:01:59.460> or<00:01:59.940> whatever

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
maybe was eaten by termites or whatever

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.520 
maybe was eaten by termites or whatever
the<00:02:00.780> damage<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.290> from<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.480> would<00:02:03.480> imagine<00:02:03.750> that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the damage is from I would imagine that

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190 
the damage is from I would imagine that
these<00:02:04.820> garden<00:02:05.820> beds<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> untreated<00:02:07.020> two

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
these garden beds with the untreated two

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.310 
these garden beds with the untreated two
by<00:02:07.350> tens<00:02:08.060> would<00:02:09.060> last<00:02:09.270> about<00:02:09.539> four<00:02:09.810> years<00:02:10.050> just

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
by tens would last about four years just

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.010 
by tens would last about four years just
judging<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.360> condition<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.870> these

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
judging on the the condition of these

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.320 
judging on the the condition of these
boards<00:02:13.350> now<00:02:13.500> after<00:02:13.920> two<00:02:14.100> years<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.240> that's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
boards now after two years and that's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.990 
boards now after two years and that's
not<00:02:15.570> bad<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.050> years<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.710> untreated<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.490> would

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
not bad for years for untreated I would

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.130 
not bad for years for untreated I would
hope<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.180> get<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.480> longer<00:02:18.780> time<00:02:19.110> frame

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
hope to get a longer time frame

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.050 
hope to get a longer time frame
certainly<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.160> would<00:02:20.340> get<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.520> longer<00:02:20.850> time

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
certainly you would get a longer time

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.210 
certainly you would get a longer time
frame<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.570> treated<00:02:21.930> boards<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.980> when<00:02:23.190> I

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
frame with treated boards but when I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.340 
frame with treated boards but when I
made<00:02:23.490> these<00:02:23.640> beds<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.300> wasn't<00:02:24.900> sure<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.200> I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
made these beds I wasn't sure if I

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.890 
made these beds I wasn't sure if I
should<00:02:25.380> use<00:02:25.770> treated<00:02:26.400> boards<00:02:26.730> or<00:02:26.910> not<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
should use treated boards or not and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.960 
should use treated boards or not and
that's<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.200> separate<00:02:28.590> debate<00:02:28.800> I'm<00:02:29.490> kind<00:02:29.850> of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
that's a separate debate I'm kind of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.760 
that's a separate debate I'm kind of
leaning<00:02:30.120> toward<00:02:30.630> treated<00:02:31.170> boards<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.620> not

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
leaning toward treated boards are not

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.770 
leaning toward treated boards are not
that<00:02:32.010> bad<00:02:32.250> especially<00:02:32.580> now<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.240> treating

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
that bad especially now the treating

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.410 
that bad especially now the treating
process<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.770> they<00:02:34.950> use<00:02:35.160> now<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:36.150> I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
process that that they use now but I

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.750 
process that that they use now but I
chose<00:02:36.989> I'm<00:02:37.290> treated<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.830> these<00:02:38.040> two<00:02:38.520> years

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
chose I'm treated for these two years

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.870 
chose I'm treated for these two years
ago<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.360> I'm<00:02:40.110> not<00:02:40.709> upset<00:02:40.890> by<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.250> decision

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
ago and I'm not upset by that decision

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.699 
ago and I'm not upset by that decision
and<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:42.660> kind<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.959> on<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.530> do

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
and I it's kind of on you to do

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.410 
and I it's kind of on you to do
something<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.640> where<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.030> answer<00:02:45.270> a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
something to where you can answer a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.300 
something to where you can answer a
common<00:02:45.660> question<00:02:45.870> how<00:02:46.590> long<00:02:46.650> does<00:02:46.920> something

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
common question how long does something

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.060 
common question how long does something
last<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.360> only<00:02:48.390> way<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.020> know<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
last the only way to really know is to

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.070 
last the only way to really know is to
put<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.820> try<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.750> that's<00:02:51.870> what
