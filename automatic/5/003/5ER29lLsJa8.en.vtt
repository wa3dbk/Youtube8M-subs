00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.859
 one of the most unpleasant surprises 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.990
 of the last days around way you 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.290
 has been without doubt the absence of 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.660
 battlefield 4 paraguay and is that you give no 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.090
 have any kind of intention to bring 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.130
 this quarter of battlefield to the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.380
 wii and this time they have appeared 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.230
 new data that clarifies all this 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.349
 because in battlefield 4 it would not take 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.630
 wii and you give the study that this has created 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.390
 title explains that they have not even 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.000
 tested its frostbite 3 engine in wii 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.910
 because they have not made it very simple 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.330
 according to them when they tested the frostbite 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.850
 2 The results were not for nothing 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.980
 their liking were catastrophic but 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.170
 attention because it is even a topic 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.570
 serious of what it seems since the engine 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.980
 of the study is expected to be the basis of 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.860
 most of the futures 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.080
 developments of electronic arts something that 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.480
 the study itself has confirmed through 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.000
 his account of 'twitter' and includes 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.880
 also future developments based 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.550
 in star wars jon anderson director 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.000
 Taiz technician has said that the tests 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.580
 byte 2 in wii gave no results 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.950
 too promising so they have not 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.890
 worked more on the console and it has not 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.500
 approved that new frostbite 3 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.280
 on the battlefield is held 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.250
 4 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.680
 jon anderson says that frostbite 3 ni 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.750
 has even been executed in a wii 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.330
 that this graphic engine has not adapted 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.940
 to wii and I could seriously put in 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.490
 danger the appearance of these titles in 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.070
 the nintendo console although electronic 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.710
 Arts eye could commission developments 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.380
 specific to the console they use 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.020
 another type of engine again opens the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.420
 always debate is really cool and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.180
 a console that is at the height of the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.360
 circumstances of the next generation 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.640
 technically you will be able to live from the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.190
 own titles of nintendo during 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.990
 long what is clear is that the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.990
 time will speak for itself
