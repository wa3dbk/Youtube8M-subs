00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
on elance which is weird because

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.310 
on elance which is weird because
apparently<00:00:44.300> odesk<00:00:45.300> has<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> talent<00:00:45.660> pool<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.230> a

apparently odesk has a talent pool of a
million<00:00:46.820> more<00:00:47.820> workers<00:00:48.510> than<00:00:48.539> elance<00:00:49.020> it's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
million more workers than elance it's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
million more workers than elance it's
really<00:00:49.469> weird<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:50.489> understand<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
really weird I don't understand it and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.139 
really weird I don't understand it and
maybe<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.879> profile<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.090> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
maybe it's because my profile like I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
maybe it's because my profile like I
don't<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.690> extensive<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> hiring<00:00:55.649> history

don't have as extensive a hiring history

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.119 
don't have as extensive a hiring history
maybe<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.449> attractive<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.289> do

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
maybe it's just not as attractive to do
