little<00:00:04.110> c-max<00:00:04.680> comes<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.279> two<00:00:05.490> versions<00:00:05.730> that

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
little c-max comes in two versions that

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.179 
little c-max comes in two versions that
not<00:00:06.270> everybody<00:00:06.660> understands<00:00:07.529> there's<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
not everybody understands there's the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.100 
not everybody understands there's the
hybrid<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.820> then<00:00:09.240> there's<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.660> one<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
hybrid and then there's this one the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.470 
hybrid and then there's this one the
energy<00:00:10.530> which<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> plug-in<00:00:11.280> hybrid<00:00:11.490> which

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
energy which is a plug-in hybrid which

one makes sense for you and what's the
big<00:00:14.400> difference<00:00:14.610> we'll<00:00:15.540> check<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.809> out<00:00:15.990> now

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
big difference we'll check that out now

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.010 
big difference we'll check that out now
as<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.650> drive<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> 2013<00:00:17.699> C<00:00:18.000> Max<00:00:18.270> Energy<00:00:18.539> and

as we drive the 2013 C Max Energy and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:31.880 
as we drive the 2013 C Max Energy and
check<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.500> tech<00:00:30.410> let's<00:00:31.410> begin<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
check the tech let's begin with a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
check the tech let's begin with a
refresher<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> c-max<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
refresher on what a c-max is in the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.360 
refresher on what a c-max is in the
first<00:00:34.020> place<00:00:34.290> before<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.680> even<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.160> its

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
first place before we even get to its

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.670 
first place before we even get to its
variants<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.420> bigger<00:00:36.750> than<00:00:37.020> most<00:00:37.200> compact

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680

think<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> head-on<00:00:41.640> competitor<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
think of it as a head-on competitor the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900 
think of it as a head-on competitor the
Toyota<00:00:42.960> Prius<00:00:43.320> V<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.010> kind<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.700> odd

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

Toyota Prius V which is kind of an odd
little<00:00:45.120> category<00:00:45.719> into<00:00:45.989> itself<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
little category into itself it's a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.150 
little category into itself it's a
compact<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> skosh<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.079> room<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:50.010> they

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
compact with a skosh more room as they

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.939 
compact with a skosh more room as they
used<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> say<00:00:50.760> about<00:00:50.809> sansabelt<00:00:51.809> trousers<00:00:52.410> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
used to say about sansabelt trousers so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.319 
used to say about sansabelt trousers so
it's<00:00:53.129> ideal<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.520> Americans
