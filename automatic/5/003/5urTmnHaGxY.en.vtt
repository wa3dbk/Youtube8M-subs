be<00:00:37.640> most<00:00:37.970> fair<00:00:38.120> there<00:00:38.540> are<00:00:38.690> they<00:00:38.780> part<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.140> our

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
be most fair there are they part of our

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.400 
be most fair there are they part of our
team<00:00:39.380> FPS<00:00:39.800> players<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:44.540> what<00:00:45.050> do<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:45.200> know

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
team FPS players and what do we know

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.310 
team FPS players and what do we know
about<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.890> team<00:00:46.630> honestly<00:00:47.630> I<00:00:47.690> don't<00:00:47.900> really

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
about the team honestly I don't really

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.050 
about the team honestly I don't really
know<00:00:48.560> much<00:00:48.860> about<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.250> same<00:00:49.430> tomorrow<00:00:49.670> the

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
know much about the same tomorrow the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.580 
know much about the same tomorrow the
only<00:00:50.270> clear<00:00:50.540> enough<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:51.050> goalkeeper<00:00:51.560> and

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
only clear enough a goalkeeper and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.440 
only clear enough a goalkeeper and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.600 
I think it actually the season and the
games<00:02:31.440> we<00:02:31.620> played<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> road<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.310> actually

else<00:03:00.700> just<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.720> play<00:03:01.900> off<00:03:01.930> full<00:03:02.230> 90<00:03:02.530> minutes
