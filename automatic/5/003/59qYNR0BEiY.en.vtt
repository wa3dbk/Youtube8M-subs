00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.359 

okay<00:01:29.110> let's<00:01:29.680> pattern<00:01:30.159> on<00:01:30.430> this<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:32.100> series<00:01:33.100> to

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
okay let's pattern on this the series to

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.560 
okay let's pattern on this the series to
SS<00:01:33.909> this<00:01:34.659> is<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.900> five<00:01:35.830> car<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:37.119> we've<00:01:37.240> seen<00:01:37.450> it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
SS this is a five car and we've seen it

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.230 
SS this is a five car and we've seen it
in<00:01:37.659> various<00:01:37.930> stages<00:01:38.500> bits<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.280> pieces<00:01:39.460> but

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
in various stages bits and pieces but

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.929 
in various stages bits and pieces but
what<00:01:40.390> we've<00:01:40.479> just<00:01:40.509> done<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.049> full<00:01:41.200> game<00:01:41.380> show

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
what we've just done is a full game show

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.480 
what we've just done is a full game show
for<00:01:42.939> camshaft<00:01:43.390> package<00:01:43.690> now<00:01:43.899> this<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:45.460> I

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
for camshaft package now this is like I

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.990 
for camshaft package now this is like I
said<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.729> e85<00:01:46.330> or<00:01:46.950> l77<00:01:47.950> engine<00:01:48.460> which<00:01:48.729> means

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
said the e85 or l77 engine which means

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.539 
said the e85 or l77 engine which means
it<00:01:49.210> has<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.479> dod<00:01:49.930> system<00:01:50.350> inside<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:50.799> so<00:01:51.490> I'm

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
it has the dod system inside it so I'm

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.130 
it has the dod system inside it so I'm
doing<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> camshaft<00:01:52.270> properly<00:01:52.659> we've<00:01:52.930> been

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
doing the camshaft properly we've been

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.010 
doing the camshaft properly we've been
through<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.770> done<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.310> DoD<00:01:55.090> delete<00:01:55.420> which

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
through and done a DoD delete which

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.149 
through and done a DoD delete which
means<00:01:56.289> we've<00:01:56.470> changed<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:57.399> lead<00:01:57.850> off<00:01:58.030> lifters

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
means we've changed the lead off lifters

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.529 
means we've changed the lead off lifters
inside<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.280> engine<00:02:00.610> as<00:02:01.000> well<00:02:01.179> as<00:02:01.300> doing<00:02:01.479> the

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
inside the engine as well as doing the

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.180 
inside the engine as well as doing the
cam<00:02:01.720> show<00:02:01.929> which<00:02:02.530> involves<00:02:02.860> taking<00:02:03.009> the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
cam show which involves taking the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.710 
cam show which involves taking the
cylinder<00:02:03.490> heads<00:02:03.640> off<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:04.030> new<00:02:04.149> head<00:02:04.300> gaskets

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
cylinder heads off the new head gaskets

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.389 
cylinder heads off the new head gaskets
and<00:02:04.810> head<00:02:04.990> bolts<00:02:05.319> and<00:02:05.500> new<00:02:05.590> cover<00:02:05.800> plate<00:02:06.100> and

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
and head bolts and new cover plate and

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.550 
and head bolts and new cover plate and
new<00:02:06.550> lifters<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.149> new<00:02:07.750> lifter<00:02:08.019> retainers

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
new lifters and new lifter retainers

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.020 
new lifters and new lifter retainers
that<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.860> quite<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.220> few<00:02:09.580> bits<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:09.850> pieces

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
that is quite a few bits and pieces

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.210 
that is quite a few bits and pieces
inside<00:02:10.450> there<00:02:10.690> but<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.380> end<00:02:11.530> up<00:02:11.709> with<00:02:11.920> a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
inside there but you end up with a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.009 
inside there but you end up with a
system<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.850> works<00:02:13.150> properly<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.750> will<00:02:13.930> look

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
system that works properly and will look

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.949 
system that works properly and will look
after<00:02:14.170> itself<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.519> essentially<00:02:16.239> with<00:02:16.690> that

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
after itself so essentially with that

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.380 
after itself so essentially with that

that's<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> yellow<00:02:38.079> run<00:02:38.350> there<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:39.519> as<00:02:39.730> you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
that's the yellow run there and as you

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.599 
that's the yellow run there and as you
can<00:02:39.970> see<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.660> made<00:02:40.900> around<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.769> 300<00:02:42.070> actually

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
can see it made around the 300 actually

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:43.979 
can see it made around the 300 actually
at<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.329> end<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.600> run

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
like a normal one of these cars what we

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.460 
like a normal one of these cars what we
did<00:02:51.430> initially<00:02:51.640> he<00:02:52.299> just<00:02:52.540> had<00:02:52.690> an<00:02:53.049> OT<00:02:53.320> our

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
design a camshaft to suit what we wanted

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.170 
design a camshaft to suit what we wanted
here<00:03:17.170> quite<00:03:17.799> what<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:18.160> do<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.609> actually<00:03:18.670> end<00:03:19.090> up

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
here quite what we do to actually end up

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.819 
here quite what we do to actually end up
with<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.359> canvas<00:03:19.780> it's<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.140> car<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.590> the

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
with a canvas it's the car and the

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.860 
with a canvas it's the car and the
driver<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:22.060> as<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.299> can<00:03:22.420> see<00:03:22.570> even<00:03:22.750> from

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
driver and as you can see even from

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.360 
driver and as you can see even from
right<00:03:23.200> down<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.500> bottom<00:03:23.769> here<00:03:23.799> we<00:03:24.160> really

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
right down the bottom here we really

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.640 
right down the bottom here we really
have<00:03:24.609> no<00:03:24.760> gains<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.780> little<00:03:25.989> bit<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.410> reads

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
have no gains it's a little bit it reads

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.930 
have no gains it's a little bit it reads
a<00:03:26.739> little<00:03:26.769> bit<00:03:26.980> high<00:03:27.100> that's<00:03:27.459> really<00:03:27.760> neither

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
a little bit high that's really neither

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.400 
a little bit high that's really neither
here<00:03:28.180> nor<00:03:28.209> there<00:03:28.329> it's<00:03:28.900> around

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
here nor there it's around

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.280 
here nor there it's around
hundred<00:03:29.620> horsepower<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.940> up<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.390> around<00:03:32.050> here

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
hundred horsepower and up to around here

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.690 
hundred horsepower and up to around here
which<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.560> talking<00:03:32.800> about<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:33.010> 2000<00:03:33.580> riyals

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
which is talking about the 2000 riyals

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.190 
which is talking about the 2000 riyals
they're<00:03:34.060> all<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.300> same<00:03:34.540> money<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:34.960> there's<00:03:35.110> no

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
they're all the same money so there's no

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.800 
they're all the same money so there's no
loss<00:03:35.470> out<00:03:35.770> of<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:35.980> camshaft<00:03:36.210> but<00:03:37.210> as<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.720> can

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
loss out of this camshaft but as you can

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.480 
loss out of this camshaft but as you can
see<00:03:37.870> once<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.230> moved<00:03:38.440> into<00:03:38.560> 3,000<00:03:39.220> reads<00:03:39.370> we've

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
see once I moved into 3,000 reads we've

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.550 
see once I moved into 3,000 reads we've
got<00:03:39.700> gains<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.570> up<00:03:40.900> here<00:03:41.140> at<00:03:41.230> three<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.530> a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
got gains and up here at three and a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.110 
got gains and up here at three and a
half<00:03:41.680> thousand<00:03:42.130> revs<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.460> camshaft<00:03:42.940> is

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
half thousand revs the camshaft is

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.510 
half thousand revs the camshaft is
starting<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.510> show<00:03:43.690> its<00:03:43.720> worth<00:03:44.220> as<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.370> go

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
starting to show its worth as you go

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.510 
starting to show its worth as you go
through<00:03:45.790> into<00:03:46.780> up<00:03:47.320> into<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.650> revs<00:03:47.830> up<00:03:48.100> here

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
through into up into the revs up here

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.910 
through into up into the revs up here
we're<00:03:48.700> moving<00:03:48.820> into<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:49.390> around<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.320> 6000

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
we're moving into the around the 6000
