00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
been a lot of studies about that the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.029 
been a lot of studies about that the
biggest<00:00:48.360> thing<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.930> student<00:00:49.500> housing<00:00:49.890> is

biggest thing with student housing is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.740 
biggest thing with student housing is
that<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.820> affects<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.360> first<00:00:51.570> time

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that it really affects the first time

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.959 
that it really affects the first time
home<00:00:51.930> buyers<00:00:52.170> market<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> look<00:00:53.579> at<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
home buyers market so if you look at the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.580 
home buyers market so if you look at the
type<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> student<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.750> would<00:00:54.960> incur<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> lot

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
type of student that would incur a lot

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.900 
type of student that would incur a lot
of<00:00:55.710> debt<00:00:55.980> typically<00:00:56.520> they're<00:00:56.760> well<00:00:56.879> educated

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
of debt typically they're well educated

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180 
of debt typically they're well educated
typically<00:00:57.899> they're<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.379> employed

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
typically they're going to be employed

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.450 
typically they're going to be employed
well<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.030> maybe<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.170> optimal<00:01:01.859> person<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> go

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
well and maybe the optimal person to go

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
well and maybe the optimal person to go
out<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.640> buy<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> first-time<00:01:03.359> home<00:01:04.290> that's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
out and buy a first-time home that's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
out and buy a first-time home that's
really<00:01:05.189> impeding<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> market<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> got

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
really impeding the market so if you got

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.179 
really impeding the market so if you got
if<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.200> haven't<00:01:07.350> dead<00:01:07.650> already<00:01:07.920> they're

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
if they haven't dead already they're

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.620 
if they haven't dead already they're
servicing<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.670> debt<00:01:08.790> maybe<00:01:09.330> even<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
servicing that debt maybe even the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
servicing that debt maybe even the
delinquent<00:01:10.200> debt<00:01:10.619> debt<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.130> they're

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
delinquent debt debt so they're

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
delinquent debt debt so they're
affecting<00:01:12.119> their<00:01:12.240> credit<00:01:12.510> stores<00:01:12.750> score<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
affecting their credit stores score so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
affecting their credit stores score so
they<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.799> can't<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> buy<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
they really can't go out and buy that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
they really can't go out and buy that
starter<00:01:16.500> home<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.130> initially<00:01:17.580> end<00:01:17.790> up

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
starter home that they initially end up

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.450 
starter home that they initially end up
running<00:01:18.090> okay<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.259> did<00:01:19.320> most<00:01:19.799> students

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
running okay so how did most students

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
running okay so how did most students
get<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.030> into<00:01:21.509> debt<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.170> far<00:01:22.409> behind<00:01:22.619> in

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
get so into debt and so far behind in

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.710 
get so into debt and so far behind in
their<00:01:23.159> payments<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:24.119> did<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.509> being

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
their payments and how did not being

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
their payments and how did not being
able<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.200> quickly<00:01:25.409> find<00:01:25.770> employment<00:01:26.340> after

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
able to quickly find employment after

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.920 
able to quickly find employment after
graduation<00:01:27.740> exacerbate<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> problem<00:01:29.930> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
graduation exacerbate the problem so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.539 
graduation exacerbate the problem so
it's<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.619> reflection<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
it's really just a reflection of the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's really just a reflection of the
economy<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> reality<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.619> is

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
economy you know and the reality is is

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.160 
economy you know and the reality is is
that<00:01:35.240> when<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.270> comes<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:37.079> housing<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
that when it comes to housing the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.749 
that when it comes to housing the
majority<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> housing<00:01:40.950> market<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> push

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
majority of the housing market is a push

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.789 
majority of the housing market is a push
up<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> start<00:01:42.810> off<00:01:42.869> renting<00:01:43.320> then

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
up right so you start off renting then

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
actually doing as bad as good as it can

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.330 
actually doing as bad as good as it can
right<00:03:07.650> now<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.040> going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.250> get

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
right now and it's going to get

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.610 
right now and it's going to get
significantly<00:03:09.060> better<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.260> look<00:03:10.440> at

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
significantly better so if you look at

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.680 
significantly better so if you look at
two<00:03:10.770> thousand<00:03:11.100> eight<00:03:11.190> nine<00:03:11.550> ten<00:03:12.090> eleven

twelve it's really been bad 2013 is set

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.770 
twelve it's really been bad 2013 is set
up<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> really<00:03:17.070> great<00:03:17.370> year<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.540> that

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
up to be a really great year and that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.890 
up to be a really great year and that
should<00:03:19.049> continue<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.790> 2014-15<00:03:20.790> with<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> huge

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
should continue to 2014-15 with a huge

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.729 
should continue to 2014-15 with a huge
um<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:23.820> built<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.360> demand<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:24.989> purchases<00:03:25.590> I

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
um it built up demand for purchases I

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.220 
um it built up demand for purchases I
think<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.400> would<00:03:26.640> even<00:03:26.940> be<00:03:26.970> better<00:03:27.090> if<00:03:27.810> the

know if you look at any index like that
is<00:04:01.470> ok<00:04:02.130> but<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.549> problem<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.299> it

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
is ok but the problem is is that it
