 and here in this box and suddenly 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.099
 disappeared as you know from history the 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.479
 the best is the best written you never leave me 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.709
 to be able to see I'm sorry for a lot that 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.709
 enter a room and leave 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.419
 in the other world I belong to the other 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.849
 world 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.680
 that is, the willy is the worst nightmare of 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.169
 anyone probably accurate 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.710
 imagine you know the government is a 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.199
 example 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.419
 imagine that you are going to me that I know to shit 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.909
 they are flat and to be a bit like that you go 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.909
 to shit and something very ugly comes out of the bathroom 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.660
 as well as at the extreme 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.070
 since being a box 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.400
 that is, being a box is the worst thing that you 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.400
 it can happen 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.930
 was a fucking bitch in the challenge of what 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.930
