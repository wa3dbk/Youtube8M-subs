might have been a burn here and this is
a<00:01:28.040> newer<00:01:28.310> forest<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.150> don't<00:01:29.540> know<00:01:30.580> why<00:01:31.580> don't<00:01:31.760> we

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
a newer forest I don't know why don't we

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.359 
a newer forest I don't know why don't we
look<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.330> see<00:01:32.510> if<00:01:32.600> we<00:01:32.720> can<00:01:32.930> find<00:01:33.200> other<00:01:33.560> older

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
look and see if we can find other older

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.790 
look and see if we can find other older
trees<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:35.090> may<00:01:35.240> have<00:01:35.360> any<00:01:35.540> char<00:01:36.259> marks<00:01:36.530> on

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
trees that may have any char marks on

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:48.700 
trees that may have any char marks on
them<00:01:46.060> this<00:01:47.060> trail<00:01:47.330> goes<00:01:47.600> for<00:01:47.869> miles<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.560> can

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
them this trail goes for miles you can

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.600 
them this trail goes for miles you can
we<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:49.130> keep<00:01:49.310> going<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:49.910> going<00:01:51.100> well<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.130> I
