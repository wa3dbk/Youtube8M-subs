00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.990 
start recording so I had to actually
press<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:12.020> pretty<00:03:12.860> tight<00:03:13.069> to<00:03:13.730> actually

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
press it in pretty tight to actually

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.340 
press it in pretty tight to actually
start<00:03:14.180> recording<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.810> same<00:03:17.989> thing<00:03:18.200> with

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.500 
not recording there's another video on
YouTube<00:03:23.780> now<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.620> watch<00:03:24.860> that<00:03:25.390> mentions<00:03:26.390> that

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
YouTube now I watch that mentions that

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.410 
YouTube now I watch that mentions that
if<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.780> push<00:03:27.110> this<00:03:27.500> area<00:03:28.040> back<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:29.120> push<00:03:29.390> the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
if you push this area back and push the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.960 
if you push this area back and push the
button<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:31.760> actually<00:03:32.000> helps<00:03:32.239> but<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:33.970> don't

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
button it actually helps but I don't

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.199 
button it actually helps but I don't
think<00:03:35.150> that's<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.510> case<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:36.730> really<00:03:37.730> do<00:03:38.000> think

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
think that's the case I really do think

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.460 
think that's the case I really do think
that<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.510> just<00:03:38.750> have<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:38.989> push<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.260> button

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
that you just have to push the button

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.360 
that you just have to push the button
pretty<00:03:39.680> hard<00:03:39.940> start<00:03:40.940> recording<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:42.370> don't

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
pretty hard start recording I don't

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.400 
pretty hard start recording I don't
think<00:03:43.700> that's<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.120> case<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:44.989> fault

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
think that's the case is fault

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.150 
think that's the case is fault
I<00:03:45.440> believe<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:48.260> actual<00:03:48.650> button<00:03:48.920> it's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
I believe this actual button it's

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.540 
I believe this actual button it's
actually<00:03:49.459> pretty<00:03:49.640> hard<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.940> actually<00:03:50.390> push

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
actually pretty hard to actually push

anything<00:04:06.950> like<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:09.549> when<00:04:10.549> I<00:04:10.579> purchased<00:04:11.269> the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
anything like that when I purchased the

anything like that when I purchased the
s100<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.590> was<00:04:12.769> very<00:04:13.010> curious<00:04:13.280> whether<00:04:13.700> or<00:04:13.820> not

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
s100 I was very curious whether or not

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.860 
s100 I was very curious whether or not
it<00:04:14.150> was<00:04:14.299> compatible<00:04:15.260> with<00:04:15.470> this<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.390> I<00:04:17.390> looked

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
it was compatible with this and I looked

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.229 
it was compatible with this and I looked
up<00:04:17.959> video<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.530> hopefully<00:04:19.430> this<00:04:19.789> video<00:04:19.940> will

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
up video and hopefully this video will

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.920 
up video and hopefully this video will
actually<00:04:20.660> help<00:04:20.780> others<00:04:22.270> participe<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.300> s100

actually help others participe a s100
which<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.350> think<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:24.950> pretty<00:04:25.100> nice<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:25.690> like

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
which I think it's pretty nice I like

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.450 
which I think it's pretty nice I like
the<00:04:26.870> fact<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.470> has<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> 13<00:04:28.039> point<00:04:28.220> 5

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
the fact that it has a 13 point 5

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.409 
the fact that it has a 13 point 5
megapixel<00:04:29.440> bill<00:04:30.470> compared<00:04:31.039> to<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.400> s<00:04:31.550> 15

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
megapixel bill compared to the s 15

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.190 
megapixel bill compared to the s 15
which<00:04:32.870> was<00:04:33.760> good<00:04:34.760> for<00:04:34.880> making<00:04:35.030> videos<00:04:35.419> um<00:04:35.630> I

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
which was good for making videos um I

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.960 
which was good for making videos um I
make<00:04:36.470> more<00:04:36.770> snowboarding<00:04:37.280> videos<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.789> things

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
make more snowboarding videos and things

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.190 
make more snowboarding videos and things
like<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.810> think<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.930> s100<00:04:41.930> is

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
like that but I think the s100 is

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.040 
like that but I think the s100 is
probably<00:04:42.770> good<00:04:43.310> upgrade<00:04:43.580> for<00:04:43.789> still<00:04:44.360> until

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
probably good upgrade for still until

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.719 
probably good upgrade for still until
they<00:04:45.140> upgrade<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.590> for<00:04:47.229> interval<00:04:48.229> width<00:04:48.890> 13.5

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
they upgrade it for interval width 13.5

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.909 
they upgrade it for interval width 13.5
million<00:04:50.120> pixels<00:04:50.479> which<00:04:51.289> is<00:04:51.320> pretty<00:04:51.530> nice<00:04:51.680> um

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
million pixels which is pretty nice um

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.750 
million pixels which is pretty nice um
hopefully<00:04:52.820> this<00:04:53.270> video<00:04:53.390> helps
