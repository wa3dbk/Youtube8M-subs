00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
to download actually so I took me around

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.540 
to download actually so I took me around
20<00:04:46.020> minutes<00:04:46.289> but<00:04:46.680> why<00:04:46.800> why<00:04:47.039> doesn't<00:04:47.340> make<00:04:47.430> that

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.730 
20 minutes but why why doesn't make that
long<00:04:47.729> um<00:04:48.200> that's<00:04:49.200> pretty<00:04:49.380> much<00:04:49.470> how<00:04:49.680> to

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
long um that's pretty much how to

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.000
