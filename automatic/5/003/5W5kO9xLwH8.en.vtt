00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello to Artem Nesterenko and in this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.540
 video I want to make about what 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.760
 the most effective advertising in our 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.290
 business but before let's go to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.480
 most effective advertising breaks down in general 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
 What is the business you asked 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.859
 ever ask yourself what 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.830
 is a business 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:22.560
 a customer is a product sales marketing or 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.180
 even something I think everyone 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.869
 an entrepreneur asking myself the question 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.699
 Often 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.550
 but I would like to give an understanding now 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.260
 of what is a business because it is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 is key u maybe you are now 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.450
 completely change your strategy 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 developing your business and so business is 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.149
 solving other people's problems for big money 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 for the average money that you can 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.629
 help solve 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.340
 the client of his problems whatever you are 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.660
 engaged in you solve problems for money 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.170
 such an example is for example let's 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.149
 let's think that for example let's take books 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.250
 yes that is, a person buys a book is not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.059
 for the book he buys the book to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.799
 solve some problem or for example 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.150
 for example, take the trade to buy time 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.119
 in order to drill it was 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.189
 but in order to drill a hole like that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.840
 it may not even be a hole 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.369
 and hang the regiment that is, he wants to solve 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.250
 his problem but for this buys 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.350
 drill think about when your customers 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.049
 come to you and buy your service 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.270
 or your product what they want to decide 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.070
 problem because of this we can proceed 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.619
 how can you build the most 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 effective advertising is that so 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.490
 how business today is very evolving with 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.729
 I want to talk about high speeds 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.530
 that people who have knowledge 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.720
 what is a two-tier sale create 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.979
 very big business and and so what 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.710
 two-tier sale 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.680
 the first is when you first step is when 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.299
 you can create your customer base then 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.140
 have you put some trust 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.630
 relationship here we include 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.100
 infomarketing in our countries 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 will tell much space now 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.520
 very few businesses that use 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.890
 infomarketing what is it but for example 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 if you promote something you lead 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 start teaching your customers something 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.290
 how to choose a product 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.119
 how not to stumble or do something else 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.440
 start educating your customers and 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.750
 free create some 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.380
 training course or write some 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.480
 the book 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.390
 how to choose the right customer 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.680
 product and present in terms of 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.480
 how to choose the right 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.250
 the item i am is that if you start 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.540
 create your own base and she 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.300
 there will be tens and hundreds 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.330
 thousand you will be much easier to sell 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.650
 than for example just in the forehead to do it 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.410
 the person who first encounters 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.900
 your product and when you start it 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.790
 do you will have 2 2 positions pay 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.680
 focus on mcdonalds he advertises 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.990
 the sight of your hamburger is even painted on 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.510
 yourself mcdonalds hamburg you pay 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.270
 attention to ikea they offer some 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.470
 very cheap product called front end 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.720
 think what you can offer either 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.640
 free of charge either for a very small price and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.590
 so give it in return for 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.140
 contacts of people who will be it 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.150
 buyers download or purchase in 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.000
 your point or when I buy your 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.920
 service and when you line up nicks 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.080
 trusting relationships with such people 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.310
 it's much easier for them to make a decision 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.770
 buy it something further 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.180
 based on this frontend product you 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.100
 offering for free is not there 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.220
 the right word in Russian to 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.200
 explain what 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.460
 offer a solution to some problem 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.400
 based on what I said at the beginning 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.930
 This video, that is, you write directly to 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.150
 what problems do you face? 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.550
 your clients why they are looking for exactly yours 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.050
 product not to buy a drill and 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.660
 so that she was to 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.870
 drill a hole yes and it is still important to say 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.540
 that when you start releasing 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.250
 Some products create this then you 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.170
 it will be much easier to set respect 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.520
 sell your product so therefore 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.680
 effective advertising is when 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.200
 build a base and promote your 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.910
 product then familiar people who 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.200
 lined up with you put pressure on relationships with 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.610
