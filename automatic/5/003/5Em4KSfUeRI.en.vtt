00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
here so that's the basic idea that's

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.770 
here so that's the basic idea that's
written<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.660> tab<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:06.300> be<00:02:06.509> sure<00:02:06.540> to
