00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
end and plug it into the dazzle and you

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.230 
end and plug it into the dazzle and you
should<00:01:24.310> see<00:01:24.430> that<00:01:24.460> there's<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.790> light<00:01:24.970> on<00:01:25.000> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
should see that there's a light on the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.120 
should see that there's a light on the
dazzle<00:01:25.570> if<00:01:25.780> it's<00:01:25.990> plugged<00:01:26.140> in<00:01:26.350> just<00:01:26.950> going<00:01:27.070> to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
dazzle if it's plugged in just going to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.300 
dazzle if it's plugged in just going to
go<00:01:27.220> ahead<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.549> unfold<00:01:27.670> but<00:01:28.119> now<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:30.070> best

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
go ahead and unfold but now it's best

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.830 
go ahead and unfold but now it's best
for<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.610> not<00:01:30.640> have<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.150> power<00:01:31.299> on<00:01:31.510> or

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
for it to not have the power on or

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.710 
for it to not have the power on or
you're<00:01:31.990> connecting<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:33.030> write<00:01:34.030> these<00:01:34.299> you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
you're connecting you write these you

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.109 
you're connecting you write these you
can<00:01:34.840> see<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.049> I've<00:01:35.320> put<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:36.119> correct

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
can see that I've put the correct

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.609 
can see that I've put the correct
colored<00:01:37.710> ends<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.189> wrong<00:01:39.369> cable<00:01:40.030> into<00:01:40.479> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
colored ends of the wrong cable into the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.890 
colored ends of the wrong cable into the
dazzle<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:42.100> then<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.970> other<00:01:43.000> end<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:45.130> here

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
dazzle and then the other end just here

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.969 
dazzle and then the other end just here
I'm<00:01:46.900> going<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:48.600> need<00:01:49.600> three<00:01:50.110> more<00:01:50.140> bits<00:01:50.830> of

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
I'm going to need three more bits of

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.649 
I'm going to need three more bits of
equipment<00:01:51.070> which<00:01:53.400> are<00:01:54.930> three<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:56.259> these<00:01:56.560> I

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
equipment which are three of these I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.649 
equipment which are three of these I
gotta<00:01:58.659> focus<00:01:58.930> yep<00:01:59.470> so<00:02:00.009> they've<00:02:00.280> got<00:02:00.659> two

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
gotta focus yep so they've got two

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.969 
gotta focus yep so they've got two
female<00:02:02.439> ports<00:02:02.860> there<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.340> they<00:02:04.000> male<00:02:04.180> 1<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
female ports there and they male 1 the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.850 
female ports there and they male 1 the
don't<00:02:05.979> want<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.280> do<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.970> just<00:02:07.210> connect<00:02:07.570> one<00:02:08.560> of

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
don't want to do is just connect one of

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.720 
don't want to do is just connect one of
these<00:02:09.489> female<00:02:10.060> ports<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:11.200> each<00:02:11.349> of<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> wires

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
these female ports to each of the wires

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.330 
these female ports to each of the wires
like<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.880> now<00:02:14.450> you'll<00:02:14.690> need<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.340> composite

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
like this now you'll need a composite

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.000 
like this now you'll need a composite
cable<00:02:16.670> which<00:02:17.570> has<00:02:17.690> got<00:02:18.130> wind<00:02:19.390> with<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:21.010> red

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
cable which has got wind with the red

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.450 
cable which has got wind with the red
yellow<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.490> white<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:24.250> remember<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.310> as<00:02:25.430> a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
yellow and white and remember it as a

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.220 
yellow and white and remember it as a
matter<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.760> its<00:02:25.940> white<00:02:26.180> or<00:02:26.450> black<00:02:26.690> because<00:02:27.110> of

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
matter of its white or black because of

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.380 
matter of its white or black because of
the<00:02:27.320> vein<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.740> then<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.370> other<00:02:28.400> end<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.300> that

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
the vein and then the other end of that
