club<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.930> uh<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.700> atmosphere

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
club and uh and just the atmosphere

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.840 
club and uh and just the atmosphere
wasn't<00:02:58.420> conducive<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:59.079> that<00:02:59.370> feel<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.549> healing
