more challenging movement so today what
we're<00:00:39.360> gonna<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.899> take<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> look<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
we're gonna do is take a look at the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.680 
we're gonna do is take a look at the
movement<00:00:40.800> mastery<00:00:41.309> mindset<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.390> applies

movement mastery mindset as it applies

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.470 
movement mastery mindset as it applies
to<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.020> TRX<00:00:43.440> lunch<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.940> Mike<00:00:45.270> were<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to the TRX lunch now if Mike were a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.479 
to the TRX lunch now if Mike were a
basic<00:00:45.930> trainee<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.500> would<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.829> him<00:00:46.980> start<00:00:47.340> out

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
basic trainee I would have him start out

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.160 
basic trainee I would have him start out
with<00:00:47.670> two<00:00:47.879> hands<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> ground<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.960> he's<00:00:49.079> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
with two hands on the ground so he's in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
with two hands on the ground so he's in
his<00:00:49.260> most<00:00:49.500> stable<00:00:49.770> position<00:00:50.070> before<00:00:50.550> he<00:00:50.730> goes

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
his most stable position before he goes

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.020 
his most stable position before he goes
ahead<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.449> comes<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.289> off<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> ground<00:00:53.030> okay

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
so he was a little bit unstable go ahead

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.880 
so he was a little bit unstable go ahead
