00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.340
 let's use if you think the number 14 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.930

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.789
 direction 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 When you see I've already put the bank in this 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.189
 from here we go to this from here where I 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.710
 I pull that're low on ink is because 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.320
 ink is not very strong so you need to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 little I will nominate because the paint 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.620
 sheet plus an accessory 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.980
 look here it turned white on that side then 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 the hand to leave the hand so the more 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.160
 Light 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.100
 pulling in comes someone saying they will stay 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:19.860
 white with ink again from the side here 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.700
 here very little ink and you will circulate 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.760
 every turn to the base was 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.490
 using the supporter 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:40.120

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.440
 Okay, and you're coming with the farm by the side 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:50.380

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:52.500
 Already look here the white notice this here 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.500

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:44.290
