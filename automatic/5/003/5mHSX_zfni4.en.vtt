00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.410
 hello today we will be with you 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.389
 play math with you today 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.000
 cats 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.750
 today we will talk about how 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.730
 recorded numbers in ancient greece you 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.550
 maybe met roman 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.830
 Roman numbers are sometimes found 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.009
 on the clock where else are roman 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.500
 numbers in some roman books 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.400
 numbers write how many chapters number 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.649
 the head is written and still very often by roman 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.370
 writes numbers what age is now 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.489
 but the roman numbers many know we will 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.640
 speak today not about roman but about 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.329
 greek 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.480
 have you ever heard of such and not 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.129
 committed but let's try about them 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.320
 talk I'll tell you how they 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.010
 considered Greek a little bit like 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.500
 Roman but simpler when for example 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.850
 there was a need to write that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 man there is one bull he did not write 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.150
 just one stick just like that once 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.810
 one stick 1 means one stick but 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:22.990
 if two bulls are the same i am a chopstick or two 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:26.200
 fingers showed yes but if 4 bulls. 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.939
 no this in the roman tick they just 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.790
 showed just four fingers either 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:36.790
 just four sticks but if you kick 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:42.610
 then it was a bit like a Roman 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.710
 then they do not have written here is a 5 as a whole 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.850
 arm 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:54.939
 little letters navel like our 5 to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.939
 what do you think how did they write 7 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.429
 attempt 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:13.060
 sticks it was 7 let's all sign 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:18.910
 something we have 6 this five is four three 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.870
 two one yes how do you think how 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.870
 write 9 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.290
 and how to be a war of four sticks will 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:44.210
 9 to 9 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:46.550
 maybe and poetry and sticks is 8 a 10 y 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.280
 they were recorded with a special icon but 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.670
 not like the roman like this if 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.530
 two hands fold triangle 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:01.330
 another triangle looks like the letter d 10 a 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.330
 who would guess how to write 15 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:15.620
 and square b is exactly a triangle and p 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.490
 Of course the poet is already five and how to write 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.490
 17 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.350
 exactly 17 is a triangle for and two 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.060
 sticks are 17 and you know how they are 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.230
 recorded 23 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:46.000
 but they wrote two triangles and then 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.140
 three sticks ok let's go now bye 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.400
 stop kirish 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:56.380
 and let's try to think and how 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.550
 they solved the examples let me write 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.820
 some example of greek numbers 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:09.760
 agreed and try to solve it here 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:12.700
 I wrote an example of who can do it 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:21.720
 read let's try to read this 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:21.720
 example do you want gas 21 + 13 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.790
 but you know what they had 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.520
 for 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.520
 she and you could write hundreds of numbers 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.060
 these are how sly they wrote down a hundred 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:49.730
 happy to tell you 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.600
 hundred they wrote the letter n m it 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.690
 there will be a hundred 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:05:01.090
 and who can tell me how to write 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.090
 number 124 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.340
 n 2 triangles and four sticks it 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:26.289
 124 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:39.279
 how to record 210 and video and everything and that 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:42.400
 210 but how to write 345 3 n 4 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:49.949
 a triangle and a five ip 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:54.279
 it's 345 great what a great fellows and now u 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:58.589
 they were still sly signs you know what 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:04.389
 cunning they had special marks 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:10.289
 50 and special sign 500 special 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:13.569
 sign 50 was similar to both 5 and ten and 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.120
 he was like a triangle which 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:19.560
 hid in the top five and it was 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.560
 special sign 50 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:31.549
 and who would guess what the number could be 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:37.219
 write like this don't slip 

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:45.529
 look here this icon is that 72 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:55.989
 great this 72 really is that 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:55.989
 and this this not 50 this 500 500 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:10.879
 610 pieces of us for sure is 616 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:15.529
 but you are great we are fine today 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:18.169
 learned to write Greek numbers and we 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:22.519
 even learned how to write examples 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:24.649
 with the help of the Greek sensitive and you 

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:28.839
 you can invent tasks now 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:28.839
 so cleverly write them agreed 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.739
 I will
