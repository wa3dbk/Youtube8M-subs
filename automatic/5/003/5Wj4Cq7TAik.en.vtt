00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
playing the map not completing the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
playing the map not completing the
Easter<00:00:32.579> Egg<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.940> dying<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
Easter Egg and dying now this is

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110 
Easter Egg and dying now this is
actually<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> first<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.610> zombies

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
actually the first time in zombies

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.270 
actually the first time in zombies
Treyarch<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:37.170> answers<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> question

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
Treyarch actually answers the question

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
Treyarch actually answers the question
why<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.180> able<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.750> restart<00:00:40.260> each<00:00:40.440> map<00:00:40.800> if

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
why are we able to restart each map if

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.250 
why are we able to restart each map if
the<00:00:41.219> storyline<00:00:41.760> progresses<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.600> since<00:00:43.050> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the storyline progresses and since this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.200 
the storyline progresses and since this
answer<00:00:43.710> makes<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.129> much<00:00:44.280> sense<00:00:44.309> for<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.940> map

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
answer makes so much sense for this map

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
answer makes so much sense for this map
why<00:00:45.690> would<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.350> apply<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> other<00:00:47.250> maps

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
why would this not apply to other maps

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.090 
why would this not apply to other maps
as<00:00:47.879> well<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.079> Richthofen<00:00:49.680> has<00:00:49.860> any

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
as well it's not like Richthofen has any

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
as well it's not like Richthofen has any
more<00:00:50.340> power<00:00:50.579> than<00:00:50.879> cement<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.539> did<00:00:51.870> back<00:00:52.230> in

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
more power than cement that did back in

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.770 
more power than cement that did back in
black<00:00:52.680> ops<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.100> world<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.489> war<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.480> wouldn't

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
black ops in world at war so it wouldn't

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.900 
black ops in world at war so it wouldn't
be<00:00:54.989> completely<00:00:55.590> crazy<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
be completely crazy to think that this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.479 
be completely crazy to think that this
is<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.270> every<00:00:57.930> map<00:00:58.199> works<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
is how every map works when the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.130 
is how every map works when the
characters<00:00:59.969> died<00:01:00.329> they<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.660> brought<00:01:00.930> back<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
characters died they get brought back to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
characters died they get brought back to
the<00:01:01.379> beginning<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.670> could

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the beginning so that they could

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
the beginning so that they could
eventually<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.350> progress<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
eventually do it right and progress the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.100 
eventually do it right and progress the
storyline<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.060> doing<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.450> wouldn't<00:01:06.900> be

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
storyline but doing this wouldn't be

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.450 
storyline but doing this wouldn't be
without<00:01:07.470> consequence

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
without consequence

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.850 
without consequence
every<00:01:09.030> time<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.330> samantha<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.260> Richthofen

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
every time that samantha or Richthofen

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
every time that samantha or Richthofen
would<00:01:11.070> use<00:01:11.280> their<00:01:11.490> powers<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.119> restart<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
would use their powers to restart the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
would use their powers to restart the
map<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> characters<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:14.400> would<00:01:14.549> be

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
map for the characters they would be

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.780 
map for the characters they would be
creating<00:01:15.270> an<00:01:15.390> alternate<00:01:16.259> universe<00:01:16.580> one<00:01:17.580> where

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
creating an alternate universe one where

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
creating an alternate universe one where
everything<00:01:18.330> plays<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.810> badly<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
everything plays out badly and the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
everything plays out badly and the
characters<00:01:20.100> die<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> map<00:01:21.060> now<00:01:21.479> obviously

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
characters die in the map now obviously

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.050 
characters die in the map now obviously
in<00:01:22.380> real<00:01:22.650> life<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.189> players<00:01:23.460> around

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
in real life there are players around

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
in real life there are players around
the<00:01:24.270> world<00:01:24.509> playing<00:01:24.930> zombie<00:01:25.380> maps<00:01:25.590> every<00:01:26.189> day

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the world playing zombie maps every day

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
the world playing zombie maps every day
and<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:27.119> completing<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> easter<00:01:28.170> egg<00:01:28.290> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and not completing the easter egg and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
and not completing the easter egg and
dying<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.490> course<00:01:29.759> that's<00:01:30.180> expected<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
dying and of course that's expected to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.560 
dying and of course that's expected to
happen<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.619> maybe<00:01:31.950> every<00:01:32.729> time<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.150> happens

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
happen but maybe every time that happens

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 
happen but maybe every time that happens
that<00:01:34.110> represents<00:01:34.890> an<00:01:35.040> alternate<00:01:35.610> universe

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that represents an alternate universe

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.390 
that represents an alternate universe
that<00:01:36.570> stopped<00:01:37.020> existing<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.920> soon<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
that stopped existing as soon as the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.179 
that stopped existing as soon as the
players<00:01:38.640> died<00:01:39.030> maybe<00:01:39.750> every<00:01:40.409> time<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.920> play

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
players died maybe every time we play

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.060 
players died maybe every time we play
zombies<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.939> any<00:01:42.390> map<00:01:42.689> were<00:01:43.170> acting<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.829> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
zombies on any map were acting out in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
zombies on any map were acting out in
alternate<00:01:44.640> universe<00:01:45.119> where<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> characters

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
alternate universe where the characters

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.410 
alternate universe where the characters
don't<00:01:46.290> make<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.130> map<00:01:47.310> alive<00:01:47.670> call

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
don't make it out of the map alive call

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510
