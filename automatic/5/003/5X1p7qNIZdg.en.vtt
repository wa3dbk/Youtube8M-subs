00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
amount of skimming out of it I ended up

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.709 
amount of skimming out of it I ended up
putting<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> back<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.210> tank<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:15.690> a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
putting it on the back of the tank for a

putting it on the back of the tank for a
while<00:00:15.960> because<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.320> really<00:00:16.500> was<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.880> it<00:00:17.880> was

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
while because I really was a it was

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.580 
while because I really was a it was
really<00:00:18.180> difficult<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.600> get<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.840> out<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
really difficult to get it out of the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.310 
really difficult to get it out of the
sump<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> had<00:00:20.869> one<00:00:21.869> issue<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.140> I

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
sump that I had one issue that I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.080 
sump that I had one issue that I
realized<00:00:22.769> shortly<00:00:23.369> after<00:00:23.580> putting<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
realized shortly after putting it on the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.679 
realized shortly after putting it on the
back<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> my<00:00:24.420> tank<00:00:25.130> was<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> lot<00:00:27.660> of

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
back of my tank was that get a lot of

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
back of my tank was that get a lot of
water<00:00:28.019> leaking<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.859> flow<00:00:29.460> control

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
water leaking out of this flow control

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.479 
water leaking out of this flow control
knob<00:00:30.199> that's<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.380> problem<00:00:31.619> especially<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
knob that's a problem especially on the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
knob that's a problem especially on the
back<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.790> tank<00:00:33.059> where<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.050> can't<00:00:34.260> don't

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
back of a tank where you can't don't

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.180 
back of a tank where you can't don't
have<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> lot<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> room<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.280> back<00:00:35.430> there<00:00:35.809> I

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
have a lot of room to get back there I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.880 
have a lot of room to get back there I
decided<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:39.140> since<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.770> new

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
decided that since I'm going with a new

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.060 
decided that since I'm going with a new
set<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:42.140> maybe<00:00:43.140> upgrade<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.860> bit

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
set up maybe upgrade this a little bit

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.130 
set up maybe upgrade this a little bit
I'm<00:00:44.430> probably<00:00:44.940> never<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> use<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.840> one

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I'm probably never going to use this one

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.459 
I'm probably never going to use this one
again<00:00:47.180> probably<00:00:48.180> gonna<00:00:48.360> return<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.020> get

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
again probably gonna return it or get

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.880 
again probably gonna return it or get
try<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> repaired<00:00:51.500> having<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> leaky

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
try to get it repaired having a leaky

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.569 
try to get it repaired having a leaky
protein<00:00:53.250> skimmer<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> good<00:00:54.000> thing<00:00:55.579> so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
protein skimmer is not a good thing so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.939 
protein skimmer is not a good thing so
here's<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> new<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.410> kind<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.800> see

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.410 
of the tank over here and metal feed
there<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> pump<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> left<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
there will be a pump to the left of the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.499 
there will be a pump to the left of the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
sump water come back here I'm a little

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
sump water come back here I'm a little
intimidated<00:01:27.659> by<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.590> honest<00:01:28.920> but

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
intimidated by this to be honest but

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.749 
intimidated by this to be honest but
it's<00:01:30.500> this<00:01:31.500> one's<00:01:31.680> upgradable<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.369> if<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.579> want

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
it's this one's upgradable so if I want

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.300 
it's this one's upgradable so if I want
to<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.240> crazy<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> giant<00:01:34.829> tank<00:01:35.159> or

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to go crazy with a giant tank or

to go crazy with a giant tank or
something<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.640> should<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.030> able<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.360> that

something I should be able to do that
main<00:01:37.560> reason<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> upgrade<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.520> two

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
main reason for the upgrade is two

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480 
main reason for the upgrade is two
reasons<00:01:39.509> 1i<00:01:39.750> had<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> opportunity<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:41.369> in

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
reasons 1i had the opportunity to get in

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.069 
reasons 1i had the opportunity to get in
that<00:01:42.290> incredibly<00:01:43.290> good<00:01:43.920> price<00:01:44.899> second<00:01:45.899> reason

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
that incredibly good price second reason

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.670 
that incredibly good price second reason
was<00:01:46.380> i<00:01:46.890> figured<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.399> i<00:01:48.320> only<00:01:49.320> want<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> do

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
was i figured that i only want to do

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.130 
was i figured that i only want to do
this<00:01:49.799> upgrade<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.460> once<00:01:50.729> every<00:01:51.030> ten<00:01:51.420> fifteen

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
this upgrade like once every ten fifteen

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.870 
this upgrade like once every ten fifteen
years<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.649> hopefully<00:01:52.740> this'll<00:01:53.130> s<00:01:53.399> work<00:01:53.640> quite

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
years so hopefully this'll s work quite

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.840 
years so hopefully this'll s work quite
some<00:01:54.119> time<00:01:54.979> don't<00:01:55.979> keep<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.280> posted<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.729> the
