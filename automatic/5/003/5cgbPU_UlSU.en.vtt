00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
presentation the board inside here is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.040 
presentation the board inside here is
pretty<00:01:59.220> well<00:02:00.090> packs<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.870> to<00:02:00.900> take

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
pretty well packs it's going to take

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.450 
pretty well packs it's going to take
some<00:02:01.080> time<00:02:01.350> getting<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.680> little<00:02:01.950> little<00:02:02.190> time

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
some time getting a little little time

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.340 
some time getting a little little time
getting<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.910> out<00:02:03.060> overall<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.320> right

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
getting it out overall you can see right

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.470 
getting it out overall you can see right
now<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.190> very<00:02:05.580> attractive<00:02:05.940> board

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
now this is a very attractive board

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.440 
now this is a very attractive board
again<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> looks<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.369> x58<00:02:08.970> g1

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
again this looks just like the x58 g1
