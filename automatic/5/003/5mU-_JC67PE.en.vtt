00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
problems when it came to how it drove

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.339 
problems when it came to how it drove
but<00:00:08.580> its<00:00:08.880> conservative<00:00:09.360> styling<00:00:09.840> meant<00:00:10.200> it

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
but its conservative styling meant it

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.020 
but its conservative styling meant it
just<00:00:10.620> looked<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.040> bit<00:00:11.070> like<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.490> two-door

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
recognized this is a bit of problem as

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.890 
recognized this is a bit of problem as

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
going to be markedly different to the

lower<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.699> wider<00:00:23.910> than<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.600> old<00:00:24.750> car<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
lower and wider than the old car and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.990 
lower and wider than the old car and
we've<00:00:25.590> got<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> version<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:26.640> today

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
we've got a version of it here today

we've got a version of it here today
we've<00:00:27.990> also<00:00:28.170> invited<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.710> team<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.130> car

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

we've also invited a team of what car
readers<00:00:29.640> along<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.150> take<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> look<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> new

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
readers along to take a look at the new

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.479 
readers along to take a look at the new
car<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:32.309> they're<00:00:32.940> very<00:00:32.969> nice<00:00:33.660> ergonomics

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
car I think they're very nice ergonomics

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.319 
car I think they're very nice ergonomics
different<00:00:35.489> from<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> 3-series<00:00:36.059> quite

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
different from the 3-series quite

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.479 
different from the 3-series quite
dramatically<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.160> stands

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
dramatically I like the way it stands

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.610 
dramatically I like the way it stands
and<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> width<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:40.020> stands<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> wheels

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and the width it stands on the wheels

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.310 
and the width it stands on the wheels
seem<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.219> very<00:00:41.910> positive<00:00:42.120> big<00:00:43.110> boot

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
seem to be very very positive big boot

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860 
seem to be very very positive big boot
which<00:00:43.590> surprised<00:00:43.980> me<00:00:44.190> favourite<00:00:44.940> bit<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.450> think

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
which surprised me favourite bit I think

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.479 
which surprised me favourite bit I think
is<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> seating<00:00:46.530> position<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.219> very

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
is the seating position is is very

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
is the seating position is is very
driver<00:00:47.760> orientated<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.989> controls<00:00:49.379> very

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
driver orientated the controls very

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
driver orientated the controls very
cockpit<00:00:50.010> come<00:00:50.280> around<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.600> see

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
cockpit come around you you can see

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.229 
cockpit come around you you can see
everything<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.649> clear<00:00:53.059> nicely<00:00:54.059> laid

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
everything it's very clear nicely laid

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.630 
everything it's very clear nicely laid
out<00:00:54.270> simple<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> brand<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.520> an

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
out simple I think the brand is it's an

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.369 
out simple I think the brand is it's an
ideal<00:00:56.969> thing<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.199> do

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
ideal thing so that you really do

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.049 
ideal thing so that you really do
separate<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.399> 3-series<00:00:59.789> from<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
separate out from the 3-series from the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.380 
separate out from the 3-series from the
4<00:01:00.239> Series<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.989> feels<00:01:01.350> different<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:02.100> an<00:01:02.219> owner

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
4 Series it feels different as an owner

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390 
4 Series it feels different as an owner
and<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.570> matches<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> 6<00:01:05.220> Series

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and it matches in with the the 6 Series

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.420 
and it matches in with the the 6 Series
in<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> 8<00:01:05.909> Series<00:01:06.360> history<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.170> BMW<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in the 8 Series history of BMW with the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
in the 8 Series history of BMW with the
even<00:01:09.030> numbers<00:01:09.360> being<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.869> bit<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
even numbers being a bit more of a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
even numbers being a bit more of a
sporty<00:01:10.710> difference<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> idea

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
sporty difference I do like the idea

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.060 
sporty difference I do like the idea
that<00:01:12.570> they're<00:01:12.840> talking<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.320> four-wheel

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that they're talking about a four-wheel

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
that they're talking about a four-wheel
drive<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.670> rural<00:01:15.360> areas<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:15.810> that's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
drive in rural areas I think that's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570 
drive in rural areas I think that's
that's<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.560> important<00:01:17.280> rear<00:01:17.430> wheel

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that's really important rear wheel

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.749 
that's really important rear wheel
drives<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:18.000> making<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.630> rather<00:01:18.750> difficult

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
drives are making it rather difficult

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
drives are making it rather difficult
but<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> definite<00:01:21.750> contender<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
but I think it's a definite contender I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
but I think it's a definite contender I
really<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.220> absolutely<00:01:23.729> love<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
really do like it I absolutely love it I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
really do like it I absolutely love it I
think<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.810> great<00:01:25.590> looking<00:01:25.799> car<00:01:25.920> it's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
think it's a great looking car it's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.460 
think it's a great looking car it's
probably<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.470> best-looking<00:01:29.930> coupe<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.110> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
probably the best-looking coupe a that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.980 
probably the best-looking coupe a that
will<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> road<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.750> 2013

a great package from BMW very sort of
standard<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.079> guess<00:03:42.260> for<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.500> guys<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:43.099> BMW

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
standard I guess for the guys that BMW

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.039 
standard I guess for the guys that BMW
bit<00:03:43.910> like<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.090> typical<00:03:44.450> day<00:03:44.780> in<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.930> office

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
bit like a typical day in the office

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.009 
bit like a typical day in the office
producing<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:46.010> great<00:03:46.579> car<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.060> think<00:03:47.900> I'd<00:03:47.989> have

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
producing a great car I think I'd have

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.050 
producing a great car I think I'd have
liked<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.620> feel<00:03:49.069> a<00:03:49.099> bit<00:03:49.340> more<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.819> look<00:03:49.940> a

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
liked it to feel a bit more and look a

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.059 
liked it to feel a bit more and look a
bit<00:03:50.090> more<00:03:50.209> dynamic<00:03:50.540> as<00:03:51.019> per<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.319> concept<00:03:51.769> but

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
bit more dynamic as per the concept but

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.069 
bit more dynamic as per the concept but
I<00:03:52.310> can't<00:03:52.790> fault<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.239> way<00:03:53.359> but<00:03:53.569> it's<00:03:53.690> put

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
I can't fault the way but it's put

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.930 
I can't fault the way but it's put
together<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.889> what<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:55.280> looks<00:03:55.459> like<00:03:55.639> and

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
together and what it looks like and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.280 
together and what it looks like and
certainly<00:03:56.569> it's<00:03:56.690> bigger<00:03:56.870> than<00:03:57.049> I<00:03:57.109> thought

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
certainly it's bigger than I thought

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.530 
certainly it's bigger than I thought
it'd<00:03:58.190> be<00:03:58.340> for<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:58.880> replacement<00:03:59.419> for<00:03:59.480> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it'd be for the replacement for the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.080 
it'd be for the replacement for the
3-series<00:03:59.959> so<00:04:00.769> yeah<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.549> looks<00:04:01.820> like<00:04:01.970> it's

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
3-series so yeah it looks like it's

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.220 
3-series so yeah it looks like it's
going<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.299> shape<00:04:02.449> it<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.600> be<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.840> really<00:04:03.019> good

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
going to shape it to be a really good

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.559 
going to shape it to be a really good
to<00:04:03.409> keep<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:03.890> package<00:04:04.250> there's<00:04:05.090> lots<00:04:05.239> of<00:04:05.330> room

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
to keep a package there's lots of room

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.770 
to keep a package there's lots of room
here<00:04:05.599> doesn't<00:04:06.200> feel<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:07.400> enclosed<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:08.599> dash

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
here doesn't feel so enclosed the dash

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.020 
here doesn't feel so enclosed the dash
is<00:04:09.019> typically<00:04:09.379> high<00:04:09.620> quite<00:04:10.190> similar<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.790> 5

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
is typically high quite similar to the 5

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.300 
is typically high quite similar to the 5
Series<00:04:11.360> our<00:04:11.450> drive<00:04:11.659> but<00:04:12.049> for<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.709> coupe<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:13.129> it's

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
Series our drive but for a coupe a it's

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.380 
Series our drive but for a coupe a it's
where<00:04:13.459> you<00:04:13.580> want<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.790> be<00:04:13.909> you<00:04:14.090> want<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.299> be

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
where you want to be you want to be

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.910 
where you want to be you want to be
firmly<00:04:14.900> sat<00:04:15.260> in<00:04:15.379> the<00:04:15.500> car

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
firmly sat in the car

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.939 
firmly sat in the car
so<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.880> think<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.299> positions<00:04:17.720> great<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.290> it's

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
so I think the positions great and it's

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.620 
so I think the positions great and it's
a<00:04:19.100> nice<00:04:19.280> place<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.729> be<00:04:19.760> as<00:04:19.970> well<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.180> materials

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
a nice place to be as well the materials

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.590 
a nice place to be as well the materials
are<00:04:20.750> good<00:04:21.250> good<00:04:22.250> visibility<00:04:22.520> all<00:04:22.940> around<00:04:23.210> so

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
are good good visibility all around so

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.909 
are good good visibility all around so
yeah<00:04:24.050> really<00:04:24.350> happy<00:04:24.500> with<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.710> driving

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
yeah really happy with the driving

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.520 
yeah really happy with the driving
position<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.520> sat<00:04:25.940> in<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.090> back<00:04:26.120> on<00:04:26.419> 5<00:04:26.900> 9<00:04:27.139> and<00:04:27.440> my

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
position I sat in the back on 5 9 and my

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.080 
position I sat in the back on 5 9 and my
head's<00:04:27.770> on<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:27.949> ceiling<00:04:28.340> so<00:04:28.729> it's<00:04:28.940> good

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
head's on the ceiling so it's good

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.670 
head's on the ceiling so it's good
enough<00:04:29.240> for<00:04:29.360> my<00:04:29.479> kids<00:04:29.750> but<00:04:30.050> I<00:04:30.080> think<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.590> would

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
enough for my kids but I think it would

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.680 
enough for my kids but I think it would
be<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.800> bit<00:04:31.010> too<00:04:31.190> cramped<00:04:31.669> for<00:04:32.120> me<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:32.540> back

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
be a bit too cramped for me in the back

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.780 
be a bit too cramped for me in the back
of<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:32.900> car<00:04:33.139> in<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.650> main<00:04:33.830> positions<00:04:34.460> great

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
of this car in the main positions great

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.390 
of this car in the main positions great
visibility<00:04:35.449> good<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:36.169> think<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.889> real<00:04:37.100> proof

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
visibility good I think the real proof

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.219 
visibility good I think the real proof
is<00:04:37.580> how<00:04:37.789> does<00:04:37.880> it<00:04:38.000> drive<00:04:38.090> because<00:04:38.930> we're<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.080> car

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
is how does it drive because we're a car

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.750 
is how does it drive because we're a car
like<00:04:39.350> this<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:39.680> got<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.830> drive<00:04:40.070> brilliantly

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
like this it's got a drive brilliantly

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.909 
like this it's got a drive brilliantly
and<00:04:41.449> if<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:41.600> does<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.110> will<00:04:42.229> be<00:04:42.320> fantastic

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
and if it does that it will be fantastic

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.950 
and if it does that it will be fantastic
if<00:04:43.910> you're<00:04:44.090> thinking<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.330> buying<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.660> new<00:04:44.690> 4
