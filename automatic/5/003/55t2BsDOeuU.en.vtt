00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.350
 we 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.090
 I restore citroen citroen of 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.230
 collection basically from the ds I 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.520
 roll in goddess and in sm the yellow asm is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.940
 to me after I have a car 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.140
 recent a bm I should not say but 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.980
 but I still have somehow 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.370
 Secu is a goddess we love or love 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.100
 not when we love we put all his 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.290
 heart and we can not do without 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.580
 55 when it came out and we wondered 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.580
 what it was it was this UFO 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.700
 but in two words related suspension 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.670
 hydropneumatic so 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.729
 it is put in motion is put in position in 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.860
 position road so and in addition she 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.000
 had the speeds assist it was 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.950
 not an automatic gearbox but a 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.560
 speed we pass the speeds but we 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.420
 not gear so that was enough 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.310
 revolutionary a car that was rolling at 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.469
 160 170 km / h in the 50's 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.340
 it was this extraordinary for a 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.280
 everyone's gentleman's car 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.450
 that was fine so that's what has 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.409
 did the trick and then she had when 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.810
 even a boiling 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.810
 which was not we could see nowhere 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.250
 here we restore in the workshops all 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.500
 from a to z except saddlery I have a sub 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.799
 treating who comes in the workshops me 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.580
 do the series but if not beyond the 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.190
 dismounting at sandblasting at a cleaning at 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.129
 assembly body paints we do 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.110
 everything in the workshops with the request 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.379
 here we are alone we do not big 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.730
 thing so I hired a painter and 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:26.319
 then I hired a coachbuilder and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.750
 and after the mechanic is there 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.599
 soon a second mechanic and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.640
 a handyman to prepare the 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.049
 parts at least stupid all that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.410
 there are already two 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.739
 there are about ten here there are 25 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.660
 Car 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.870
 you count at least 500 hours per 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.819
 here we are redone and competition 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.709
 even more than better than 9 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.019
 it must shine it must be 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.540
 that must remain in conformity with 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.579
 the origin and do better than what 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.349
 was originally I want a team at 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.680
 complete that goes well I'm not trying to 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.630
 to have 50 people because after that it's 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.819
 con it's going to be complicated to manage in addition 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.319
 find staff it's complicated 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.750
 need passionate people who love them 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.910
 work at royan happily but 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.650
 it's still difficult what I 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.690
 do what there is to do and here I am 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.139
 do not want to make a multinational 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.139
 it's paul ii
