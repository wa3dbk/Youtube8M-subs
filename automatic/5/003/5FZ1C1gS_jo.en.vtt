the<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:32.040> operation<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.969> comes<00:00:33.270> back<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
the the operation of that comes back to

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.450 
the the operation of that comes back to
positively<00:00:35.399> charged<00:00:36.980> molecules<00:00:37.980> coming<00:00:38.309> in

the<00:00:47.460> water<00:00:47.700> comes<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> passes<00:00:48.539> over<00:00:49.020> what

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the water comes and passes over what

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.170 
the water comes and passes over what
happens<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.070> an<00:00:50.190> electric<00:00:51.949> process<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
happens is an electric process as the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.119 
happens is an electric process as the
water<00:00:54.420> comes<00:00:54.840> across<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> positive

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
water comes across with the positive

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.770 
water comes across with the positive
charge<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> negatively<00:00:57.059> charged<00:00:57.480> ones

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
charge the negatively charged ones

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
charge the negatively charged ones
they're<00:00:58.020> attracted<00:00:58.649> cuz<00:00:59.039> opposites<00:00:59.190> attract

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
they're attracted cuz opposites attract

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.380 
they're attracted cuz opposites attract
and<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.050> pulls<00:01:01.379> off<00:01:01.649> those<00:01:02.180> minerals<00:01:03.180> out

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and it it pulls off those minerals out

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.800 
and it it pulls off those minerals out
of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> water<00:01:04.470> itself<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> then

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
of the out of the water itself so then

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.330 
of the out of the water itself so then
it<00:01:06.930> comes<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.530> home<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.100> called

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it comes into your home and it's called

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
it comes into your home and it's called
soft<00:01:08.700> water<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> point<00:01:09.420> that's<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
soft water at that point that's just the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.440 
soft water at that point that's just the
basic<00:01:10.770> operation<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.030> now

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
basic operation of what it is now

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.090 
basic operation of what it is now
there's<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.990> components<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.830> system

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
there's the components in this system

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.999 
there's the components in this system
are<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.970> salt<00:01:15.240> brine<00:01:15.479> tank<00:01:15.810> which<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.680> either

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
are the salt brine tank which is either

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.670 
are the salt brine tank which is either

of this tank and it has a little
computer<00:01:24.450> head<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:24.990> top<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
computer head on top of it and it's a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.609 
computer head on top of it and it's a
little<00:01:26.250> box<00:01:26.490> looking<00:01:27.470> situation<00:01:28.470> there

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
little box looking situation there

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.200 
little box looking situation there
that's<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:29.850> taller<00:01:30.060> than

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that's about a little bit taller than

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.109 
that's about a little bit taller than
this<00:01:30.509> tank<00:01:30.810> itself<00:01:31.229> what<00:01:32.159> happens<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.790> water

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this tank itself what happens is water

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
this tank itself what happens is water
comes<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.720> fills<00:01:34.110> into<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.650> tank<00:01:34.979> that's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
comes in and fills into this tank that's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.730 
comes in and fills into this tank that's
full<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> salt<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.960> basically

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
full of salt this is just a basically

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.069 
full of salt this is just a basically
all<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.979> does<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.250> hold<00:01:38.430> salt<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.600> makes<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
all it does is hold salt and it makes a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.350 
all it does is hold salt and it makes a
mixture<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.340> call<00:01:41.520> brine<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
mixture that they call brine with the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.899 
mixture that they call brine with the
salt<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.810> salt<00:01:43.049> water<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.470> brine<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.610> pulls

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
salt with salt water is brine it pulls

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.090 
salt with salt water is brine it pulls
this<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> regeneration<00:01:46.079> process<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this off in the regeneration process and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.120 
this off in the regeneration process and
puts<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.659> resin<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.170> basically<00:01:49.890> what

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
puts it into the resin so basically what

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.880 
puts it into the resin so basically what
you<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> high<00:01:51.530> concentrate<00:01:52.530> mixture

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
you have is a high concentrate mixture

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.760 
you have is a high concentrate mixture
of<00:01:52.979> salt<00:01:53.250> water<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.759> comes<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.409> resin

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
of salt water that comes in to the resin

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.240 
of salt water that comes in to the resin
itself<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:57.060> knocks<00:01:57.329> all<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.990> also

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
itself and it knocks all it's also

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.830 
itself and it knocks all it's also
positively<00:01:59.250> charged<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.270> stronger

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
positively charged and it's stronger

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.240 
positively charged and it's stronger
than<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> calcium<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.649> magnesium<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
than the calcium and magnesium and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.740 
than the calcium and magnesium and
knocks<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.939> off<00:02:03.149> with<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.420> resin

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
knocks all of that off with a resin

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.069 
knocks all of that off with a resin
negatively<00:02:04.590> charged<00:02:04.890> resin<00:02:05.340> beads<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
negatively charged resin beads and

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.479 
negatively charged resin beads and
flushes<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> out<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.500> system<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> couple

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
flushes it out the system with a couple

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
flushes it out the system with a couple
of<00:02:08.580> different<00:02:08.910> couple<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.479> different<00:02:09.539> flushes

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
of different couple of different flushes

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
of different couple of different flushes
when<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.470> regenerates<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:11.879> that's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
when it regenerates and then that's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.730 
when it regenerates and then that's
basically<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:13.080> loop

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
basically the loop

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.500 
basically the loop
it<00:02:13.860> goes<00:02:14.040> back<00:02:14.250> into<00:02:14.490> service<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.300> once

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
it goes back into service and then once

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.180 
it goes back into service and then once
again<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:15.930> producing<00:02:16.440> soft<00:02:16.740> water<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
again it's producing soft water the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.100 
again it's producing soft water the
whole<00:02:17.340> time<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:17.790> doing<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.210> process<00:02:18.510> it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
whole time it's doing this process it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.430 
whole time it's doing this process it
will<00:02:19.530> still<00:02:19.770> produce<00:02:19.940> soft<00:02:20.940> water<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.170> as

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
will still produce soft water but not as

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.980 
will still produce soft water but not as
much<00:02:22.880> typically<00:02:23.880> when<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> guy<00:02:24.300> sets<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.930> up

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
much typically when a guy sets this up

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.870 
much typically when a guy sets this up
to<00:02:25.290> regenerate<00:02:25.770> they'll<00:02:25.980> set<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> later

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to regenerate they'll set it for a later

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.100 
to regenerate they'll set it for a later
time<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.360> day<00:02:27.510> when<00:02:27.690> they<00:02:27.780> know<00:02:27.930> they're

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
time in the day when they know they're

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.750 
time in the day when they know they're
not<00:02:28.140> using<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.770> water<00:02:28.950> as<00:02:29.190> much<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.730> you

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
not using the water as much like you

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.570 
not using the water as much like you
know<00:02:29.970> five<00:02:30.300> o'clock<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.810> morning<00:02:31.230> or

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
know five o'clock in the morning or

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.360 
know five o'clock in the morning or
midnight<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:33.420> those<00:02:33.690> timeframes<00:02:34.020> also<00:02:35.010> has<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
midnight if those timeframes also has to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.980 
midnight if those timeframes also has to
do<00:02:35.520> with<00:02:35.670> your<00:02:35.850> sleep<00:02:36.120> patterns<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:36.840> it's

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
do with your sleep patterns and if it's

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.990 
do with your sleep patterns and if it's
next<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.320> your<00:02:37.470> bedroom<00:02:37.830> or<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:38.850> that's

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
next to your bedroom or not but that's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.150 
next to your bedroom or not but that's
the<00:02:39.210> basic<00:02:39.660> operation<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.890> water

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the basic operation of the water

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.640 
the basic operation of the water
