00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.240
 Welcome to a unpacked 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:09.200
 and touched video with asked how 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.269
 science arminia 2 leaves the product name 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.240
 already some recognize a new model 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.210
 from the us series and a micro atx 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.640
 model that just now in the 2nd 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.800
 But vision is present here quite the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.849
 True, it stays less sleep 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.919
 carton a simple design a great one 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.260
 Air intake at the front and thus one 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.559
 overall, the focus is also high 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.730
 Cooling performance, notably 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.920
 Cooling power not just over one 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.989
 Air cooling can be achieved but 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.289
 although we have a micro atx housing 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.920
 There is also a lot of water cooling 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.930
 options exactly where to tour 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.710
 can be blocked and which format the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.199
 allowed to have 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.500
 I'll show you right on 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.500
 casing 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.480
 the typical wise to also has the 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.800
 keep arminia 2 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.560
 the front rounded in aluminum look 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.810
 but as usual then out 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.400
 Plastic made a big window 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.070
 that clears the view of the havel and 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.280
 back then you recognize one 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.870
 usual construction the power supply down the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.170
 mainboard here on the right sidewall 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.180
 back to the joy there we have here 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.030
 a five instructor who is easy 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.550
 to take out on pressure leaves tight 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.979
 that makes the convincing impression 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.300
 behind it then the three listed fan 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.750
 the loop straight to the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.390
 connection cable but you should otherwise 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.730
 still running around 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.700
 120 mm model a second 120 mm model 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.910
 then fits down there 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.410
 Compared to the large models saving effect 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.690
 for the here are the 140er fan 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:37.050
 so that you are a bit limited 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:42.470
 otherwise we see cover of shame 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:48.240
 actually on 140 fifth places 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.050
 I show it briefly pensions women 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.340
 they sit a little firmer 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.209
 in short step up are 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.500
 screw you look at work 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:05.400
 the wine the view on the lower part 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.310
 Of the cover they are remarkable for two operas 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:13.290
 because, of course, to understand 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.930
 0 connections so after the current 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.739
 fast connection site audio 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.540
 bushes and here a three-stage 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:27.750
 fan control that is welcome 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.380
 here behind the match then turn 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:37.620
 a dust filter so the blanket 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.810
 Fans will be nice against pollution 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.570
 protected 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.519
 140 mm model pre-assembled additionally 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.090
 here space from further 140er fan 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.180
 or else the possibility 320 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.290
 nation and her when you run 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.840
 aesthetics for the optical drives 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.090
 away so you could not be here 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.420
 only a 140 pay 200 years 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.720
 but actually mount a 360 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.910
 accommodate 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.420
 regular but most users for sure 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.230
 rather the 240s interesting here too 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.900
 nice to see 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.239
 The mounting holes as far as possible 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.330
 were moved away 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:29.880
 so that the risk of collision yes 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:31.470
 the shrub is reduced as much as possible 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.840
 just spoke 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.390
 after refer also made un 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.700
 bottom dust filter the ultimate after 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.620
 take out the back and is next to it 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.620
 accordingly easy to clean 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:52.460
 in a fallback the third 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:55.050
 formatted is likely to escalation 120 mm 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:00.450
 So again conventional from me 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.670
 size of the interior shows up as well 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.460
 the outer in familiar fractal design 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.780
 optics so nice with the black and white 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.760
 Contrast also fell the construction is it 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.430
 not surprising 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.950
 Caged here in the drive 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.990
 usual assembly planning with one 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.990
 decoupled assembly contract should be on 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.910
 values and a screw mounting for 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.910
 two and a half dollars lost coupling 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.020
 we screwed the optical 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.860
 drives without tools, however, one 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.390
 mounting the expansion card and here 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.680
 we even have one and also one 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:46.350
 vertical slot for example for a 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.590
 fan control address in this format 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:52.590
 drive cage still to notice 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.480
 one of the cage is mullah's hands 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.750
 are watching something right now 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:05.580
 fix to the first one 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:08.670
 screwdriver and leaves it all then 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.250
 also take out and poppy by 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:15.900
 then a lot of space for a long time 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.940
 Expansion card is our cage 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.080
 screwed to the ground can also 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.540
 be removed 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.720
 and then we have the second bigger one 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:30.450
 radiators place namely the 240th 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:33.840
 baritone space behind the front that is 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.400
 could be a little short of that 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.460
 So be it that you with some 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.500
 Cantons also up here on the 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.300
 optical drive criticism must also 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.820
 which fortunately screwed it up and 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:54.450
 not fixed offers so can then 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:57.750
 Also do not take it with you 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.950
 at distant drive cage still the 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.290
 one or the other has run can use 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.000
 fractal design thought of it is the 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.240
 mounting places on the back of the 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.830
 to mount mainboard rees that's us 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.200
 can really take out all the ships 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:21.540
 can still have two ssds in here so 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:24.210
 a relatively flexible housing both 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.640
 my for system as well as the 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.940
 drives 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:33.750
 that is quite positive overall 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:37.470
 on the first league is that arminia 2 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:41.970
 a typical fractal design housing with 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:45.690
 the usual inconspicuous exterior design 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.910
 At functional interior the whole just 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.330
 trimmed down on cooling performance and 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:53.220
 flexibility 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.979
 that makes it possible of course one 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.419
 convincing impression 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:59.490
 before we get here for a final 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:02.610
 Conclusion can come put us now 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.040
 of course, there is our test 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:08.270
 then in the foreseeable future had lux de 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.270
 to read
