sense<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:38.710> probably<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.220> pumpkin<00:02:39.610> spice<00:02:39.940> and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
sense it probably is pumpkin spice and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.910 
sense it probably is pumpkin spice and
I'm<00:02:40.330> not<00:02:40.480> used<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.780> eating<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.230> lot<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.620> so

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
I'm not used to eating a lot of that so

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:52.140 
I'm not used to eating a lot of that so
um<00:02:42.850> it's<00:02:43.540> good<00:02:43.900> though<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.350> really<00:02:44.740> good<00:02:51.090> mmm

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
um it's good though it's really good mmm

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.810 
um it's good though it's really good mmm
no<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.470> like<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.670> no<00:02:56.130> I'm<00:02:57.130> gonna<00:02:57.340> be<00:02:57.520> honest

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
no I like that no I'm gonna be honest

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.790 
no I like that no I'm gonna be honest
with<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.390> think<00:02:58.960> it<00:02:59.020> will<00:02:59.080> throw<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.470> lot<00:02:59.770> of

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
with you I think it will throw a lot of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.700 
with you I think it will throw a lot of
people<00:03:00.130> off<00:03:00.280> because<00:03:00.670> that's<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.900> taste<00:03:02.200> that

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
people off because that's a taste that

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.850 
people off because that's a taste that
you're<00:03:02.980> used<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.430> eating<00:03:05.310> tasting<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:08.530> like

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
you're used to eating tasting in like

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.000 
you're used to eating tasting in like
September<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.910> October<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.660> November<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.980> I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
September and October and November so I

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.390 
September and October and November so I
think<00:03:12.190> when<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:12.820> hot<00:03:13.060> outside<00:03:14.190> it's<00:03:15.190> gonna

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
think when it's hot outside it's gonna

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.510 
think when it's hot outside it's gonna
be<00:03:15.640> just<00:03:15.940> an<00:03:16.120> odd<00:03:16.420> flavor<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.380> go<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.650> right<00:03:18.280> now

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
be just an odd flavor to go to right now

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.729 
be just an odd flavor to go to right now
just<00:03:18.940> because<00:03:19.239> your<00:03:19.390> brain<00:03:19.690> associates<00:03:20.320> that

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
just because your brain associates that

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.390 
just because your brain associates that
with<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.550> later<00:03:21.790> time<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.360> year<00:03:22.570> um<00:03:23.400> but

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
with the later time of the year um but

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.680 
with the later time of the year um but
it's<00:03:24.550> very<00:03:24.910> very<00:03:25.330> good

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
it's very very good

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.020 
it's very very good
can<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.110> see<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.160> see<00:03:27.370> how<00:03:27.550> how
