well<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> tighten<00:00:26.640> treatment<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.750> laser

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
well the tighten treatment is a laser

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.950 
well the tighten treatment is a laser
and<00:00:28.710> light<00:00:28.949> based<00:00:29.279> treatment<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.689> goes

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and light based treatment and it goes

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
and light based treatment and it goes
into<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.590> skin<00:00:31.710> into<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.219> deepest<00:00:32.759> layer<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
into the skin into the deepest layer of

the<00:00:33.149> skin<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.780> does<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.260> things<00:00:34.559> when

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the skin and it does two things when

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.850 
the skin and it does two things when
it's<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.149> tighten<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's in there it will tighten up the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.369 
it's in there it will tighten up the
already<00:00:38.430> existing<00:00:38.640> collagen<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.260> can

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
already existing collagen just you can

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.470 
already existing collagen just you can
think<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> when<00:00:41.610> you're<00:00:41.730> cooking<00:00:41.940> an<00:00:42.210> egg

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
think of it when you're cooking an egg

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.010 
think of it when you're cooking an egg
and<00:00:42.750> how<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.370> white<00:00:44.370> part<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.789> egg

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
and how the white part of the egg

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
and how the white part of the egg
initially<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.230> very<00:00:46.620> runny<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:47.760> after

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
initially is very runny and then after

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
initially is very runny and then after
heat<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.629> applied<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> becomes

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
heat is applied to it then it becomes

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
heat is applied to it then it becomes
much<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.760> firm<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.960> first<00:00:52.260> way<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
much more firm that's the first way that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.139 
much more firm that's the first way that
it<00:00:52.829> treats<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> second<00:00:53.730> way<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it treats it the second way that it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
it treats it the second way that it
treats<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.989> sends<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.379> injury<00:00:55.770> message<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
treats is it sends an injury message to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.639 
treats is it sends an injury message to
cells<00:00:57.059> called<00:00:57.390> fibroblasts<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.320> those<00:00:58.500> are

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
cells called fibroblasts and those are

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.170 
cells called fibroblasts and those are
the<00:00:58.739> cells<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.070> produce<00:00:59.190> collagen<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the cells that produce collagen and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330 
the cells that produce collagen and
those<00:01:00.930> cells<00:01:01.260> begin<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> produce<00:01:01.980> more

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
those cells begin to produce more

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.429 
those cells begin to produce more
collagen<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.170> been<00:01:04.290> an

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
collagen as that as if there's been an

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.770 
collagen as that as if there's been an
injury<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> area<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.360> gets<00:01:06.570> turned

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
injury in the area and that gets turned

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.109 
injury in the area and that gets turned
on<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.290> about<00:01:07.470> 6<00:01:07.860> month<00:01:08.100> period<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.549> time<00:01:08.760> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
on for about 6 month period of time so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.890

dicing you know no pain there is a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.590 
dicing you know no pain there is a
little<00:01:16.530> bit<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.040> heat<00:01:17.729> sensation<00:01:18.060> that's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
little bit of heat sensation that's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.480 
little bit of heat sensation that's
associated<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.710> most<00:01:19.950> people<00:01:20.280> who

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
associated with this but most people who

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
associated with this but most people who
have<00:01:20.640> had<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.060> done<00:01:21.270> say<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.960> not

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
have had this done say that it's not

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.890 
have had this done say that it's not
anything<00:01:22.439> that's<00:01:22.680> bothersome<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> them<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
anything that's bothersome to them the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.590 
anything that's bothersome to them the
what<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.860> how<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> different<00:01:26.700> than<00:01:27.030> Botox

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
what is how is it different than Botox

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.330 
what is how is it different than Botox
what<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.170> doing<00:01:28.320> differently<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
what is it doing differently to the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
what is it doing differently to the
muscles<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.880> skin<00:01:30.329> than<00:01:30.630> what<00:01:30.840> Botox<00:01:31.290> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
muscles in the skin than what Botox is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
muscles in the skin than what Botox is
doing<00:01:31.770> well<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.670> interesting

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
doing well it's kind of interesting

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.780 
doing well it's kind of interesting
because<00:01:33.299> Botox<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.350> works<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.369> muscle

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
because Botox really works on the muscle

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.819 
because Botox really works on the muscle
and<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.299> stop<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> muscle<00:01:37.079> from<00:01:37.200> moving<00:01:37.500> with

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
and you stop the muscle from moving with

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.920 
and you stop the muscle from moving with
tighten<00:01:38.280> there's<00:01:38.520> no<00:01:38.729> alteration<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
tighten there's no alteration in the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.990 
tighten there's no alteration in the
movement<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.619> there's<00:01:40.799> no<00:01:40.950> falseness<00:01:41.520> about

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
movement so there's no falseness about

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
movement so there's no falseness about
the<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:42.299> someone<00:01:42.720> looks<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:44.040> does

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the way someone looks but it really does

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
the way someone looks but it really does
take<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.850> area<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.390> lot<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.810> times<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
take that area a lot of times in the
