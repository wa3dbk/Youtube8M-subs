work the only way you can get this
printer<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.630> work<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.990> reach<00:01:54.140> around<00:01:54.290> back

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
printer to work is to reach around back

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.070

and<00:01:56.320> take<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.470> power<00:01:57.680> cord<00:01:58.600> like<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:01:59.750> doing

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
and take the power cord like I'm doing

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.199 
and take the power cord like I'm doing
here<00:02:00.880> unplug<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.470> plug<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.970> back<00:02:05.000> in<00:02:05.450> and

here unplug it and plug it back in and

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.729 
here unplug it and plug it back in and
then<00:02:08.209> what<00:02:08.720> it'll<00:02:08.929> do<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.170> they'll<00:02:09.379> come<00:02:09.470> up<00:02:09.619> on

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
then what it'll do is they'll come up on

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.760 
then what it'll do is they'll come up on
the<00:02:09.830> screen<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:12.290> into<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:14.140> mode<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.379> reboot

several problems another thing I tried
was<00:03:51.079> I<00:03:51.290> took<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:52.459> HP<00:03:52.970> Officejet<00:03:53.359> Pro<00:03:54.040> 8500<00:03:55.040> a

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
was I took the HP Officejet Pro 8500 a

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.360 
was I took the HP Officejet Pro 8500 a
and<00:03:55.669> I<00:03:55.849> took<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.449> off<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:57.500> power<00:03:57.829> save<00:03:58.340> mode

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
and I took it off the power save mode

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.009 
and I took it off the power save mode
and<00:03:59.739> as<00:04:00.739> you<00:04:00.889> can<00:04:01.010> see<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:02.120> powers<00:04:02.540> that<00:04:02.569> looks

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
and as you can see the powers that looks

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.750 
and as you can see the powers that looks
like<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.319> power<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:03.709> on<00:04:03.829> all<00:04:04.099> the<00:04:04.250> time<00:04:06.760> but

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
like the power is on all the time but

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.930 
like the power is on all the time but
again<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.629> touch<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.139> screen<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:12.940> nothing

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
happens and as you can see this power

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.909 
happens and as you can see this power
button<00:04:19.329> is<00:04:20.329> kind<00:04:21.019> of<00:04:21.139> dimming<00:04:21.530> in<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.859> out<00:04:22.010> I

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
button is kind of dimming in and out I

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.219 
button is kind of dimming in and out I
can<00:04:24.919> touch<00:04:25.160> that

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.040 

and<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.710> printer<00:04:30.070> still<00:04:30.490> will<00:04:30.759> not<00:04:31.380> function

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
and the printer still will not function

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.800 
and the printer still will not function
again<00:04:35.050> anyway<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.889> get<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.280> going<00:04:36.460> let's<00:04:36.850> go

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
again anyway to get it going let's go

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:45.360 
again anyway to get it going let's go
back<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.259> the<00:04:38.440> power<00:04:38.860> cord<00:04:40.680> unplug<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.889> plug<00:04:44.370> it

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
back to the power cord unplug it plug it

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.020 
back to the power cord unplug it plug it
back<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.900> it'll<00:04:50.289> go<00:04:50.470> back<00:04:50.740> into<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.460> boot

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030
