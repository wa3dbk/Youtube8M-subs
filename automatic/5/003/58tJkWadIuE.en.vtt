what one may look like from uh you know
the<00:00:36.010> surface<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.290> um<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.969> one's<00:00:40.180> a<00:00:40.270> pretty

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
the surface and um this one's a pretty

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.709 
the surface and um this one's a pretty
basic<00:00:40.809> ravine<00:00:41.379> not<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.160> big<00:00:42.489> this<00:00:43.420> one<00:00:43.600> is

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
basic ravine not that big this one is

basic ravine not that big this one is
actually<00:00:43.870> on<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.230> surface<00:00:44.620> as<00:00:44.739> you<00:00:44.860> see

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.990 
the what it looks like you know from
above<00:01:00.219> now<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.579> can<00:01:00.940> obviously<00:01:01.270> tell<00:01:01.660> that

above now you can obviously tell that
you<00:01:04.000> know<00:01:04.120> it<00:01:04.480> looks<00:01:04.840> like<00:01:04.989> an<00:01:05.110> earthquake

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350

pretty<00:01:05.830> much<00:01:05.950> just<00:01:06.100> split<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:06.490> world<00:01:06.730> apart

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
pretty much just split the world apart

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.750 
pretty much just split the world apart
because<00:01:07.680> there's<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.800> giant<00:01:09.070> split<00:01:09.280> navik<00:01:09.580> I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
because there's a giant split navik I

you can just see how epic this is this
is<00:01:28.480> a<00:01:28.510> quad<00:01:29.020> ravine<00:01:29.620> um<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:31.080> I<00:01:32.080> mean<00:01:32.230> it<00:01:32.440> will

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
is a quad ravine um and I mean it will

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.110 
is a quad ravine um and I mean it will
it's<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.980> quad<00:01:33.280> ravine<00:01:33.550> but<00:01:33.760> there's<00:01:33.940> like<00:01:34.060> a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
it's a quad ravine but there's like a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's a quad ravine but there's like a
little<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:35.320> two<00:01:35.560> ravines<00:01:35.920> connected<00:01:36.520> by

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
little it's two ravines connected by

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.460 
little it's two ravines connected by
like<00:01:36.760> a<00:01:36.850> little<00:01:37.120> piece<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.390> land<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:37.930> I'm<00:01:38.050> just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
like a little piece of land so I'm just

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.640 
like a little piece of land so I'm just
call<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.800> quad<00:01:39.040> ravine<00:01:39.340> but<00:01:40.290> obviously<00:01:41.290> the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
call it a quad ravine but obviously the

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.260 
call it a quad ravine but obviously the
glue<00:01:41.830> stone<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.310> not<00:01:42.490> in<00:01:42.610> here<00:01:42.790> I<00:01:42.820> put<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.150> down

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
glue stone is not in here I put it down

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.000 
glue stone is not in here I put it down
so<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.450> could<00:01:43.660> see<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.870> little<00:01:43.930> bit<00:01:44.170> better<00:01:44.260> but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
so you could see a little bit better but

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.890 
so you could see a little bit better but
this<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.520> this<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.120> probably<00:01:46.420> one<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
this is this is probably one of the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.290 
this is this is probably one of the
coolest<00:01:47.140> things<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.920> if<00:01:48.340> you'll<00:01:48.880> notice<00:01:48.970> this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
coolest things and if you'll notice this

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.720 
coolest things and if you'll notice this
one<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.630> actually<00:01:49.860> underground<00:01:50.860> it's<00:01:51.160> not<00:01:51.400> um

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
one is actually underground it's not um

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.580 
one is actually underground it's not um
you<00:01:52.180> can't<00:01:52.420> see<00:01:52.600> this<00:01:52.720> from<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:52.990> surface<00:01:53.200> so

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
you can't see this from the surface so

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.910 
you can't see this from the surface so
uh<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.990> what's<00:01:56.260> going<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.560> happen<00:01:56.830> when

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
uh that's what's going to happen when

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.200 
uh that's what's going to happen when
you're<00:01:57.040> actually<00:01:57.190> looking<00:01:57.430> for<00:01:57.700> ravines<00:01:57.970> you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
you're actually looking for ravines you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.450 
you're actually looking for ravines you
might<00:01:58.360> just<00:01:58.510> you<00:01:58.690> know<00:01:58.810> wind<00:01:59.500> or<00:02:00.010> find<00:02:00.250> one

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
might just you know wind or find one

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.570 
might just you know wind or find one
randomly<00:02:00.930> while<00:02:01.930> going<00:02:02.170> about<00:02:02.320> your<00:02:02.650> day<00:02:02.830> but

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
randomly while going about your day but

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.490 
randomly while going about your day but
as<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:03.970> see<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.450> one<00:02:04.660> has<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.840> lot<00:02:05.140> more<00:02:05.170> lava

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
as you see this one has a lot more lava

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.699 
as you see this one has a lot more lava
in<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:06.370> can<00:02:07.020> split<00:02:08.020> off<00:02:08.170> like<00:02:08.379> this<00:02:08.530> one

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
in it and it can split off like this one

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.680 
in it and it can split off like this one
did<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.099> go<00:02:09.310> into<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.580> double<00:02:10.030> like

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
did and go into a double like

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.810 
did and go into a double like
so<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.130> more<00:02:12.310> than<00:02:12.370> one<00:02:12.490> ravines

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
so you can have more than one ravines

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.010 
so you can have more than one ravines
you<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.060> also<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.450> abandoned<00:02:13.990> mine

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
you can also have the abandoned mine

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.920 
you can also have the abandoned mine
shafts<00:02:14.560> like<00:02:14.710> you<00:02:15.160> see<00:02:15.310> here<00:02:15.340> on<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
shafts like you see here on the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
shafts like you see here on the
stronghold<00:02:16.930> video<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.290> saw<00:02:17.650> there<00:02:17.860> was

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
stronghold video you saw there was

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.720 
stronghold video you saw there was
strong<00:02:18.310> holds<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.210> go<00:02:19.390> into<00:02:19.600> um<00:02:20.730> so

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
strong holds that you can go into um so

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.520 
strong holds that you can go into um so
you<00:02:22.390> know<00:02:22.420> everything<00:02:22.900> will<00:02:22.990> still<00:02:23.170> spawn

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
you know everything will still spawn

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.140 
you know everything will still spawn
around<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.100> ravine<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:24.730> might<00:02:24.910> be<00:02:25.120> a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
around a ravine it just might be a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.900 
around a ravine it just might be a
little<00:02:25.450> bit<00:02:25.660> awkward<00:02:26.080> because<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.680> hole

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
little bit awkward because of the hole

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.640 
little bit awkward because of the hole
there's<00:02:27.910> no<00:02:28.030> space<00:02:28.300> for<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.900> actually<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.620> a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
there's no space for it to actually be a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.350 
there's no space for it to actually be a
de<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:30.010> saw<00:02:30.190> some<00:02:30.490> things<00:02:30.520> we're<00:02:30.940> floating
