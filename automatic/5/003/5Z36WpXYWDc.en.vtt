is<00:01:23.070> extremely<00:01:23.790> pure<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> watch<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
is extremely pure and if you watch this

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.380 
is extremely pure and if you watch this
trail<00:01:25.439> you'll<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.430> how<00:01:26.820> fast<00:01:27.090> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
trail you'll see just how fast it

trail you'll see just how fast it
evaporates<00:01:28.049> soccer<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.009> got<00:01:29.430> tired

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
evaporates soccer I got tired

evaporates soccer I got tired
any<00:01:32.010> camera<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.260> it<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:34.560> work

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
any camera can do this and it will work

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
any camera can do this and it will work
with<00:01:35.100> any<00:01:35.280> digital<00:01:35.940> SLR<00:01:36.510> where<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.260> can

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
with any digital SLR where you can

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.010 
with any digital SLR where you can
remove<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:38.040> lens<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> access<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.210> sensor<00:01:39.660> so

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
remove the lens and access the sensor so

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.230 
remove the lens and access the sensor so
little<00:01:40.320> point<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.680> shoots<00:01:40.980> you<00:01:41.700> can't<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
little point and shoots you can't you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
little point and shoots you can't you
can't<00:01:42.510> do<00:01:42.690> that<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.080> sensors<00:01:43.500> completely<00:01:44.100> see

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
can't do that the sensors completely see

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.330 
can't do that the sensors completely see
so<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.950> clean<00:01:47.790> are<00:01:47.970> designed<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:49.340> since

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
so is this clean are designed for since

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.560 
so is this clean are designed for since
our<00:01:50.580> it's<00:01:51.330> designed<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> sensor<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
our it's designed for the sensor and it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.190 
our it's designed for the sensor and it
comes<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.050> three<00:01:55.380> sizes<00:01:56.030> there<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> size<00:01:57.690> for

millimetres that's for the full-frame
sensors<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.850> also<00:02:12.030> make<00:02:12.420> another<00:02:12.750> size

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
sensors and we also make another size

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.170 
sensors and we also make another size
for<00:02:13.500> some<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.070> Fuji<00:02:14.459> cameras<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.150> the
