00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello cool people I hope you know 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 find very well on this occasion 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.680
 let's talk about a movie 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.110
 animated it's about the ribbon 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.110
 'Spongebob' a hero out of the water 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.969
 ah 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.980
 probably you have seen the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.930
 caricature of nickelodeon de 'bob 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.540
 sponge 'I personally saw it when 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.860
 It was smaller but if I find it 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.750
 on television the truth is that 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.849
 also the grandmother to see me seem 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.309
 very fun coverage and in this 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.980
 occasion we are brought this film the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.890
 cartoon taken to the big screen 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.960
 but with a new proposal that is with 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.969
 the characters in three the dimension 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.530
 living with the real world 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.769
 basically in this movie is going to 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.780
 there is a conflict and that in the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.510
 bikini bottom that is where they all live 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.659
 these characters there is no blood 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.739
 bourgeois are over the cangreburguer 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.449
 you are going to find out why they are not 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.489
 I'm going to ruin the movie but that's going to 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.710
 be the conflict that they are going to have to 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.110
 solve the characters for what 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.659
 first I would like to highlight this 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.510
 movie is that while it bears the title 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.700
 of 'spongebob' a hero out of the water 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.530
 Well, we're waiting for sponge 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.720
 that most of it out of the water but 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.670
 rather be like 20 minutes only 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.380
 out of the water as it differentiates what 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.240
 I thought and probably you 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.600
 as well 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.259
 this movie is more than anything 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.020
 caricature is an episode that can be 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.509
 to be like that of 'spongebob' which is not 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.009
 necessarily it is something negative since 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.680
 it really is a very funny movie 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.049
 that has very good jokes and what is 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.789
 Well these jokes is that they are those 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.310
 what children can understand 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.869
 adults who have some references 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.080
 contemporary that are pretty 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.229
 funny depronto references very 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.240
 americana are very gringas go from usa 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.250
 but that still turn out to be quite 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.220
 The characters are funny because 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.009
 we know bob sponja arenita patricio 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.229
 gift crab or plankton etc. follow 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.690
 being very good characters and 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.819
 obviously good we are going to have a turn 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.980
 in the movie that is going to be whatever 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.810
 interesting so if you guys 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.760
 like the hbo sponge series or if 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.410
 Have you ever liked me I think it's a 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.709
 It's going to seem very funny 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.319
 if they go under that expectation not waiting 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.150
 that is something more than what you already know 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.790
 because just this is what happens with 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.260
 this movie as I comment it does not go any further 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.659
 beyond what 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.980
 is Bob Sponja the television series but 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.930
 which is like a long episode a 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.000
 episode so to speak very 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.189
 entertaining a funny movie is 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.290
 a movie with values â€‹â€‹with very good 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.329
 jokes but that out of the moment in the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.430
 that the characters are 3d and that in fact 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.530
 it looks really good I love how they look 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.959
 the characters the texture and how 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.239
 they coexist with the human world because it is not 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.079
 more than this really me that's why this 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.489
 movie I give three stars out of five 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.739
 if you win they saw tell me how about them 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.720
 it seemed and what caricature they would like 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.819
 I made a movie and leave it here
