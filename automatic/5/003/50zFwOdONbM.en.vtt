00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.370

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.560
 years for his son jesus one 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 single euro cent so it created him 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.679
 would have existed and would have him 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.080
 we say at the volksbank of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.269
 Judea would have negotiated a good book 5 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.130
 percent interest was lost in the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.710
 we are confused by history and they find that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.230
 today this savings account when tidying up the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.210

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.519

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.449
 are only at the switch and his kite 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.080
 times interest according to loud survey into 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.520
 audience 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.559
 I hope you can get it with you 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 read the pros what do you appreciate what 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.920
 what would you do now if you have this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.760

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.850
 three ask what a steady come 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.460
 We will see millions in the second year 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.449
 Money as the world has more money sleeps 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.590
 we have it short and 20 teachers and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.890
 if she's on my old Italian 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 lira here again with something about 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.880
 old numbers forgive me the 295 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.530
 billion world globe made of pure gold 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 we 've got 1000 worries a few 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.450
 months depending on the exchange rate you like it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.000
 would like 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.439
 That's the interest rate effect of us 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.479
 everyone is underestimated because of man 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.040
 can not think of ex not exponential 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.390
 we can not think in the interest rate 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.799
 can now think in the year is we do 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.490
 the countertop line but now it will 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.100
 really exciting 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.990
 let's assume that Joseph would have been her 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.939
 son jesus always picked up the interest 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.259
 have each year equal negotiations 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.369
 just do not let the interest stop and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.869
 is picked up this time and that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.850
 put pillows and now they find 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.659
 passbook and pillow is available to them 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.920
 now available 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.509
 one euro 1 euro to 295 billion 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.759
 The world of gold is the difference 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.470
 between interest and interest rates and that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.200
 Of course, that brings me to the idea 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.460
 Incidentally, there were ancient times in the Middle Ages 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.579
 at least in the Christian 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.640
 social teaching the interest ban unemployed 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.259
 income what sin usa we look 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.329
 we are currently watching the eurozone 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.649
 the debt here it looks all around 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.850
 not better off the americans 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.630
 debt technically essential 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.130
 worse than europe 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.180
 if we look at the individual federal states 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.890
 she had addressed her 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.360
 view states in the us 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.489
 catastrophic that must now 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.959
 Thousands of prisoners fired 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.700
 for humanitarian reasons because it is not anymore 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.140
 can finance by feeding 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.330
 there will be thousands of schools 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.370
 it will be closed police 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.599
 labore sells the rate for 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.269
 us nothing for the next month yet 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.550
 The magistrates appalled the 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.709
 idea in the socialization results 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.959
 that you wanted to order that one truck 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.360
 from the Department of Defense and said 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.140
 where will we get the damage 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.760
 American city ​​have no more 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.069
 Do you still know a single steel mill? 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.480
 they are there then they have nothing 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.510
 more in the markets now comes completely 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.739
 Big bet on the bets 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.000
 to go for a bust on the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.260
 American states 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.819
 we have to think about that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.799
 Greece's total debt 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.239
 that is about 300 billion euros 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.239
 make the usa in just three months
