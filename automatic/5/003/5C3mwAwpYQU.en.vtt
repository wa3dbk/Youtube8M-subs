the bleeder valve to open and I've
twisted<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.739> line<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.750> fused<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.860> there

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
twisted the line it's fused on there

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.170 
twisted the line it's fused on there
pretty<00:00:42.220> good<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.580> I<00:00:42.610> can't<00:00:42.820> get<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.000> thing<00:00:43.150> to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
pretty good and I can't get the thing to

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.990 
pretty good and I can't get the thing to
pop<00:00:43.449> free<00:00:44.519> so<00:00:45.519> I<00:00:45.550> was<00:00:45.760> looking<00:00:45.850> at<00:00:46.090> this<00:00:46.210> one

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
pop free so I was looking at this one

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.430 
pop free so I was looking at this one
there's<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.059> little<00:00:49.329> ring<00:00:49.600> that<00:00:49.629> pops<00:00:50.140> off

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.090 

writing<00:00:53.440> here<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.879> flashlight<00:00:55.180> somewhere

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
writing here and a flashlight somewhere

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.410 
writing here and a flashlight somewhere
but<00:00:57.100> there's<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.579> little<00:00:57.760> ring<00:00:57.940> that<00:00:58.120> will<00:00:58.180> pop

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
but there's a little ring that will pop

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.880 
but there's a little ring that will pop
off<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:01.780> should<00:01:01.989> be<00:01:02.110> we'll<00:01:02.289> pull<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.680> line

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
off there should be we'll pull that line

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.090 
off there should be we'll pull that line
out<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.460> reuse<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.320> I'm<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.649> try

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
out and reuse it so I'm going to try

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.219 
out and reuse it so I'm going to try
that<00:01:07.320> before<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.770> drop<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.700> transmission<00:01:10.330> I've

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
that before I drop the transmission I've

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.450 
that before I drop the transmission I've
got<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.530> drive<00:01:11.740> shafts<00:01:12.070> out<00:01:14.160> if<00:01:15.160> they<00:01:15.340> are

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
got the drive shafts out if they are

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.680 
got the drive shafts out if they are
right<00:01:15.640> there<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.979> got<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:19.450> issue

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
with one of the little end caps of

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.339 
with one of the little end caps of
little<00:01:22.240> bearings<00:01:22.539> fill<00:01:22.750> out<00:01:22.899> what<00:01:23.080> they<00:01:23.170> think

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:23.349 
little bearings fill out what they think

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.630 
little bearings fill out what they think
I've<00:01:23.560> got<00:01:23.709> them<00:01:23.830> all<00:01:23.979> like<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:24.220> put<00:01:24.369> that<00:01:24.490> back

I've got them all like you put that back
together<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.740> don't<00:01:27.039> know<00:01:27.580> if<00:01:27.670> I'm<00:01:27.759> gonna<00:01:27.849> be

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
together so I don't know if I'm gonna be

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.900 
together so I don't know if I'm gonna be
able<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.270> get<00:01:28.390> in<00:01:28.479> there<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:30.310> pop<00:01:30.520> that<00:01:30.729> little

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
able to get in there to pop that little

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.839 
able to get in there to pop that little
pin<00:01:31.390> out<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:32.009> replace<00:01:33.009> this<00:01:33.220> line<00:01:33.459> I<00:01:33.729> don't

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:33.849 
pin out and replace this line I don't

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.370 
pin out and replace this line I don't
even<00:01:34.030> know<00:01:34.209> if<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.509> same<00:01:34.720> style<00:01:35.020> mount

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
even know if it's the same style mount

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.900 
even know if it's the same style mount
on<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.709> other<00:01:36.069> bearing<00:01:36.759> inside<00:01:37.000> there<00:01:38.910> but

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
on the other bearing inside there but

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.529 
on the other bearing inside there but
just<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.539> quick<00:01:40.660> overview<00:01:41.080> this<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.160> end<00:01:42.340> of

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
just a quick overview this is the end of

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.199 
just a quick overview this is the end of
inbound<00:01:43.539> side<00:01:43.869> this<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.910> when<00:01:45.910> you<00:01:46.000> press

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
inbound side this is the when you press

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.600 
inbound side this is the when you press
the<00:01:46.360> clutch<00:01:46.539> pedal<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:47.050> is<00:01:47.200> what<00:01:47.399> moves<00:01:48.399> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
the clutch pedal this is what moves the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.930 
the clutch pedal this is what moves the
fluid<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.920> it's<00:01:51.039> just<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:54.310> press<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.819> with

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
fluid and it's just really press it with

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.650 
fluid and it's just really press it with
one<00:01:55.090> hand

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
one hand

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.460 
one hand
I<00:01:57.360> decided<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.479> connects<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.259> pressure

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
I decided to connects to the pressure

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.979 
I decided to connects to the pressure
plate<00:01:59.770> keeps<00:02:00.369> pressure<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:01.209> it<00:02:01.360> keeps

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:01.989 
plate keeps pressure on it so it keeps

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.490 
plate keeps pressure on it so it keeps
the<00:02:02.140> clutch<00:02:02.349> engaged<00:02:03.179> so<00:02:04.179> anyway<00:02:04.539> let's<00:02:05.349> see

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
the clutch engaged so anyway let's see

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.680 
the clutch engaged so anyway let's see
if<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:05.679> can't<00:02:05.950> try<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.000> screw<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:07.420> one<00:02:07.479> up

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
if we can't try to screw this one up

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.980 
if we can't try to screw this one up
here<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.970> what<00:02:10.090> happens<00:02:10.450> if<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.720> do<00:02:10.780> this

this shut the camera down you
guys<00:02:21.180> will<00:02:21.690> see<00:02:26.870> where<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:27.900> pop<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.440> pin<00:02:28.680> out<00:02:28.890> I

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
guys will see where I pop the pin out I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.530 
guys will see where I pop the pin out I
wanna<00:02:29.370> see<00:02:29.550> if<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.850> get<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.360> break
