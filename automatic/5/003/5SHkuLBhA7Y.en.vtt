I<00:00:48.810> have<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> clone<00:00:49.980> information<00:00:54.200> Roger<00:00:55.200> Roger

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
I have the clone information Roger Roger

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.840 
I have the clone information Roger Roger
the<00:00:56.880> clone<00:00:57.480> units<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.170> attacking<00:00:58.670> send<00:00:59.670> out

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the clone units are attacking send out

complete<00:01:41.909> Pete<00:01:42.909> I'm<00:01:43.179> fine<00:01:43.869> we'll<00:01:44.289> use<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.770> MPS

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.340 

low-gain<00:01:54.830> 75%<00:01:55.830> comple<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.630> tank<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.110> being

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
low-gain 75% comple so the tank is being

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.950 
low-gain 75% comple so the tank is being
destroyed<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.580> you<00:01:59.700> want<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.090> proton<00:02:00.630> cannon

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
destroyed do you want the proton cannon

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.980 
destroyed do you want the proton cannon
to<00:02:01.290> fire<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.980> don't<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.240> proton<00:02:03.720> cannon

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to fire I don't think the proton cannon

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.540 
to fire I don't think the proton cannon
needs<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.530> fire<00:02:04.770> yet<00:02:06.800> okay<00:02:07.800> okay<00:02:07.980> order<00:02:08.460> the

how<00:02:17.070> are<00:02:17.130> we<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.550> get<00:02:17.670> past<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.090> proton

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
how are we going to get past that proton

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.920 
how are we going to get past that proton
cannon<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.410> have<00:02:20.130> an<00:02:20.280> idea<00:02:20.430> these<00:02:21.270> commander
