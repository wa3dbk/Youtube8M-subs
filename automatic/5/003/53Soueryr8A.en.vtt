people<00:02:15.030> based<00:02:15.239> Gallifreyan<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.019> now<00:02:16.590> there

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
people based Gallifreyan on now there

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640 
people based Gallifreyan on now there
are<00:02:17.430> many<00:02:17.670> many<00:02:18.120> many<00:02:18.420> different<00:02:18.840> types<00:02:19.290> of

type of gal Fran on the internet and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.680 
type of gal Fran on the internet and
it's<00:02:23.980> called<00:02:24.220> circular<00:02:24.940> Gallifreyan<00:02:25.480> or

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
it's called circular Gallifreyan or

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.630 
it's called circular Gallifreyan or
Sherman's<00:02:26.320> Gallifreyan<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.460> looks

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
Sherman's Gallifreyan and it looks

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.780 
Sherman's Gallifreyan and it looks
something<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.410> now<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.620> like<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.520> type

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
something like this now I like this type

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.240 
something like this now I like this type
of<00:02:30.820> Gallifreyan<00:02:31.540> um<00:02:32.380> because<00:02:32.710> as<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.100> see

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
of Gallifreyan um because as you can see

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.400 
of Gallifreyan um because as you can see
these<00:02:33.820> lines<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.930> kind<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.230> go

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
these lines is just kind of go

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.530 
these lines is just kind of go

don't<00:02:37.690> know<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.080> confuses<00:02:38.709> me<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.340> way

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
don't know it confuses me and the way

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.040 
don't know it confuses me and the way
you<00:02:39.550> read<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:40.300> counterclockwise

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
you read it is like counterclockwise

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.940 
you read it is like counterclockwise
around<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.830> circle<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.110> doesn't

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
around the circle and it just doesn't

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.980 
around the circle and it just doesn't
quite<00:02:45.220> make<00:02:45.430> sense<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.940> me<00:02:46.060> especially<00:02:46.209> since

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
quite make sense to me especially since

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.870 
quite make sense to me especially since
I<00:02:47.680> don't<00:02:47.709> know<00:02:47.890> if<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.100> has<00:02:48.250> changed<00:02:48.310> but

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
I don't know if this has changed but

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.570 
I don't know if this has changed but
it's<00:02:49.030> more<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.450> code<00:02:49.810> than<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.920> an<00:02:51.250> act

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
it's more of a code than it is an act

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.630 
it's more of a code than it is an act
language<00:02:52.330> um<00:02:52.800> because<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.950> uses<00:02:54.220> our

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
language um because it uses our

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.420 
language um because it uses our
lettering<00:02:55.330> system<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:56.530> adds<00:02:56.739> like<00:02:57.040> SH

you<00:03:48.580> can<00:03:48.730> see<00:03:48.910> right<00:03:48.940> there<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.540> that's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
you can see right there that that's

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.500 
you can see right there that that's
completely<00:03:50.560> different<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.970> it's<00:03:52.150> not<00:03:52.239> like

version<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.590> Gallifreyan<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.400> see<00:03:57.579> now

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
version of Gallifreyan that we see now

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.060 
version of Gallifreyan that we see now
but<00:03:58.269> it's<00:03:58.420> really<00:03:58.600> simple<00:03:58.989> which<00:03:59.650> is<00:03:59.829> an<00:03:59.950> issue

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
but it's really simple which is an issue

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.160 
but it's really simple which is an issue
I<00:04:00.250> have<00:04:00.610> with<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.239> at<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.930> same<00:04:02.110> time

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
I have with it and at the same time

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.009 
I have with it and at the same time
really<00:04:02.860> confusing<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.239> way<00:04:04.390> this<00:04:04.570> works<00:04:04.630> is

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
really confusing the way this works is

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.840 
really confusing the way this works is
the<00:04:05.200> number<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.470> lines<00:04:05.709> on<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.040> outside<00:04:06.459> along

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
the number of lines on the outside along

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.640 
the number of lines on the outside along
with<00:04:07.030> some<00:04:07.239> of<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:07.390> symbols<00:04:07.660> inside<00:04:08.410> of<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
with some of the symbols inside of the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.580 
with some of the symbols inside of the
circle<00:04:09.360> represents<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.510> consonant<00:04:11.049> sound<00:04:11.320> and

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
circle represents a consonant sound and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.319 
circle represents a consonant sound and
then<00:04:12.100> something<00:04:12.430> else<00:04:12.640> on<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.970> inside

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
then something else on the inside

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.150 
then something else on the inside
represents<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.930> vowel<00:04:14.140> sound<00:04:14.470> you<00:04:14.709> have<00:04:14.890> one

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
represents the vowel sound you have one

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.219 
represents the vowel sound you have one
consonant<00:04:15.670> sound<00:04:15.910> one<00:04:16.180> vowel<00:04:16.390> sound<00:04:16.780> or<00:04:17.049> two

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
consonant sound one vowel sound or two

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.580 
consonant sound one vowel sound or two
consonant<00:04:17.799> sounds<00:04:18.130> in<00:04:18.220> one

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
consonant sounds in one

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.680 
consonant sounds in one
sound<00:04:18.949> or<00:04:19.190> just<00:04:19.850> a<00:04:19.940> vowel<00:04:20.120> sound<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.600> those

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
sound or just a vowel sound and those

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.180 
sound or just a vowel sound and those
are<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.930> only<00:04:21.049> three<00:04:21.350> combinations<00:04:21.769> it

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
are the only three combinations it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.430 
are the only three combinations it
sounds<00:04:22.460> you<00:04:22.520> can<00:04:22.669> have<00:04:22.850> i<00:04:23.120> modified<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.410> bit

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
sounds you can have i modified it a bit

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.990 
sounds you can have i modified it a bit
and<00:04:24.590> gave<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:24.949> a<00:04:25.010> direction<00:04:25.340> when<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.699> comes<00:04:25.850> to

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
and gave it a direction when it comes to

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.580 
and gave it a direction when it comes to
sound<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.510> sound<00:04:26.750> that<00:04:26.930> comes<00:04:27.080> first<00:04:27.320> is

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
sound so the sound that comes first is

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.750 
sound so the sound that comes first is
on<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.800> left<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.280> sound<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:28.639> comes

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
on the left and the sound that comes

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.120 
on the left and the sound that comes
second<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.360> on<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.600> right<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.830> goes<00:04:30.979> in

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
second is on the right and it goes in

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.370 
second is on the right and it goes in
order<00:04:31.460> that<00:04:31.639> way<00:04:31.820> but<00:04:32.150> originally<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:32.840> doesn't

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
order that way but originally it doesn't

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.170 
order that way but originally it doesn't
have<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.190> also<00:04:34.340> just<00:04:34.760> kind<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:34.970> has

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
have that and it also just kind of has

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.530 
have that and it also just kind of has
adds<00:04:35.449> some<00:04:36.229> extra<00:04:36.260> circles<00:04:37.220> it's<00:04:37.490> fine<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:38.210> if

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
adds some extra circles it's fine and if

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.960 
adds some extra circles it's fine and if
you<00:04:39.139> want<00:04:39.380> a<00:04:39.470> second<00:04:39.830> consonant<00:04:40.520> sound<00:04:40.729> you

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
you want a second consonant sound you

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.820 
you want a second consonant sound you
use<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.479> center<00:04:41.840> circle<00:04:42.050> as<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.650> outer

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
use the center circle as the outer

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.900 
use the center circle as the outer
circle<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.669> there's<00:04:44.570> no<00:04:44.780> real<00:04:45.460> unified<00:04:46.460> way

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
circle and there's no real unified way

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.450 
circle and there's no real unified way
of<00:04:47.240> writing<00:04:47.780> because<00:04:48.260> there's<00:04:48.740> just<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.250> many

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
of writing because there's just so many

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.550 
of writing because there's just so many
random<00:04:49.850> little<00:04:50.210> symbols<00:04:50.750> like<00:04:50.930> circles<00:04:51.410> are

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
random little symbols like circles are

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.250 
random little symbols like circles are
both<00:04:51.770> vowels<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:52.700> consonants<00:04:52.910> not<00:04:53.720> just<00:04:54.020> one

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
both vowels and consonants not just one

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.490 
both vowels and consonants not just one
or<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.440> other<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.850> I'm<00:04:56.540> not<00:04:56.930> really<00:04:57.290> a<00:04:57.320> big

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
or the other so I I'm not really a big

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.200 
or the other so I I'm not really a big
fan<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:58.040> either<00:04:58.310> but<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:58.729> like<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.180> lot

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
fan of this either but I like it a lot

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.870 
fan of this either but I like it a lot
more<00:04:59.780> now<00:05:00.440> this<00:05:00.770> on<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.250> other<00:05:01.280> hand<00:05:01.610> is

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
more now this on the other hand is

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.850 
more now this on the other hand is
something<00:05:02.750> written<00:05:02.870> in<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.380> new<00:05:03.530> form

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
something written in the new form

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.400 
something written in the new form
Gallifreyan<00:05:04.490> which<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.150> came<00:05:05.570> up<00:05:05.750> with<00:05:05.780> if<00:05:06.229> you

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
Gallifreyan which I came up with if you

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.379 
Gallifreyan which I came up with if you
compare<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:07.070> the<00:05:07.250> original<00:05:07.729> on<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.060> dr.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
compare it to the original on the dr.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.610 
compare it to the original on the dr.
Scott<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.870> can<00:05:08.990> see<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.260> they're<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.410> lot

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
Scott you can see that they're a lot

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.290 
Scott you can see that they're a lot
more<00:05:09.680> similar<00:05:10.220> now<00:05:10.639> the<00:05:10.700> way<00:05:10.820> this<00:05:10.940> works<00:05:11.150> is

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
more similar now the way this works is

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.750 
more similar now the way this works is
that<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.570> number<00:05:11.750> of<00:05:11.930> circles<00:05:12.380> on<00:05:12.560> the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
that the number of circles on the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.420 
that the number of circles on the
thickness<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.389> circles<00:05:14.810> tells<00:05:15.200> you<00:05:15.500> how

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
thickness of the circles tells you how

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.830 
thickness of the circles tells you how
many<00:05:16.669> vowels<00:05:16.910> there<00:05:17.270> are<00:05:17.419> how<00:05:17.810> many

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
many vowels there are how many

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.770 
many vowels there are how many
consonants<00:05:18.470> there<00:05:18.830> are<00:05:19.010> in<00:05:19.280> what<00:05:20.150> order<00:05:20.419> they

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
consonants there are in what order they

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.990 
consonants there are in what order they
come<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:21.910> also<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.479> intonation<00:05:24.260> of<00:05:24.889> them<00:05:25.760> I

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
come and also the intonation of them I

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.140 
come and also the intonation of them I
also<00:05:26.720> streamlined<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.650> so<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:28.039> lines<00:05:28.760> are

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
also streamlined it so that lines are

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.960 
also streamlined it so that lines are
always<00:05:29.360> consonant<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.169> circles<00:05:30.830> are<00:05:31.130> always

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
always consonant and circles are always

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.690 
always consonant and circles are always
vowels<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:33.410> little<00:05:33.680> floating<00:05:34.070> circles<00:05:34.610> on

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
vowels the little floating circles on

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.180 
vowels the little floating circles on
the<00:05:34.789> other<00:05:34.940> hand<00:05:35.150> are<00:05:35.410> punctuation<00:05:36.410> so<00:05:37.010> those

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
the other hand are punctuation so those

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.100 
the other hand are punctuation so those
you<00:05:37.370> can<00:05:37.520> see<00:05:37.669> are<00:05:37.789> a<00:05:37.820> lot<00:05:38.060> simpler<00:05:38.510> and<00:05:38.810> that's

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
you can see are a lot simpler and that's

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.150 
you can see are a lot simpler and that's
because<00:05:39.260> they're<00:05:39.530> representing<00:05:39.979> something

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
because they're representing something

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.800 
because they're representing something
totally<00:05:40.610> different<00:05:40.820> from<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.330> comp<00:05:41.539> more

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
totally different from the comp more

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.510 
totally different from the comp more
complicated<00:05:42.289> circles<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.130> they're<00:05:43.250> floating

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
complicated circles and they're floating

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.550 
complicated circles and they're floating
showing<00:05:44.060> exactly<00:05:44.389> where<00:05:44.750> they<00:05:44.930> are<00:05:44.960> so<00:05:45.410> this

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
showing exactly where they are so this

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.219 
showing exactly where they are so this
one<00:05:45.800> is<00:05:46.070> a<00:05:46.130> space<00:05:46.760> and<00:05:47.060> this<00:05:47.570> one<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:48.020> an

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
one is a space and this one is an

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.440 
one is a space and this one is an
exclamation<00:05:48.500> point<00:05:48.979> now<00:05:49.849> if<00:05:49.970> you<00:05:50.060> look<00:05:50.210> again

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
exclamation point now if you look again

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.640 
exclamation point now if you look again
you<00:05:50.599> can<00:05:50.720> see<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.990> there's<00:05:51.139> one<00:05:51.380> really

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
you can see that there's one really

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.650 
you can see that there's one really
simple<00:05:52.250> circle<00:05:52.580> in<00:05:52.760> the<00:05:52.880> middle<00:05:52.910> of<00:05:53.180> this<00:05:53.300> line

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
simple circle in the middle of this line

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.170 
simple circle in the middle of this line
of<00:05:53.840> circles<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:54.380> that<00:05:54.710> actually<00:05:55.010> is<00:05:55.639> simple

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
of circles and that actually is simple

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.480 
of circles and that actually is simple
because<00:05:56.360> it's<00:05:56.720> only<00:05:56.990> a<00:05:57.200> vowel<00:05:57.440> sound<00:05:57.860> so<00:05:58.400> if

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
because it's only a vowel sound so if

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.980 
because it's only a vowel sound so if
there<00:05:58.639> are<00:05:58.700> the<00:05:58.760> three<00:05:58.970> inner<00:05:59.210> circles<00:05:59.720> inside

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
there are the three inner circles inside

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.230 
there are the three inner circles inside
of<00:06:00.139> the<00:06:00.200> first<00:06:00.440> two<00:06:00.650> circles<00:06:01.099> that<00:06:02.030> means

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
of the first two circles that means

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.600 
of the first two circles that means
there<00:06:02.599> are<00:06:02.870> consonants<00:06:03.650> involved<00:06:04.070> either<00:06:04.280> one

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
there are consonants involved either one

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.909 
there are consonants involved either one
or<00:06:04.639> two<00:06:04.910> if<00:06:05.870> there<00:06:06.020> aren't<00:06:06.229> and<00:06:06.470> it<00:06:06.530> just<00:06:06.710> means

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
or two if there aren't and it just means

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.640 
or two if there aren't and it just means
that<00:06:07.099> it's<00:06:07.220> a<00:06:07.370> vowel<00:06:07.550> sound<00:06:07.910> so<00:06:08.630> it's<00:06:09.139> really

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
that it's a vowel sound so it's really

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.890 
that it's a vowel sound so it's really
complicated<00:06:10.220> and<00:06:10.760> it's<00:06:10.940> just<00:06:11.180> laid<00:06:11.599> out<00:06:11.750> on

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
complicated and it's just laid out on

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.110 
complicated and it's just laid out on
like<00:06:12.050> four<00:06:12.380> different<00:06:12.530> pieces<00:06:12.889> of<00:06:13.130> paper<00:06:13.370> but

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
like four different pieces of paper but

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.700 
like four different pieces of paper but
my<00:06:14.330> hope<00:06:14.570> is<00:06:14.750> to<00:06:14.930> have<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.229> time<00:06:15.440> to

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
my hope is to have the time to

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.770 
my hope is to have the time to
streamline<00:06:16.250> it<00:06:16.460> make<00:06:16.610> it<00:06:16.729> a<00:06:16.789> lot<00:06:16.970> simpler<00:06:17.450> and

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
streamline it make it a lot simpler and

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.589 
streamline it make it a lot simpler and
make<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:18.860> make<00:06:18.979> more<00:06:19.130> sense<00:06:19.190> so<00:06:19.789> that's<00:06:19.970> that<00:06:20.240> I

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
make it make more sense so that's that I

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.500 
make it make more sense so that's that I
did<00:06:21.500> come<00:06:21.740> up<00:06:21.889> with<00:06:22.310> a<00:06:22.580> type<00:06:22.849> of<00:06:22.880> gal<00:06:23.180> friend

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
did come up with a type of gal friend

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.330 
did come up with a type of gal friend
and<00:06:23.960> that's<00:06:24.200> the<00:06:24.320> thing<00:06:24.560> that<00:06:24.590> I<00:06:24.800> did<00:06:24.919> and

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
and that's the thing that I did and

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.570 
and that's the thing that I did and
nobody<00:06:25.520> uses<00:06:26.000> it<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.360> hopefully<00:06:27.130> I<00:06:28.130> will

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
nobody uses it and hopefully I will

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.300 
nobody uses it and hopefully I will
actually<00:06:29.270> be<00:06:29.419> able<00:06:29.510> to<00:06:29.690> memorize

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
actually be able to memorize

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.630 
actually be able to memorize
all<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.490> symbols<00:06:30.700> and<00:06:31.090> read<00:06:31.300> it<00:06:31.560> someday<00:06:32.640> but

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
all the symbols and read it someday but

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.240 
all the symbols and read it someday but
yeah<00:06:34.210> that's<00:06:35.080> the<00:06:35.650> story<00:06:36.040> of<00:06:36.250> my<00:06:37.210> life
