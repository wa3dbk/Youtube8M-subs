00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
tandem is what it's called the turtle

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
tandem is what it's called the turtle
shredder<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:17.070> what's<00:01:17.310> known<00:01:17.549> by<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
have 2,000 HP no matter what even if

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
have 2,000 HP no matter what even if
they're<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> elder<00:01:35.820> turtle<00:01:36.180> they're<00:01:36.780> going

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
they're the elder turtle they're going

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
they're the elder turtle they're going
to<00:01:37.020> die<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.460> another<00:01:38.579> tandem<00:01:39.119> right

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to die now we have another tandem right

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.289 
to die now we have another tandem right
here<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.630> ahead<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.840> take<00:01:39.960> them<00:01:40.079> out<00:01:40.140> again

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
here we go ahead and take them out again

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.880 
here we go ahead and take them out again
now<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.360> turtles<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> turtle<00:01:43.590> island

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
now the turtles on the turtle island

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.469 
now the turtles on the turtle island
take<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> while<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> take<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.820> probably<00:01:45.299> about

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
take a while to take out probably about

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
take a while to take out probably about
four<00:01:45.810> minutes<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> regular

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
four minutes if you just go the regular

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.749 
four minutes if you just go the regular
team<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.930> definitely<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.399> turtle

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
team so you definitely want the turtle

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880 
team so you definitely want the turtle
shredders<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.020> Marines<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.409> recommend

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
shredders and the Marines I recommend

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.730 
shredders and the Marines I recommend
the<00:01:52.979> best<00:01:53.130> place<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.549> farm<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the best place to farm them is the the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.370 
the best place to farm them is the the
second<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.460> last<00:01:56.490> mission<00:01:58.939> actually<00:01:59.939> no

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
second to last mission actually no

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.090 
second to last mission actually no
probably<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> last<00:02:01.560> mission<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:04.070> low<00:02:05.070> ground

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
probably the last mission on low ground

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.789 
probably the last mission on low ground
which<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> same<00:02:06.270> place<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.719> get<00:02:06.960> smoker<00:02:07.500> i

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
which is the same place you get smoker i

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.919 
which is the same place you get smoker i
recommend<00:02:08.550> farming<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.420> farm<00:02:09.599> for

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
recommend farming there you can farm for

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
recommend farming there you can farm for
smoker<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.890> marines<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> same<00:02:11.610> time

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
smoker and the marines at the same time

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.550 
smoker and the marines at the same time
no<00:02:12.540> problem<00:02:12.840> they're<00:02:12.959> not<00:02:13.110> rare

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
no problem they're not rare

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.309 
no problem they're not rare
he<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.130> got<00:02:14.280> get<00:02:14.520> lucky<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:15.060> get<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.170> right

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
he just got get lucky to get the right

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.460 
he just got get lucky to get the right
color<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.360> global<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.660> got<00:02:19.020> him<00:02:19.110> right<00:02:19.260> away<00:02:19.380> i

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
color and global I got him right away i

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.140 
color and global I got him right away i
think<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.950> first<00:02:20.190> run<00:02:20.400> cuz<00:02:20.580> i<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.760> farming

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
pretty sure it was when it was then but

now some people of all these guys i
don't<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.330> see<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.569> point<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.900> evolving

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
don't really see the point of evolving

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.259 
don't really see the point of evolving
them<00:02:55.500> when<00:02:55.650> all<00:02:55.890> you'll<00:02:56.370> use<00:02:56.610> them<00:02:56.790> for<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
them when all you'll use them for is the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.820 
them when all you'll use them for is the
turtles<00:02:57.569> pretty<00:02:57.810> much<00:02:57.959> no<00:02:58.380> other<00:02:58.530> reason<00:02:58.769> to

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
turtles pretty much no other reason to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.289 
turtles pretty much no other reason to
use<00:02:58.920> them<00:02:59.040> we<00:02:59.459> got<00:02:59.610> an<00:02:59.670> elder<00:02:59.910> turtle<00:03:00.180> there
