00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:28.820
 we have changed the truth that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.820
 in everything you say if it's a bit 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.550
 tired 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.180
 but always interviews 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.790
 always follow first and get the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.610
 Last to the truck for the photos but 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.710
 good is part of the job is part of 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.170
 that people recognize you the work that 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.989
 you're doing and it's something that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.489
 you have to live not then only 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.839
 you have to put the best attitude for 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.839
 to do things well 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.470
 It is more than what I imagined 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:14.090
 more than what I dreamed but if 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.700
 I am clear that the present is the one 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.540
 you have to live, I 'm not going to leave it 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.869
 aside did not focus on what 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.869
 is what comes 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.079
 I think we all went serene 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.270
 because without him nobody under his arm 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.399
 we knew we had two games to 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.159
 qualify the mundialista and that was it 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.729
 that we focus and the truth that I 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 touched make places to me but the team 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.390
 good very good games 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.750
 to focus on what your job is 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.850
 be thinking all the time that you're going to 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.520
 have a possibility and one in which 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.190
 you have to put in then always be 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.140
 with that mentality it helps you in the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.490
 moments of greatest tension is when 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.490
 when you can do something right 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.129
 because there the tournament is the local tournament 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.940
 with saints make a good paper and 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.770
 get into the liguilla 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.900
 to look for another championship is the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.580
 liberators also if we want to put 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.360
 launched the name of mexico and of saints 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.450
 of course and the longest the most 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.480
 the world is far away, that is to say that if 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.519
 I'm fine things came 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.030
 as I have been doing effortlessly 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.049
 double when working the reward goes to 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.049
 arrive that is the world 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.100
 and I only have left 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.670
 focus on what the team is like 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.920
 win the scoring title that 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.790
 for one reason or another I have not 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.260
 could not be but I think with that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.990
 it would also help the team not enter 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.210
 More goals detailed 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.210
 the team is better and is working 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.870
