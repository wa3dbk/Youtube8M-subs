00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.190
 reorganizing things in a house is not as simple a task as it is 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.399
 It seems to us that we have technology help. 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.599
 how has this been to this facet life on the table so I'll tell you one 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.269
 bit to you what we can do added 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.380
 in addition to the cooker 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.339
 is a fridge with freezer is interesting today with only 8 said 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.579
 economists 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.179
 give a help yes 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.220
 interesting now is the utensil that is fundamental of these appliances 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.320
 the classic blender 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.260
 today there are other resources available to telehemes in this item 1 6 and 1 7 and 1 and so 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.000
 onwards 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.530
 We have very Brazilian games. 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.190
 that the little electric mixer a little bit more to the kitchen she is also a great 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.380
 from the north forget that question of the slaughtering direction to the 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.629
 the egg white on the average between rabat this the cake no no no 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.629
 I do not think this is more than that besides you can use 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.440
 among some recipes eg large has a market share 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.010
 making fun 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.560
 not to lose the scents and this fantastic accessory captain of her 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.770
 help until March after giving birth to this accessory you do not need 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.010
 be surfing our confrontation 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 Katy 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.430
 an interesting part of the effective system in haia o created paulo 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.120
 he says to be logic several becky fuller said hillary also said that 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.000
 you can 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.450
 on the bleachers 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.680
 remembering that if I can still do with the knife but there is something I do not have 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.360
 access and to replace the sieve already 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.480
 The ideal car is that the bigger one thinks you have time that you can usually 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.350
 materials that is already resistant to high temperatures it can 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.820
 How does this runner have a model that I love? 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.620
 who would say that it is a hand in the wheel minister but that remembrance of ct does not 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.310
 want to be a kitchen 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.760
 this one looks at you choice of standard wherever you want 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.950
 in different periods and that there is a classic 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.950
 each as exposed 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.819
 but what are our vacillations of containers with water in food 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.509
 there are several ways to show again 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.759
 I find it interesting that today 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.169
 We're rescuing those fired. 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.199
 which is healthier because it's a classic 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.910
 independent 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.990
 such as change in temperature and can contaminate food and plastics 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.989
 proposal but herself 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.239
 this is very important 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.409
 if you are not at risk of contamination then these are points 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.739
 that faces temperatures it is verified that they guide 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.610
 and if he creates himself a microwave or did not say anything here that goes 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.980
 enjoy part of under 20 that will give problem 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.620
 how will I live a September situation the intensification of focus 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.949
 is good now for what he has done said trinity among them 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.339
 children can not be missing at all 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.159
 So what do you do the dimension is going to 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.199
 according to the size of the family the last one you intend to do in 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.869
 kitchen 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.539
 The fundamental item can not be 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.309
 she adds that it is essential it has several sizes and consequently the 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.299
 our account but family 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.409
 we have 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.859
 It's a picture on twitter. 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.089
 interesting therefore 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:34.829
 and who studies that everything interferes the longer what is more 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.509
 close abortion 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.579
 but it retains moisture 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.239
 then usually housework pans 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.239
 the higher narrower landmarks 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.189
 and the other one slightly wider 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.979
 a larger area 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.889
 Lower bernasconi to check directly from food cooking 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.619
 this will make a change in the time of the collision 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:59.439
 and then what happens in those three you can already work in the kitchen 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.279
 It is a future if you have to support the milk they are not 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.279
 but we can use 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.669
 I suspect it has prb 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.570
 and I asked to get rid of CIA in CriciÃºma at a pace we have today 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.180
 as well as his Dutch coach 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.150
 in a pan that is very special already identifies 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
 have already been opened 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.369
 what are the fundamental points of faith in democracy, why can it 

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:35.889
 become so essential in the kitchen 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.350
 first with the pressure 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.779
 you get speed on the correction I think I can do that already 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:43.639
 You had a salary increase. 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.689
 Now we know it's going to have to save a lot of time. 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.309
 second 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.309
 an important element the much thicker version 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.990
 then in that story if I have not 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.560
 art pot to make a song with the pressure cooker I can already put 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.120
 one that is a little bigger 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.229
 make a bed that if the cover will not put pressure 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.289
 and if I go to prepare the ford prepare a shower 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.180
 I need a pan that has a larger thickness no longer glues 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.409
 I can use a pressure cooker too, so she ends up lending a hand to the 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.409
 wheel was from several sources 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.689
 another tip came from the middle of the stabbing group of the cutlery is not 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.689
 doubt that 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.860
 I hope to do well 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.150
 here you can buy a complete game 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.790
 but a knife that is essential the first one you can see here 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.749
 I'll have to use a lot of bread knife. 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:50.099
 and it's always good to have a small daughter 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:55.490
 disasters are 36 vacancies now if you can buy games otherwise by 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.910
 less has this experience 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.199
 and another interesting thing, but we can move forward a little bit 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.530
 are three key elements to rice austria 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:05.919
 It's going to be a war. 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.089
 and warmth 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.669
 the aggressors expect nothing 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.860
 thank you stew the show with the beans without agreement 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.479
 so my importance I love the wire whisk 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.080
 also stated that the plague too fundamentally cut 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.350
 during the difficult course imagine 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.350
 in the new format 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:33.990
 by walking through this supposed 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.290
 - we found the porridge two well-cut prouni items sometimes 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.839
 the two meet and two in a row 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.740
 over two-bottle can opener 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.340
 you can buy the one that combines comfort I repeat I do not have with the 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.569
 orkut as fundamental a corkscrew
