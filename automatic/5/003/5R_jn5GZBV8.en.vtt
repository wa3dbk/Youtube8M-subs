00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.159 
far as materials and craftsmanship and
the<00:00:25.800> factory<00:00:26.220> environment<00:00:26.630> with<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.839> board

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
the factory environment with this board

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.620 
the factory environment with this board
we<00:00:28.529> wanted<00:00:29.159> to<00:00:29.189> try<00:00:29.579> to<00:00:29.609> make<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.179> more<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
we wanted to try to make one more to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.020 
we wanted to try to make one more to
showcase<00:00:31.259> some<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> elements<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.879> we're

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
showcase some of the elements that we're

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.610 
showcase some of the elements that we're
doing<00:00:33.120> things<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.989> bring<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> table

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
doing things that we can bring the table

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.880 
doing things that we can bring the table
and<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:36.180> put<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> lot<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:37.530> different

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and so we put a lot of the different

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
and so we put a lot of the different
components<00:00:38.039> here<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.359> the<00:00:39.629> same

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
components here then to the same

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.069 
components here then to the same
construction<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.679> have<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.190> reforestation

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079

beeswax modified centered speed base and

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.350 
beeswax modified centered speed base and
basically<00:01:05.190> it's<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.790> ninety-five

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
basically it's you know ninety-five

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
basically it's you know ninety-five
percent<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.440> whole<00:01:07.650> black<00:01:08.010> parts

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
percent because the whole black parts

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.150 
percent because the whole black parts
recycled<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:09.870> clear<00:01:10.080> part<00:01:10.410> is

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
recycled and then the clear part is

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.120 
recycled and then the clear part is
what's<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.390> recycled<00:01:13.010> about<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
what's you know not recycled about the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.960 
what's you know not recycled about the
materials<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.730> go<00:01:14.910> into<00:01:15.090> each<00:01:15.420> other<00:01:16.790> doc<00:01:17.790> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
materials that go into each other doc it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.960 
materials that go into each other doc it
in<00:01:18.090> each<00:01:18.240> other<00:01:18.450> well<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
in each other well so we do that and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.860 
in each other well so we do that and
then<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.170> carbon<00:01:22.830> fiber<00:01:22.980> stringers

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
then there's a carbon fiber stringers

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.890 
then there's a carbon fiber stringers
the<00:01:24.870> board<00:01:25.260> started<00:01:25.950> off<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.490> cam<00:01:27.390> bird<00:01:27.630> park

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the board started off as cam bird park

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.500 
the board started off as cam bird park
board<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> demand<00:01:30.300> for

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
board and because of the demand for

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.090 
board and because of the demand for
reversing<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.080> more<00:01:31.230> flat<00:01:31.440> cake<00:01:31.680> stuff<00:01:31.920> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
reversing a more flat cake stuff we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.780 
reversing a more flat cake stuff we
offer<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.580> in<00:01:33.290> both<00:01:34.290> options<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.160> there's<00:01:35.430> the

on this board the x axis beneath and we

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.210 
on this board the x axis beneath and we
use<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.420> polyurethane<00:02:17.420> resin<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.440> these<00:02:18.980> boards

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
use a polyurethane resin on these boards

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.740 
use a polyurethane resin on these boards
it's<00:02:19.520> kind<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.790> unique<00:02:19.940> because<00:02:20.330> that

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
it's kind of unique because that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.860 
it's kind of unique because that
requires<00:02:22.000> what<00:02:23.000> has<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> lower

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
requires what has like a lower

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.080 
requires what has like a lower
consumption<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.620> energy<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:25.190> it's<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:25.970> a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
consumption of energy and it's just a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.970 
consumption of energy and it's just a
little<00:02:26.330> bit<00:02:26.510> better<00:02:27.320> in<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.590> factory

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
little bit better in the factory
