00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.390 
they look to be an improved team from
last<00:01:31.890> year<00:01:32.370> and<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:33.570> think<00:01:33.810> they've<00:01:34.400> they've

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
last year and I think they've they've

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.200 
last year and I think they've they've
had<00:01:35.580> two<00:01:35.730> good<00:01:35.910> results<00:01:36.360> obviously<00:01:36.870> and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
had two good results obviously and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.250 
had two good results obviously and
they'll<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> team<00:01:39.630> becomes<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
they'll be a team becomes of the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.780 
they'll be a team becomes of the
confidence<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.190> playing<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:41.580> I<00:01:41.610> think

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
confidence they be playing well I think

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.020 
confidence they be playing well I think

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
something is going to be a hard team to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.110 
something is going to be a hard team to
beat<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.280> most<00:01:53.460> important<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:53.970> us<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120
