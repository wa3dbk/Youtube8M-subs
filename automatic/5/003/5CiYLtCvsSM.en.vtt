00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 markus has recently started his sport 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:10.250
 changed like an extra now as 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.250
 Sagittarius is what we see now 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.390
 how long are you making yourself a nice one 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.939
 shoot a bow 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:29.020
 about half a year are the successes 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:34.580
 normal or others actually 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.860
 above average my name is 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.750
 series but I am at 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.750
 olympics center set as 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.890
 Has developed a nice circle 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.800
 closed 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.559
 his last competition was both from 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.559
 the technical development pay her 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.600
 he only made half a year and for that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:16.070
 sees that as well as the sporty one 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:19.289
 attitude requires what force 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 Moving experience brings that 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.000
 corrections actually faster 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.100
 arrive 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.080
 shouldered a bit wisely that is 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:33.600
 the thing back there, yes, as my own 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.600
 team achieved or not so good 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.930
 so already different years so 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.880
 really do not really think so 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 either everything right, wrong 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.100
 strength is actually 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.450
 get through 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.220
 So most of the strengths on each 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.190
 case our training hardworking conceivable 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.750
 the matter also takes appropriate anxiety 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.760
 would have a blatant weakness is 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.360
 so be silent when the character 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.470
 niche area or 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.470
 in the field very difficult 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.620
 Once technology would not be one now 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.250
 So stable has found rhythm 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.230
 partly still too long in the office is called 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.530
 relented with us in the target process 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.790
 and this is a long time that something 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.650
 move more determined 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.269
 how important is this rhythm of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.200
 Rhythm is very important to you 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.190
 practically 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.140
 a certain element and that one 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.239
 his withdrawal so if you have the short 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.980
 before deciding now i can 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.620
 Send a lot should that possible 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.900
 always from the same point of the abstract and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.810
 always in a certain same 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 time sequence do not happen with him 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 reaction or tension come in 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.510
 the longer you get where you feel light 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.880
 getting harder 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.769
 that is more powerful a potentially 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.040
 more tension in the game is to 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.180
 harder in just as evenly 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.209
 to send on the journey 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.010
 a while shooting 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.670
 actually a good progress 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.400
 my material has turned out too 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.160
 improved and that worked out for me 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.630
 also in competitions 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:27.310
 that I compete in the last one 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.810
 have become the third and second, that 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.739
 the last match was 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.739
 circular championship 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:48.349
 passage after 60 second and then after 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:51.129
 the final everything 18 meters and then are 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.129
 three matches 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.980
 but usually with new celebrations can also 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.880
 to open up 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.060
 what was a bigger competition? 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.060
 this year that was 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.960
 actually when I started it 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.100
 was out to the outside 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.190
 60 meters 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.820
 that's exactly what i was with russia 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.390
 is there anything else this year? 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:27.530
 this year are 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:28.510
 after which I join them 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.280
 can shoot 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:37.660
 18 meters it is never seen alone 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.660
 18 meters only shoots on friday 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.069
 I'll be there on Saturday 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.610
 thon judges chemnitz and am 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.610
 sunday finally 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.380
 as there is no age I distinguish 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.840
 Actually do not expect much because you 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.880
 say that from four nations 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.610
 there are not enough protectors and 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.420
 think 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.409
 I will not come in the end 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.050
 that still has 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:13.480
 not only very few managed 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.290
 dix on sunday yes the saints there 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.210
 I shoot with it 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.320
 there you can 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.600
 win a series 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.550
 there are internationally advertised 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.540
 train which are adult where you 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.310
 To start an athlete is easy in the 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.840
 to gain experience and competitive experience 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.910
 maybe also to be there because 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.760
 Well-known athletes are on the line 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.430
 you want to be great 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.280
 tournament more than 20 people 500 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.960
 getting together is something special 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.820
 Actually, that does not matter if I am 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.460
 now that can win a trophy front 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.200
 but like me with myself 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.940
 guaranteed for me to apply and 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.920
 as a competitive experience and as 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.920
 additional medcup about the better 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.800
 Team but still only release like yourself 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.760
 so no competitions 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.290
 so I never really me 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.290
 determined it has turned out so 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.690
 training alone is not like that for me 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.020
 my thing and yes there has been too 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.020
 Not 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.250
 when are you just left ? 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.430
 make history 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:26.710
 yes, it has been like this before two three 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.510
 weeks revealed that 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.390
 makes it very fun here 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:34.590
 if you meet that too 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.590
 really makes a lot of fun 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.550
 the st 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.790
 I would like to have a lot of fun and fun 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.210
 Next year there is a target so 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.210
 cold 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.540
 280 to close 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.750
 60 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.550
 now I am at 279 2 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.570
 yourself 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.570
 that would 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.390
 first success experiences have in it 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.400
 not long in coming 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.340
 and of course we hope so 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.170
 continues for him and the same 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.450
 Separation of his old sport has 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.450
 namely the sound was worth it
