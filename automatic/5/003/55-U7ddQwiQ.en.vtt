00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.300 
today I'm going to be talking about back
clipping<00:00:04.259> it's<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.650> real<00:00:04.799> gonna<00:00:04.980> be<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> real

clipping it's a real gonna be a real
quick<00:00:05.460> video<00:00:05.810> back<00:00:06.810> clipping<00:00:07.080> what

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
quick video back clipping what

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.799 
quick video back clipping what
backflipping<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.429> why<00:00:08.670> cannot<00:00:09.300> do<00:00:09.660> it

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
backflipping is and why cannot do it

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.810 
backflipping is and why cannot do it
okay<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.679> back<00:00:10.889> clipping<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.490> our<00:00:11.610> previous

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
okay so back clipping so in our previous

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.070 
okay so back clipping so in our previous
video<00:00:12.150> we<00:00:12.330> went<00:00:12.360> over<00:00:13.190> I'm<00:00:14.190> clipping<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.269> I'm

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
video we went over I'm clipping and I'm

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.120 
video we went over I'm clipping and I'm
clipping<00:00:16.410> how<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.949> should<00:00:17.130> work<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:18.920> is<00:00:19.920> when

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
clipping how that should work is is when

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.630 
clipping how that should work is is when
you're<00:00:20.220> clipping<00:00:20.750> you<00:00:21.750> want<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.710> rope<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
you're clipping you want the rope so

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.670 
you're clipping you want the rope so
here's<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.720> rope<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.080> my<00:00:25.199> harness

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
here's the rope to my harness

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.939 
here's the rope to my harness
okay<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.029> side<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.689> my<00:00:27.779> harness<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.710> want

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
okay this side is to my harness you want

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.550 
okay this side is to my harness you want
the<00:00:29.189> rope<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> direction<00:00:30.720> where<00:00:31.260> if

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the rope to be in a direction where if

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.340 
the rope to be in a direction where if
you're<00:00:31.800> climbing<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.390> now<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> let's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
you're climbing up so now I let's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.530 
you're climbing up so now I let's
imagine<00:00:34.710> I'm<00:00:34.950> climbing<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
imagine I'm climbing up up up and the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.819 
imagine I'm climbing up up up and the
rope<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.290> gonna<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.640> free<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.410> carabiner

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
rope is it's gonna be free the carabiner

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.720 
rope is it's gonna be free the carabiner
is<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.750> basically<00:00:42.750> almost<00:00:43.730> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
is going to be basically almost it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
is going to be basically almost it's
there's<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.719> least<00:00:45.870> amount<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.200> friction<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
there's a least amount of friction and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.670 
there's a least amount of friction and
twisting<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.539> draw<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
twisting of the of the draw and as I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.970 
twisting of the of the draw and as I
climb<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.460> gonna<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:51.860> just<00:00:52.860> gonna

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
climb up it's just gonna be just gonna

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.380 
climb up it's just gonna be just gonna
be<00:00:53.039> passing<00:00:53.219> through<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.030> there's<00:00:54.180> no

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
be passing through there and there's no

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
be passing through there and there's no
twisting<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.530> draw

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
twisting of the draw

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.060 
twisting of the draw
what<00:00:56.579> bat<00:00:56.850> clipping<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.620> went<00:00:58.800> over

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
what bat clipping is so we went over

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.070 
what bat clipping is so we went over
let's<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.640> from<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.149> darkness<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.930> clip<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
let's see so from my darkness I clip and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.039 
let's see so from my darkness I clip and
and<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.450> orientation

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and now it's it's in the orientation

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.429 
and now it's it's in the orientation
where<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.640> draw<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.180> twisting<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
where the the draw is not twisting and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.370 
where the the draw is not twisting and
I'm<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.010> climbing<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.869> good

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I'm just climbing up and it's all good

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.480 
I'm just climbing up and it's all good
what<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.159> clipping<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.189> were<00:01:17.369> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
what back clipping is is is if I were to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.149 
what back clipping is is is if I were to
inadvertently

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
inadvertently

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.300 
inadvertently
clip<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.790> where<00:01:20.970> okay<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
clip to where okay so this is this is so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
clip to where okay so this is this is so
let's<00:01:23.700> say<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> good<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> my

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
let's say this is good this is to my

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
let's say this is good this is to my
harness<00:01:24.960> okay<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.830> isn't<00:01:25.950> my<00:01:26.100> harness<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
harness okay this isn't my harness and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.969 
harness okay this isn't my harness and
this<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.780> rope<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.259> below<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
this is the the rope going below this is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.210 
this is the the rope going below this is
good<00:01:29.220> let's<00:01:29.939> say<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.479> was<00:01:30.860> opposite<00:01:31.860> let's<00:01:32.070> say

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
good let's say it was opposite let's say

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.569 
good let's say it was opposite let's say
there's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.579> twist<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:34.100> okay<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.159> there's<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
there's a twist in it okay so there's a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.399 
there's a twist in it okay so there's a
twist<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.869> actually

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
twist and I actually

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.149 
twist and I actually
and<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> rope<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.390> harness<00:01:39.720> is

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
and now the rope to my harness is

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.929 
and now the rope to my harness is
actually<00:01:41.659> between<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.979> carabiner<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
actually between the carabiner and the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.219 
actually between the carabiner and the
rock<00:01:45.180> that's<00:01:45.750> not<00:01:46.079> good<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.369> go<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:48.229> when

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
rock that's not good so as I go up when

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.719 
rock that's not good so as I go up when
it's<00:01:49.740> twisting<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.390> draw<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.549> were<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it's twisting the the draw if it were to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.920 
it's twisting the the draw if it were to
be<00:01:53.880> free<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.290> now<00:01:56.689> twist<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
be free so it's actually now twist is

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.090 
be free so it's actually now twist is
actually<00:01:58.350> putting<00:01:58.649> pressure<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.250> on<00:02:01.100> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
actually putting pressure on on the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.399 
actually putting pressure on on the
carabiner<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> twist<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.329> that's<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:04.140> good

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
carabiner to twist and that's not good

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
carabiner to twist and that's not good
so<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.159> keep<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:06.420> can

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
so now if I keep going up what can

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.170 
so now if I keep going up what can
happen<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:08.509> if<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.780> fall<00:02:10.370> that<00:02:11.370> rope<00:02:11.790> can

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
happen is if I fall that rope can

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.400 
happen is if I fall that rope can
actually<00:02:12.629> go

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
actually go

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.800 
actually go
against<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.770> caribiner<00:02:14.510> against<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.630> gate

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
against the caribiner against the gate

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.040 
against the caribiner against the gate
and<00:02:16.110> come<00:02:16.830> undone

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
and come undone

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.250 
and come undone
so<00:02:19.050> that's<00:02:19.320> backflipping<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.220> again<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
so that's backflipping so again this is

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.590 
so that's backflipping so again this is
the<00:02:22.350> draw<00:02:22.560> hanging<00:02:23.010> hanging<00:02:23.310> correctly<00:02:23.970> and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
the draw hanging hanging correctly and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.110 
the draw hanging hanging correctly and
you<00:02:24.900> clip<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.530> you're<00:02:26.010> climbing<00:02:26.220> up<00:02:26.550> this

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
you clip in and you're climbing up this

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.330 
you clip in and you're climbing up this
is<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.750> good<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.500> all<00:02:28.680> good<00:02:28.890> all<00:02:29.070> doing

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
is all good this is all good all doing

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.280 
is all good this is all good all doing
all<00:02:29.520> good<00:02:29.730> okay<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:31.140> just

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
all good okay so it's just it's just

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.970 
all good okay so it's just it's just
freely

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
freely

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.820 
freely
there's<00:02:32.280> no<00:02:32.460> twisting<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.270> carabiner<00:02:33.900> but

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
there's no twisting of the carabiner but

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.740 
there's no twisting of the carabiner but
let's<00:02:35.700> say<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.880> were<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.300> accidentally<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:38.070> is

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
let's say I were to accidentally this is

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.650 
let's say I were to accidentally this is
this<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.020> my<00:02:40.110> harness<00:02:40.340> instead<00:02:41.340> of

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
this is to my harness instead of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.550 
this is to my harness instead of
clipping<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.870> all<00:02:43.020> good

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
clipping it all good

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.830 
clipping it all good
I<00:02:43.590> accidentally<00:02:44.340> clip<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.760> backwards<00:02:45.450> back

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
I accidentally clip in backwards back

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.550 
I accidentally clip in backwards back
flipping<00:02:46.700> now<00:02:47.700> when<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> climb<00:02:48.270> up<00:02:48.560> it's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
flipping now when I climb up it's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.760 
flipping now when I climb up it's
causing<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.160> twist<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.790> causing<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.140> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
causing this twist is causing the the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.550 
causing this twist is causing the the
carabiner<00:02:53.220> gate<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.730> face<00:02:54.000> outward<00:02:54.300> more<00:02:54.960> it's

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
carabiner gate to face outward more it's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.820 
carabiner gate to face outward more it's
not<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.730> not<00:02:56.940> good<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.510> again<00:02:58.290> when<00:02:58.710> you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
not this is not good and again when you

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.720 
not this is not good and again when you
fall<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.670> just<00:02:59.820> fall<00:03:00.000> right<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:01.610> guess<00:03:02.610> I

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
fall you can just fall right I guess I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.030 
fall you can just fall right I guess I
can't<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:04.080> can't<00:03:04.320> simulate<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.740> but<00:03:04.830> they<00:03:04.890> can

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
can't you can't simulate it but they can

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.690 
can't you can't simulate it but they can
you<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.460> fall<00:03:05.670> right<00:03:05.940> out<00:03:07.490> okay

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
you can just fall right out okay

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.850 
you can just fall right out okay
so<00:03:09.150> that's<00:03:09.330> what<00:03:09.480> bad<00:03:09.630> clipping<00:03:09.960> is<00:03:10.080> guys<00:03:10.350> so

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
so that's what bad clipping is guys so

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.880 
so that's what bad clipping is guys so
so<00:03:11.610> dope<00:03:11.820> back<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.300> okay

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
so dope back to it okay

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.490 
so dope back to it okay
