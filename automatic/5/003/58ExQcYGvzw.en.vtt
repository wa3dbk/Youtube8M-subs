00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
put this roughly with a stock muffler

put this roughly with a stock muffler
was<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.160> then<00:01:25.340> run<00:01:25.990> just<00:01:26.990> pipes<00:01:27.290> back<00:01:27.590> two<00:01:27.920> and

a half inch pipes back from the muffler
without<00:01:30.500> resonators<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.670> should<00:01:31.880> give<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.150> a

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
without resonators it should give it a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.510 
without resonators it should give it a
nice<00:01:32.420> nice<00:01:33.229> low<00:01:33.470> sound<00:01:33.860> hopefully<00:01:34.250> not<00:01:34.400> too

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
nice nice low sound hopefully not too

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.460 
nice nice low sound hopefully not too
much<00:01:34.640> drone<00:01:34.940> but<00:01:35.180> we'll<00:01:35.330> see<00:01:35.510> once<00:01:35.720> it<00:01:35.869> gets

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
much drone but we'll see once it gets

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.930 
much drone but we'll see once it gets
installed<00:01:37.960> okay<00:01:38.960> well<00:01:39.860> this<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.520> next<00:01:40.759> day

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
installed okay well this is the next day

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.240 
installed okay well this is the next day
and<00:01:41.210> these<00:01:41.840> are<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.380> stock<00:01:42.619> parts<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.220> I

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
and these are the stock parts that I

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.090 
and these are the stock parts that I
pulled<00:01:43.550> off<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.060> by<00:01:45.050> 2010<00:01:45.590> challenger

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
pulled off of the by 2010 challenger

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.040 
pulled off of the by 2010 challenger
this<00:01:46.490> right<00:01:46.790> here<00:01:46.970> here's<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.930> original

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
this right here here's the original

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.020 
this right here here's the original
muffler<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.930> went<00:01:50.930> on<00:01:51.020> back<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:52.030> this

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
muffler and went on back to this

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.330 
muffler and went on back to this
resonator<00:01:53.540> here<00:01:53.830> it's<00:01:54.830> kind<00:01:55.009> of<00:01:55.040> funny<00:01:55.220> the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
resonator here it's kind of funny the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.150 
resonator here it's kind of funny the
resonator<00:01:55.759> is<00:01:55.940> uh<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.990> probably<00:01:57.350> larger<00:01:57.890> than

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
resonator is uh is probably larger than

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.810 
resonator is uh is probably larger than
the<00:01:58.670> muffler<00:01:59.110> it's<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.410> pretty<00:02:01.130> heavy<00:02:01.340> hefty

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
the muffler it's a pretty heavy hefty

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.020 
the muffler it's a pretty heavy hefty
resonator<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:04.340> sound<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.789> it<00:02:04.940> was

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
resonator and the sound that it was

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.660 
resonator and the sound that it was
blocking<00:02:05.479> is<00:02:05.710> pretty<00:02:06.710> loud<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:06.920> rumbly<00:02:07.460> it

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
blocking is pretty loud and rumbly it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.300 
blocking is pretty loud and rumbly it
sounds<00:02:08.030> great<00:02:08.330> without<00:02:08.510> it<00:02:09.040> it's<00:02:10.040> a<00:02:10.100> little

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
sounds great without it it's a little

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.830 
sounds great without it it's a little
windy<00:02:10.429> let's<00:02:10.760> see<00:02:11.000> if<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.299> go<00:02:11.390> get<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.600> sound

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
windy let's see if we can go get a sound

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.960 
windy let's see if we can go get a sound
clip<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.320> take<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:12.830> look<00:02:13.010> at<00:02:13.130> what<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.700> got<00:02:13.880> in

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
clip and take a look at what you got in

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:30.160 
clip and take a look at what you got in
the<00:02:14.060> back<00:02:15.970> pretty<00:02:16.970> windy

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.290 

detection<00:02:31.170> accuracy<00:02:32.000> skydiver<00:02:33.000> still

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
detection accuracy skydiver still

00:02:33.300 --> 00:03:21.460 
detection accuracy skydiver still
impressive<00:02:33.630> yes

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.930 

all<00:03:22.470> right<00:03:22.620> we're<00:03:22.830> gonna<00:03:22.920> start<00:03:23.280> her<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.370> soon

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
all right we're gonna start her up soon

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.940 
all right we're gonna start her up soon
it<00:03:24.030> sounds<00:03:24.270> like<00:03:24.360> from<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.600> inside<00:03:24.980> ready<00:03:30.950> not

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
it sounds like from the inside ready not

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:49.650 
it sounds like from the inside ready not
too<00:03:32.100> bad

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.490 

right<00:03:50.230> there<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.560> 3s<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.250> lot<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.730> drone<00:03:52.500> in

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
right there in the 3s a lot of drone in

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.140 
right there in the 3s a lot of drone in
the<00:03:53.650> fourth<00:03:53.920> gear<00:03:54.160> Gilad<00:03:54.580> ran<00:03:54.790> right<00:03:54.970> into

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
the fourth gear Gilad ran right into

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.050 
the fourth gear Gilad ran right into
three<00:03:55.390> thousands

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.880 

it's<00:03:58.480> bearable<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:59.140> mean<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.620> don't<00:03:59.710> really

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
it's bearable I mean you don't really

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.330 
it's bearable I mean you don't really
sit<00:04:00.280> on<00:04:00.430> 3,000<00:04:01.120> too<00:04:01.210> often<00:04:01.680> in<00:04:02.680> here<00:04:03.130> right<00:04:03.310> now

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
sit on 3,000 too often in here right now

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.560 
sit on 3,000 too often in here right now
we're<00:04:04.030> sitting<00:04:05.370> 1,700<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.550> it's<00:04:07.090> really<00:04:07.390> not

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
we're sitting 1,700 and it's really not

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.500 
we're sitting 1,700 and it's really not
not<00:04:07.990> bad<00:04:08.260> at<00:04:08.410> all
