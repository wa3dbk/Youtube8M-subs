are no accessories this is a test unit
and<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.640> thickness<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.770> 10.8<00:01:13.770> millimeters

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and the thickness is 10.8 millimeters

just<00:02:46.380> like<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> e4<00:02:47.490> model<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.420> basically

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
just like on the e4 model and basically

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.870 
just like on the e4 model and basically
the<00:02:48.990> changes<00:02:49.380> here<00:02:49.590> involved<00:02:50.130> slight<00:02:50.460> design

one gigabyte of RAM
just<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.950> e4<00:02:56.520> ABO<00:02:57.420> bytes<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.780> storage

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
because I shuddered at the phone for

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.930 
because I shuddered at the phone for
selfies<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.420> we<00:03:06.900> have<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.350> back<00:03:07.770> 5<00:03:08.220> megapixel

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
case we got a mali t760 MP 2 the e4 had

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.550 
case we got a mali t760 MP 2 the e4 had
a<00:03:34.440> Mali<00:03:34.740> 400<00:03:35.370> MP<00:03:35.730> 2<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.600> build<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.020> also<00:03:37.350> better

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
a Mali 400 MP 2 the build is also better

this<00:03:37.770> model<00:03:38.070> feels<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.310> bit<00:03:38.459> solid<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.060> just

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
this model feels a bit solid and just

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.650 
this model feels a bit solid and just
like<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.170> e4<00:03:40.620> its<00:03:41.060> back<00:03:42.060> side<00:03:42.270> of<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.480> case

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
like the e4 its back side of the case

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.900 
like the e4 its back side of the case
feels<00:03:42.990> like<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.200> bumper<00:03:43.800> around<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.430> body<00:03:44.670> of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
feels like a bumper around the body of

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.560 
feels like a bumper around the body of
the<00:03:45.030> device<00:03:45.180> ok<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.590> better<00:03:47.130> build<00:03:47.459> LT<00:03:48.000> another

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
the device ok so better build LT another

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.000 
the device ok so better build LT another
processor<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.290> that's<00:03:49.410> basically<00:03:49.890> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
processor and that's basically the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.760 
processor and that's basically the
upgrades<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.600> G<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:52.320> one<00:03:52.530> here

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
upgrades that we for G this one here

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.610 
upgrades that we for G this one here
brings<00:03:53.070> from<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.550> e4<00:03:54.120> as<00:03:54.840> usual<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.380> want<00:03:55.500> to

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
brings from the e4 as usual I want to

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.980 
brings from the e4 as usual I want to
have<00:03:55.800> a<00:03:55.830> quick<00:03:56.100> glance<00:03:56.450> of<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.600> camera

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
have a quick glance of the camera

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.820 
have a quick glance of the camera
interface<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.800> camera<00:03:59.160> features<00:04:00.440> ok<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.500> keep

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
interface and camera features ok so keep

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.490 
interface and camera features ok so keep
in<00:04:01.980> mind<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.220> price<00:04:02.690> 129<00:04:03.690> euros<00:04:04.050> which<00:04:04.350> is

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
in mind the price 129 euros which is

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.890 
in mind the price 129 euros which is
pretty<00:04:04.709> affordable<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:05.970> phone<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.540> has

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
pretty affordable for a phone that has
