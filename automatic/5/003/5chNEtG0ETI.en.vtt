00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
really quick and I guess I admired some

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
really quick and I guess I admired some
of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.900> stuff<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> antlers<00:01:38.220> were

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
of the stuff that the antlers were

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.539 
of the stuff that the antlers were
trying<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.060> musically<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.530> album<00:01:40.740> but

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
trying to do musically on that album but

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.910 
trying to do musically on that album but
uh<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.180> lo-fi<00:01:42.420> recording<00:01:43.079> quality<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> felt

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
uh the lo-fi recording quality I felt

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920 
uh the lo-fi recording quality I felt
hampered<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.729> lot<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> potential

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
hampered a lot of that potential

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
hampered a lot of that potential
especially<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> LP<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.070> loud<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.909> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
especially when the LP got loud but that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
especially when the LP got loud but that
to<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.659> kind<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.960> what<00:01:49.079> makes<00:01:49.229> Burst<00:01:49.560> Apart

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to me is kind of what makes Burst Apart

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
to me is kind of what makes Burst Apart
