00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 very good all its worth to see and we go 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.379
 play moto ski test acrobat the challenge 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.240
 Definitive for motorcycles seriously is the most 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.550
 difficult that I have played but in addition to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 difficult is very well thought out and is 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.719
 pretty funny as you see we are 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 enough subscribers these last 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.619
 races that has played a truth is that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.180
 I've recorded them all in a moment but 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.220
 you will have seen them during these 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.410
 days is playing with subscribers 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.820
 pretty cool, we've been 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.289
 playing a lot of people knew 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 that are more beautiful than the rest 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 of racing in the end we go there I remember 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.000
 that because this race already says bone 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.280
 it was going to go up a few days ago but the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.530
 I played so bad and I was so long in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.559
 this race that I said to the shit I was 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.989
 how would I say half an hour or anything like that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.640
 is what I usually say exaggeratedly 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.410
 but I was like an almost a quarter of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.510
 time to complete this race is very 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 complicated that's why I've put the bike 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 is the last time the island says with 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.440
 the new bike that goes very fast but 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.590
 It's definitely not the best bike to 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 hit jumps and fall 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.080
 oh my god it would be an idea and seriously not 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.870
 could that definitely jump out of that 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.030
 motorcycle was not the best to drop things from 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.770
 you're not all career is 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.690
 falls and all that this is really 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.850
 simply the beginning in principle 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.970
 so that you step on the control of the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.530
 motorcycle after the final challenge in the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.650
 what am I talking about is on a bridge 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.540
 actually under a bridge and I do not know very 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.580
 well how to explain it is very complicated 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.440
 fun and I want to see how they huddle 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.780
 all those that go so fast by 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.850
 go ahead because you can go very fast in 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.649
 this part but then you are not going to 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.540
 overcome unless some of you 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.810
 have already played this race with me 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.729
 before which is quite possible in order 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.860
 let's see how this is about to 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.740
 start this I do not remember very well how 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.050
 was that what had to go up here 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.430
 let's go little by little that one went out there 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.350
 now you have to climb up here oh god no 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.900
 the same thing will happen to me as to the other 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:05.840
 let's go here trial trial way seal or 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.580
 it hurts and we finally got here and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.810
 now you have to go through here and now the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.369
 first time he says this I went for 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.860
 over the bridge and I say where are the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.160
 control points and here it was like 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.440
 You see it's very good but god seriously 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.060
 this map is very well thought out or is already 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.920
 You see the ramps and everything I see is more 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.400
 forward to a flip you will do more with this 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.230
 circuit 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.910
 I mean, I 'm telling you , it's not one of those 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.709
 races to compete in truth because 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.030
 at least the first time you are not going to 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.950
 compete because case action is 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.019
 complicated you have to ask him the trick 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.780
 these little things is that go very slow oh 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.500
 God seriously I fell I do not know if I had to 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.660
 import the truth 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.790
 to see do you think you can do in step 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.680
 that one is estimating me or is source 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.170
 he was pushing me before or something because 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.190
 I do not know why I shut up so much we're going 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.580
 here around here was for me 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.040
 shit or what you do not have to accelerate 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.780
 very good yes sometimes sometimes sometimes it's not 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.459
 what has this circuit that is 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.140
 quite complete you have to get to the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.510
 ramp here and forward let's go there let's go 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.610
 but Kate stays as above the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.620
 motorbike and now I do not know why I have the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.300
 parachute but it's cool to wear it 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.010
 a god what bad luck I'm having 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.360
 Right now I'm falling a lot but 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.280
 in the last time I played this race 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.530
 I kept silent a lot more so it does or is 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.209
 an idea I'm obviously cutting 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.730
 many of the falls that I just had 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.190
 to see if I now drive a little better 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.690
 little by little calmly things are 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.230
 they get could get to that ramp not 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.230
 let's check it let's go 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.750
 bowes this reminds me of a mini game 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.000
 what was in gta san andreas what 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.700
 would become gta 2 so to speak 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.170
 where you could do trial in a kind 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.170
 of stadium where there was a lot of 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.720
 ramps and tests and going through 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.250
 rails and narrow areas was era I do not know 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.840
 some of you surely know it if 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.790
 you played san andreas I was 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.330
 pretty handsome to be good you know 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:07.530
 gta a game where you steal you kill and steal and 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.930
 you kill and sell drugs and you steal 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.940
 where I 'm going now I have to get there 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.870
 somehow I would have to go through 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.609
 down there let's see if it had to happen 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.900
 around here God seems different to me 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.609
 Last time governments will 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.460
 they will have updated something is possible 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.430
 because I do not remember but I told you 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.310
 I was so long that I lost what 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.860
 that is from time to see you can upload 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.870
 please have a cross country bike 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.030
 you should be more you have a motorcycle and a 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.330
 cross helmet and you're made for this and 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.070
 some boots there you are prepared to 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.030
 get your hands dirty in this circuit 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.700
 follow me 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.920
 let's see let's go well let's see this 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.860
 soft and quiet part I like and now 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.750
 we come to the end by carefully not 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.570
 I want to fall I want at least a part 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.930
 of the race has to be very old 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.640
 calmly while nothing else happens first 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.100
 I had not noticed more first like this 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.760
 keep calm this is close by 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.970
 here yes or no so I say nothing in the end 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.470
 I want to come back from here to not 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.870
 cut or anything give me the point of 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.620
 control takes the plunder to not even what 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.260
 I catch you to fuck the little bit bit by bit 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.270
 little bit too close to the edge and we arrived 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.010
 I 'm going to be half as calm 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.720
 time to get that seriously I was 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.480
 trying to get up the hill and twenty 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.700
 a thousand stories but always in the end what 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.500
 more useful is to reappear and do it from 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.970
 where were you the last time about everything 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.950
 in these maps that are made for 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.390
 do trial and what is the map itself 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.700
 but more where there is someone who does not 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.140
 get that silhouette 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.300
 to see from araya I think it's all 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.610
 relaxation go through here in the countryside 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.070
 Enjoy the nature of the clouds 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.510
 the sea the mountain we have here the truth 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.870
 we have the mountain the sea we have of 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.120
 all 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.770
 until water for the race and as you have 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.420
 seen is challenging I do not know if you will 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.700
 played some more challenging can that 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.080
 yes, maybe not, but this one is pretty like that 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.000
 how good you always have this 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.250
