from Virginia Tech University and we're

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.950 
from Virginia Tech University and we're
presenting<00:00:16.730> Seymour<00:00:17.150> here<00:00:17.480> at<00:00:17.750> the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
presenting Seymour here at the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.269 
presenting Seymour here at the
conference<00:00:18.230> Seymour<00:00:19.039> is<00:00:19.190> a<00:00:19.390> 256<00:00:20.390> node

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
conference Seymour is a 256 node

parallel<00:00:22.279> cluster<00:00:22.759> computer<00:00:23.269> it's<00:00:23.539> a<00:00:23.630> bunch

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
parallel cluster computer it's a bunch

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.220 
parallel cluster computer it's a bunch
of<00:00:24.170> little<00:00:25.300> efforts<00:00:26.300> making<00:00:26.720> one<00:00:26.929> large

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.609 
of little efforts making one large
computation<00:00:28.150> it's<00:00:29.150> also<00:00:29.359> a<00:00:29.619> kinetic

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
computation it's also a kinetic

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.060

sculpture<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:31.599> each<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.200> computers

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
sculpture and so each of the computers

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.180 
sculpture and so each of the computers
is<00:00:34.400> mounted<00:00:35.060> on<00:00:35.240> an<00:00:35.390> articulating<00:00:36.050> arm<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.590> so

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
is mounted on an articulating arm and so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.250 
is mounted on an articulating arm and so
as<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.960> computation<00:00:39.860> is<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:40.700> given<00:00:41.150> to<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.750> head

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260

on how much that individual part is
being<00:00:54.830> computed<00:00:55.490> so<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.350> patterns<00:00:57.350> that

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
being computed so the patterns that

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.950 
being computed so the patterns that
develop<00:00:58.220> are<00:00:58.400> what<00:00:58.550> are<00:00:58.670> usually<00:00:58.840> inside<00:00:59.840> of

the computer it was an era very
interesting<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.890> me<00:01:27.920> design<00:01:28.430> wise<00:01:28.640> in

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
interesting to me design wise in

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.430 
interesting to me design wise in
computers<00:01:29.570> because<00:01:29.810> they<00:01:29.930> were<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.140> coming

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
computers because they were just coming

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.830 
computers because they were just coming
off<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.590> room<00:01:30.920> size<00:01:31.190> computers<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.659> they

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
off of room size computers and so they

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.920 
off of room size computers and so they
moved<00:01:32.960> into<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:33.409> world<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:34.720> computers<00:01:35.720> that

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
moved into this world of computers that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.040 
moved into this world of computers that
were<00:01:36.050> kind<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.380> furniture<00:01:36.620> pieces<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:38.090> had

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
were kind of furniture pieces and had

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.540 
were kind of furniture pieces and had
much<00:01:39.500> more<00:01:39.530> character<00:01:40.070> they<00:01:40.220> weren't<00:01:40.400> just

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
much more character they weren't just

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.180 
much more character they weren't just
cabinets<00:01:41.090> they<00:01:41.360> were<00:01:41.500> all<00:01:42.500> sorts<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:42.979> shapes

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
cabinets they were all sorts of shapes

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.950 
cabinets they were all sorts of shapes
and<00:01:43.460> sizes<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:44.360> when<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:44.630> was<00:01:44.750> researching

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
and sizes and so when I was researching

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.950 
and sizes and so when I was researching

science<00:01:48.290> at<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.500> University<00:01:49.100> came<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.790> me<00:01:49.940> and

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
science at the University came to me and

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.149 
science at the University came to me and
things<00:01:50.630> developed<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.440> project<00:01:51.830> got<00:01:51.950> bigger

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
things developed the project got bigger

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.250 
things developed the project got bigger
and<00:01:52.250> bigger<00:01:52.430> when<00:01:53.210> we<00:01:53.330> decided<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.870> initiate

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
and bigger when we decided to initiate

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.350 
and bigger when we decided to initiate
this<00:01:54.590> project<00:01:54.979> i<00:01:55.040> started<00:01:55.070> researching<00:01:55.460> the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
this project i started researching the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.880 
this project i started researching the
history<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.750> supercomputing<00:01:57.530> because<00:01:57.799> i

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
history of supercomputing because i

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.140 
history of supercomputing because i
didn't<00:01:58.100> really<00:01:58.220> know<00:01:58.310> much<00:01:58.610> about<00:01:58.790> that<00:01:59.090> i

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
didn't really know much about that i

technologies in a school of visual arts
at<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:02.960> university<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.830> not<00:02:04.430> very<00:02:04.460> familiar

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
at the university so not very familiar

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.139 
at the university so not very familiar
with<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:06.020> parallel<00:02:06.979> computers<00:02:07.369> at<00:02:07.520> all<00:02:07.729> but

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
with with parallel computers at all but

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.259 
with with parallel computers at all but
i<00:02:08.599> learned<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.530> lot<00:02:09.679> about<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.489> evolution<00:02:10.789> of

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
i learned a lot about the evolution of

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.010 
i learned a lot about the evolution of
them<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.670> what<00:02:13.670> they<00:02:13.790> do

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
them and so what they do

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.450 
them and so what they do
and<00:02:15.640> sort<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.730> early<00:02:16.970> iterations<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:18.020> them

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
and sort of early iterations of them

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.070 
and sort of early iterations of them
starting<00:02:19.460> in<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.880> early<00:02:20.150> 80s<00:02:20.480> late<00:02:20.660> 70s

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
starting in like that early 80s late 70s

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.960 
starting in like that early 80s late 70s
time<00:02:21.290> period<00:02:21.770> really<00:02:22.250> influenced<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.820> design

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
time period really influenced the design

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.930 
time period really influenced the design
so<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.080> footprint<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.710> reminiscent<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.760> this

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
so the footprint is reminiscent of this

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.730 
so the footprint is reminiscent of this
Cray<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:26.420> computer<00:02:26.990> which<00:02:27.200> was<00:02:27.410> sort<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.650> a

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
Cray one computer which was sort of a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.950 
Cray one computer which was sort of a
cylinder<00:02:28.130> with<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.490> pie<00:02:28.790> shape<00:02:29.150> taken<00:02:29.810> out<00:02:29.900> of

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
cylinder with a pie shape taken out of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.600 
cylinder with a pie shape taken out of
it<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.440> see<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.710> pie<00:02:30.890> shape<00:02:31.160> on<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.460> back

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
it so you see the pie shape on the back

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.480 
it so you see the pie shape on the back
side<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.210> piece<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.160> because<00:02:34.160> these

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
side of this piece and because these

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.460 
side of this piece and because these
types<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.910> computers<00:02:35.330> are<00:02:35.510> usually<00:02:35.810> used<00:02:35.960> to

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
types of computers are usually used to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.180 
types of computers are usually used to
do<00:02:37.280> like<00:02:37.490> fluid<00:02:38.120> dynamic<00:02:38.900> simulation<00:02:39.770> or

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
do like fluid dynamic simulation or

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.040 
do like fluid dynamic simulation or
weather<00:02:41.030> patterns<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.720> things<00:02:41.810> like<00:02:41.990> that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
weather patterns and things like that

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.140 
weather patterns and things like that
the<00:02:42.620> idea<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:42.950> fluidity<00:02:43.370> really<00:02:43.790> became<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the idea of fluidity really became a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.840 
the idea of fluidity really became a
large<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:46.670> large<00:02:47.240> theme<00:02:48.170> throughout<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.010> like

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
large a large theme throughout so like

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.590 
large a large theme throughout so like
the<00:02:49.970> blues<00:02:50.270> that<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.840> see<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.880> acrylic

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
the blues that you see in the acrylic

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.780 
the blues that you see in the acrylic
but<00:02:54.110> also<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.620> sweeping<00:02:55.040> motions<00:02:55.460> like

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
but also like the sweeping motions like

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.760 
but also like the sweeping motions like
the<00:02:55.940> downward<00:02:56.360> sweeping<00:02:56.600> motions<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.410> also

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
the downward sweeping motions and also

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.070 
the downward sweeping motions and also
that<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.490> our<00:02:58.730> glasses<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.780> wave

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
that it it our glasses it's like a wave

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.200 
that it it our glasses it's like a wave
building<00:03:00.590> form<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.310> there<00:03:01.820> are<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> lot<00:03:02.180> of

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
building form so there are a lot of

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.560 
building form so there are a lot of
little<00:03:02.960> little<00:03:03.710> things<00:03:04.010> even<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.610> the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
little little things even the the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.020 
little little things even the the
movement<00:03:06.020> of<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.140> arms<00:03:06.530> themselves<00:03:07.030> instead

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
movement of the arms themselves instead

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.660 
movement of the arms themselves instead
of<00:03:08.150> just<00:03:08.530> flapping<00:03:09.530> out<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.980> coming<00:03:10.250> back<00:03:10.430> in

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
of just flapping out and coming back in

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.210 
of just flapping out and coming back in
they<00:03:11.090> actually<00:03:11.570> sort<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.260> articulate<00:03:12.830> out<00:03:13.010> in

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
they actually sort of articulate out in

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.870 
they actually sort of articulate out in
a<00:03:13.310> wave<00:03:13.520> form<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:15.230> lot<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.040> small<00:03:16.460> details

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
a wave form so a lot of small details

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.790 
a wave form so a lot of small details
sort<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.270> built<00:03:17.480> into<00:03:17.930> their<00:03:18.110> but<00:03:18.440> sort<00:03:18.770> of

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
sort of built into their but sort of

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.699 
sort of built into their but sort of
surrounding<00:03:19.280> themes<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.990> fluidity<00:03:20.990> and<00:03:21.350> and

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
surrounding themes of fluidity and and

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.630 
surrounding themes of fluidity and and
and<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:23.390> water<00:03:24.170> but<00:03:24.380> yeah<00:03:24.500> we<00:03:24.620> started<00:03:25.010> with<00:03:25.610> a

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
and and water but yeah we started with a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.949 
and and water but yeah we started with a
sort<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.150> salute<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.110> really<00:03:27.890> early

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
sort of salute to that really early

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.380 
sort of salute to that really early
computer<00:03:29.959> design<00:03:30.320> there's<00:03:31.010> 256<00:03:31.910> computers

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
computer design there's 256 computers

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.530 
computer design there's 256 computers
and<00:03:32.630> within<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.260> 256<00:03:34.220> there's<00:03:34.459> one<00:03:34.760> called

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
and within that 256 there's one called

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.120 
and within that 256 there's one called
the<00:03:35.690> head<00:03:35.840> node<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.230> tells<00:03:36.470> everybody<00:03:36.770> else

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
the head node that tells everybody else

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.820 
the head node that tells everybody else
what<00:03:37.490> to<00:03:37.640> do<00:03:37.820> each<00:03:38.060> computer<00:03:39.020> is<00:03:39.320> given<00:03:39.680> a

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
what to do each computer is given a

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.500 
what to do each computer is given a
small<00:03:40.100> part<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.730> large<00:03:40.970> task<00:03:41.300> to

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
small part of that large task to

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.199 
small part of that large task to
complete<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:43.160> head<00:03:43.310> node<00:03:43.520> sends<00:03:43.970> out

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
complete so the head node sends out

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.910 
complete so the head node sends out
signals<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.810> all<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.140> other<00:03:45.350> computers

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
signals to all of the other computers

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.640 
signals to all of the other computers
and<00:03:46.160> says<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.570> divis<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.750> up<00:03:47.870> right<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.440> just

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
and says and divis it up right it just

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.640 
and says and divis it up right it just
tell<00:03:48.830> it's<00:03:49.010> like<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:50.200> it's<00:03:51.200> like<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.470> coach

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
tell it's like the it's like the coach

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.350 
tell it's like the it's like the coach
it<00:03:51.860> just<00:03:52.040> tells<00:03:52.220> everybody<00:03:52.459> their<00:03:52.820> assignment

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
it just tells everybody their assignment

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.460 
it just tells everybody their assignment
when<00:03:53.780> they're<00:03:53.900> complete<00:03:54.200> with<00:03:54.320> their

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
when they're complete with their

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.620 
when they're complete with their
assignment<00:03:54.920> they<00:03:55.100> report<00:03:55.910> back<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.270> that<00:03:56.420> head

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
assignment they report back to that head

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.650 
assignment they report back to that head
node<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.920> when<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.670> articulating<00:03:59.510> arm

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
node and so when the articulating arm

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.350 
node and so when the articulating arm
moved<00:03:59.870> out<00:04:00.050> that's<00:04:00.770> when<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.400> has<00:04:01.880> that

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
moved out that's when it has that

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.360 
moved out that's when it has that
individual<00:04:02.900> computers<00:04:03.320> received<00:04:04.040> its

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
individual computers received its

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.820 
individual computers received its
mission<00:04:05.240> for<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.690> computation<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.709> then

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
mission for that computation and then

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.560 
mission for that computation and then
head<00:04:07.190> node<00:04:07.340> compiles<00:04:07.940> everything<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.510> that's

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
head node compiles everything and that's

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.940 
head node compiles everything and that's
what<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:08.870> see<00:04:08.900> come<00:04:09.200> out<00:04:09.320> on<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.560> computer

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
what you see come out on the computer

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.080 
what you see come out on the computer
screen<00:04:10.100> what<00:04:10.640> caught<00:04:10.820> me<00:04:10.970> first<00:04:11.209> was<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.810> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
screen what caught me first was a the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.640 
screen what caught me first was a the
exhibition<00:04:14.090> title<00:04:14.420> acting<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.020> translation

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
exhibition title acting and translation

exhibition title acting and translation
I<00:04:15.950> mean<00:04:16.310> that's<00:04:16.400> what<00:04:16.609> we're<00:04:16.760> trying<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.120> do<00:04:17.359> is

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
I mean that's what we're trying to do is

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.690 
I mean that's what we're trying to do is
we're<00:04:17.690> trying<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:18.140> take<00:04:18.350> what's<00:04:18.669> inside<00:04:19.669> of

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
we're trying to take what's inside of

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.400 
we're trying to take what's inside of
the<00:04:19.910> computer<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:20.690> we're<00:04:20.780> sort<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:21.049> trying<00:04:21.320> to

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
the computer and we're sort of trying to

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.320 
the computer and we're sort of trying to
translate<00:04:21.770> it<00:04:21.980> in<00:04:22.040> a<00:04:22.100> physical<00:04:22.790> form<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.300> that

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
translate it in a physical form so that

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.050 
translate it in a physical form so that
other<00:04:23.600> people<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:25.100> that<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.340> can<00:04:25.490> we<00:04:25.760> can<00:04:25.880> sort

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
other people so that we can we can sort

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.760 
other people so that we can we can sort
of<00:04:26.120> explain<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.750> people<00:04:26.930> what<00:04:27.229> goes<00:04:27.410> on

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
of explain to people what goes on

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.379 
of explain to people what goes on
inside<00:04:28.069> of<00:04:28.190> these<00:04:28.280> supercomputers<00:04:28.699> which<00:04:29.210> is

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
inside of these supercomputers which is

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.059 
inside of these supercomputers which is
something<00:04:30.319> you<00:04:30.770> know<00:04:31.099> rarely<00:04:31.629> a<00:04:32.860> few<00:04:33.860> people

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
something you know rarely a few people

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.619 
something you know rarely a few people
know<00:04:34.190> about<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.669> it<00:04:34.729> really<00:04:34.940> fit<00:04:35.330> with<00:04:35.569> our

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629 
know about so it really fit with our

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.899 
know about so it really fit with our
project<00:04:36.259> very<00:04:36.530> well<00:04:36.770> there's<00:04:37.340> also<00:04:37.610> enough

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
project very well there's also enough

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.249 
project very well there's also enough
great<00:04:38.210> opportunity<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.900> get<00:04:39.020> some

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
great opportunity to get some

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.050 
great opportunity to get some
international<00:04:39.830> exposure<00:04:40.370> for<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.849> project

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
international exposure for the project

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.820 
international exposure for the project
this<00:04:41.419> is<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:41.690> first<00:04:41.900> place<00:04:42.139> we've<00:04:42.379> shown<00:04:42.650> it

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
this is the first place we've shown it

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.379 
this is the first place we've shown it
and<00:04:43.039> we<00:04:43.129> wanted<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.400> be<00:04:43.759> on<00:04:43.879> a<00:04:43.909> really<00:04:44.120> big

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
and we wanted to be on a really big

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.059 
and we wanted to be on a really big
stage<00:04:44.720> for<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:45.169> there's<00:04:45.530> really<00:04:45.740> no<00:04:45.919> place

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
stage for that there's really no place

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.830 
stage for that there's really no place
better<00:04:46.310> than<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.879> sea<00:04:47.060> graph<00:04:47.270> art<00:04:47.479> gallery

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
better than the sea graph art gallery

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.390 
better than the sea graph art gallery
for<00:04:48.050> something<00:04:48.349> like<00:04:48.500> that<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:49.129> many<00:04:49.250> people

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
for something like that so many people

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.839 
for something like that so many people
here<00:04:50.090> there<00:04:50.960> aren't<00:04:51.139> a<00:04:51.349> lot<00:04:51.379> of<00:04:51.530> venues<00:04:51.860> like

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
here there aren't a lot of venues like

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.119 
here there aren't a lot of venues like
this<00:04:53.180> out<00:04:53.479> there<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:54.770> bring<00:04:54.979> together

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
this out there that bring together

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.469 
this out there that bring together
technology<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.360> art<00:04:57.050> in<00:04:57.289> the<00:04:57.979> way<00:04:58.159> that

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
technology and art in the way that

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.850 
technology and art in the way that
myself<00:04:59.479> and<00:04:59.840> my<00:04:59.960> colleagues<00:05:00.380> at<00:05:00.560> Virginia

Tech have been able to bring together

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.210 
Tech have been able to bring together
technology<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.139> art<00:05:03.319> so<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.740> fit<00:05:03.919> very<00:05:04.130> well

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
technology and art so it fit very well

professor<00:05:18.639> and<00:05:19.719> probably<00:05:20.719> the<00:05:20.840> most

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
professor and probably the most

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.779 
professor and probably the most
satisfying<00:05:21.409> part<00:05:21.560> about<00:05:22.009> this<00:05:22.370> whole<00:05:22.430> project

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
satisfying part about this whole project

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.909 
satisfying part about this whole project
is<00:05:23.150> that<00:05:23.210> we<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:24.259> know<00:05:24.349> it's<00:05:24.440> one<00:05:24.560> of<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:24.710> few

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
is that we you know it's one of the few

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.510 
is that we you know it's one of the few
opportunities<00:05:25.550> and<00:05:26.419> few<00:05:26.719> projects<00:05:27.199> i<00:05:27.440> can<00:05:28.370> say

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
opportunities and few projects i can say

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.730 
opportunities and few projects i can say
objectively<00:05:28.750> that<00:05:29.750> I've<00:05:29.900> seen<00:05:30.139> that<00:05:30.440> is

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
objectively that I've seen that is

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.629 
objectively that I've seen that is
really<00:05:31.159> a<00:05:31.190> true<00:05:31.460> collaboration<00:05:31.729> between<00:05:32.349> the

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
really a true collaboration between the

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.249 
really a true collaboration between the
art<00:05:34.639> and<00:05:34.789> technology<00:05:35.270> and<00:05:35.479> within<00:05:35.719> academia

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
art and technology and within academia

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:43.830 
art and technology and within academia
so<00:05:36.849> we're<00:05:37.849> all<00:05:37.969> really<00:05:38.150> proud<00:05:38.270> of<00:05:38.780> it
