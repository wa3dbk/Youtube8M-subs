was like I wonder if that happened a lot

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.650 
was like I wonder if that happened a lot
back<00:03:55.489> in<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:55.730> day<00:03:55.880> when<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.120> had<00:03:56.239> prisoners

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
back in the day when you had prisoners

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.030 
back in the day when you had prisoners
and<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:56.870> wanted<00:03:57.139> to<00:03:57.290> like<00:03:57.500> instead<00:03:57.769> of<00:03:57.889> just

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
and you wanted to like instead of just

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.559 
and you wanted to like instead of just
kill<00:03:58.400> them<00:03:58.549> right<00:03:58.579> there<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.060> wanted<00:03:59.359> to<00:03:59.450> go

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
kill them right there you wanted to go

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.479 
kill them right there you wanted to go
ahead<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.870> have<00:03:59.989> them<00:04:00.170> fight<00:04:00.829> a<00:04:01.040> little<00:04:01.340> bit

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
ahead and have them fight a little bit

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.030 
ahead and have them fight a little bit
for<00:04:01.670> their<00:04:01.819> survival<00:04:02.480> because<00:04:02.799> around<00:04:03.799> me<00:04:03.950> a

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
for their survival because around me a

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.399 
for their survival because around me a
lot<00:04:04.099> if<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.459> guys<00:04:04.580> have<00:04:04.760> seen<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:05.030> movie

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
lot if you guys have seen the movie

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.630 
lot if you guys have seen the movie
Apocalyptica<00:04:06.409> where<00:04:06.620> they<00:04:07.099> let<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.489> guy<00:04:07.610> run

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
Apocalyptica where they let the guy run

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.540 
Apocalyptica where they let the guy run
and<00:04:08.120> he<00:04:08.510> dodges<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:09.170> be

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
and he dodges this be

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.160 
and he dodges this be
and<00:04:09.790> then<00:04:09.880> at<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.120> end<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.480> think<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:10.960> of<00:04:10.990> them

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
and then at the end I think one of them

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.450 
and then at the end I think one of them
hits<00:04:11.350> him<00:04:11.530> cut<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:11.980> guy<00:04:12.100> comes<00:04:12.310> up<00:04:12.400> to

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
hits him cut and the guy comes up to

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.010 
hits him cut and the guy comes up to
finish<00:04:12.730> him<00:04:12.850> off<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.150> he<00:04:13.210> stabs<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.720> guy<00:04:13.840> and

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
finish him off and he stabs the guy and

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.039 
finish him off and he stabs the guy and
kills<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.320> guy<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.490> mean<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:16.540> part<00:04:16.959> was

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
kills that guy so I mean that part was

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.630 
kills that guy so I mean that part was
really<00:04:17.260> cool<00:04:17.440> too<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> way<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.160> way<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.610> I

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
really cool too the way the way that I

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.180 
really cool too the way the way that I
mean<00:04:19.360> the<00:04:20.260> way<00:04:20.380> they<00:04:20.470> brought<00:04:20.590> it<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:20.830> I<00:04:20.950> think

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
mean the way they brought it in I think

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.800 
mean the way they brought it in I think
I<00:04:21.280> think<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:21.519> was<00:04:21.610> really<00:04:21.820> cool<00:04:22.000> for<00:04:22.480> me<00:04:22.540> was<00:04:22.780> a

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
I think it was really cool for me was a

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.900 
I think it was really cool for me was a
really<00:04:22.990> good<00:04:23.140> trailer<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.710> mean<00:04:24.100> this<00:04:24.490> is<00:04:24.640> among

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
really good trailer I mean this is among

really good trailer I mean this is among
I<00:04:25.210> would<00:04:25.690> say<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.170> probably<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.680> best

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240

tonight I will get it much later on and
I<00:05:25.120> probably<00:05:25.390> had<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.630> more<00:05:25.870> discounted

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
I probably had a more discounted

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.180 
I probably had a more discounted
discounted<00:05:27.400> um<00:05:27.550> price<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.810> then<00:05:29.740> review<00:05:30.160> it

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
discounted um price and then review it

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.159 
discounted um price and then review it
at<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.700> time<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.300> see<00:05:31.450> if<00:05:31.540> it<00:05:31.630> was<00:05:31.720> even<00:05:31.960> worth

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
at that time to see if it was even worth

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.110 
at that time to see if it was even worth
it<00:05:32.380> but<00:05:32.919> probably<00:05:33.160> by<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.520> time<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:33.970> I<00:05:34.030> get

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
it seems to be the pacing of the of

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.530 
it seems to be the pacing of the of
after<00:05:41.590> Attila<00:05:41.919> so<00:05:42.190> so<00:05:42.820> that<00:05:43.030> there<00:05:43.360> you<00:05:43.419> go
