00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
was that this is a dual-core phone and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
was that this is a dual-core phone and
every<00:01:01.350> other<00:01:01.910> Bionic<00:01:02.910> I've<00:01:03.090> seen<00:01:03.359> has<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
every other Bionic I've seen has the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
Motorola logo this one it doesn't I

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.280 
Motorola logo this one it doesn't I
don't<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.840> because<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
don't know if that's just because the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.179 
don't know if that's just because the
update<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:16.189> thought

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
update on here or what but I thought

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.810 
update on here or what but I thought
that<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.640> interesting<00:01:19.159> here<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.520> try

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that was interesting here I'm gonna try

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.320 
that was interesting here I'm gonna try
and<00:01:20.939> recover<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:22.710> it'll<00:01:23.549> act<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.119> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and recover it and it'll act like it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.749 
and recover it and it'll act like it's
recovering<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.500> once<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.920> reboots<00:01:26.340> again<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
recovering but once it reboots again it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
recovering but once it reboots again it
gets<00:01:26.909> stuck<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> Droid<00:01:27.540> logo<00:01:27.960> screen

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
gets stuck in the Droid logo screen

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.640 
gets stuck in the Droid logo screen
again<00:01:32.210> I've<00:01:33.210> tried<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:34.020> everything<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
again I've tried just about everything I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.100 
again I've tried just about everything I
can<00:01:34.799> find<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.400> fix<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:36.180> now<00:01:36.990> I've

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
can find to fix this thing now I've

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.770 
can find to fix this thing now I've
tried<00:01:37.350> older<00:01:37.710> packages<00:01:38.450> but<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> older

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
tried older packages but the older

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.600 
tried older packages but the older
packages<00:01:40.380> won't<00:01:40.619> even<00:01:40.860> flash<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.400> phone

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
packages won't even flash the phone

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
packages won't even flash the phone
right<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.899> only<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.909> package<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.329> newest

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
right it's only the package the newest

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.440 
right it's only the package the newest
package<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.380> I'll<00:01:48.049> put<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> disc<00:01:49.380> put<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
package and I'll put the disc put the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
package and I'll put the disc put the
package<00:01:51.450> into<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> description<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.070> you'll

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
package into the description so you'll

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.030 
package into the description so you'll
know<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.410 

but<00:02:00.040> I've<00:02:00.159> almost<00:02:00.310> given<00:02:00.670> up<00:02:00.880> on<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.240> phone

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
but I've almost given up on this phone

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.920 
but I've almost given up on this phone
because<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:01.780> can't<00:02:01.990> find<00:02:02.259> any<00:02:02.710> other<00:02:02.860> way<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
because I can't find any other way to

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.950 
because I can't find any other way to
fix<00:02:05.320> what's<00:02:05.680> going<00:02:06.009> on<00:02:06.159> here

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
fix what's going on here

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.320 
fix what's going on here
I<00:02:08.130> suppose<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.310> could<00:02:09.489> be<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.640> hardware<00:02:10.060> problem

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
I suppose it could be a hardware problem

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.839 
I suppose it could be a hardware problem
but<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.780> doesn't<00:02:11.530> seem<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.980> act<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.730> is

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
but it doesn't seem to act like it is

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.809 
but it doesn't seem to act like it is
because<00:02:13.239> everything<00:02:13.660> seems<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.050> work<00:02:14.819> except

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
because everything seems to work except

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.750 
because everything seems to work except
getting<00:02:16.120> past<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.630> Droid<00:02:17.050> logo<00:02:17.440> screen<00:02:17.830> but

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
getting past that Droid logo screen but

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.240 
getting past that Droid logo screen but
the<00:02:18.910> flashing<00:02:19.480> seems<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.110> function<00:02:20.290> fine<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the flashing seems to function fine the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.240 
the flashing seems to function fine the
recovery<00:02:21.989> acts<00:02:22.989> like<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.530> wants<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.860> recover

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
recovery acts like it wants to recover

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.820 
recovery acts like it wants to recover
but<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.150> never<00:02:25.450> got<00:02:25.660> gets<00:02:26.260> anywhere

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.630 

that's<00:02:29.830> rebooting<00:02:30.519> now<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:32.220> another<00:02:33.220> red

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
that's rebooting now and another red

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.199 
that's rebooting now and another red

Motorola logo with no dual core text

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:47.839 
Motorola logo with no dual core text
underneath<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.900> which<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.170> weird

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.580 

and<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.749> Droid<00:02:49.079> logo<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.900> that's<00:02:52.290> it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
and the Droid logo and this that's it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.050 
and the Droid logo and this that's it
this<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:52.829> where<00:02:53.159> it'll<00:02:53.340> get<00:02:53.489> stuck<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.030> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
this is where it'll get stuck and I
