00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello dear garden friends now im 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.010
 autumn you can with little effort 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.260
 Make sure your garden is in spring 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.980
 really flourishes as they do that 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.210
 quite simply plant flower bulbs 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.439
 Here you can see the three flowers birds 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.810
 that we want to plant today 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.220
 daffodils crocuses and tulips 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 the bigger the onions and tubers are 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 the deeper they have to be put 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.879
 as a rule of thumb, the plant hole must 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.320
 be about twice as deep as that 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.300
 flower bulb is high before we go with the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.359
 tulips start what I want to 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.289
 a few plants made of wire mesh 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.340
 tulip bulbs are gladly made of 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.050
 wants to bow eating 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.100
 with such baskets that can be 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.699
 Prevent a cut first 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.489
 44 x 44 cm piece of wire mesh too 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.539
 rectangle is particularly well suited 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.550
 Continue with 12 mm mesh and continue to separate 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.620
 now on two opposite 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 each side above and below a twelve 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.430
 centimeter wide tab out in the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.170
 pinch ten stitches 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 she protruding wires end with the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.230
 side cutters click on the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.580
 bottles and the four side walls in the 90th 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.580
 degrees angle upwards 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.450
 As you can see that requires a little 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.450
 patience 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.610
 now they connect the two 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.250
 opposite side walls with the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.250
 laschen and finished the film is out of basket 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.890
 Here my tulip bulbs feel 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.490
 especially for that I must now only times the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.490
 matching hole came 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.150
 Lift a round twelve centimeters 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:52.850
 deep plant hole from loosen the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:54.530
 Sole and put the basket one 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.870
 two to three centimeters thick layer 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.800
 Building sand under the onions is reduced 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.800
 the danger of waterlogging 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.830
 single tulips is hardly valid 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.730
 That's why they put you in groups better 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.730
 from five to ten pieces 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.300
 distribute the onions evenly 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.710
 in the plant hole then they shovel it 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.250
 close again and press the earth with the 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.540
 Feet slightly 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.430
 Finally, mark the place with you 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.290
 I plant a shield now 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.770
 my onions in threes in the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.390
 race 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.010
 that works best with such a 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.800
 lung-wing planters pierce them 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.150
 hole after hole in the grass 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.990
 put the onions and 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.990
 close the holes again 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.930
 the circuit is cast as the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.930
 know it would like something moister 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.219
 We should always be in larger crocuses 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.039
 Groups of ten to twenty pieces 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.600
 plant out as naturally as that 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.840
 if we just drop the tubers 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.870
 Leave and plant where you are 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.430
 to lie down 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.590
 The planting of the crocus tubers is on 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.870
 fastest by using the weed 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.610
 pierce a hole in front of the tuber 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.840
 push in and then the hole 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.880
 to press again 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.020
 make sure the tubers do not 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.020
 come too deep into the earth 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.050
 now i hope that winter is not 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:58.030
 too long will be looking forward to the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:05:00.030
 many colorful flowers early grandmother 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.780
 you have that for big eyes as 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.150
 rule of thumb is that top teams the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.280
 large wing is high for all it's 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.740
 after or hello love the plant hole 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.630
 must be about twice as deep as that 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.630
 onion is the next heavy
