00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.470 
he wasn't really crossing him just
because<00:03:13.859> he<00:03:14.129> was<00:03:14.250> he<00:03:14.760> was<00:03:14.849> just<00:03:14.879> sprinting

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
because he was he was just sprinting

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.030 
because he was he was just sprinting
around<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.840> likes<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.109> David<00:03:16.409> Luiz<00:03:16.650> normally

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
around the likes of David Luiz normally

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.189 
around the likes of David Luiz normally
you'd<00:03:17.129> have<00:03:17.159> to<00:03:17.280> pass<00:03:17.579> around<00:03:17.879> him<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.269> there

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
you'd have to pass around him but there

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.569 
you'd have to pass around him but there
was<00:03:19.290> no<00:03:19.470> problem<00:03:19.739> at<00:03:19.859> all<00:03:20.010> with<00:03:20.129> hazard

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
was no problem at all with hazard

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.670 
was no problem at all with hazard
running<00:03:20.940> around<00:03:21.000> them<00:03:21.419> so<00:03:21.629> I'd<00:03:22.199> probably<00:03:22.440> give

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
running around them so I'd probably give

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.890 
running around them so I'd probably give
my<00:03:22.859> hazard<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.609> rating<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.299> nine<00:03:24.659> and<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> half

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
my hazard a rating of nine and a half
