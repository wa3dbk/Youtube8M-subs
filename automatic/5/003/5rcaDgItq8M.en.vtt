00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.190
 I take this opportunity to show you more 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.060
 one interesting drawing 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.180
 he fit without punch card he 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.509
 quite laborious but worth it 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.119
 we press the park button on the back 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.899
 carriages and if we tie several 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.539
 rows we get the usual reps while 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.690
 knitting density on the back needle case 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:42.010
 there should be more figure than 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 front I will set the position 64 in 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.739
 knitting process we may have 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.970
 change these values about knitting 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:55.540
 several rows 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:59.800
 usual simple reps this way 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.270
 all needles are knitted back only needles 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:12.850
 front years 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:15.579
 and now let's work on a little decker 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.639
 let's start with simple 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:21.759
 single needle and central 

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:26.259
 needle 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:29.770
 the loop will be transferred to the next empty one 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:34.679
 we transfer the needle to the back 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.679
 non-working position tying two rows 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.439
 now we do the same with our neighbors 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.829
 loops 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:56.049
 Shemku this figure of course I 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:57.569
 I will attach more to this disk 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.990
 closer 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:06.209
 also i work from on the needle in bye 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.380
 that in the evening and then the whole movement will be 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.380
 2 then 3 whatever 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:23.390
 but for now it's still like that 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:38.700
 back idle position 7 eyelets and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:43.580
 middle I return to work this 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:50.400
 I take a loop and one loop 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:57.750
 I return it turned out 3 back 3 in 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:03.930
 worker 3 in the back and so far all the same 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.470
 most one eyelet and tidy 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:14.220
 one 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:17.010
 add rhythm is saved when 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:25.410
 you work so immediately remember old 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:29.280
 good times on yourself in neve 1 2 yes 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.790
 at 5 the same manual lock in each 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.790
 second row 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.460
 so you can take 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.430
 virtually any relief pattern of 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:04:00.540
 hand knitting and adapt it to 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:06.230
 such a knit rep with analysis well, and we 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.230
 meet you in viewing samples
