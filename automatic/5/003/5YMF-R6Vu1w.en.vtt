00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.700
 the interview that you will see 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.740
 then it has a comic content 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.810
 of an offense and has been 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.220
 done using raised phrases 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.950
 by the person interviewed in their 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.169
 own videos is to say the interview does not 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.300
 the interview series is real 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.040
 funny is done from the respect and 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.310
 conservation towards people who are 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.380
 apparently interviewed 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.520
 I knew it was only a matter of time 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.870
 man is something logical with the amount of 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.610
 interviews that I've already taken there 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.380
 appear sooner or later because I do not know 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.510
 it happened nine months ago because 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.950
 first we did not know each other yet and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.450

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.350
 that tomorrow we have eight months since 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.550

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.280

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.570
 become one of the most 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.300
 horrible that I had the privilege 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.740
