00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.420 
I believe what academies does for school
is<00:03:07.909> it<00:03:08.090> gets<00:03:08.269> students<00:03:08.629> to<00:03:08.870> focus<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.680> what

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
is it gets students to focus in on what

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.890 
is it gets students to focus in on what
who<00:03:10.579> they<00:03:10.730> are<00:03:10.879> and<00:03:11.209> what<00:03:11.359> they<00:03:11.480> want<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.690> do<00:03:11.870> in

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
who they are and what they want to do in

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.270 
who they are and what they want to do in
life<00:03:12.019> they<00:03:12.530> don't<00:03:12.680> have<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.890> pick<00:03:13.099> their

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
life they don't have to pick their

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.250 
life they don't have to pick their
career<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.879> high<00:03:14.000> school<00:03:14.329> but<00:03:14.750> just<00:03:14.989> get<00:03:15.109> them

major<00:06:13.780> undecided<00:06:14.590> for<00:06:15.040> all<00:06:15.100> those<00:06:15.280> years<00:06:15.340> I

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
major undecided for all those years I

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.850 
major undecided for all those years I
guess<00:06:16.180> one<00:06:16.570> of<00:06:16.600> the<00:06:16.750> greatest<00:06:16.960> satisfactions

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
guess one of the greatest satisfactions

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.580 
guess one of the greatest satisfactions
that<00:06:18.130> I<00:06:18.160> get<00:06:18.520> out<00:06:18.760> of<00:06:19.000> this<00:06:19.150> is<00:06:19.450> that<00:06:19.840> in<00:06:20.140> three

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
that I get out of this is that in three

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.770 
that I get out of this is that in three
short<00:06:20.890> years<00:06:21.040> we<00:06:21.760> really<00:06:22.240> have<00:06:22.450> seen<00:06:22.750> a

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
short years we really have seen a

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.310 
short years we really have seen a
difference<00:06:23.500> in<00:06:24.210> our<00:06:25.210> children<00:06:25.720> and<00:06:25.840> what<00:06:26.170> they

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
difference in our children and what they

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.830 
difference in our children and what they
can<00:06:26.530> achieve<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:27.310> in<00:06:28.300> what<00:06:28.690> the

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
can achieve and in what the

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.870 
can achieve and in what the
opportunities<00:06:29.530> are<00:06:29.560> that<00:06:30.070> we<00:06:30.220> now<00:06:30.430> have

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
opportunities are that we now have

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.760 
opportunities are that we now have
available<00:06:31.540> for<00:06:31.600> them<00:06:31.870> that<00:06:32.290> we're<00:06:32.590> not<00:06:32.710> there

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
available for them that we're not there

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.620 
available for them that we're not there
previously<00:06:33.730> we<00:06:34.030> believe<00:06:34.270> this<00:06:34.360> is<00:06:34.420> the<00:06:34.540> right

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
previously we believe this is the right

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.660 
previously we believe this is the right
thing<00:06:34.810> for<00:06:35.170> children<00:06:35.830> we're<00:06:36.220> seeing<00:06:36.460> it<00:06:36.580> again

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
thing for children we're seeing it again

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.490 
thing for children we're seeing it again
and<00:06:37.060> again<00:06:37.330> it's<00:06:37.840> not<00:06:38.020> a<00:06:38.080> hundred<00:06:38.350> percent

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
and again it's not a hundred percent

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.320 
and again it's not a hundred percent
you're<00:06:39.250> not<00:06:39.340> going<00:06:39.550> to<00:06:39.610> give<00:06:39.730> an<00:06:39.820> educational

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
you're not going to give an educational

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330 
you're not going to give an educational
program<00:06:40.510> it<00:06:40.750> works<00:06:40.930> for<00:06:41.080> every<00:06:41.320> child<00:06:41.590> what<00:06:42.310> I

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
program it works for every child what I

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.920 
program it works for every child what I
tell<00:06:42.730> you<00:06:42.760> it's<00:06:42.940> made<00:06:43.090> a<00:06:43.120> real<00:06:43.450> difference<00:06:43.480> at
