00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.859
 good friends and friends the day time 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.010
 he brought them a commented game and the 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.840
 truth is that no 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.620
 Sorry I have said nothing because 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:18.060
 there was nothing new to tell any more 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.210
 the holidays we all deserve 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.039
 Now that she appears on Monday 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.500
 beta 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.469
 we can already have in our hands what 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.989
 that will be part in scoop of pacific 4 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:36.540
 we are looking forward to those 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.040
 moments to say 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.190
 yes at least the team shoots 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.649
 until now only 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.649
 At the beginning of the summer, change the graphic 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:57.020
 and I hope that a commune of 650 types of 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.430
 logic have to pull through the game 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.430
 at least all minimum 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.300
 for the back 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.650
 Well what I was going to comment on 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.230
 methods of games that 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.500
 what are there are conquests will be 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.050
 playable in the beta 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.720
 total war with mixed vehicles 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.990
 capturing flags by means of rivers and 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.990
 the rest 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:33.490
 the egg this game will be escaped to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.290
 the current consoles to 24 players 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.290
 for the others 64 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.620
 domination that will also be playable in 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.930
 the beta 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.390
 is designed for 20 players in all 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.150
 the platforms do not know if then for pc 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.850
 we will put it for 64 days that cross 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.729
 quartet that are tiny maps 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.170
 we've seen before 64 players and 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 although it is a lack of control 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.230
 because they do not even give you time to recharge 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.429
 or to revive people since you 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.830
 you find a place in all the corners 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.760
 You look like a fucking mall in 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.760
 in Christmas 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.030
 and then another new fire method that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.150
 It is very very very chachi 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.940
 at least what I've seen and what it is 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.400
 the strategy of the game is that it's called 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.980
 classroom iteration is inspired by the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.650
 football 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.140
 why 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.600
 we have a bomb and as if we had 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.330
 33 the with 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.910
 and the pump can only be carried by a 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.940
 team then we must eliminate the one 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.710
 transport the pump or protect when 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.069
 we say when our team and 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.799
 carry the pump 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.319
 it would be like this as best explained to me as 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.969
 if it was soccer and the ball instead of 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.810
 have a goal we have three in 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.819
 against 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.480
 this method of the game seems to be 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.480
 pretty good 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.140
 and let's see what 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.360
 as desired 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:19.760
 and it will be 24 players for 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.480
 ps3 and 360 and for the consoles of 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.840
 platform 32 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.650
 new deactivation 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.959
 This is also new 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.110
 that you have to donate from a squad 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.110
 enemy 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.260
 the reds 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.880
 the deactivation mode in which the 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.820
 they are 5 against 5 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.970
 and it will be something similar to look 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.020
 destroy because we can only relive 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.780
 the allies once 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.880
 and players who do not want eliminated 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.480
 he stays in the game as spectators 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.470
 that is 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.470
 search and destroy 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.490
 of death by team and you know how 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.490
 like him 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.209
 says it's designed for 20 players 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:20.530
 inside the platforms I doubt it's 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.600
 Well, well, we'll see, we'll see what 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.230
 is what he does 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.920
 with this 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:31.780
 assault 24 for consoles 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.200
 32 for pc and new consoles 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.780
 for those that there is no assault 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.910
 it's about destroying them in conquer 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.620
 you can have two more parts for 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.810
 get to activate the bomb and protect the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.700
 destroyed in case it touches us 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.889
 defend eliminate with enemies for 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.889
 that do not approach the bomb 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.440
 not one death per team 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.139
 will be four patrols fighting 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.490
 each 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:13.229
 and also if it's like peace and feel 3 that 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.229
 it comes out from time to time online 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.060
 and the team that follows can win 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.060
 the game of cadiz 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.390
 and well there is already here everything is already 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.000
 otherwise here 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.520
 I hope you liked the game 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.880
 here I am trying to write to the 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.880
 rules 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.199
 try to blow out the torch to repair it 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.199
 but nothing 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.199
 quickly 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.169
 I already get back what is the day of the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.430
 all right 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.680
 I hope to have more 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.220
 more informed of all the new things 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.849
 what 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.800
 that go knowing out there 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.800
 about the 4 diamond pack 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.700
 already on Tuesday is launched to the vein and from 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.110
 when I can play I will not upload any video 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.780
 with my little ones 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.780
 new impressions new impressions 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.580
 as well 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.490
 wants more or less 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.990
 when the consumption 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.990
 compared to battlefield 3 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.610
 with regard to the requirement that 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.979
 call though yes I have also seen 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.379
 that the sea is quite dynamic there 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.590
 waves not like here that you see in the sea 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:40.590
 forever 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.280
 Y 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.910
 Where is 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.910
 go dead 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.680
 Elena 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.050
 saved by the hair because this has been 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.500
 all your team has won is already the 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.500
 next friends 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:18.560
 all right 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.560
 and 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.320
 uses
