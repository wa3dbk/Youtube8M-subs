00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:10.780
 marble ps3 if this channel has tutorial 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.780
 offline for the list 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.810
 all we have to do is go 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:22.180
 to our profile we give to triangle 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.310
 commentary 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.160
 here we erase what we have written I know 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.680
 that we have written something down to 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.990
 down here we give the icon that has 9 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.570
 squares suÃ¡rez 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.670
 we will get this type of keyboard now 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.360
 we have to give the key icon 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.860
 english we're going to simple keyboard what 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.250
 of audition has changed this from here in 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.580
 the first box for that we have 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.210
 what to give x triangle x triangle x worth 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.220
 this combination of keys we press 2 2 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.620
 twice times be 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.890
 and as you can see the second point comes together 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.890
 OK 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.090
 There are people with the trick 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.420
 now and when it starts when it's done 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 friends will leave with some failures will come out 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.870
 blank holes call and it will go out to the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.260
 people that we have seen that is connected 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.360
 disconnected, I do this because I do not 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.550
 I have nobody with whatever it is that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.440
 I'm disconnected but well 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.030
 they are also appreciated 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.090
 ok with this you can play online 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.500
 perfectly so that for example for 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.410
 that bothered me to explain a 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.670
 game or if you are integrating a video to 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.830
 what 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.470
 that people are lending and that 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.470
 send messages nothing 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.040
 loaded in white 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.060
 right now 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.020
 then I think it's also connected 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.350
 as you see it works well there is no 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.350
 failure 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.720
 and good to undo the trick and return 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.040
 to be online only to be done 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.910
 is we go to our comment profile and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.910
 we delete the text 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 authors 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.060
