using a servo motor on the lens it's not

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.889 
using a servo motor on the lens it's not
possible<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> true<00:00:38.969> measure<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.629> Mark

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
possible to do a true measure and Mark

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
possible to do a true measure and Mark
as<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.290> may<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.530> familiar<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.670> film

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
as you may be familiar with in a film

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.360 
as you may be familiar with in a film
camera<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> fully<00:00:43.110> manual<00:00:43.410> lens<00:00:43.770> setup

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
camera or a fully manual lens setup

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.060 
camera or a fully manual lens setup
however<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.899> camcorders<00:00:46.170> offer<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.980> are

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
however these camcorders offer what are

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.920 
however these camcorders offer what are
called<00:00:47.250> shot<00:00:47.670> transitions<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> shot

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
called shot transitions and shot

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.170 
called shot transitions and shot
transitions<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.800> allow<00:00:50.129> us<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> create

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
transitions will allow us to create

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.000 
transitions will allow us to create
something<00:00:51.480> much<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.199> measure<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> Mark

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
something much like a measure and Mark

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
something much like a measure and Mark
so<00:00:53.550> let's<00:00:53.760> look<00:00:53.940> at<00:00:54.120> how<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.360> set<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.840> shot

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
so let's look at how we set up a shot

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.680 
so let's look at how we set up a shot
transition<00:00:55.789> underneath<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> handle<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
transition underneath the handle you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.720 
transition underneath the handle you
will<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:58.050> an<00:00:58.260> indicator<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.980> says<00:00:59.219> store

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
will see an indicator that says store

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.270 
will see an indicator that says store
check<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.660> execute<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> here's<00:01:02.010> where<00:01:02.160> we're

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
check and execute and here's where we're

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.429 
check and execute and here's where we're
going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> set<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.760> our<00:01:03.000> shot<00:01:03.210> transition<00:01:03.780> now

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
going to set up our shot transition now

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.140 
going to set up our shot transition now
currently<00:01:04.860> I've<00:01:05.040> zoomed<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.880> this

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
currently I've zoomed in on this

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.000 
currently I've zoomed in on this
American<00:01:06.630> flag<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> foreground<00:01:07.590> so

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
American flag here in the foreground so

American flag here in the foreground so
I'm<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.570> store<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.470> focus<00:01:10.920> point

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
I'm just going to store this focus point

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
I'm just going to store this focus point
by<00:01:11.790> hitting<00:01:12.000> store<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.850> stores

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
by hitting store and a and that stores

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.530 
by hitting store and a and that stores
my<00:01:16.170> shot<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.680> position<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:18.000> I'm<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
my shot a position now I'm going to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.710 
my shot a position now I'm going to
rotate<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.409> focus<00:01:19.799> back<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.299> see<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
rotate the focus back so we can see the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
rotate the focus back so we can see the
small<00:01:21.960> child<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> fire<00:01:22.770> truck<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
now we want to check our shot so let's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.890 
now we want to check our shot so let's
hit<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> execute<00:01:32.400> button<00:01:32.790> again<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.720> puts

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
hit the execute button again and it puts

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.679 
hit the execute button again and it puts
it<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.140> check<00:01:34.470> mode<00:01:35.000> let's<00:01:36.000> hit<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.289 
record mode and as we film we now hit
our<00:01:57.810> shot<00:01:58.079> transition

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.539 

and<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:02.049> takes<00:02:02.229> place<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.860> recorded<00:02:03.220> to

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
and it takes place and is recorded to

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.109 
and it takes place and is recorded to
tape<00:02:05.070> now<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.159> might<00:02:06.310> be<00:02:06.490> that<00:02:06.700> we<00:02:06.790> want<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
tape now it might be that we want the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.699 
tape now it might be that we want the
shot<00:02:07.329> transition<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:07.960> go<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> little<00:02:08.470> bit<00:02:08.679> more

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
shot transition to go a little bit more

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.610 
shot transition to go a little bit more
quickly<00:02:09.130> than<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.270> currently<00:02:10.660> we<00:02:11.380> can<00:02:11.410> go

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
quickly than it is currently we can go

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.040 
quickly than it is currently we can go
into<00:02:11.739> our<00:02:11.860> menu<00:02:12.069> mode<00:02:12.400> or<00:02:12.970> into<00:02:13.510> our<00:02:13.569> P<00:02:13.810> mode

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
into our menu mode or into our P mode

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.970 
into our menu mode or into our P mode
and<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:16.989> P<00:02:17.170> mode<00:02:17.349> we'll<00:02:17.560> select<00:02:17.739> our

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
and here in the P mode we'll select our

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.190 
and here in the P mode we'll select our
shot<00:02:18.190> transition<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.940> here<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:20.019> control

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
shot transition and here we can control

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.500 
shot transition and here we can control
the<00:02:20.590> transition<00:02:21.099> time<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:22.090> for<00:02:22.209> instance

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
the transition time so for instance

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.780 
the transition time so for instance
let's<00:02:22.750> slow<00:02:23.260> down<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.650> transition<00:02:24.250> or<00:02:24.370> speed

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
let's slow down that transition or speed

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.729 
let's slow down that transition or speed
up<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.090> transition<00:02:25.660> let's<00:02:26.230> slow<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.440> down<00:02:26.530> to

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
up that transition let's slow it down to

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.550 
up that transition let's slow it down to
four<00:02:26.950> seconds<00:02:27.599> let's<00:02:28.599> go<00:02:28.750> into<00:02:28.900> our<00:02:28.959> curve<00:02:29.290> and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
four seconds let's go into our curve and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.930 
four seconds let's go into our curve and
change<00:02:29.920> our<00:02:30.069> curve<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.330> that's<00:02:31.540> linear<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.940> we

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
change our curve so that's linear and we

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.340 
change our curve so that's linear and we
don't<00:02:34.150> need<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.330> start<00:02:34.630> timer<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:35.049> there<00:02:35.230> so

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
don't need a start timer on there so

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.110 
don't need a start timer on there so
let's<00:02:35.500> check<00:02:35.830> okay<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.750> once<00:02:37.750> again<00:02:39.120> let's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
let's check okay and once again let's

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.860 
let's check okay and once again let's
execute<00:02:40.510> our<00:02:40.780> shot<00:02:40.989> transition<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:43.569> can<00:02:43.690> see

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
execute our shot transition you can see

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.240 
execute our shot transition you can see
there<00:02:44.019> takes<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.440> little<00:02:44.590> bit<00:02:44.769> longer<00:02:44.980> to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
there takes a little bit longer to

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.880 
there takes a little bit longer to
transpire<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.569> we<00:02:46.720> can<00:02:46.840> adjust<00:02:46.930> these<00:02:47.410> per

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
transpire and we can adjust these per

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.979 
transpire and we can adjust these per
shot<00:02:48.220> transition<00:02:48.790> shot<00:02:49.239> transitions<00:02:49.780> can<00:02:49.930> be

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
shot transition shot transitions can be

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.780 
shot transition shot transitions can be
used<00:02:50.260> for<00:02:50.410> any<00:02:50.620> number<00:02:51.069> of<00:02:51.190> different<00:02:51.580> things

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
used for any number of different things

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.160 
used for any number of different things
but<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> great<00:02:52.330> thing<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.569> we<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:52.900> assign

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
but the great thing is we can assign

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.100 
but the great thing is we can assign
gain<00:02:53.560> or<00:02:54.100> zoom<00:02:54.519> or<00:02:54.790> focus<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.720> these<00:02:55.870> shot

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
gain or zoom or focus to these shot

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.199 
gain or zoom or focus to these shot
transitions<00:02:56.680> buttons<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.580> for<00:02:57.760> instance<00:02:58.030> here

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
transitions buttons so for instance here

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.600 
transitions buttons so for instance here
I've<00:02:58.420> assigned<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.930> change<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.530> gain<00:02:59.769> to<00:03:00.340> button

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
I've assigned a change in gain to button

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.600 
I've assigned a change in gain to button
number<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.910> as<00:03:01.299> well<00:03:01.840> as<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.380> change<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.340> zoom

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
number a as well as a change in the zoom

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.830 
number a as well as a change in the zoom
and<00:03:03.819> focus<00:03:03.849> positions<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.329> great<00:03:10.720> if

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
and focus positions this is great if

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.120 
and focus positions this is great if
you're<00:03:10.989> zooming<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.530> background<00:03:11.799> that's

you're zooming in to a background that's

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.949 
you're zooming in to a background that's
a<00:03:12.280> little<00:03:12.430> bit<00:03:12.579> darker<00:03:12.760> or<00:03:13.180> if<00:03:13.600> you're<00:03:13.750> zooming

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
a little bit darker or if you're zooming

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.539 
a little bit darker or if you're zooming
