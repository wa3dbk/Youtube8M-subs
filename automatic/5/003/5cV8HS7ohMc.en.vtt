 south of piauí 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.960
 in passing through teresina decided to give 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.540
 A pause to rest for 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.640

 That same band and singer of the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.430

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.530
 clear aerial team ballad found on 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.329
 crying gare does not ask for a ride 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:46.440

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.690
 piano and not to tell you what you 'd pay 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.629
 place 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.129
 Daisy Magellan still from the clay that the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.289
 people have a very strong connection 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.820
 even because we left a job 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.699
 wonderful within the group a friendship 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.590
 It's timbalada and banda will perpetuate by 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.589
 life because it has its sonority 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.210
 itself has its own identity and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.710
 Thank god, all of us who went there 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.630
 we have to thank brawn because this 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.580
 opportunity that was a step 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.979
 fundamental for all of us today. 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.810
 we can have a musical history and it is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.869
 traveling all over Brazil, they are seeing 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.020
 there is the road to success and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.780
 help also begins in music along with 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.450
 he on the same tour travels the Bahian duo 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.780
 Italo and Marciel the sertanejo project 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.630
 electric takes to the whole carnival 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.659
 Romanticism of the precise sertanejo style 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.189
 of an old man who knows this love that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:45.149
 take the symptoms that cause me, I do not 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.970
 I know what I'm going to do if I look for 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.120
 my medicine is you 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.840
 we set up a different backland 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.890
 carnival mix an axé sertanejo 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.600
 practically for the season of 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.690
 Carnival we help each other and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.330
 makes a mess I only see in my dreams 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.720
 nor returning heaven 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.220
 then I feel in the mouth the taste of honey 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.330
 I felt whenever he kissed you 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.210
 people prove that the music she comes 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.490
 passing from generation to generation 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.340
 it is and certainly what we did well in 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.530
 This song was written by me 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.650
 I think the artist has to go where the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.790
 people are there today and all the concentration 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.320
 in bars, right? 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.660
 we are closing with the golden key 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.330
 and you know the Carnival calendar 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.190
 piauí is also very good and I think 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.320
 that people deserve other artists 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.350
 that it's shining that I'm in the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.450
 Brazil, come here and brighten up this 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.390
 human warmth brings this energy to bring 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.900
 musicality in container at the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.820
 crying, do not ask me for a ride 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:01.269
 I'll will always have the nose 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.260
 steady, I was going to tell you not to talk to you 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.260
