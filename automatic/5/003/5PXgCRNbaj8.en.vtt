 boot windows boot foot 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:39.059
 Then beauty would be one of the pr 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.100
 lightest version of windows 7 used 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 mainly for an installation of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.110
 client computers beauty with

 People are going to do it in the next videos. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.410

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.350
 different ways there it can be 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.280
 initialized through px is what is the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.860
 boot through network tv dvd hd hard drive 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.189
 It's usually we'll use the script 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.320
 cop pr.com that we will see that there is 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.240
 while to create a directory 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.939
 compilation and then we'll use the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.090
 the scd mg tool to generate a 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.090
 image iso only that in this objective 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.799
 will also copy the mgs that we will 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.939
 Are you going to use it to capture it? It's an image. 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:42.720

 so come in shelters and give me right 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.450
 so the first step we have to 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.880
 that go into saae dem directory 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 pick and perry windows are 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.820
 available together with the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.000
 windows icca beauty 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.659
 god ai k toms shoes is this directory 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.560
 Beauty here 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.420
 let's go to the script copy right foot 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.800
 x86 architectures 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.860
 if 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.080
 the beats deceived me to 6 4 and there's another one 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:43.290
 use x86 beauty so pop pp x86 that 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.600
 architecture in the territory of 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.690
 compilation that passes here has not yet 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.720
 I just created it when it's toothy 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:57.600
 issue the command beauty so I'll give

 to use to study money that 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.720
 before you see what you have 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.020

 is to rename this file 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.430
