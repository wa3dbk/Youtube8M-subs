00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.920 

this<00:00:03.820> time<00:00:04.029> around<00:00:04.149> we<00:00:04.390> want<00:00:04.540> to<00:00:04.630> have<00:00:04.750> a<00:00:04.779> look

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:04.930 
this time around we want to have a look

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.139 
this time around we want to have a look
at<00:00:05.080> how<00:00:05.319> to<00:00:05.380> manipulate<00:00:06.069> nodes<00:00:06.609> in<00:00:06.940> the<00:00:07.000> node

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
at how to manipulate nodes in the node

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.360 
at how to manipulate nodes in the node
graph<00:00:07.330> how<00:00:08.109> the<00:00:08.170> position<00:00:08.650> nodes<00:00:08.889> how<00:00:09.309> to

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
graph how the position nodes how to

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.220 
graph how the position nodes how to
access<00:00:09.760> nodes<00:00:10.000> and<00:00:10.270> how<00:00:10.480> to<00:00:10.540> manipulate<00:00:10.809> the

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
access nodes and how to manipulate the

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.930 
access nodes and how to manipulate the
node<00:00:11.410> graph<00:00:11.619> itself<00:00:12.070> through<00:00:12.340> Python<00:00:12.730> so

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
node graph itself through Python so

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.049 
node graph itself through Python so
let's<00:00:13.119> have<00:00:13.240> a<00:00:13.299> look<00:00:13.480> at<00:00:13.570> that<00:00:14.820> first<00:00:15.820> of<00:00:15.940> all

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
let's have a look at that first of all

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.849 
let's have a look at that first of all
I'm<00:00:16.180> going<00:00:16.299> to<00:00:16.359> create<00:00:16.539> something<00:00:16.600> for<00:00:17.590> us<00:00:17.710> to

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:17.859 
I'm going to create something for us to

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.480 
I'm going to create something for us to
play<00:00:18.039> with<00:00:18.720> i'll<00:00:19.720> just<00:00:19.960> create<00:00:20.199> a<00:00:20.289> no<00:00:21.070> op<00:00:21.220> node

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
play with i'll just create a no op node

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.849 
play with i'll just create a no op node
and<00:00:21.820> i'm<00:00:22.480> going<00:00:22.599> to<00:00:22.660> create<00:00:22.869> it<00:00:23.019> in<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.529> x<00:00:23.679> and

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
and i'm going to create it in the x and

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.759 
and i'm going to create it in the x and
y<00:00:23.980> position<00:00:24.339> 0<00:00:24.849> so<00:00:25.300> i'll<00:00:25.419> go<00:00:25.599> x<00:00:25.839> plus<00:00:26.109> equals<00:00:26.499> 0

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
y position 0 so i'll go x plus equals 0

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.710 
y position 0 so i'll go x plus equals 0
and<00:00:27.099> y<00:00:27.669> plus<00:00:27.970> equals<00:00:28.509> 0<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.820> can<00:00:30.970> see<00:00:31.150> x<00:00:31.329> +<00:00:31.539> +

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
and y plus equals 0 so you can see x + +

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.630 
and y plus equals 0 so you can see x + +
y<00:00:31.810> +<00:00:31.839> are<00:00:32.259> simply<00:00:32.560> hidden<00:00:32.800> knobs<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.430> node

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
y + are simply hidden knobs of a node

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.750 
y + are simply hidden knobs of a node
and<00:00:33.910> you<00:00:34.510> can<00:00:34.690> use<00:00:34.900> any<00:00:35.170> knob<00:00:35.920> methods<00:00:36.400> on<00:00:36.580> them

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
and you can use any knob methods on them

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.630 
and you can use any knob methods on them
just<00:00:37.420> like<00:00:37.600> everything<00:00:37.900> else<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.100> remind

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
just like everything else so to remind

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.530 
just like everything else so to remind
myself<00:00:39.850> I'm<00:00:40.240> going<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.480> give<00:00:40.780> that<00:00:40.810> a<00:00:42.540> label

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
myself I'm going to give that a label

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.450 
myself I'm going to give that a label
called<00:00:44.020> 00<00:00:44.830> and<00:00:46.020> select<00:00:47.020> that<00:00:47.170> line<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.830> run

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
called 00 and select that line and run

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.490 
called 00 and select that line and run
that<00:00:48.700> will<00:00:49.030> give<00:00:49.270> us<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:49.600> no<00:00:49.780> op<00:00:49.930> node<00:00:50.170> in<00:00:50.440> the

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
that will give us a no op node in the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.650 
that will give us a no op node in the
node<00:00:50.950> graph<00:00:51.130> position<00:00:51.640> 00<00:00:52.120> so<00:00:52.330> let's<00:00:52.510> do<00:00:52.630> that

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
node graph position 00 so let's do that

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.400 
node graph position 00 so let's do that
again<00:00:52.840> for<00:00:53.260> a<00:00:53.290> second<00:00:53.680> one<00:00:53.830> cold<00:00:55.200> well<00:00:56.200> first

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
again for a second one cold well first

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.810 
again for a second one cold well first
of<00:00:56.530> all<00:00:56.620> n<00:00:56.830> 2<00:00:57.610> and<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:58.750> will<00:00:59.140> live<00:00:59.500> in<00:00:59.530> x<00:00:59.980> +<00:01:00.220> 200

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
of all n 2 and that will live in x + 200

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.619 
of all n 2 and that will live in x + 200
+<00:01:01.030> y<00:01:01.660> +<00:01:02.550> 200<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.820> label<00:01:04.059> should<00:01:04.330> read

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
+ y + 200 and the label should read

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.149 
+ y + 200 and the label should read
exactly<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:06.899> ok<00:01:07.899> so<00:01:08.200> let's<00:01:08.560> run<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:08.920> and

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
exactly that ok so let's run that and

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.880 
exactly that ok so let's run that and
that<00:01:09.579> will<00:01:09.759> create<00:01:10.149> a<00:01:10.450> second<00:01:11.380> no<00:01:11.530> up<00:01:11.679> down

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
that will create a second no up down

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.010 
that will create a second no up down
here<00:01:11.920> at<00:01:12.310> 200<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.820> 100<00:01:13.179> so<00:01:13.329> you<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.600> see<00:01:13.810> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
here at 200 to 100 so you can see the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.230 
here at 200 to 100 so you can see the
note<00:01:14.289> graphs<00:01:14.679> coordinate<00:01:15.609> system<00:01:15.939> is<00:01:16.030> sort<00:01:16.210> of

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
note graphs coordinate system is sort of

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.059 
note graphs coordinate system is sort of
upside<00:01:16.539> down<00:01:16.780> from<00:01:17.200> what<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.590> viewer<00:01:17.829> is

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:18.069 
upside down from what the viewer is

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.029 
upside down from what the viewer is
meaning<00:01:18.549> that<00:01:18.759> positive<00:01:19.749> Y<00:01:20.140> values<00:01:20.710> will

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
meaning that positive Y values will

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.370 
meaning that positive Y values will
position<00:01:21.909> nodes<00:01:22.299> further<00:01:22.630> down<00:01:22.929> in<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.229> node

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
position nodes further down in the node

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.330 
position nodes further down in the node
graph<00:01:23.560> rather<00:01:24.069> than<00:01:24.219> further<00:01:24.520> up<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:27.159> now

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
graph rather than further up so now

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.219 
graph rather than further up so now
let's<00:01:27.579> give<00:01:28.030> ourselves<00:01:28.149> another<00:01:28.869> thing<00:01:29.140> to

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
let's give ourselves another thing to

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.300 
let's give ourselves another thing to
play<00:01:29.439> with<00:01:29.649> I'm<00:01:29.829> going<00:01:29.979> to<00:01:30.039> call<00:01:30.280> that

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
play with I'm going to call that

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.550 
play with I'm going to call that
variable<00:01:30.789> marker<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.479> I<00:01:32.319> will<00:01:32.499> assign<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.249> note

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
variable marker and I will assign a note

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.929 
variable marker and I will assign a note
to<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:35.979> can<00:01:36.280> create<00:01:36.490> itself

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
to it and that can create itself

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.929 
to it and that can create itself
wherever<00:01:37.450> at<00:01:37.719> once<00:01:38.079> too<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:39.700> over

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
wherever at once too so that's over

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.989 
wherever at once too so that's over
there<00:01:40.090> now<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.829> position<00:01:41.829> nodes<00:01:42.340> after

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
there now to position nodes after

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:45.330 
there now to position nodes after
they've<00:01:43.149> been<00:01:43.359> created<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.170> can<00:01:44.350> use<00:01:44.740> either

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
they've been created we can use either

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.859 
they've been created we can use either
their<00:01:45.789> norb<00:01:46.389> objects<00:01:48.539> like<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:51.659> set<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.689> new

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
their norb objects like so and set a new

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.580 
their norb objects like so and set a new
value<00:01:53.319> for<00:01:53.740> them

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.230 

that<00:01:57.590> will<00:01:57.799> work<00:01:57.829> just<00:01:58.159> fine<00:01:58.280> however<00:01:58.820> there

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
that will work just fine however there

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.149 
that will work just fine however there
are<00:01:59.359> a<00:01:59.390> few<00:01:59.659> methods<00:01:59.869> attached<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.799> node

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
are a few methods attached to node

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.560 
are a few methods attached to node
objects<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:01.820> will<00:02:02.000> make<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.299> sort<00:02:02.509> of

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
objects that will make that sort of

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.690 
objects that will make that sort of
thing<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.780> lot<00:02:02.869> easier<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:04.369> particular

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
thing a lot easier and that particular

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.639 
thing a lot easier and that particular
one<00:02:05.030> is<00:02:05.509> called<00:02:05.899> simply<00:02:06.259> set<00:02:06.619> X<00:02:06.860> pulse

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
one is called simply set X pulse

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.119 
one is called simply set X pulse
actually<00:02:09.649> with<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:09.800> capital<00:02:10.099> X<00:02:11.319> Excel<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.530> if

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
actually with a capital X Excel and if

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.390 
actually with a capital X Excel and if
we<00:02:13.310> give<00:02:13.879> that<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.120> new<00:02:14.330> value<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.019> run<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.410> it

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
we give that a new value and run that it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.180 
we give that a new value and run that it
will<00:02:16.640> work<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:17.510> as<00:02:17.690> good<00:02:17.750> except<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.069> lot

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
will work just as good except it's a lot

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.390 
will work just as good except it's a lot
less<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.519> type<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.840> position<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.799> in<00:02:21.950> Y<00:02:22.129> of

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
less to type so to position it in Y of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.440 
less to type so to position it in Y of
obviously<00:02:22.910> we<00:02:23.209> could<00:02:23.390> do<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.840> same<00:02:24.049> thing<00:02:25.450> set

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
obviously we could do the same thing set

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.850 
obviously we could do the same thing set
y<00:02:26.599> plus<00:02:26.900> run<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.829> again<00:02:29.319> however<00:02:30.319> there<00:02:30.739> is

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
y plus run that again however there is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.740 
y plus run that again however there is
yet<00:02:31.130> another<00:02:31.310> handy<00:02:31.910> method<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.540> is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
yet another handy method and that is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.100 
yet another handy method and that is
called<00:02:32.989> set<00:02:33.349> XY<00:02:33.920> plus<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.519> we<00:02:34.670> only<00:02:34.819> have<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.420> do

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
called set XY plus so we only have to do

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.490 
called set XY plus so we only have to do
one<00:02:36.140> command<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:37.910> can<00:02:38.269> assign<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:39.079> new<00:02:39.290> x

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
one command and we can assign a new x

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.699 
one command and we can assign a new x
value<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.340> new<00:02:40.459> Y<00:02:40.910> value<00:02:41.569> and<00:02:41.810> run<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.500> all

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
value and a new Y value and run that all

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.130 
value and a new Y value and run that all
at<00:02:42.890> once<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:44.150> will<00:02:44.299> position<00:02:44.630> our<00:02:44.840> node

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
at once and that will position our node

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.059 
at once and that will position our node
in<00:02:45.410> both<00:02:46.010> directions<00:02:46.450> now<00:02:47.450> if<00:02:47.569> we<00:02:47.690> wanted<00:02:47.959> to

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
in both directions now if we wanted to

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.069 
in both directions now if we wanted to
assign<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.459> new<00:02:49.970> position<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.569> line<00:02:50.780> up<00:02:50.930> that

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
assign a new position to line up that

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.410 
assign a new position to line up that
node<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.310> right<00:02:52.519> side<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.910> know<00:02:53.150> up<00:02:53.299> to

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
node to the right side of the know up to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.619 
node to the right side of the know up to
node<00:02:53.750> we'd<00:02:54.530> have<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:55.030> find<00:02:56.030> out<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.480> no

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
node we'd have to find out what the no

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.470 
node we'd have to find out what the no
of<00:02:56.780> two<00:02:57.019> nodes<00:02:57.260> screen<00:02:57.890> width<00:02:58.069> is<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.640> that's

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
of two nodes screen width is and that's

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.000 
of two nodes screen width is and that's
pretty<00:02:59.660> easy<00:02:59.780> because<00:03:00.109> there<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.769> node

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
pretty easy because there is a node

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.160 
pretty easy because there is a node
method<00:03:01.250> called<00:03:01.609> screen<00:03:02.000> widths<00:03:02.389> so<00:03:02.660> we<00:03:02.810> simply

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
method called screen widths so we simply

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.349 
method called screen widths so we simply
access<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.769> i'll<00:03:04.609> create<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.090> variable

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
access that i'll create a variable

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.300 
access that i'll create a variable
called<00:03:05.630> width<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.440> will<00:03:06.620> hold<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.100> know

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
called width and that will hold the know

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.500 
called width and that will hold the know
of<00:03:07.459> two<00:03:07.730> nodes<00:03:08.060> screen<00:03:08.930> width<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:10.299> that<00:03:11.299> will

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
of two nodes screen width and that will

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.259 
of two nodes screen width and that will
give<00:03:11.750> me<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.959> notes<00:03:12.590> width<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.549> pixels<00:03:13.609> at

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
give me the notes width in pixels at

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.870 
give me the notes width in pixels at
zoom<00:03:14.569> level<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.730> now<00:03:16.940> if<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.299> go<00:03:18.489> Marcus<00:03:19.489> at

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
zoom level one so now if I go Marcus at

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.129 
zoom level one so now if I go Marcus at
X<00:03:20.030> plus<00:03:21.970> we'll<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.209> grab<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.720> current

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
X plus we'll just grab the current

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.210 
X plus we'll just grab the current
market<00:03:24.380> position<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.370> we'll<00:03:26.079> go<00:03:27.079> market<00:03:27.739> X

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
market position so we'll go market X

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.069 
market position so we'll go market X
plus<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:28.849> once<00:03:29.060> again<00:03:29.209> there<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:29.630> shortcut

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
plus so once again there is a shortcut

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.710 
plus so once again there is a shortcut
method<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.620> retrieve<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.670> exposition<00:03:32.299> of<00:03:32.329> a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
method to retrieve the exposition of a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.120 
method to retrieve the exposition of a
node<00:03:32.930> rather<00:03:33.260> than<00:03:33.410> having<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.709> go<00:03:33.920> through

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
node rather than having to go through

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.420 
node rather than having to go through
the<00:03:34.220> noble<00:03:34.519> object<00:03:34.819> and<00:03:35.000> we'll<00:03:35.540> add<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:37.190> width

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the noble object and we'll add the width

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.949 
the noble object and we'll add the width
which<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.359> no<00:03:38.720> op<00:03:38.900> node<00:03:39.139> screen<00:03:39.620> width<00:03:39.829> and

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
which is the no op node screen width and

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.839 
which is the no op node screen width and
we<00:03:41.959> run<00:03:42.849> both<00:03:43.849> lines<00:03:44.120> here<00:03:45.160> will<00:03:46.160> now<00:03:46.370> position

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
we run both lines here will now position

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.430 
we run both lines here will now position
the<00:03:46.940> market<00:03:47.329> to<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.599> right<00:03:47.750> side<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.230> it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
the market to the right side of it

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.069 
the market to the right side of it
obviously<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.579> same<00:03:49.819> works<00:03:50.120> for<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.870> height

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
obviously the same works for the height

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.550 
obviously the same works for the height
and<00:03:51.349> screen<00:03:52.010> height<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.549> set<00:03:52.910> y<00:03:53.120> paz<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.630> so

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
and screen height and set y paz and so

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.580 
and screen height and set y paz and so
on<00:03:54.709> cell<00:03:55.040> if<00:03:55.069> i<00:03:55.540> keep<00:03:56.540> adding<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.230> screen

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
on cell if i keep adding the screen

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.349 
on cell if i keep adding the screen
width<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.190> markers<00:03:58.579> current<00:03:58.940> position

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
width to the markers current position

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.330 
width to the markers current position
will<00:03:59.540> just<00:03:59.810> keep<00:04:00.230> moving<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.709> over<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.220> the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
will just keep moving it over to the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.250 
will just keep moving it over to the
right<00:04:01.519> more<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.030> more<00:04:02.209> now<00:04:02.870> let's<00:04:03.079> have<00:04:03.169> a

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
right more and more now let's have a

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.719 
right more and more now let's have a
quick<00:04:03.470> look<00:04:03.500> at<00:04:03.709> how<00:04:03.949> to<00:04:04.009> control<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.549> node

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
quick look at how to control the node

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.030 
quick look at how to control the node
graph<00:04:04.910> itself<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:06.229> is<00:04:06.380> pretty<00:04:06.590> much<00:04:06.769> one

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
graph itself and that is pretty much one

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.220 
graph itself and that is pretty much one
method<00:04:07.430> called<00:04:07.790> nuke<00:04:08.389> Tatsu

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
method called nuke Tatsu

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.070 
method called nuke Tatsu
you<00:04:09.409> just<00:04:09.920> run<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.310> without<00:04:10.430> any<00:04:10.700> arguments<00:04:11.300> it

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
you just run it without any arguments it

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.690 
you just run it without any arguments it
will<00:04:12.260> simply<00:04:12.709> return<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.069> current<00:04:13.489> zoom

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
will simply return the current zoom

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.920 
will simply return the current zoom
level<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.299> dag<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:15.230> if<00:04:15.379> we<00:04:15.500> bump<00:04:15.709> that<00:04:15.920> up

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
level of the dag so if we bump that up

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.840 
level of the dag so if we bump that up
we<00:04:17.930> will<00:04:18.169> zoom<00:04:18.380> in<00:04:19.070> if<00:04:20.169> we<00:04:21.169> lower<00:04:21.799> that<00:04:22.100> go

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
we will zoom in if we lower that go

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.520 
we will zoom in if we lower that go
below<00:04:23.540> one<00:04:24.080> will<00:04:25.040> zoom<00:04:25.580> out<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:26.199> if<00:04:27.199> we<00:04:27.260> give

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
below one will zoom out and if we give

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.460 
below one will zoom out and if we give
it<00:04:27.650> another<00:04:28.120> argument<00:04:29.120> which<00:04:29.479> is<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.660> couple<00:04:30.320> or

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
it another argument which is a couple or

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.520 
it another argument which is a couple or
a<00:04:30.500> list<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:31.010> X&amp;Y<00:04:31.880> positions<00:04:32.479> will<00:04:32.720> define<00:04:33.229> its

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
a list of X&amp;Y positions will define its

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.379 
a list of X&amp;Y positions will define its
center<00:04:33.860> points<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.430> if<00:04:34.669> I<00:04:34.850> want<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.150> zoom

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
center points so if I want to zoom

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.300 
center points so if I want to zoom
around<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:36.169> marker<00:04:36.590> note<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:37.010> is<00:04:37.130> now

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
around that marker note that is now

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
around that marker note that is now
living<00:04:37.870> way<00:04:38.870> over<00:04:39.139> here<00:04:39.410> I<00:04:39.639> can<00:04:40.639> simply<00:04:40.970> go<00:04:41.120> all

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
living way over here I can simply go all

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.689 
living way over here I can simply go all
market<00:04:41.930> or<00:04:42.080> expose<00:04:45.520> oops<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:47.560> marker<00:04:48.560> dot<00:04:49.340> y

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
market or expose oops and marker dot y

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.430 
market or expose oops and marker dot y
Paz<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:53.030> set<00:04:53.270> has<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.720> be<00:04:53.840> either<00:04:54.199> a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
Paz and that set has to be either a

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.890 
Paz and that set has to be either a
couple<00:04:55.039> or<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.430> list<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.120> I'm<00:04:56.449> putting<00:04:56.810> it

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
couple or a list so I I'm putting it

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.629 
couple or a list so I I'm putting it
into<00:04:57.130> parenthesis<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:59.229> running<00:05:00.229> that<00:05:00.380> line

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
into parenthesis and running that line

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.480 
into parenthesis and running that line
will<00:05:01.639> Center<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.750> marker<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.380> zoom<00:05:03.979> to<00:05:04.220> zoom

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
will Center the marker and zoom to zoom

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.730 
will Center the marker and zoom to zoom
level<00:05:04.760> of<00:05:04.880> point<00:05:05.240> five<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:05.870> if<00:05:05.990> we<00:05:06.199> bump<00:05:06.440> that

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
level of point five so if we bump that

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.439 
level of point five so if we bump that
up<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.889> a<00:05:07.490> level<00:05:07.699> of<00:05:07.880> three<00:05:09.789> will<00:05:10.789> zoom<00:05:11.180> into

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
up to a level of three will zoom into

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.620 
up to a level of three will zoom into
that<00:05:11.750> marker<00:05:12.199> and<00:05:12.700> one<00:05:13.700> last<00:05:13.880> thing<00:05:14.120> about<00:05:14.330> the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
that marker and one last thing about the

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.110 
that marker and one last thing about the
new<00:05:14.810> Claude<00:05:15.050> zoom<00:05:15.260> command<00:05:15.440> if<00:05:16.280> you<00:05:16.639> only<00:05:16.820> run

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
new Claude zoom command if you only run

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.629 
new Claude zoom command if you only run
it<00:05:17.210> with<00:05:17.360> one<00:05:17.570> argument<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.380> that<00:05:18.639> argument

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
it with one argument and that argument

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.420 
it with one argument and that argument
is<00:05:19.760> either<00:05:20.000> 0<00:05:20.660> or<00:05:20.750> negative<00:05:21.310> then<00:05:22.310> you're

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
is either 0 or negative then you're

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.990 
is either 0 or negative then you're
basically<00:05:22.580> performing<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.450> zoom<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.810> fit<00:05:25.000> which

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
basically performing a zoom to fit which

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.650 
basically performing a zoom to fit which
is<00:05:26.150> kind<00:05:26.360> of<00:05:26.419> handy<00:05:27.910> so<00:05:28.910> now<00:05:29.060> let's<00:05:29.270> just<00:05:29.419> clean

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
is kind of handy so now let's just clean

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.370 
is kind of handy so now let's just clean
up<00:05:29.690> after<00:05:30.110> ourselves<00:05:30.139> using<00:05:30.680> nuke<00:05:31.039> delete<00:05:31.520> and

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
up after ourselves using nuke delete and

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.560 
up after ourselves using nuke delete and
nuke<00:05:33.380> dot<00:05:33.830> all<00:05:34.010> nodes<00:05:34.370> will<00:05:34.849> give<00:05:35.060> us<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.360> list

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
nuke dot all nodes will give us a list

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.240 
nuke dot all nodes will give us a list
of<00:05:35.720> all<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.080> nodes<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.410> root<00:05:36.620> level<00:05:36.800> so<00:05:37.070> we'll

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
of all the nodes and root level so we'll

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.580 
of all the nodes and root level so we'll
loop<00:05:37.520> through<00:05:37.789> them<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.710> as<00:05:39.710> we<00:05:40.490> go<00:05:41.410> we<00:05:42.410> will

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
loop through them and as we go we will

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.159 
loop through them and as we go we will
use<00:05:42.770> nuke<00:05:43.039> to<00:05:43.400> lead<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:44.090> delete<00:05:44.419> every<00:05:44.750> single

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
use nuke to lead to delete every single

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.770 
use nuke to lead to delete every single
node<00:05:45.560> on<00:05:45.800> root<00:05:46.310> level<00:05:46.520> like<00:05:47.060> so<00:05:49.330> it<00:05:50.330> cleans<00:05:50.630> up

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
node on root level like so it cleans up

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.020 
node on root level like so it cleans up
the<00:05:50.930> node<00:05:51.139> graph<00:05:51.340> now<00:05:52.340> that<00:05:52.520> was<00:05:52.639> all<00:05:52.820> a<00:05:52.849> bit

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
the node graph now that was all a bit

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.850 
the node graph now that was all a bit
dry<00:05:53.300> and<00:05:53.330> boring<00:05:53.690> so<00:05:54.110> let's<00:05:54.139> have<00:05:54.470> some<00:05:54.650> fun

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
dry and boring so let's have some fun

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:03.230 
dry and boring so let's have some fun
with<00:05:55.010> this

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.310 

but<00:06:04.240> you<00:06:04.300> can<00:06:04.480> actually<00:06:04.600> do<00:06:04.840> something<00:06:05.080> useful

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
but you can actually do something useful

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.960 
but you can actually do something useful
with<00:06:05.530> all<00:06:05.800> of<00:06:05.920> this<00:06:06.010> as<00:06:06.160> well<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:06.580> let's<00:06:06.790> have<00:06:06.910> a

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
with all of this as well so let's have a

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.850 
with all of this as well so let's have a
look<00:06:07.090> at<00:06:07.150> something<00:06:07.360> more<00:06:07.570> practical<00:06:07.860> I've

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
look at something more practical I've

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.530 
look at something more practical I've
got<00:06:09.070> a<00:06:09.100> little<00:06:09.280> function<00:06:09.580> here<00:06:09.850> called<00:06:09.880> scale

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
got a little function here called scale

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.230 
got a little function here called scale
nodes<00:06:10.900> which<00:06:11.860> takes<00:06:12.190> a<00:06:12.490> single<00:06:12.940> argument

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
nodes which takes a single argument

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.740 
nodes which takes a single argument
which<00:06:14.140> is<00:06:14.320> a<00:06:14.350> scale<00:06:14.980> factor<00:06:15.190> so<00:06:15.820> i'll<00:06:15.940> put<00:06:16.150> 1.2

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
which is a scale factor so i'll put 1.2

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.280 
which is a scale factor so i'll put 1.2
as<00:06:16.960> in<00:06:17.320> one<00:06:17.770> hundred<00:06:17.860> and<00:06:18.070> twenty<00:06:18.370> percent<00:06:18.640> and

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
as in one hundred and twenty percent and

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.870 
as in one hundred and twenty percent and
the<00:06:20.290> function<00:06:20.740> operates<00:06:21.100> on<00:06:21.190> a<00:06:21.250> selection<00:06:21.640> of

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
the function operates on a selection of

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.580 
the function operates on a selection of
notes<00:06:22.090> i'll<00:06:22.360> select<00:06:22.630> a<00:06:22.870> bunch<00:06:23.020> of<00:06:23.140> notes<00:06:23.260> here

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
notes i'll select a bunch of notes here

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.980 
notes i'll select a bunch of notes here
and<00:06:23.740> then<00:06:24.010> run<00:06:24.280> that<00:06:24.490> function<00:06:25.120> on<00:06:25.270> it<00:06:25.420> and<00:06:25.570> you

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
and then run that function on it and you

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.230 
and then run that function on it and you
see<00:06:26.200> it<00:06:26.440> will<00:06:26.650> scale<00:06:27.160> the<00:06:27.370> nodes<00:06:27.580> outwards

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
see it will scale the nodes outwards

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.990 
see it will scale the nodes outwards
from<00:06:28.360> their<00:06:28.630> common<00:06:28.870> center<00:06:28.900> or<00:06:29.560> if<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.700> scale

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
from their common center or if the scale

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.380 
from their common center or if the scale
factor<00:06:31.240> is<00:06:31.540> smaller<00:06:31.840> than<00:06:32.050> one<00:06:32.260> it<00:06:32.800> will<00:06:33.760> make

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
factor is smaller than one it will make

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.450 
factor is smaller than one it will make
them<00:06:34.600> move<00:06:35.260> towards<00:06:35.800> each<00:06:35.920> other<00:06:36.040> so<00:06:36.340> that's

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
them move towards each other so that's

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.130 
them move towards each other so that's
actually<00:06:36.820> quite<00:06:36.940> handy<00:06:37.360> in<00:06:37.480> production<00:06:37.930> to

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
actually quite handy in production to

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.750 
actually quite handy in production to
clean<00:06:38.650> up<00:06:38.800> your<00:06:38.830> scripts<00:06:39.340> or<00:06:39.460> to<00:06:39.610> give

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
clean up your scripts or to give

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.210 
clean up your scripts or to give
yourself<00:06:39.850> a<00:06:40.210> bit<00:06:40.360> more<00:06:40.510> room<00:06:40.750> when<00:06:41.230> you<00:06:41.440> find

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
yourself a bit more room when you find

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.340 
yourself a bit more room when you find
yourself<00:06:42.340> in<00:06:42.760> need<00:06:42.850> of<00:06:43.090> space<00:06:43.510> so<00:06:44.050> let's<00:06:44.230> have

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
yourself in need of space so let's have

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.390 
yourself in need of space so let's have
a<00:06:44.440> look<00:06:44.470> at<00:06:44.740> how<00:06:44.950> the<00:06:45.010> script<00:06:45.520> is<00:06:45.670> put<00:06:45.880> together

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
a look at how the script is put together

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.790 
a look at how the script is put together
it's<00:06:48.400> actually<00:06:48.760> nothing<00:06:49.450> more<00:06:49.720> than<00:06:49.810> that<00:06:49.900> so

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
it's actually nothing more than that so

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.460 
it's actually nothing more than that so
let's<00:06:50.950> go<00:06:51.100> through<00:06:51.130> it<00:06:52.080> first<00:06:53.080> of<00:06:53.230> all<00:06:53.320> we

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
let's go through it first of all we

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.250 
let's go through it first of all we
determine<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.910> current<00:06:55.510> node<00:06:55.900> selection

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
determine the current node selection

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.870 
determine the current node selection
which<00:06:56.530> gives<00:06:56.800> us<00:06:56.920> a<00:06:57.040> list<00:06:57.280> of<00:06:57.580> all<00:06:57.730> the

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
which gives us a list of all the

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.990 
which gives us a list of all the
selected<00:06:58.150> nodes<00:06:58.420> we<00:06:58.930> then<00:06:59.140> grab<00:06:59.550> the<00:07:00.550> amount

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
selected nodes we then grab the amount

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.940 
selected nodes we then grab the amount
as<00:07:01.270> in<00:07:01.420> how<00:07:01.630> many<00:07:01.690> nodes<00:07:02.080> are<00:07:02.290> selected<00:07:02.770> if

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
as in how many nodes are selected if

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.740 
as in how many nodes are selected if
nothing<00:07:03.280> is<00:07:03.370> selected<00:07:03.580> we<00:07:04.030> just<00:07:04.240> quit<00:07:04.360> so<00:07:04.660> we

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
nothing is selected we just quit so we

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.120 
nothing is selected we just quit so we
don't<00:07:04.930> do<00:07:05.020> anything<00:07:05.080> otherwise<00:07:05.830> we<00:07:06.040> will

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
don't do anything otherwise we will

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.120 
don't do anything otherwise we will
proceed<00:07:06.340> and<00:07:07.290> initialize<00:07:08.290> two<00:07:08.620> variables

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
proceed and initialize two variables

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.570 
proceed and initialize two variables
called<00:07:09.370> all<00:07:09.640> X<00:07:09.850> and<00:07:10.120> all<00:07:10.240> I<00:07:10.450> to<00:07:11.200> then<00:07:11.860> hold<00:07:12.280> all

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
called all X and all I to then hold all

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.820 
called all X and all I to then hold all
the<00:07:12.880> nodes<00:07:13.060> x<00:07:13.480> and<00:07:13.810> y<00:07:13.900> positions<00:07:14.380> collectively

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
the nodes x and y positions collectively

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.190 
the nodes x and y positions collectively
so<00:07:15.130> we<00:07:15.250> loop<00:07:15.430> through<00:07:15.460> the<00:07:15.700> nodes<00:07:15.970> and<00:07:16.240> we

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.200 
so we loop through the nodes and we

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.240 
so we loop through the nodes and we
gather<00:07:17.650> and<00:07:18.070> add<00:07:19.030> as<00:07:19.390> we<00:07:19.540> go<00:07:19.720> all<00:07:20.080> the<00:07:20.680> x<00:07:20.890> and<00:07:21.100> y

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
gather and add as we go all the x and y

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.700 
gather and add as we go all the x and y
positions<00:07:21.790> once<00:07:22.540> we've<00:07:22.720> got<00:07:22.750> that<00:07:22.960> we<00:07:23.500> can

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.710 
positions once we've got that we can

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.580 
positions once we've got that we can
then<00:07:23.950> divide<00:07:24.790> the<00:07:25.330> result<00:07:25.510> by<00:07:25.840> the<00:07:26.140> amount<00:07:26.440> of

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
then divide the result by the amount of

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.100 
then divide the result by the amount of
notes<00:07:26.770> we<00:07:26.920> have<00:07:27.190> to<00:07:27.460> find<00:07:27.850> the<00:07:28.420> common<00:07:28.750> center

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110 
notes we have to find the common center

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.380 
notes we have to find the common center
point<00:07:29.410> in<00:07:29.590> x<00:07:29.890> and<00:07:30.010> y<00:07:30.220> once<00:07:30.970> we've<00:07:31.120> got<00:07:31.150> the

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:31.390 
point in x and y once we've got the

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.210 
point in x and y once we've got the
center<00:07:31.690> point<00:07:31.900> we<00:07:32.290> can<00:07:32.470> then<00:07:32.680> loop<00:07:33.010> through

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220 
center point we can then loop through

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.400 
center point we can then loop through
all<00:07:33.250> the<00:07:33.400> nodes<00:07:33.550> again<00:07:33.910> to<00:07:34.120> reassign<00:07:34.600> their

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:35.410 
all the nodes again to reassign their

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.700 
all the nodes again to reassign their
node<00:07:35.860> positions<00:07:36.430> as<00:07:36.670> a<00:07:36.730> result<00:07:37.720> of<00:07:37.900> the<00:07:38.380> common

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
node positions as a result of the common

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.700 
node positions as a result of the common
center<00:07:39.100> and<00:07:39.310> each<00:07:39.820> nodes<00:07:40.300> distance<00:07:41.290> to<00:07:41.560> that

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710 
center and each nodes distance to that

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.540 
center and each nodes distance to that
center<00:07:42.130> which<00:07:43.350> this<00:07:44.350> alone<00:07:44.740> wouldn't<00:07:45.280> change

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 
center which this alone wouldn't change

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.100 
center which this alone wouldn't change
anything<00:07:45.940> in<00:07:46.240> the<00:07:46.300> script<00:07:46.570> because<00:07:46.720> every

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.110 
anything in the script because every

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.900 
anything in the script because every
node<00:07:47.290> would<00:07:47.620> stay<00:07:48.070> exactly<00:07:48.280> where<00:07:48.580> it<00:07:48.760> was

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:48.910 
node would stay exactly where it was

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.660 
node would stay exactly where it was
except<00:07:49.690> we're<00:07:50.260> multiplying<00:07:50.560> by<00:07:51.220> the<00:07:51.250> scale

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:51.670 
except we're multiplying by the scale

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.160 
except we're multiplying by the scale
factor<00:07:51.910> that<00:07:52.180> you<00:07:52.300> can<00:07:52.480> feed<00:07:52.750> into<00:07:53.050> this

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.170 
factor that you can feed into this

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:58.290 
factor that you can feed into this
function<00:07:53.380> and<00:07:53.740> that<00:07:53.770> will<00:07:54.520> allow<00:07:54.790> us<00:07:54.820> to<00:07:57.300> scale

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:58.300 
function and that will allow us to scale

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.530 
function and that will allow us to scale
the<00:07:59.020> nodes<00:07:59.260> as<00:07:59.500> we<00:07:59.860> just<00:08:00.040> saw<00:08:00.250> so<00:08:01.060> you<00:08:01.120> see<00:08:01.360> this

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:01.540 
the nodes as we just saw so you see this

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.000 
the nodes as we just saw so you see this
is<00:08:01.600> really<00:08:01.930> quite<00:08:02.200> handy<00:08:02.560> and<00:08:02.770> there's<00:08:02.950> a

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.010 
is really quite handy and there's a

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.290 
is really quite handy and there's a
whole<00:08:03.220> lot<00:08:03.340> of<00:08:03.370> other<00:08:03.490> things<00:08:03.820> you<00:08:03.940> can<00:08:04.060> do

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.300 
whole lot of other things you can do

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.990 
whole lot of other things you can do
like<00:08:04.660> aligning<00:08:05.620> nodes<00:08:05.980> horizontally<00:08:06.910> and

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 
like aligning nodes horizontally and

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.760 
like aligning nodes horizontally and
vertically<00:08:07.360> or<00:08:07.720> mirroring<00:08:08.230> the<00:08:08.260> whole<00:08:08.530> node

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:08.770 
vertically or mirroring the whole node

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.220 
vertically or mirroring the whole node
graph<00:08:08.980> if<00:08:09.340> you<00:08:09.790> like<00:08:09.970> and<00:08:10.210> all<00:08:10.750> of<00:08:10.900> this<00:08:11.020> is

graph if you like and all of this is

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.930 
graph if you like and all of this is
simply

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 
simply

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.220 
simply
on<00:08:12.180> finding<00:08:12.960> and<00:08:13.080> setting<00:08:13.380> node<00:08:13.710> positions
