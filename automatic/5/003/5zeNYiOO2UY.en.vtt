00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.800
 standard situation after stopping 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.320
 fan in products air flow 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.459
 turned out less than expected 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.319
 how is this explained first 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:16.299
 specified documentation 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.169
 parameter values ​​were determined at 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.400
 optimal constants 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.359
 emitted measurement conditions second to 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.579
 practice ideally provided installation in 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.689
 which fan freely cleans and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.220
 giving out the deed can be found extremely 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.390
 rarely often these reactors should 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.920
 recover very close 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.720
 structural element walls 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
 body due to this may occur 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.839
 obstacles in inflow and outflow 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.699
 air resulting performance 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.800
 month and the noise level will increase especially 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 painful ahead because fans on 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 foreign objects in the making 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.460
 consequences before them what causes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.330
 tonal noise increase 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.810
 and reduce the negative impact 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.280
 structural elements 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.980
 a fan is needed so that 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.600
 fan spacing 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.340
 neighboring buildings were at least equal 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.350
 mounting ruby ​​fan 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.120
 under favorable installation conditions 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 no matter installed 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.870
 air inlet fan installation and 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.860
 at the exit of her work point 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.550
 it turns out the same thing 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.130
 except to ensure the required 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.030
 performance must be considered 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.590
 and other aspects for example being fostered from 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.530
 cooling systems or serves for ventilation 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.070
 with father flow integrator 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.590
 to a large extent nominally 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.990
 coming with my father under the wheelhouse space 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.380
 and vice versa passing stream integrators 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.310
 mostly tables and moves so far 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.140
 pore directions for example sow 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.830
 gooseneck turbulence fans 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.560
 amplified by the exchange we are given 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.799
 components therefore for cooling or 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.630
 on the contrary, heating is recommended 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.689
 set the fan on the supply 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.960
 air, that is, the country of origin of air 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.080
 installation 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.500
 besides the situation on the pressure side 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.490
 recommended for cooling devices 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.110
 because at the same time fans 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.470
 loaded and with typical losses then 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.110
 there is work and relatively little 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.110
 ambient temperature what 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.200
 provides long life 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.350
 services
