I<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:52.110> suggest<00:00:52.559> using<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:53.129> artist<00:00:53.430> brand<00:00:53.699> such

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I do suggest using an artist brand such

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700 
I do suggest using an artist brand such
as<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.300> sold<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.690> our<00:00:54.780> website<00:00:55.260> just

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
as the one sold on our website just

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.290 
as the one sold on our website just
because<00:00:56.010> they're<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.460> pigment<00:00:56.910> rich<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
because they're more pigment rich and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
because they're more pigment rich and
therefore<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> little<00:00:57.930> easier<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> work<00:00:58.770> with

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
therefore a little easier to work with

the sand paper to maintain my point as
much<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.930> possible<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.619> I'll<00:01:44.130> start

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
much as possible and I'll start

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.920 
much as possible and I'll start
scrubbing<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.119> stump<00:01:45.360> back<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> forth

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
scrubbing the stump back and forth

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
scrubbing the stump back and forth
against<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> sandpaper<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> turn<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.700> my

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
against the sandpaper as I turn it in my

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.450 
against the sandpaper as I turn it in my
hand<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.930> old<00:01:49.110> color<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.590> sort<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.890> lint<00:01:50.220> off

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
hand the old color will sort of lint off

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.429 
hand the old color will sort of lint off
leaving<00:01:51.210> me<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> clean<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.810> sharp<00:01:52.079> stop

so<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.159> good<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:54.140> I'll<00:01:55.159> take<00:01:56.159> my

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
so now I'm good to go I'll take my

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
so now I'm good to go I'll take my

I'm<00:02:11.560> starting<00:02:12.549> with<00:02:12.579> small<00:02:13.239> circles<00:02:13.870> right<00:02:14.319> on

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
I'm starting with small circles right on

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.869 
top of the line of color gas also
solvent<00:02:17.379> so<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> melts<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.040> wax<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.730> it

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
solvent so it melts the wax and it

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.640 
solvent so it melts the wax and it
allows<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.510> move<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.780> color<00:02:20.170> around<00:02:20.379> on

I've melted down my color with small

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.899 
I've melted down my color with small

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
circles then I continue to go around

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.690 
circles then I continue to go around
again<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.450> slowly<00:02:28.959> begin<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.650> enlarge<00:02:30.280> my

my circles bigger and bigger notice how
I<00:02:35.739> still<00:02:36.220> return<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.909> the<00:02:37.000> outside<00:02:37.180> edges

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
I still return to the outside edges

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
same process where I use small circles

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.289 
same process where I use small circles
first<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.799> melt<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.129> color<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.579> then<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.180> go

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
first to melt the color and then I go

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.300 
first to melt the color and then I go
back<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.659> make<00:03:04.810> larger<00:03:05.230> circles<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.799> drag<00:03:06.069> and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
back and make larger circles to drag and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.690 
back and make larger circles to drag and
pull<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.670> color<00:03:06.909> out<00:03:07.150> towards<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.720> middle

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
pull that color out towards the middle

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.619 
pull that color out towards the middle

blending the lightest color first now

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.159 
blending the lightest color first now
that<00:03:15.609> I've<00:03:15.730> got<00:03:15.940> my<00:03:15.970> light<00:03:16.329> green<00:03:16.629> layer<00:03:16.840> done

that I've got my light green layer done
I'm<00:03:17.410> adding<00:03:17.919> darker<00:03:18.280> green<00:03:18.549> accents<00:03:19.180> just<00:03:19.510> to

I'm adding darker green accents just to

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.420 
I'm adding darker green accents just to
add<00:03:19.720> even<00:03:19.930> more<00:03:20.049> depth<00:03:20.590> than<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:20.859> richer<00:03:21.220> look

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
add even more depth than a richer look

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.670 
add even more depth than a richer look
to<00:03:21.549> my<00:03:21.639> image<00:03:21.970> then<00:03:22.690> I'll<00:03:22.840> repeat<00:03:23.199> the<00:03:23.440> same

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
to my image then I'll repeat the same

blending process with the gamsol I don't

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.490 
blending process with the gamsol I don't
need<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.239> clean<00:03:28.449> and<00:03:28.599> sharpen<00:03:28.930> my<00:03:29.049> stump<00:03:29.379> at

need to clean and sharpen my stump at

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.990 
need to clean and sharpen my stump at
this<00:03:29.680> point<00:03:29.949> because<00:03:30.129> I'm<00:03:30.340> blending<00:03:30.609> together

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
this point because I'm blending together

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.330 
this point because I'm blending together
two<00:03:31.239> shades<00:03:31.540> from<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.840> same<00:03:32.049> color<00:03:32.319> family<00:03:32.409> so

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
two shades from the same color family so

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.800 
two shades from the same color family so
I'm<00:03:33.459> just<00:03:33.609> adding<00:03:33.819> a<00:03:33.970> bit<00:03:34.090> more<00:03:34.120> gams<00:03:34.480> out<00:03:34.690> of

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
I'm just adding a bit more gams out of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.710 
I'm just adding a bit more gams out of
the<00:03:34.870> stump<00:03:35.139> and<00:03:35.319> then<00:03:35.409> continuing<00:03:36.010> on<00:03:36.159> I

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
the stump and then continuing on I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.729 
the stump and then continuing on I
mentioned<00:03:37.720> earlier<00:03:37.989> that<00:03:38.049> gamsol<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.650> a

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
mentioned earlier that gamsol is a

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.619 
mentioned earlier that gamsol is a
solvent<00:03:39.340> which<00:03:39.400> means<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.970> doesn't<00:03:40.180> wet<00:03:40.479> the

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
solvent which means it doesn't wet the

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.089 
solvent which means it doesn't wet the
paper<00:03:40.810> but<00:03:41.199> instead<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.620> evaporates

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
paper but instead it evaporates

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.460 
paper but instead it evaporates
instantly<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:43.269> great<00:03:43.569> thing<00:03:43.840> about<00:03:43.870> that<00:03:44.229> is

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
instantly the great thing about that is

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.110 
instantly the great thing about that is
that<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.739> can<00:03:44.919> keep<00:03:45.099> building<00:03:45.280> layers<00:03:45.760> of

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
that you can keep building layers of

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.030 
that you can keep building layers of
color<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:46.569> continue<00:03:47.049> blending<00:03:47.379> as<00:03:47.739> much<00:03:47.889> as

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
color and continue blending as much as

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.559 
color and continue blending as much as
you<00:03:48.159> like<00:03:48.310> without<00:03:48.549> ever<00:03:48.819> having<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.329> worry

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569

about the paper pilling up or shredding

sometimes<00:04:29.420> ask<00:04:29.690> me<00:04:29.930> how<00:04:30.110> often<00:04:30.320> do<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.650> need

sometimes ask me how often do you need

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.650 
sometimes ask me how often do you need
to<00:04:30.830> reapply<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.580> GAM<00:04:31.850> saws<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.360> stop

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
to reapply the GAM saws of the stop

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.320 
to reapply the GAM saws of the stop
there<00:04:33.290> isn't<00:04:33.710> really<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:34.010> set<00:04:34.400> amount<00:04:34.580> but<00:04:35.210> what

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
there isn't really a set amount but what

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.210 
there isn't really a set amount but what
I<00:04:35.360> usually<00:04:35.420> say<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.200> start<00:04:36.500> with<00:04:36.650> less<00:04:36.950> and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
I usually say is to start with less and

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.550 
I usually say is to start with less and
you<00:04:37.310> can<00:04:37.460> always<00:04:37.670> add<00:04:37.970> more<00:04:38.000> as<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:39.230> work<00:04:39.440> with

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
you can always add more as you work with

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.770 
you can always add more as you work with
the<00:04:39.650> gamsol<00:04:40.100> you'll<00:04:40.460> develop<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.970> feel<00:04:41.360> for<00:04:41.660> how

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
the gamsol you'll develop a feel for how

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.020 
the gamsol you'll develop a feel for how
much<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.110> add<00:04:42.140> by<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.160> way<00:04:43.370> notice<00:04:43.640> how<00:04:43.850> I'm

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
much to add by the way notice how I'm

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.430 
much to add by the way notice how I'm
pointing<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.480> tip<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.840> stump<00:04:45.110> towards

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
pointing the tip of the stump towards

pointing the tip of the stump towards
the<00:04:45.530> edge<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:45.980> image<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.520> turning<00:04:47.030> the

the edge of the image and turning the

the edge of the image and turning the

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
paper to help with positioning I think

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.590 
paper to help with positioning I think
this<00:04:49.340> just<00:04:49.520> makes<00:04:49.760> it<00:04:49.880> easier<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.300> control

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
this just makes it easier to control

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.680 
this just makes it easier to control
where<00:04:51.230> I'm<00:04:51.350> blending<00:04:51.680> my<00:04:51.980> color<00:04:52.510> so<00:04:53.510> back<00:04:53.660> to

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
where I'm blending my color so back to

where I'm blending my color so back to
the<00:04:53.900> question<00:04:54.230> about<00:04:54.320> how<00:04:54.470> much<00:04:54.710> gamsol<00:04:55.220> to

the question about how much gamsol to

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.700 
the question about how much gamsol to
use<00:04:55.660> basically<00:04:56.660> when<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.020> feel<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.650> the

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
use basically when you feel that the
