cable and that's pretty much it then the

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.790 
cable and that's pretty much it then the
next<00:00:40.789> step<00:00:40.969> is<00:00:41.179> start<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:41.960> application<00:00:42.109> we're

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
next step is start the application we're

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.299 
next step is start the application we're
gonna<00:00:42.920> use<00:00:43.129> iAnnotate<00:00:43.489> first<00:00:45.100> which<00:00:46.100> is<00:00:46.280> a

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
gonna use iAnnotate first which is a

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.639 
gonna use iAnnotate first which is a
really<00:00:46.519> neat<00:00:46.730> application<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.719> I'm<00:00:47.839> liking

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
really neat application and I'm liking

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.169 
really neat application and I'm liking
it<00:00:48.679> very<00:00:48.739> much<00:00:49.039> because<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:49.519> can<00:00:49.550> highlight

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
it very much because you can highlight

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.759 
it very much because you can highlight
things<00:00:52.570> so<00:00:53.570> what<00:00:53.809> I<00:00:53.839> have<00:00:54.109> here<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.410> instead<00:00:54.710> of

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
things so what I have here is instead of

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.569 
things so what I have here is instead of
slides<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:55.699> downloaded<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:56.989> iPad

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
slides that I downloaded to the iPad

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.380 
slides that I downloaded to the iPad
previously<00:01:00.219> so<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.699> cool<00:01:01.879> thing<00:01:02.059> is<00:01:02.089> you<00:01:02.210> can

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
previously so the cool thing is you can

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.340 
previously so the cool thing is you can
scroll<00:01:02.899> through<00:01:02.960> these<00:01:03.320> slides<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:05.170> when<00:01:06.170> you

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
scroll through these slides and when you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.570 
scroll through these slides and when you
want<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.710> project<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:09.080> tap<00:01:10.040> on<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.280> tab

you get it looks perfect so I can lock
the<00:01:29.000> screen<00:01:29.300> here<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.230> don't<00:01:30.380> change

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
the screen here so that I don't change

the<00:01:31.460> width<00:01:31.640> of<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.000> slides<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.660> I<00:01:32.750> can<00:01:32.930> just

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
the width of the slides and I can just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.430 
the width of the slides and I can just
move<00:01:33.140> forward<00:01:33.590> page<00:01:34.100> by<00:01:34.340> page<00:01:35.110> go<00:01:36.110> through<00:01:36.350> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.479 
another cool feature is that I can
switch<00:02:25.690> easily<00:02:25.720> between<00:02:26.099> presentations<00:02:27.099> this

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
switch easily between presentations this

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.030 
switch easily between presentations this
readin<00:02:28.060> green<00:02:28.450> table<00:02:28.989> indicates<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.799> this

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
readin green table indicates that this

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.539 
readin green table indicates that this
tab<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.549> actually<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.870> projector<00:02:32.379> now<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
tab is actually on the projector now I

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.369 
tab is actually on the projector now I
can<00:02:34.209> prepare<00:02:34.959> another<00:02:35.709> slide<00:02:36.610> show<00:02:36.910> while<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
can prepare another slide show while the

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.789 
can prepare another slide show while the
current<00:02:38.799> slide<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.220> being<00:02:39.940> presented<00:02:40.799> and

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
current slide is being presented and

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.680 
current slide is being presented and
once<00:02:41.950> I'm<00:02:42.129> ready<00:02:42.310> let's<00:02:43.030> say<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.209> want<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.540> show

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
once I'm ready let's say I want to show

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
this little paper or this graph here I'm

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.509 
this little paper or this graph here I'm
gonna<00:02:47.260> end<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.739> presentation<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.430> the

what else immediately on the screen will
be<00:02:56.079> that<00:02:56.440> will<00:02:56.620> be<00:02:56.650> discipline<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:59.319> is<00:02:59.530> how

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
be that will be discipline this is how

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.309 
be that will be discipline this is how
it<00:02:59.739> looks

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
it looks

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.780 
it looks
the<00:03:02.319> other<00:03:02.500> application<00:03:03.069> I<00:03:03.160> want<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.400> show<00:03:03.579> is

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
the other application I want to show is

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.270 
the other application I want to show is
whiteboard<00:03:04.450> HT<00:03:04.870> which<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.349> as<00:03:05.650> its<00:03:05.890> name<00:03:06.069> says

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
whiteboard HT which is as its name says

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.479 
whiteboard HT which is as its name says
a<00:03:06.340> whiteboard<00:03:07.920> whatever<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:08.980> see<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.370> the

a whiteboard whatever I see on the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.520 
a whiteboard whatever I see on the
screen<00:03:09.790> here<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> iPad<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.200> see

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
screen here on the iPad I can see

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.659 
screen here on the iPad I can see
immediately<00:03:11.829> on<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.400> projector<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.519> is

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
immediately on the projector so this is

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.409 
immediately on the projector so this is
great<00:03:15.970> for<00:03:16.000> brainstorming<00:03:16.840> for

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
great for brainstorming for

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.479 
great for brainstorming for
collaborative<00:03:19.419> editing<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.459> whatnot

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
collaborative editing and whatnot

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.259

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
meetings and that kind of things so I

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.129 
meetings and that kind of things so I
can<00:03:25.510> draw<00:03:25.720> little<00:03:25.900> things<00:03:27.870> diagrams<00:03:28.870> use<00:03:29.349> text

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
can draw little things diagrams use text

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:38.610 
can draw little things diagrams use text
the<00:03:32.139> text<00:03:32.400> module<00:03:33.959> just<00:03:37.470> use<00:03:38.470> different

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
the text module just use different

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.539 
the text module just use different
colors<00:03:39.190> use<00:03:39.549> different<00:03:39.910> shapes<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.519> it's

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
colors use different shapes so it's

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.000 
colors use different shapes so it's
pretty<00:03:42.849> cool
