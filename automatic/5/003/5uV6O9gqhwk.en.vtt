00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 when you go abroad 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.500

 poverty is also true in politics 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.570
 they should be ashamed of doing politics 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.590
 in this way instead of defending the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.049
