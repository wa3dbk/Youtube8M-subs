00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
adjusted the size because I know based

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.490 
adjusted the size because I know based
on<00:03:24.010> my<00:03:24.069> three<00:03:24.430> other<00:03:24.459> lines<00:03:25.209> how<00:03:25.989> many<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
on my three other lines how many and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.449 
on my three other lines how many and
what<00:03:26.829> I<00:03:27.040> needed<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.780> will<00:03:29.160> put<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.280> there<00:03:30.430> on

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
what I needed and I will put it there on

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.789 
what I needed and I will put it there on
the<00:03:30.579> screen<00:03:31.590> we<00:03:32.590> will<00:03:33.239> adjust<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.680> rotate<00:03:35.680> at

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
the screen we will adjust that rotate at

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.539 
the screen we will adjust that rotate at
90<00:03:36.099> degrees<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:37.019> maybe<00:03:38.019> even<00:03:38.470> zoom<00:03:38.769> in<00:03:38.980> using

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
90 degrees and maybe even zoom in using

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.729 
90 degrees and maybe even zoom in using
our<00:03:39.849> gestures<00:03:40.359> so<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.810> we<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:41.109> get<00:03:41.380> up<00:03:41.410> close

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
our gestures so that we can get up close

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.729 
our gestures so that we can get up close
and<00:03:41.769> personal<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.590> design<00:03:46.650> I'm<00:03:47.650> going

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
and personal but that design I'm going

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.379 
and personal but that design I'm going
to<00:03:48.040> move<00:03:48.220> off<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.639> side<00:03:48.849> so<00:03:49.030> it's<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.239> little

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
to move off to the side so it's a little

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.050 
to move off to the side so it's a little
easier<00:03:49.599> to<00:03:49.900> see<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.410> work<00:03:50.590> with<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.400> we<00:03:51.940> are

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
easier to see and work with and we are

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.089 
easier to see and work with and we are
going<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.329> use<00:03:52.599> our<00:03:52.810> encore<00:03:53.260> option<00:03:53.709> now<00:03:53.919> there

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
are shapes circles lines and hoop

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.120 
are shapes circles lines and hoop
options<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:58.090> will<00:03:58.570> use<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.169> default<00:03:59.320> straight

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130

we<00:04:18.400> also<00:04:18.430> have<00:04:19.000> alignment<00:04:19.590> options<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:21.459> if<00:04:21.580> I

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
we also have alignment options so if I

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.080 
we also have alignment options so if I
want<00:04:22.360> this<00:04:22.630> centered<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:24.400> course<00:04:24.730> what<00:04:24.940> you

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
can do just place it close to the bottom

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:38.880 
can do just place it close to the bottom
and<00:04:30.840> select<00:04:31.840> everything<00:04:36.630> under<00:04:37.630> some<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.740> our
