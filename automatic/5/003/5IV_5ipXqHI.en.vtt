00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
hello so this is the problem with God

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:18.019 
hello so this is the problem with God
nothing<00:00:07.250> happens<00:00:09.679> suddenly<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.580> that's<00:00:17.880> the

nothing happens suddenly so that's the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.630 
nothing happens suddenly so that's the
problem<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.510> God<00:00:19.820> what<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.939> need<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:22.640> is

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
problem with God what you need to do is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.759 
problem with God what you need to do is
come<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.060> passenger<00:00:24.539> side<00:00:26.240> remove<00:00:27.769> that

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
come on the passenger side remove that

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.700 
come on the passenger side remove that
side<00:00:29.160> panel<00:00:29.779> which<00:00:30.779> comes<00:00:31.050> off<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.679> really

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
side panel which comes off really really

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.770 
side panel which comes off really really
catch<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:35.190> panel<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:36.030> comes<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.600> really

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
catch that panel can comes out really

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.869 
catch that panel can comes out really
easily<00:00:38.059> no<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> bottom<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
easily no and then at the bottom so you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.779 
easily no and then at the bottom so you
can<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.559> I've<00:00:43.559> already<00:00:43.829> taken<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> old

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
can see I've already taken out the old

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.709 
can see I've already taken out the old
one<00:00:45.260> you're<00:00:46.260> looking<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:47.450> this<00:00:49.129> gray<00:00:50.129> thing

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
one you're looking for this gray thing

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.990 
one you're looking for this gray thing
which<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> attached<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
which is attached to this and this is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.580 
which is attached to this and this is
the<00:00:57.000> resistor

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
the resistor

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.789 
the resistor
these<00:01:00.219> things<00:01:00.550> were<00:01:00.730> controls<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.649> heating

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
these things were controls the heating

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.899 
these things were controls the heating
what<00:01:05.799> will<00:01:06.010> do<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:08.049> flag<00:01:08.670> we're<00:01:09.670> going<00:01:09.820> to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
what will do the flag we're going to

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
what will do the flag we're going to
attach<00:01:10.150> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
attach it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.680 
attach it
I'm<00:01:11.619> going<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.009> test<00:01:12.159> it<00:01:12.430> okay

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.530 

let's<00:01:16.690> attach<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.460> that's<00:01:18.700> all<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.180> way<00:01:19.300> back

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
let's attach so that's all the way back

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.670 
let's attach so that's all the way back
here<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.130> then<00:01:21.310> we<00:01:21.340> gonna<00:01:21.580> fix<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.530> maybe<00:01:23.530> you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
here and then we gonna fix it maybe you

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.469 
here and then we gonna fix it maybe you
can<00:01:23.860> see<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.799> this<00:01:27.040> is<00:01:27.340> white<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:29.440> then<00:01:30.479> we're

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
can see and this is white and then we're

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:39.450 
can see and this is white and then we're
going<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.660> test<00:01:31.899> it<00:01:33.360> go

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:49.330 

you<00:01:40.460> can<00:01:40.640> hear<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:41.710> that<00:01:42.710> is<00:01:42.860> now<00:01:43.070> working

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

so<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.899> is<00:01:51.899> what<00:01:52.200> causes<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> problem<00:01:53.360> that

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so that is what causes the problem that

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.889 
so that is what causes the problem that
little<00:01:54.720> resistor<00:01:55.259> down<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:56.119> maybe<00:01:57.119> through

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
little resistor down there maybe through

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:05.499 
little resistor down there maybe through
light<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.080> say<00:02:02.570> that's<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.720> one<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.200> know

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
light you can say that's the one I know

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.259 
light you can say that's the one I know
we're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.720> fix<00:02:06.990> it
