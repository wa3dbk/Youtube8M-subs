00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:02.659 
greetings fellow conspirators mortars

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.110 
greetings fellow conspirators mortars
ville<00:00:02.840> here<00:00:03.049> and<00:00:03.409> today<00:00:03.830> I<00:00:04.160> am<00:00:04.279> testing<00:00:05.000> on<00:00:05.089> a

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 
ville here and today I am testing on a

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.670 
ville here and today I am testing on a
glitch<00:00:05.479> that<00:00:05.509> I<00:00:05.779> found<00:00:05.959> in<00:00:06.080> a<00:00:06.140> creative<00:00:06.410> world

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
glitch that I found in a creative world

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.160 
glitch that I found in a creative world
I<00:00:06.890> was<00:00:07.459> trying<00:00:07.819> to<00:00:07.910> combine<00:00:08.210> thermal

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
I was trying to combine thermal

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.440 
I was trying to combine thermal
expansion<00:00:09.710> energy<00:00:10.160> with<00:00:10.790> galacticraft

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
expansion energy with galacticraft

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.329 
expansion energy with galacticraft
energy<00:00:11.870> because<00:00:12.139> I<00:00:12.320> wanted<00:00:12.740> to<00:00:12.830> use<00:00:12.980> solar

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:13.339 
energy because I wanted to use solar

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:14.740 
energy because I wanted to use solar
panels<00:00:13.759> but<00:00:13.820> I<00:00:13.910> also<00:00:14.089> wanted<00:00:14.299> to<00:00:14.389> use<00:00:14.540> this

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
panels but I also wanted to use this

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.040 
panels but I also wanted to use this
type<00:00:14.990> of<00:00:15.200> storage<00:00:15.559> and<00:00:15.919> the<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:17.510> redstone

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
type of storage and the the redstone

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.770 
type of storage and the the redstone
energy<00:00:18.950> conduits<00:00:19.280> so<00:00:20.120> I<00:00:20.450> was<00:00:20.570> trying<00:00:20.750> to

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
energy conduits so I was trying to

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.330 
energy conduits so I was trying to
combine<00:00:21.050> them<00:00:21.230> all<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:21.530> I<00:00:21.560> found<00:00:21.770> this<00:00:21.890> really

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
combine them all and I found this really

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.950 
combine them all and I found this really
Chiti<00:00:23.120> Chiti<00:00:23.150> glitch<00:00:23.750> that<00:00:24.380> will<00:00:24.700> probably

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
Chiti Chiti glitch that will probably

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.080 
Chiti Chiti glitch that will probably
actually<00:00:26.960> hang<00:00:27.260> on<00:00:27.350> me<00:00:27.580> that<00:00:28.580> will<00:00:28.730> probably

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
actually hang on me that will probably

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.390 
actually hang on me that will probably
allow<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:29.420> to<00:00:29.660> have<00:00:29.780> unlimited<00:00:29.960> power<00:00:30.470> so

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
allow you to have unlimited power so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.810 
allow you to have unlimited power so
first<00:00:32.029> we<00:00:32.210> want<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.629> be<00:00:32.719> all<00:00:32.870> inputs<00:00:33.820> then

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
first we want this to be all inputs then

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.569 
first we want this to be all inputs then
we'll<00:00:34.969> take<00:00:35.149> some<00:00:35.179> heavy<00:00:36.170> aluminum<00:00:36.440> wire<00:00:36.859> put

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
we'll take some heavy aluminum wire put

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.700 
we'll take some heavy aluminum wire put
it<00:00:37.699> in<00:00:38.329> between<00:00:38.719> these<00:00:38.870> two<00:00:39.109> and<00:00:39.140> we<00:00:39.440> want<00:00:39.649> it

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
it in between these two and we want it

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.160 
it in between these two and we want it
to<00:00:39.920> connect<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:40.969> is<00:00:41.089> the<00:00:41.210> oxygen<00:00:41.600> input

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
to connect so this is the oxygen input

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.860 
to connect so this is the oxygen input
side<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.620> that's<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:42.859> power<00:00:43.550> input<00:00:43.820> side<00:00:44.149> if

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
side and that's the power input side if

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.810 
side and that's the power input side if
we<00:00:44.989> click<00:00:45.170> on<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.409> you<00:00:45.469> notice<00:00:45.620> no<00:00:46.129> power<00:00:46.339> of

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
we click on it you notice no power of

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.220 
we click on it you notice no power of
course<00:00:47.059> because<00:00:47.449> this<00:00:47.570> is<00:00:47.629> an<00:00:47.839> input<00:00:47.960> right

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
course because this is an input right

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.090 
course because this is an input right
now<00:00:48.579> then<00:00:49.579> I'm<00:00:50.059> going<00:00:51.019> to<00:00:51.079> put<00:00:51.320> on<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.769> solar

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
now then I'm going to put on a solar

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.770 
now then I'm going to put on a solar
panel<00:00:52.309> which<00:00:52.879> is<00:00:53.030> collecting<00:00:53.359> energy<00:00:53.629> from

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
panel which is collecting energy from

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.049 
panel which is collecting energy from
the<00:00:53.870> Sun<00:00:54.079> turn<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.219> around<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:55.760> it's<00:00:55.879> facing

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
the Sun turn that around so it's facing

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.059 
the Sun turn that around so it's facing
this<00:00:56.239> way<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:56.569> put<00:00:56.839> another<00:00:56.960> heavy<00:00:57.649> aluminum

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
this way and put another heavy aluminum

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.779 
this way and put another heavy aluminum
wire<00:00:58.219> there<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:59.359> now<00:00:59.510> this<00:01:00.489> should<00:01:01.489> start

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
wire there so now this should start

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.369 
wire there so now this should start
filling<00:01:01.969> up<00:01:02.089> with<00:01:02.210> power<00:01:02.390> but<00:01:02.539> it's<00:01:02.659> not

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.760 

strange<00:01:05.770> that's<00:01:06.310> okay<00:01:06.579> now<00:01:07.380> there's<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.560> really

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
strange that's okay now there's a really

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.520 
strange that's okay now there's a really
weird<00:01:08.920> thing<00:01:09.070> if<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:09.820> turn<00:01:09.969> this<00:01:10.210> side<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:11.409> an

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
weird thing if we turn this side to an

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.240 
weird thing if we turn this side to an
output<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:13.299> there's<00:01:13.509> that<00:01:13.689> this<00:01:14.250> starts

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
output and there's that this starts

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.700 
output and there's that this starts
filling<00:01:15.430> up<00:01:15.579> with<00:01:15.700> power<00:01:15.960> crazy<00:01:16.960> like<00:01:17.470> crazy

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
filling up with power crazy like crazy

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.370 
filling up with power crazy like crazy
that<00:01:18.399> is<00:01:19.229> incredible

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
that is incredible

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.950 
that is incredible
so<00:01:20.710> now<00:01:20.860> we<00:01:20.920> can<00:01:21.250> basically<00:01:21.460> if<00:01:22.329> we<00:01:22.450> turn<00:01:22.659> like

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
so now we can basically if we turn like

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.929 
so now we can basically if we turn like
let's<00:01:23.200> say<00:01:23.350> this<00:01:23.560> side<00:01:23.710> into<00:01:24.039> an<00:01:24.130> output<00:01:24.369> like

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
let's say this side into an output like

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.200 
let's say this side into an output like
that<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.710> we<00:01:26.979> can<00:01:27.130> power<00:01:27.310> as<00:01:27.729> many<00:01:28.030> machines

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
that and we can power as many machines

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.779 
that and we can power as many machines
as<00:01:28.509> we<00:01:28.659> want<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.259> this<00:01:29.950> will<00:01:30.399> never<00:01:30.579> run

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
as we want to and this will never run

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.190 
as we want to and this will never run
out<00:01:30.819> of<00:01:30.909> power<00:01:31.119> it'll<00:01:31.720> just<00:01:31.869> keep<00:01:32.020> on

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
out of power it'll just keep on

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.609 
out of power it'll just keep on
generating<00:01:32.950> power<00:01:33.399> and<00:01:33.670> stay<00:01:33.880> there<00:01:34.060> forever

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
generating power and stay there forever

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
generating power and stay there forever
so<00:01:36.959> yeah<00:01:37.959> I'm<00:01:38.020> not<00:01:38.080> really<00:01:38.259> quite<00:01:38.799> sure<00:01:38.860> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
so yeah I'm not really quite sure the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.449 
so yeah I'm not really quite sure the
specifics<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.509> glitch<00:01:40.720> like<00:01:41.080> it<00:01:42.009> might

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
specifics of the glitch like it might

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.190 
specifics of the glitch like it might
not<00:01:42.640> have<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.880> be<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> oxygen<00:01:43.780> sealer<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.080> could

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
not have to be a oxygen sealer it could

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.800 
not have to be a oxygen sealer it could
be<00:01:44.289> maybe<00:01:44.530> any<00:01:44.770> galacticraft<00:01:45.310> machine<00:01:45.810> that

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
be maybe any galacticraft machine that

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.139 
be maybe any galacticraft machine that
takes<00:01:47.470> power<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.039> like<00:01:48.310> an<00:01:48.459> oxygen<00:01:48.789> bubble

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
takes power so like an oxygen bubble

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.609 
takes power so like an oxygen bubble
distributor<00:01:49.569> collector<00:01:50.200> or<00:01:50.289> something<00:01:50.530> like

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
distributor collector or something like

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.130 
distributor collector or something like
that<00:01:50.849> might<00:01:51.849> not<00:01:52.149> need<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.420> solar<00:01:52.689> panel<00:01:52.840> could

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
that might not need a solar panel could

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.620 
that might not need a solar panel could
be<00:01:53.319> just<00:01:53.590> getting<00:01:54.069> power<00:01:54.549> from<00:01:54.849> this<00:01:55.000> side<00:01:55.240> but

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
be just getting power from this side but

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.609 
be just getting power from this side but
I<00:01:55.689> know<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:55.959> you<00:01:56.080> do<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:56.349> to<00:01:56.439> have<00:01:56.470> the

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
I know that you do have to have the

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.339 
I know that you do have to have the
solar<00:01:56.770> panel<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.310> think<00:01:57.840> actually<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.110> might

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
solar panel I think actually you might

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.740 
solar panel I think actually you might
not<00:01:59.530> have<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.829> now<00:02:00.220> you<00:02:00.250> know<00:02:01.179> what<00:02:01.360> let<00:02:01.509> me<00:02:01.599> try

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
not have to now you know what let me try

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.120 
not have to now you know what let me try
something<00:02:02.049> first

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
something first

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.149 
something first
break<00:02:03.429> this<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:04.209> if<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.780> put<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.200> down<00:02:05.319> you'll

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
break this and if we put it down you'll

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.740 
break this and if we put it down you'll
see<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.399> doesn't<00:02:06.640> have<00:02:06.729> any<00:02:06.849> power<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.179> so<00:02:07.659> we

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
see that doesn't have any power so so we

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.089 
see that doesn't have any power so so we
took<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.959> power<00:02:08.140> away<00:02:08.229> okay

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
took the power away okay

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.599 
took the power away okay
now<00:02:09.819> let's<00:02:10.060> break<00:02:10.299> this<00:02:10.980> and<00:02:11.980> we'll<00:02:12.310> take<00:02:12.489> that

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.609 
now let's break this and we'll take that

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.720 
now let's break this and we'll take that
away<00:02:12.819> too<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:14.040> we'll<00:02:15.040> make<00:02:15.190> sure<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.579> all

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
away too and we'll make sure this is all

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.869 
away too and we'll make sure this is all
we<00:02:15.880> filled<00:02:16.060> up<00:02:16.150> yet<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:17.470> now<00:02:17.680> if<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.609> connects

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
we filled up yet so now if this connects

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.330 
we filled up yet so now if this connects
we'll<00:02:21.090> see<00:02:21.299> does<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.659> take<00:02:21.930> power<00:02:22.110> away<00:02:22.340> no

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
we'll see does that take power away no

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.759 
we'll see does that take power away no
it<00:02:23.459> doesn't<00:02:23.909> interesting<00:02:24.780> -<00:02:25.260> maybe<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.739> just

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
it doesn't interesting - maybe you just

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.289 
it doesn't interesting - maybe you just
need<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.189> solar<00:02:26.400> panel<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.819> gonna<00:02:27.030> jump

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
need the solar panel just gonna jump

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.360 
need the solar panel just gonna jump
started<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.040> an

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
started and then this is just an

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.589 
started and then this is just an
infinite<00:02:29.640> power<00:02:29.909> source<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.390> not<00:02:30.510> really

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
infinite power source I'm not really

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.690 
infinite power source I'm not really
sure<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.109> either<00:02:31.739> way<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.189> really<00:02:32.340> Chiddy

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
sure but either way it's really Chiddy

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.660 
sure but either way it's really Chiddy
and<00:02:33.379> just<00:02:34.379> thought<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:35.010> people<00:02:35.340> should<00:02:35.489> know

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and just thought that people should know

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.819 
and just thought that people should know
about<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.939> so<00:02:36.239> yeah<00:02:36.750> hope<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.079> guys<00:02:37.230> found

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
about it so yeah hope you guys found

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.490 
about it so yeah hope you guys found
this<00:02:38.040> interesting<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.629> you're<00:02:39.870> not<00:02:40.200> to

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
this interesting and if you're not to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.520 
this interesting and if you're not to
ethical<00:02:41.040> II<00:02:41.750> challenge<00:02:42.750> then<00:02:43.049> maybe<00:02:43.379> you'll

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
ethical II challenge then maybe you'll

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.589 
ethical II challenge then maybe you'll
uh<00:02:43.709> you'll<00:02:43.950> use<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.939> your<00:02:44.970> attack<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
uh you'll use this in your attack of the

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.030 
uh you'll use this in your attack of the
b-team<00:02:45.689> book<00:02:45.989> anyways<00:02:46.470> that's<00:02:46.650> about<00:02:46.769> it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
b-team book anyways that's about it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.710 
b-team book anyways that's about it
thanks<00:02:47.639> guys<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:47.970> watching<00:02:48.060> see<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.629> in<00:02:48.659> the
