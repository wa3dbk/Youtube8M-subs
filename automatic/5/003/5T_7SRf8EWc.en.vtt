00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello everyone wrote to you and I 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.670
 I present to you the next 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.760
 closed video 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.219
 beta testing with the start of the test yes and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.320
 before the test began a lot of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.849
 questions to the developers for which they 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 could not immediately answer 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.830
 however, thinking about some 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.680
 Of the questions he asked, they could not 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.369
 answer on the pages of your forum 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.189
 so go so the most exciting question 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.189
 for players who do not fall for zbt how many 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 total planned sets and developers 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.710
 answers we will hold another set of 3 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.590
 which is scheduled for February of this 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.040
 years, the more the more testers 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.980
 it is better 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.320
 can we players manage heavy 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 cars fill up large trees with ram 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.809
 or shot and how you can destroy 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.949
 fallen trunks on the map and a lot 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.360
 developers will certainly be able to answer 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 the more realism in the game 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.739
 the more attractive the players are 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.379
 ask whether the opportunity to hold 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.720
 repair of internal modules and developers 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.780
 distinguish likelihood of doing repairs on 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.450
 base still discussing this opportunity 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.380
 repair is necessary in the analogy 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.670
 to the planets let them also be at the base 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.560
 The following questions will be possible 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.650
 change the shell in the barrel 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 without it from the arrow developers are responding 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.030
 until made the need from the arrow 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.030
 shells as it was in real life on 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.340
 no plans to change is not currently 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.100
 very critical but honestly wanted 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.720
 would have to recharge had 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.110
 developers are interested in deciding 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.369
 whether 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.590
 with trunk materiality according to modes and 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.770
 immediately the answer will be clear after 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.899
 experiments and checks in battle goes 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.380
 tests will probably come up with something for 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.189
 checks will only destructible plans 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.159
 buildings 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.790
 Olya drive through the house or tear down 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.420
 that shed shot yes of course 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.350
 certainly will meet developers from 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 developers are asking whether 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.050
 shells pass through the trees of the house and 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 and if it is not a high-explosive projectile which 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.819
 will detonate rather firm 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.850
 barrier and he will have energy for 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.230
 further flight means will 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.040
 walk through the trees fences at home 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.920
 developers strive to maximize 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.760
 bring the game board to realistic and 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.540
 this is well important in my opinion 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.100
 asked the players a question about 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.790
 machine gun functionality 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.860
 functions will be performed by machine guns and us 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.150
 meet 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.790
 machine gun fire first turn 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.110
 used to destroy 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.340
 lightly armored targets and calculations 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.140
 artillery guns and twin machine gun 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.230
 can be used to fix fire 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.120
 the main gun so to speak 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.930
 or even targeting allies 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.160
 tracing cartridges in the tape can and 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.980
 improvise enemy shooting 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.019
 car in a duel like complicate 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.299
 aiming at you basically 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.190
 imagination has no limits when moving with 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.290
 one scale position to another firing 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.930
 positions you can shoot a machine gun in front 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.630
 itself raising the smoke screen thus 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.430
 making it difficult to aim at will 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.890
 either tires and machine guns shoot 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.980
 automatically over enemy aircraft like 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.590
 side arrows of the aircraft most likely 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.630
 do but with the ability to turn them off 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.900
 activity so they don't give out 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.859
 the location of your car in 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.019
 developers are asking whether 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.630
 anti-aircraft semi-tracked armored vehicles 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.579
 such anti-aircraft guns were much more 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.950
 common than on the basis of marks 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.739
 tank highway and they answer 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.930
 of course they will be able to very soon 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.959
 see the first Soviet copies 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.070
 We are waiting for new video screenshots 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.530
 on new cars 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.660
 players will be asked either and in 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.450
 urban setting and developers 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.049
 answering where already without them in plans all 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.230
 will represent these epic battles on 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.780
 maps of berlin or stalingrad will 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.030
 work stabilizer guns on machines 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.569
 who he 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.890
 installed developers are responding 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.320
 equipment that had to be on 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.169
 historical prototypes will 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.590
 implemented throughout presented in 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.510
 engineering project is in plans otlichnenko 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.090
 then the tiger 1 will have a system 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.160
 fire fighting the following questions when 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.460
 start a world war developers 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.230
 answer probably after the release of the game but 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.060
 there is nothing very important to think about 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.270
 functionality would be quicker 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.790
 damage was carried out with the separation of rollers or 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.460
 fully moved caterpillars can be 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.950
 implemented by developers responding with 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.470
 separation of rollers rather yes completely 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.050
 having eaten caterpillars no immediate plans 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.200
 an interesting question was asked by the next player 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.450
 he asked mainly interested 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.760
 information about the environment and 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.760
 precisely replicas apparently implied 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.430
 replicas from crew members loader 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.830
 gunner and driver like 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.520
 such as attention to three o'clock tank 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.280
 adversary 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.500
 a distance of 200 meters developers give 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.650
 your answer as the commander of a combat vehicle 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.010
 you are exactly the tasks you enter and 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.160
 detecting enemy tanks and 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.320
 Consequently 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.410
 cues and commands to himself he 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.780
 give will not be different by 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.600
 resistance armor and damage patterns 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.240
 katana cast armor and developers 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.520
 give a clear answer yes of course on this 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.560
 moment of closed beta testing all 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.560
 armor corresponds to one type 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.669
 more you can calculate the previous one 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.460
 selection of answers 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.950
 link to the previous selection of answers i 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.600
 leave in the description for this video and if 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.690
 did you like the video 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.650
 comment on like everybody good luck 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.650
 until
