the<00:00:04.410> biggest<00:00:04.620> challenge<00:00:05.250> in<00:00:05.400> building

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
the biggest challenge in building

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.249 
the biggest challenge in building
something<00:00:05.940> with<00:00:06.180> wood<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.629> figuring<00:00:07.140> out<00:00:07.200> how

something with wood is figuring out how
to<00:00:07.529> bring<00:00:07.859> two<00:00:08.130> boards<00:00:08.550> together<00:00:09.110> of<00:00:10.110> course

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
to bring two boards together of course

to bring two boards together of course
in<00:00:10.500> woodworking<00:00:10.800> terms<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.460> called<00:00:11.610> a

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
in woodworking terms this is called a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.120 
in woodworking terms this is called a
wood<00:00:12.000> joint<00:00:12.590> now<00:00:13.590> there<00:00:13.710> are<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> lot<00:00:13.889> of

wood joint now there are a lot of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.849 
wood joint now there are a lot of
different<00:00:14.639> types<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.000> wood<00:00:15.179> joints<00:00:15.859> some

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
different types of wood joints some

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.380 
different types of wood joints some
joints<00:00:17.130> are<00:00:17.250> fairly<00:00:17.490> easy<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.910> make<00:00:18.029> while

joints are fairly easy to make while

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.000 
joints are fairly easy to make while
other<00:00:18.570> joints<00:00:18.900> are<00:00:18.990> much<00:00:19.230> more<00:00:19.439> involved<00:00:19.770> in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
other joints are much more involved in

other joints are much more involved in
complex<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:22.020> how<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.320> decide<00:00:22.800> which<00:00:23.730> type

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
complex so how do we decide which type

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.599 
complex so how do we decide which type
of<00:00:24.150> joint<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.570> use<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:26.010> best<00:00:26.220> way<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> answer

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

this<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.110> level<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.470> woodworking

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
this I think this level of woodworking

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.260 
this I think this level of woodworking
might<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.640> reach<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
might be out of reach for a lot of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.200 
might be out of reach for a lot of
people<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.700> tools<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.090> be

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
people as you can see the tools can be

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.510 
people as you can see the tools can be
very<00:01:24.509> expensive<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.890> takes<00:01:25.920> some<00:01:26.250> time<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
very expensive and it takes some time to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
very expensive and it takes some time to
learn<00:01:26.640> how<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> use<00:01:27.240> them<00:01:27.890> that's<00:01:28.890> why<00:01:29.040> I'm

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
learn how to use them that's why I'm

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
learn how to use them that's why I'm
always<00:01:29.400> looking<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:29.939> alternative<00:01:30.600> types<00:01:30.869> of

difficult for beginners to use that's
why<00:03:50.520> I<00:03:50.550> like<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.940> sandwich<00:03:51.270> joint<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:52.560> takes
