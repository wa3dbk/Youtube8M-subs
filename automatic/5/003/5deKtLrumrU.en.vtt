00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.610
 Hello, this is my first fight 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.740
 airplanes but I thought we would take off 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.429
 Well, from the airfield 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.199
 throw everything in the air and something strange 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.199
 Where is the damage panel device 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:29.099
 Well, let's see, I think it will be interesting 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.430
 to play 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:38.910
 fly think you will be interested 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 see what's going on in the world of airplanes 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.250
 basically everything is the same as 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.210
 like we have tea too 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.210
 at Allah 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.130
 and whips off 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.030
 and the fast and the furious see when forward you press 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.180
 afterburner when there is no need to press and 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.610
 then you will just fly but 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.369
 left and right click nothing 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.390
 going to give something here a mouse and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.300
 wrap up a space 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.680
 bombs throwing impossible to expect bombs 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.330
 there is no on space this is a bomb throw to back 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.690
 back by pressing just 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.240
 the propeller stops working it doesn't give 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.800
 We are so slow for this Well, if something 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.800
 honest that we do not really slow down 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
 okay 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.040
 she damages the panel we have a plane 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.980
 What kind of camera is this ? 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.330
 Is there any video somewhere where we have 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.330
 there actually opponents of the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.230
 circle play will give round shoot 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.440
 karay 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.869
