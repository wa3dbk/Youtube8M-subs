00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.070 

architecture<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.060> one<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.359> those<00:00:06.509> very

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
architecture is one of those very

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.720 
architecture is one of those very
disciplined<00:00:07.680> I'd<00:00:08.220> like<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.519> call<00:00:08.639> it

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
disciplined I'd like to call it

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.209 
disciplined I'd like to call it
discipline<00:00:09.179> forms<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:10.019> design<00:00:10.530> just<00:00:10.889> because

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
discipline forms of design just because

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.850 
discipline forms of design just because
you<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:12.000> very<00:00:12.870> technical<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.590> think

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
you have to be very technical I think

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.379 
you have to be very technical I think
the<00:00:14.009> best<00:00:14.190> way<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.400> describe<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.179> like

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the best way to describe it is like

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.689 
the best way to describe it is like
cooking<00:00:15.660> versus<00:00:16.199> baking<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.460> cooking

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
cooking versus baking or as in cooking

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.340 
cooking versus baking or as in cooking
you<00:00:18.090> know<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.420> improvise<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.869> little<00:00:19.230> bit

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
you know you can improvise a little bit

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.260 
you know you can improvise a little bit
on<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> ingredients<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.310> baking<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:21.060> it's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
on the ingredients but baking is it's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.859 
on the ingredients but baking is it's
very<00:00:21.359> precise<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.320> science<00:00:22.820> so<00:00:23.869> you

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
very precise and it's a science so you

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.050 
very precise and it's a science so you
know<00:00:24.990> architecture<00:00:25.769> again<00:00:26.070> has<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> lot<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> do

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
know architecture again has a lot to do

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.859 
know architecture again has a lot to do
with<00:00:27.390> knowing<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.289> space<00:00:28.920> knowing<00:00:29.310> about

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
with knowing about space knowing about

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.569 
with knowing about space knowing about
even<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:31.470> something<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.099> designed

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
even like how something can be designed

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.920 
even like how something can be designed
so<00:00:32.790> usually<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.239> work<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.570> an<00:00:33.690> interior

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so usually they work with an interior

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.310 
so usually they work with an interior
designer<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.520> also<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> know

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
designer and then you also have to know

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.549 
designer and then you also have to know
math<00:00:37.320> geometry<00:00:38.329> able<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> ability<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
math geometry able have the ability to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.549 
math geometry able have the ability to
actually<00:00:41.160> sketch<00:00:41.750> have<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> ability<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> draw

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
actually sketch have the ability to draw

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.830 
actually sketch have the ability to draw
straight<00:00:43.920> lines<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:44.850> rulers<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
straight lines and use rulers and and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
straight lines and use rulers and and
different<00:00:46.020> things<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.739> architecture

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
different things like that architecture

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
different things like that architecture
is<00:00:47.700> something<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.829> not<00:00:49.829> just

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
is something that's actually not just

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.689 
is something that's actually not just
for<00:00:51.020> you<00:00:52.020> know<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.800> bearded<00:00:53.430> man<00:00:53.670> in

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
for you know like the the bearded man in

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.840 
for you know like the the bearded man in
his<00:00:54.300> room<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:55.250> designing<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
his room like designing like what the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.549 
his room like designing like what the
next<00:00:57.090> museum<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.930> look<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.109> again

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
next museum is going to look like again

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.979 
next museum is going to look like again
it's<00:00:58.800> actually<00:00:59.250> very<00:00:59.460> helpful<00:01:00.000> tool<00:01:00.180> for

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it's actually very helpful tool for

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.110 
it's actually very helpful tool for
designers<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.739> want<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.309> able<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.609> maybe

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
designers that want to be able to maybe

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
designers that want to be able to maybe
pitch<00:01:03.420> something<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> client<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.100> not<00:01:05.460> only

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
pitch something to a client so not only

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.190 
pitch something to a client so not only
just<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> website<00:01:06.360> design<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.049> like

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
just the website design but it's like

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
just the website design but it's like
hey<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> also<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> store<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.030> your

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
hey you also have a store what if your

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.690 
hey you also have a store what if your
store<00:01:09.420> look<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.189> there's<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> lot<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
store look like this there's a lot of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
store look like this there's a lot of
free<00:01:12.030> tools<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.810> use<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.350> them

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
free tools that you can use one of them

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890 
free tools that you can use one of them
that<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.400> love<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.060> Google<00:01:15.600> Sketchup

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
that I really love is Google Sketchup

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.880 
that I really love is Google Sketchup
and<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.210> Sketchup<00:01:19.140> comm<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.740> just

and you can go to Sketchup comm or just

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.140 
and you can go to Sketchup comm or just
type<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.159> Google<00:01:20.460> Sketchup<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.000> it's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
type in Google Sketchup and it's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
type in Google Sketchup and it's
available<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:23.130> Mac<00:01:23.479> Windows<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
available on the Mac Windows like and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.539 
available on the Mac Windows like and
you<00:01:26.189> basically<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:27.090> hop<00:01:27.570> right<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.549> you

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you basically just hop right in and you

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.359 
you basically just hop right in and you
can<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.750> draw<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> box<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.740> raise<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
can if you draw a box you can raise the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.160 
can if you draw a box you can raise the
box<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.299> accustomed<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
box and just get very accustomed to it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.660 
box and just get very accustomed to it
it's<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> lot<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.280> different

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it's like they have a lot of different

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.719 
it's like they have a lot of different
tutorials<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.509> there<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.140> even<00:01:37.619> used<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
tutorials out there I even used it to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.580 
tutorials out there I even used it to
basically<00:01:39.829> come<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.310> model<00:01:41.970> for

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
basically come up with a model for

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.810 
basically come up with a model for
something<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> wanted<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.490> like

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
something that I wanted to do like

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.929 
something that I wanted to do like
during<00:01:45.090> art<00:01:45.270> school<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.560> put<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> pre

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
during art school for a put like a pre

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.600 
during art school for a put like a pre
and<00:01:47.970> post<00:01:48.240> Maternity<00:01:49.049> place<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.340> order<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and post Maternity place so in order to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.480 
and post Maternity place so in order to
actually<00:01:50.960> come<00:01:51.960> through<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:52.860> idea<00:01:53.189> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
actually come through with my idea I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
actually come through with my idea I
wanted<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> show<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> would<00:01:54.810> look<00:01:54.930> like

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
wanted to show what it would look like

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.469 
wanted to show what it would look like
as<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.409> building<00:01:56.009> space<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.850> used<00:01:57.090> Google

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
as a building space so I used Google

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.469 
as a building space so I used Google
Sketchup<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.500> show<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.920> outside

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
Sketchup to actually show the outside

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.819 
Sketchup to actually show the outside
and<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.659> sides<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> building<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.649> well<00:02:01.770> as

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and the sides of the building as well as

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.649 
and the sides of the building as well as
the<00:02:01.920> inside<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:02.610> isn't<00:02:02.790> shown<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:03.360> but

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the inside which isn't shown here but

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.020 
the inside which isn't shown here but
but<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.890> took<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> regular<00:02:05.820> picture

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
but I just took like a regular picture

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570 
but I just took like a regular picture
so<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.479> also<00:02:06.659> good<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> help<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.580> again

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
so it's also good to help you again

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.699 
so it's also good to help you again
visually<00:02:09.090> communicate<00:02:09.720> what<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> space<00:02:10.470> can

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
visually communicate what a space can

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.580 
visually communicate what a space can
look<00:02:10.860> like

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
look like

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.949 
look like
SketchUp<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.370> also<00:02:12.550> be<00:02:12.819> used<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.390> other

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
SketchUp can also be used for other

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.229 
SketchUp can also be used for other
things<00:02:14.080> besides<00:02:14.680> architectural<00:02:15.430> design<00:02:16.000> as

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
things besides architectural design as

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.720 
things besides architectural design as
well<00:02:16.420> too<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.099> good<00:02:18.310> basis<00:02:18.700> to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
well too but it's a really good basis to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.300 
well too but it's a really good basis to
know<00:02:19.120> or<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.200> start<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.830> see<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.160> it's

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
know or to start to see if it's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.830 
know or to start to see if it's
something<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.670> you're<00:02:21.910> interested<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
something that you're interested in and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.250 
something that you're interested in and
then<00:02:22.959> if<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:24.239> like<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.480> possibilities<00:02:26.080> are

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
then if so like the possibilities are

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.890 
then if so like the possibilities are
pretty<00:02:26.470> much<00:02:26.709> endless
