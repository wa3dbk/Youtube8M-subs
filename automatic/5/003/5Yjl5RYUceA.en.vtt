00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.180
 applies a transparent base over all 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.910
 the nail 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.740
 after which make a double pass on 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.740
 all nails with a nail polish 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.240
 for the decoration I chose patches 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.220
 Adhesives from the professional steiner brand 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.329
 at this point I choose the way of 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.329
 more suitable size 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.080
 place carefully on my desire and 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.210
 the net face well in such a way that 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.210
 no air bubbles remain in the folds 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.200
 with a pair of scissors then I go to 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.990
 cut access simply knowing 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.450
 the outline of the media 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.730
 finally I go then to file the 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.490
 any injuries using a file 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.910
 rather coarse finish I do 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.190
 two passes with a gel effect top coat 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.900
 the cooked top will make the nail shiny and 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.690
 will ensure that any imperfections 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 synopsis in a little less and this is 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.030
 the final effect 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.009
 the adhesive part advanced previously 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.200
 in practice what remained after that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.939
 I cut the excess it gave from 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.729
 reuse to make the decoration 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.530
 on the ring finger in this case since 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.359
 however the cut came quite 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.869
 precisely I don't need to go to 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:37.049
 finish the innermost bezel but 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.520
 I leave it as well as on this finger 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.939
 repeats the operations I did in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.939
 priority 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.759
 for the decoration of the use index 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.290
 the small golden stud and I go to 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.840
 place on one side 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.430
 finally using the doctor we are not 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.250
 high 2 satin I go to finish the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.720
 decoration in this case since not 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.490
 I want dots to all have the 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.960
 same size but I want them to be 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.179
 gradually smaller 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.190
 I'm not going to dip the dr 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.190
 smart home a I will use the residual one 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 and this is the final effect 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.340
 I hope the video you liked is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.340
 bye bye bye bye
