00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.850
 dollars 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.759
 much or little of course 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 for example three billion dollars you can 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.869
 to build 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.509
 500 kilometers of roads 100 standard flashes 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.340
 Azhek the money can cure 200 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.520
 thousand children with congenital heart disease

 or almost a year to pay a pension to everyone 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 pensioners in Ukraine so in sis pockets in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 the result is leaking 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.039
 This is not a very small amount about 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.039
 this is our investigation today 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.690
 tantalizing the smell of food often 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.170
 extends to tens of meters from 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.060
 fast foods 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.549
 but what do you think is common between 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.210
 hamburger and toilet water no matter how 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.390
 strange 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.250
 smell though spirit smells like jasmine a 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.890
 roast beef hamburger 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.619
 but both smells are made in the same 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.380
 laboratories the same company produces 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.000
 smells soap shampoo and of the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.700
 popular spirits of the world 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.630
 fast food buy flavors and food from us 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.910
 of food 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.900
 the date is mostly fresh baking well and 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.910
 of course the team that always 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.580
 the main task of aroma marketing is 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.120
 raise sales the buyer comes in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.290
 the room feels the pleasant aroma of food and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.890
 unconsciously takes more than 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.180
 planned buying our work for example 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.160
 dill and qi salami baking fast food coffee 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.120
 rise sales average check 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.209
 growing 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.880
 20 cooks add flavors not 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.190
 just so without them we hardly bought 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.530
 would hamburgers fries and cheeseburgers 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.900
 The fact is that in fast food use 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.730
 only frozen their semi-finished products 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.790
 do in turn from frozen 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.670
 products double freeze completely 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.459
 destroys the smell of hamburgers and potatoes 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.760
 fries coming out of the conveyor fresh food without 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.189
 nobody will smell 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.420
 to cause an appetite she must be delicious 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:11.340
 groin for this and use flavors 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.560
 of course you can refuse but good 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.129
 fast food they will refuse it 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.549
 because they want to create a pleasant 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.950
 fit setting 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.709
 good fast food always be fast food 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.780
 use completely different devices 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.220
 spreading odors all flavors for 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.620
 fast food restaurants 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.390
 sold as an aerosol gels and 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.190
 liquids 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.890
 often fast foods buy economy 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.810
 spray options are small 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.819
 boxes hang from the ceiling and 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.519
 consumer entering the room is not even 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.980
 suspects that here it is like a mouse in 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.159
 the mousetrap was lured by experienced marketers 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.829
 smells 0 cheating here of course 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.769
 present because when a person 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.909
 early morning comes already smells fresh 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.859
 baking it does not mean that it is already 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.269
 there is a huge amount 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.879
 flavors that are used and in 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.690
 household cosmetics 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.120
 industry and pharmaceuticals 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.720
 artificial smells are stronger than real ones 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.920
 our brain remembers them rather they sort of 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.140
 stimulates appetite 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.239
 we unwittingly want to take one more 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.100
 hamburger or ask for a second batch 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.080
 potatoes 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.150
 fast food vendors know this very well and 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.150
 the smell can easily fool us
