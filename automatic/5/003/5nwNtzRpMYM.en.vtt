light I hope you can tell because it was

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.200 
light I hope you can tell because it was
not<00:00:17.910> cheap<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:19.439> lighting<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.980> had<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.760> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
not cheap the lighting that I had was so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.019 
not cheap the lighting that I had was so
just<00:00:22.080> flimsy<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.220> would<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.369> tip<00:00:23.789> over

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
just flimsy and it would just tip over

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.529 
just flimsy and it would just tip over
and<00:00:25.160> well<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.430> tipped<00:00:26.670> over<00:00:26.789> more<00:00:27.150> than<00:00:27.180> once

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and well it tipped over more than once

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.660 
and well it tipped over more than once
and<00:00:27.869> basically<00:00:28.320> all<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.859> lights<00:00:29.099> shattered

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and basically all my lights shattered

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.339 
and basically all my lights shattered
and<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> socket<00:00:30.689> stopped<00:00:30.960> working

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and then the socket stopped working

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.139 
and then the socket stopped working
there<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.830> two<00:00:32.160> sockets<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.940> light<00:00:33.120> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
there are two sockets in that light that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.650 
there are two sockets in that light that
still<00:00:33.660> work<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:36.149> was<00:00:36.239> basically

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
still work but it's it was basically

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.229 
still work but it's it was basically
useless<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.469> saw<00:00:37.710> my<00:00:38.010> boxycharm<00:00:38.520> video

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
useless if you saw my boxycharm video

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.119 
useless if you saw my boxycharm video
then<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.930> would<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.379> able<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.620> tell<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.980> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
then you would be able to tell that it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
then you would be able to tell that it
just<00:00:41.340> looked<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.550> crap<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> even<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
just looked like crap and even in that

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.450 
just looked like crap and even in that
video<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.899> had<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> adjust<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.710> lighting<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.219> my

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.330 
video I had to adjust the lighting in my
editing<00:00:44.789> program<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.170> finally<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.160> new

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
editing program so I finally have new

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.400 
editing program so I finally have new
lighting<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> took<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
lighting it took a little bit about a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.770 
lighting it took a little bit about a
week<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> come<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.480> why<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
week for it to come in so that's why the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.569 
week for it to come in so that's why the
videos<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.379> been<00:00:52.530> lacking<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.430> that
