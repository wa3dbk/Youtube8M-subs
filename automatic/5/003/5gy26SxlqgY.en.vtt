would think we've probably got around 20
or<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.370> who<00:03:08.730> decided<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.480> stay<00:03:09.750> where<00:03:09.959> they<00:03:10.080> are

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
stoneware 14 hugs back right onto the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.990 
stoneware 14 hugs back right onto the
river<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.590> rivers<00:04:16.919> currently<00:04:17.430> at<00:04:17.549> their<00:04:17.760> back

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
river the rivers currently at their back

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.270 
river the rivers currently at their back
fences<00:04:18.600> so<00:04:18.870> we<00:04:18.989> have<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.290> have<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.440> close<00:04:20.039> look

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
fences so we have to have a close look

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.000 
fences so we have to have a close look
at<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.609> again<00:04:21.200> we've<00:04:22.200> had<00:04:22.380> some<00:04:22.650> issues<00:04:22.979> with

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
at that again we've had some issues with

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.270 
at that again we've had some issues with
power<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.940> gas

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
power and gas

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.270 
power and gas
line<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:24.880> that's<00:04:25.300> high<00:04:25.630> on<00:04:25.660> our<00:04:25.930> priority

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
line so that that's high on our priority

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.390 
line so that that's high on our priority
so<00:04:27.280> really<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:29.139> weather<00:04:29.380> wasn't<00:04:29.620> too<00:04:29.950> bad<00:04:30.160> to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
so really the weather wasn't too bad to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.890 
so really the weather wasn't too bad to
us<00:04:30.430> last<00:04:30.700> night<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:31.389> we're<00:04:31.540> going<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.750> have<00:04:31.840> a

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
us last night so we're going to have a

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.720 
us last night so we're going to have a
good<00:04:32.110> look<00:04:32.260> again<00:04:32.620> when<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:33.070> when<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.550> light

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
good look again when that when the light

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.440 
good look again when that when the light
comes<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.600> then<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:36.160> know<00:04:36.280> our<00:04:36.669> priority<00:04:37.419> is

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
comes and then you know our priority is

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.060 
comes and then you know our priority is
obviously<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.020> people<00:04:38.530> we<00:04:38.650> want<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.950> keep

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
obviously the people we want to keep

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.890 
obviously the people we want to keep
them<00:04:39.280> safe<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.940> we<00:04:40.150> want<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.419> keep<00:04:40.570> them<00:04:40.750> in

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
them safe and we want to keep them in

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.900 
them safe and we want to keep them in
shelter<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.889> give<00:04:42.040> them<00:04:42.190> something<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.639> eat

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
shelter and give them something to eat

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.379 
shelter and give them something to eat
and<00:04:44.040> you<00:04:45.040> know<00:04:45.160> this<00:04:45.400> will<00:04:45.550> go<00:04:45.700> on<00:04:45.730> for<00:04:45.910> two<00:04:46.270> or

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
and you know this will go on for two or

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.550 
and you know this will go on for two or
three<00:04:46.419> days<00:04:46.750> based<00:04:47.169> on<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.470> weather

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
three days based on the weather

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.260 
three days based on the weather
predictions<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.520> then<00:04:48.639> we<00:04:48.820> can<00:04:49.000> hopefully

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
predictions and then we can hopefully

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.560 
predictions and then we can hopefully
get<00:04:49.510> people<00:04:49.900> back<00:04:50.050> into<00:04:50.290> their<00:04:50.500> home's
