00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.380
 hello guys how are you today 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.420
 guys I come to talk to you about a product 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.420
 that is amazing that changed my life 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.160
 completely did not have much faith the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 true this product and itself when 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.890
 concluded that we were going to try it but the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.710
 truth is that 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.320
 it's pure technology in cosmetics the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.220
 Color correcting greens exists and cream 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.750
 as many people call textile a is this and 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.670
 this product actually saw it in the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.460
 past tutorial that I made of victory 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.980
 beckham and good what I liked this is 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.559
 which is a separate moisturizer 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.280
 contains the factor 20 solar producer 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:58.010
 and the curls of this cream is coming 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.960
 a tone like blue that I show you 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.290
 the cinemas 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.299
 as you see as a strange blue tone and what 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.990
 important is that contact with 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.170
 skin 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.329
 it turns from the tone of fact I bought the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.329
 mine as a tone but you can see 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.460
 is completely confused with the tone of the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.920
 skin what I like this product is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.619
 that corrects much any hue 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.930
 that is reddish that looks very yellow 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.450
 well different shades come as in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.189
 six different shades and I'm occupying 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.189
 right now number three I'm 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.700
 what I like this cream is that you 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.540
 leaves a very soft finish very high in the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.550
 skin and gives good health coverage as 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.040
 of passarella on the skin as if 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.500
 I was a little wet as between 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.210
 sweaty but I think it 's very good for 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.100
 types of normal dry skin 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.479
 it works amazing even if you're 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.490
 mixed I think it would look good 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.490
 I would only recommend that you put 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.900
 dust on my skin is normal to dry I 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.330
 if I still put powder on him 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.190
 only so that it lasts me throughout 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.700
 the day but they have days of chulilla 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.910
 today I do not bring anything of it's going to be 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.340
 where I put the physics and I put a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.670
 little powder on top of mirabalais without 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.530
 end and it is natural of marc and was thus the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.569
 true that the skin is very nice level 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.849
 it is very red then the shades that 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.130
 has the color correcting wind help me 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.200
 very much to remove everything red from me 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.940
 congratulate you not to see but also for 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.340
 the pigments and the powders it contains 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.110
 This cream helps you to fade lines 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.720
 of expression and also the pretty ones 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.000
 then not only correct the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.830
 hyperpigmentation of the skin that I 'm 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.290
 you have many spots, they are many 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.630
 redness as I also helps you to 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.250
 the skin is very soft porcelain like 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.040
 I had previously commented on 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.880
 catwalk the busy sunset of the senate and 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.470
 they have very young skin or mature skin or 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.870
 any skin color you have is what 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.480
 good about this product that suits 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.220
 your needs to your skin tone and 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.709
 correct what you gave me is correct and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.420
 exposes the beauty of your skin 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.610
 which I think is the best we can 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.709
 do when choosing a cosmetic product 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.329
 something that I also found out about this 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.660
 product and I did not know why I thought that 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.490
 it was just like 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.350
 corrective also as correction of 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.050
 color is that you keep your skin 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.760
 hydrated for more than 72 hours thanks 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.890
 moisturizing ingredients the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.990
 technology to seal hydration in 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.790
 your skin that has physics is 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.580
 incredible does not give you a 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.410
 light to medium coverage in a finish 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.150
 matt satin then it is not 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.850
 completely matte but neither does it shine 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.680
 too much overtures you can give it a 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.110
 very light layer first to get 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.300
 a super lightweight layer a culture that 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.340
 you almost do not notice that it's invisible or you 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.500
 can give a second layer and good 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.840
 it returns medium then if it can reach 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.450
 cover those annoying neighborhoods a little bit 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.629
 what we have 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.010
 not only is it an instant effect 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.569
 with continuous use that helps me to 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.290
 the hyperpigmentation can not be either 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.140
 hyperpigmentation and the machines that 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.090
 we have on the skin go as if taking off 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.819
 vanishing little by little then 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.099
 it also gives that effect as incredible the 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.319
 long-term skin is free of 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.479
 parabens and has many antioxidants 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.040
 what also fascinates me and I'm 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.049
 traumatized with antioxidants since 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.690
 I live in the city because the radicals 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.450
 free as pollution video dust 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.669
 attack the skin directly will help 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.430
 our skin no signs of 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.979
 very early age thing that girls like 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.110
 I am 21 years old we do not want and good apart 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.700
 as it has solar effect then everything in 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.260
 you do not have to worry 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.400
 first as the blocker and then the 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.410
 cream and then makeup 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.050
 I will also busy you as prime is a 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.310
 cinema quite well and you put a very 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.110
 light oil to correct the 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.510
 hyperpigmentation and then put your 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.510
 favorite base on top that was amazing 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.040
 for a long time and the skin remains 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.190
 super soft and so much is but also 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.800
 as prime air and I recommend it I use it 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.950
 very much as you can see it in 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.140
 out is around 600 pesos and what 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.170
 only thing that I do not think is that I think 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.030
 for 600 pesos has very little product 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.820
 I do not know I feel I have a little 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:16.840
 matured product right now gives more or less 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.690
 one month but if I use it almost daily but 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.280
 Still, I do not know, let's see when it's over 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.590
 I told them to know market but that 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.630
 get is incredible I send you a
