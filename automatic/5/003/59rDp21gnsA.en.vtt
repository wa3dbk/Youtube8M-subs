00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
here somewhere I think it's on the back

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.580 
here somewhere I think it's on the back
at<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.940> very<00:04:15.120> back<00:04:15.330> shows<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.290> how<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.470> build

him<00:04:22.500> but<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:23.070> think<00:04:23.640> most<00:04:23.790> people<00:04:24.150> would<00:04:24.270> know

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.129 
him but I think most people would know
how<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.630> build<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.110> go<00:04:25.260> minifigure

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
how to build it I go minifigure

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.939
