00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:08.440
 Matsumoto is a Hi Co., Ltd. real net 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:14.710
 Today's video It is this video 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:18.880
 Sell it is and get along in the same say Fu, such point the smartphone site of Ettoko 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.140
 It can be taken of whether Hahn good reaction rate becomes smartphone site 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.619
 I wonder if this will be a smartphone site 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.239
 Also to talk a little point I is divided into respectively say menu ye lp how 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.050
 I think I want to go 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.059
 so 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.059
 First, is it new direction 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:45.790
 Though it is menu way 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.790
 This is a form of royal road in the menu type pc site . 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.660
 There is a title here 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:00.550
 Well there are photos and copies here 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.870
 + Catch copy to buy something in there is what is referred to as a global menu here 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.510
 Because there is a side menu It is a form of this pc 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.510
 Well then, this is a smartphone 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.700
 How to convert to 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:23.829
 Do you have any points to note 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.150
 It is a form here, but it is a story of how it is optimized 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.450
 First of all 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.400
 Sumaho both pc There are common to important part 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 To know what site it is at the moment you see it 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:43.170
 It is important that it is an open moment 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.009
 If you do not know what the site is at the moment you click on the page, this is a departure 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.079
 watch 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:54.329
 So in the case of smartphones, the leaving rate is more intense than this pc. 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.979
 Time is a gap time or there is a problem with the communication environment, but you will stand out after all 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.010
 It will be intense 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.730
 9 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.630
 First with this title 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:08.360
 This photo and copy 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.200
 Should not be imperative in the very important part summer here of part of Tteyuu is here 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.610
 First important 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.530
 It looks like this is a close-up at the beginning of the screen with a sumo wrestler 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.640
 This is a tremendous importance First of all as a point Ne 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.920
 It is a menu here 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.459
 If there were a total of seven menus here for the computer, it would not be the number 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.720
 Well then, if all seven are arranged here, that smartphone 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:38.480
 In the notation seven I can not width has a narrow water 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.780
 So even max 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.310
 I want it to be around 5 after all 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.900
 To two-stage if I want to arranging a lot of menu be How does even is a form Tteyuu 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:54.849
 When 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:57.310
 Say to be one of the most different part in the hand of you is by Hey PC and smartphone is of the individual application 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:07.420
 It is a screen button 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:09.160
 If it is a smartphone here, the smartphone is a phone, so be sure to place both the phone and the net reservation person 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.850
 Please give me 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.990
 Because this is very important 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.680
 Hmm 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:23.210
 The part where the main type pc can be seen more often is this f surrounded by red letters 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:30.780
 It is a part called 9 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:34.260
 On the other hand, smartphones are the first top of this and you can see the bottom 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.120
 There is a difference that you can see it often 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:44.850
 Be aware of the bottom of point First say the first of the first top 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:49.739
 And this network load point always prepare the button of 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.770
 Why do I order a phone or ask for a phone call? 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.880
 There 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.060
 If an anti-smartphone site make from now on pc and smartphone 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.210
 If you want to optimize these points first 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.770
 It is a story Do menu is this to say that I want you to stop 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.000
 One more step 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.390
 lp 's 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:18.109
 There is that and this is 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:21.319
 I will be a high application was Well really easy to understand Makore also pc side 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:29.100
 There is an application and the document continues here 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:31.249
 Or in the good if we change the pc to my smartphone to Fu say if it 's more of the smartphone 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.580
 It's a story but 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.930
 Basically 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.550
 smartphone 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:43.900
 It is already the same as pc, but it is easy to get reaction 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:49.060
 First of all, if you say this menu is lp and which reaction is easier to take 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:57.760
 Well, in terms of response rate , lp is still high 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:05:03.520
 Hey, in the case of smartphones in particular, lp is preferred because it is vertical in Japan. 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:06.850
 Why do you want to create a site of good reaction rate to the optimization of the smartphone four , first consider lp 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.050
 One is there Well that Tteyuu to 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.120

 Quite often it is the people who become the wind Tteyuu I also examined in the pc eventually examined later 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:25.560
 There is a problem that is said to be in search 20 . 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:29.700
 Its oriental 30-It is in order to solve it 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.919
 I'd is the conversion length Yoshi suddenly still a good race in the smart phone 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.260
 It is a place to get an action 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:38.990
 At that time for this smartphone
