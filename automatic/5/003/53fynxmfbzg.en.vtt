00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.850
 greet all access test I am 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.460
 mwc 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.290
 13 on the alcatel stand that unveiled 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.960
 some new terminals including one 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.270
 touch star then the wanted star is a 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.300
 device with a screen 4 inches wg the 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.000
 cdu amoled runs under android 4.2 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.180
 I eliminate it has a dual-core processor to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.490
 1 gig hertz 5 megapixel optics to 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.760
 the back the pier in a pink version 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.050
 but there is also gray in white 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.570
 that I have before me so much sky in 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.530
 black but here I do not have but in all 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.699
 case you have the colors I have a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.720
 small of a front camera vga 4 gigas 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.129
 4 gigabytes of internal memory 512 mo of ram 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.260
 ultimately Joxi 4 gigas you have that 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.769
 2,4 for for you but you can 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.449
 add up to 32 gigas via microsd one 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.699
 1500 mile battery and amp and 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.820
 you also have a dual sim option 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.640
 then it will be available in France in 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.309
 April 2013 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.450
 in single sim version at 200 euros 199 and 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.490
 in dual syllable version 220 219 euros 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.250
 take a little tour on the design is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 a small device not too expensive and 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.619
 not very original design must be the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.390
 recognize 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.659
 for me it makes me think of an ace by 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.840
 example an s2 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.590
 if s ii of samsung but not only 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 determined ong are pretty similar jan 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.350
 here you have the keys 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.439
 sensitive and barely sees very light 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.689
 nothing on the left right that loses 1.9 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.090
 during the volume buttons so micro 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.280
 usb jack abry gang lock 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.369
 unlock here and back 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.780
 5 megapixel optics the speaker 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.980
 the flash is its viable hamlets on it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.140
 see here it's plastic 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.360
 it's rather pretty compact enough 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.250
 friendly and use my faith it's not 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.840
 it's not unpleasant I found in 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 more after last interface you have 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.150
 played a very interesting game at the beginning 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.310
 I got myself I even wondered if 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.180
 it was well that's why finally this is 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.180
 that it was really new 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.980
 alcatel overlay that seems seems 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.990
 that yes the man for example here we have this 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.280
 screen there for finally this screen there the 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.630
 drawer of notifications with some 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.980
 settings with all this 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.480
 customization that was done at 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.710
 color level 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:31.050
 mainly multitasking here is 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.050
 which also existed this way 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.940
 we stay supported then the choices and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.819
 shows a speech widget - that's it 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.190
 change the wallpaper etc I go there 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.450
 I have access to the different widgets of 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.340
 fairly classic way but with a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.420
 slight customization of a 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.290
 applications and applications 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.290
 downloaded 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.760
 the google map i do not want to launch sorry 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.319
 I will see very easily 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.180
 swap and police 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.040
 but the icaunais the widgets get 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.769
 massively move also I 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.849
 look I know nothing by passing so we 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.719
 going to walk a little bit there 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.090
 in what we have 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:11.370
 the nine an application that allows 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.930
 to save autonomy that interests 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.989
 tested when they simply 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.569
 there is by internet via wrong by default 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.489
 who installs and calculator schedule 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.240
 with uh bah yes there is still a 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.550
 custom 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.890
 the share of two alcatel then there in the 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.780
 video i the blue looks very very 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.940
 very bad actually it's a little bit more 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.200
 clear a little higher and there a few 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.880
 colors this appeal 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.570
 to see them quickly the interface of 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.570
 the camera 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.470
 it's easy and in a good way but if 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.720
 it's true 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.620
 its good 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.470
 here we go 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.880
 that by mastering 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.350
 the capture grid with a hdr mode 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.710
 white ball 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.710
 if we 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.920
 these options there 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.050
 switch it to video of course 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.940
 the 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.920
 in passengers 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.850
 I actually started catching sorry 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.850
 here I am doing them 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.349
 talented 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.349
 hearing the smc 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.259
 What we have other 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.669
 good I imagine that at the level of emails the 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.330
 blow is not configured it should 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.510
 enjoy the conch on the terminal on 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.130
 we see it could be pretty good 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.590
 these are the icons you've seen with 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.780
 stÃ©phane gouzy rather rather nice 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.460
 my good faith I think I made 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.130
 which is about yours then it's 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.450
 a little device that she is pretty 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.660
 seductive it's actually kind 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.070
 basic interface android but with 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.140
 some customization on the part 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.849
 of alcatel that I find sympathetic 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.249
 it's pretty fluid to use 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.430
 it works well it is suggested been 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.260
 at 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.540
 what more can you say about a price that is not 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.850
 so little excessive and the dual sim option 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.680
 which is still not negligible then 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.270
 after in France we will see how he 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.230
 will be offered for sale I imagine that 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.500
 if he is at the operators 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.030
 it will be a holcim swan a priori but 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.850
 did not I think you can buy it 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.860
 dueling is to see in any case when 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.860
 it's coming out soon
