00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
have to think about engaging him a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
have to think about engaging him a
little<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.789> must<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.300> a<00:01:54.390> couple<00:01:54.720> other<00:01:54.899> half

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
little I must think a couple other half

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.469 
little I must think a couple other half
steps<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.220> trot<00:01:56.489> before<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> come<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
steps in the trot before you come to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.089 
steps in the trot before you come to
walk<00:01:57.690> do<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.319> what<00:01:58.410> I'm<00:01:58.500> saying

walk do you know what I'm saying
so<00:01:59.849> you<00:01:59.940> actually<00:02:00.239> make<00:02:00.810> him<00:02:00.959> think<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.349> little

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so you actually make him think a little

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
so you actually make him think a little
quicker<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.489> go<00:02:02.789> ahead<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.149> let<00:02:03.360> him

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
quicker and then go ahead and let him

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:03.919 
quicker and then go ahead and let him
finish

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
finish

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.229 
finish
but<00:02:04.470> when<00:02:04.619> he<00:02:04.739> kind<00:02:05.039> of<00:02:05.220> goes<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.550> this<00:02:05.940> and

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
but when he kind of goes like this and

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.080 
but when he kind of goes like this and
then<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> pull<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.989> he<00:02:07.050> goes<00:02:07.640> you're<00:02:08.640> saying

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
then you pull and he goes you're saying

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.660 
then you pull and he goes you're saying
you<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> make<00:02:10.410> yourself<00:02:10.739> think<00:02:11.400> about

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
you have to make yourself think about

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.790 
you have to make yourself think about
that<00:02:11.910> transition<00:02:12.660> being<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.050> little<00:02:13.319> bit<00:02:13.470> more

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that transition being a little bit more

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.979 
that transition being a little bit more
like<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.069> cup<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.459> steps<00:02:14.849> pee<00:02:15.150> off<00:02:15.330> before<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
like a cup of steps pee off before you

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.560 
like a cup of steps pee off before you
come<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.260> walk
