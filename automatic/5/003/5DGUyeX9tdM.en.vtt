00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.870 

all<00:00:01.530> right<00:00:01.680> so<00:00:01.800> let's<00:00:01.980> get<00:00:02.129> down<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.310> some<00:00:02.460> cold

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:02.880 
all right so let's get down to some cold

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.019 
all right so let's get down to some cold
weather<00:00:03.060> painting<00:00:04.310> as<00:00:05.310> many<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.729> you<00:00:05.850> guys<00:00:05.879> are

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
weather painting as many of you guys are

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.379 
weather painting as many of you guys are
probably<00:00:07.309> dealing<00:00:08.309> with<00:00:08.610> right<00:00:08.849> now<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.210> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
probably dealing with right now is the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.129 
probably dealing with right now is the
cold<00:00:09.599> temperatures<00:00:10.129> it's<00:00:11.129> probably<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:12.139> 50

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
cold temperatures it's probably about 50

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.780 
cold temperatures it's probably about 50
which<00:00:13.379> is<00:00:13.559> good<00:00:13.799> enough<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.009> me<00:00:14.129> to<00:00:14.280> paint<00:00:14.490> but

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
which is good enough for me to paint but

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.880 
which is good enough for me to paint but
you<00:00:15.030> still<00:00:15.839> kind<00:00:15.959> of<00:00:16.080> end<00:00:16.260> up<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.530> some<00:00:16.680> paint

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
you still kind of end up with some paint

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.460 
you still kind of end up with some paint
issues<00:00:17.039> when<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.580> uh<00:00:17.840> you<00:00:18.840> try<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.170> paint<00:00:19.380> in

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
issues when you uh you try and paint in

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.320 
issues when you uh you try and paint in
the<00:00:19.529> cold<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.580> I've<00:00:20.699> got<00:00:20.880> here<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.119> I've

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the cold so what I've got here is I've

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.029 
the cold so what I've got here is I've
got<00:00:22.310> hot<00:00:23.310> water<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.420> basically<00:00:25.109> hot

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
got hot water which is basically hot

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.499 
got hot water which is basically hot
enough<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.250> me<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> touch<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.330> burn

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
enough for me to touch but not to burn

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.929 
enough for me to touch but not to burn
it's<00:00:28.380> about<00:00:28.590> 80<00:00:28.890> degrees<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.849> you

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it's about 80 degrees or so you can you

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.889 
it's about 80 degrees or so you can you
can<00:00:30.359> usually<00:00:30.560> do<00:00:31.560> tap<00:00:31.800> water<00:00:32.750> put<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
can usually do tap water put in the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.940 
can usually do tap water put in the
microwave<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.469> container<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:36.950> boil

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
microwave the container or you can boil

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.459 
microwave the container or you can boil
it<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.489> make<00:00:38.670> sure<00:00:38.789> it's<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.260> warm<00:00:40.260> enough

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
it just make sure it's it's warm enough

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
it just make sure it's it's warm enough
for<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> touch<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.340> burn<00:00:41.520> yourself

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
for you to touch and not burn yourself

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.029 
for you to touch and not burn yourself
so<00:00:42.300> basically<00:00:43.260> we're<00:00:43.469> trying<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.920> get

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
so basically we're trying to do is get

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.380 
so basically we're trying to do is get
the<00:00:44.160> paints<00:00:45.140> heat<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.379> inside<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the paints heat it up inside here and it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.850 
the paints heat it up inside here and it
won't<00:00:48.480> make<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.050> explode<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.710> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
won't make the can explode because it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.569 
won't make the can explode because it's
not<00:00:50.010> fire<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.350> something<00:00:52.579> that's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
not fire and it's not something that's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.369 
not fire and it's not something that's
too<00:00:53.820> hot<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.359> to<00:00:54.449> handle<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.079> because

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
too hot for it to handle so because

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
too hot for it to handle so because
usually<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.070> think<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.609> most<00:00:56.850> paints

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
usually it's I think on the most paints

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:09.310 
usually it's I think on the most paints
it<00:00:57.300> says<00:00:57.480> between<00:00:58.039> 50<00:00:59.039> degrees<00:00:59.340> -<00:01:07.970> so

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
it says between 50 degrees - so

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.120 
it says between 50 degrees - so
basically<00:01:10.320> we're<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.620> trying<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> get<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
basically we're just trying to get the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.460 
basically we're just trying to get the
heat<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.670> paint<00:01:12.030> heated<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.480> what<00:01:13.230> I've<00:01:13.320> got

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
heat the paint heated up what I've got

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.830 
heat the paint heated up what I've got
here<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:14.210> drop<00:01:15.210> light<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.570> these<00:01:15.660> things

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
here is a drop light and these things

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
here is a drop light and these things
get<00:01:16.050> hot<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.800> I<00:01:16.830> basically<00:01:18.890> heat<00:01:19.890> onto<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.550> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
get hot so I basically heat onto the to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.410 
get hot so I basically heat onto the to
the<00:01:21.150> piece<00:01:21.560> we<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:23.790> when<00:01:24.330> you're

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the piece we know and when you're

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.520 
the piece we know and when you're
dealing<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.780> paints<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:26.730> two<00:01:26.940> main<00:01:27.530> parts

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
dealing with paints the two main parts

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.400 
dealing with paints the two main parts
of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> paint<00:01:29.190> are<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:32.060> pigment<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
of the paint are the pigment and the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.050 
of the paint are the pigment and the
solvent<00:01:34.860> which<00:01:34.980> is<00:01:35.100> used<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.780> help<00:01:37.670> make<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
solvent which is used to help make the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
solvent which is used to help make the
paint<00:01:39.300> spread<00:01:39.600> more<00:01:39.780> easily<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.470> what<00:01:41.160> we're

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
paint spread more easily so what we're

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.570 
paint spread more easily so what we're
going<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.920> warm<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.190> my<00:01:44.340> hand

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
going to do this is as warm as my hand

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.090 
going to do this is as warm as my hand
right<00:01:44.730> now<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.680> warmer<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.160> paint<00:01:47.400> is<00:01:49.100> well

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
right now the warmer the paint is well

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.800 
right now the warmer the paint is well
dry<00:01:50.370> as<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.880> shooting<00:01:51.240> through<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.480> air<00:01:51.660> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
dry as it's shooting through the air to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.330 
dry as it's shooting through the air to
hit<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:54.590> what<00:01:55.590> we're<00:01:55.740> looking<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.220> is

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
hit the so what we're looking to do is

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.700 
hit the so what we're looking to do is
basically<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.970> said<00:01:57.150> heat<00:01:57.300> up<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.510> paint

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
basically as I said heat up the paint

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.899 
basically as I said heat up the paint
I<00:01:58.830> just<00:01:59.159> dropped<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.520> bit<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.760> water

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
I just dropped a little bit of water

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.310 
I just dropped a little bit of water
here<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.330> gonna<00:02:00.420> wipe<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:00.900> all<00:02:01.140> down

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
here so I'm gonna wipe this up all down

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.370 
here so I'm gonna wipe this up all down
before<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.680> paint<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:06.140> basically<00:02:07.140> trying<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
before I paint it basically trying to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.850 
before I paint it basically trying to
make<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.560> pig<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.399> pig<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> stall

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
make the pig that the pig and the stall

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.470 
make the pig that the pig and the stall
then<00:02:11.069> evaporate<00:02:11.940> before<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.450> actually<00:02:14.480> there

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
then evaporate before it actually there

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.210 
then evaporate before it actually there
most<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> solvent<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.350> evaporate<00:02:17.100> before

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
most of the solvent if evaporate before

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.130 
most of the solvent if evaporate before
it<00:02:17.459> hits<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.050> painted<00:02:19.050> piece<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.989> this<00:02:21.989> is

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
it hits the painted piece so this is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.050 
it hits the painted piece so this is
probably<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.739> little<00:02:23.430> bit<00:02:23.580> colder<00:02:23.880> than<00:02:24.000> my

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
probably a little bit colder than my

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.660 
probably a little bit colder than my
hand<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.080> about<00:02:25.290> hand<00:02:25.770> temperature<00:02:26.250> so

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
hand this is about hand temperature so

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.660 
hand this is about hand temperature so
then<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.510> kind<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.810> want<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.020> spray<00:02:28.670> straight

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
then you kind of want to spray straight

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:39.110 
then you kind of want to spray straight
across<00:02:36.140> right<00:02:37.140> there<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.850> first

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
across right there this is the first

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.590 
across right there this is the first
coat<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.630> really<00:02:39.840> doesn't<00:02:40.019> matter<00:02:40.140> anyways

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
coat so it really doesn't matter anyways

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.660 
coat so it really doesn't matter anyways
but<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.989> want<00:02:43.200> your<00:02:43.320> paint<00:02:43.739> surface<00:02:44.130> as<00:02:44.489> dry

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
but you want your paint surface as dry

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.380 
but you want your paint surface as dry
as<00:02:44.790> possible<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.940> cold<00:02:47.940> temperature<00:02:48.300> you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
as possible and cold temperature you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:03:03.310 
as possible and cold temperature you
wonder<00:02:48.600> who's<00:02:48.720> warm<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:48.989> possible<00:02:49.170> so<00:03:01.910> and

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
wonder who's warm as possible so and

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.220 
wonder who's warm as possible so and
then<00:03:04.320> I'm<00:03:04.410> gonna<00:03:04.560> apply<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:06.600> drop<00:03:06.989> light

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
then I'm gonna apply the the drop light

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.970 
then I'm gonna apply the the drop light
heat<00:03:07.470> back<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.160> again<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.769> heats<00:03:10.769> up

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
heat back on to it again so it heats up

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.039 
heat back on to it again so it heats up
the<00:03:11.130> piece<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:12.530> allows<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:14.060> dry

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
the piece and allows it to dry

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.990 
the piece and allows it to dry
you<00:03:16.530> know<00:03:16.650> summer<00:03:17.340> temperature<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.910> it

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
you know summer temperature that it

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000 
you know summer temperature that it
normally<00:03:18.120> would<00:03:18.420> be<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.739> guys<00:03:19.829> have

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
normally would be so if you guys have

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.069 
normally would be so if you guys have
any<00:03:20.130> questions<00:03:20.430> let<00:03:20.579> me<00:03:20.640> know<00:03:20.870> but<00:03:21.870> that's

any questions let me know but that's

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.690 
any questions let me know but that's
pretty<00:03:22.290> straightforward<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:23.100> heat<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:23.549> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
pretty straightforward just heat up the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.970 
pretty straightforward just heat up the
cans<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.030> paint<00:03:24.209> with<00:03:24.450> some<00:03:24.930> water<00:03:25.140> warm<00:03:25.890> water

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
done painting it heat it some more to

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.640 
done painting it heat it some more to
