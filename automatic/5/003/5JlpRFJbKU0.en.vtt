00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610 

hi<00:00:00.179> so<00:00:00.510> today<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.840> gonna<00:00:00.900> be<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.319> over<00:00:01.439> a

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
hi so today we're gonna be going over a

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.560 
hi so today we're gonna be going over a
board<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.370> doesn't<00:00:02.580> turn<00:00:02.760> on<00:00:02.820> so<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.480> an

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
board that doesn't turn on so this is an

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.889 
board that doesn't turn on so this is an
a<00:00:03.689> 1502<00:00:04.350> MacBook<00:00:05.310> Pro<00:00:05.549> Retina<00:00:06.240> board<00:00:06.569> and

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
a 1502 MacBook Pro Retina board and

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.230 
a 1502 MacBook Pro Retina board and
let's<00:00:07.649> get<00:00:07.859> started<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.490> get<00:00:08.730> an<00:00:08.820> idea<00:00:09.030> what's

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
let's get started and get an idea what's

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.669 
let's get started and get an idea what's
going<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.380> was<00:00:10.559> already

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
going on with it so this was already

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.030 
going on with it so this was already
ultrasonically<00:00:11.340> cleaned<00:00:11.730> by<00:00:12.240> my<00:00:12.420> coworker

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
ultrasonically cleaned by my coworker

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.230 
ultrasonically cleaned by my coworker
unfortunately<00:00:14.040> there<00:00:14.219> was<00:00:14.309> no<00:00:14.490> note<00:00:14.700> left<00:00:14.969> of

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
unfortunately there was no note left of

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
unfortunately there was no note left of
where<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.599> liquid<00:00:15.780> was<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.440> actually<00:00:16.619> haven't

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
where the liquid was I actually haven't

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.160 
where the liquid was I actually haven't
been<00:00:17.460> telling<00:00:18.180> how<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.050> is

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
been telling how to do that so that is

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.470 
been telling how to do that so that is
totally<00:00:19.470> my<00:00:19.619> fault<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.340> didn't<00:00:21.090> tell<00:00:21.300> them

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
totally my fault here I didn't tell them

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.359 
totally my fault here I didn't tell them
to<00:00:21.689> tell<00:00:22.020> me<00:00:22.050> where<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> liquid<00:00:22.980> got<00:00:23.250> in

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
to tell me where it is the liquid got in

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.250 
to tell me where it is the liquid got in
the<00:00:23.430> board<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.449> makes<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> little<00:00:25.109> bit

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the board so that makes it a little bit

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
the board so that makes it a little bit
more<00:00:25.680> difficult<00:00:26.099> because<00:00:26.250> now<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> see

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
more difficult because now I got to see

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.990 
more difficult because now I got to see
where<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> damage<00:00:28.859> originally<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.880> one

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
where the damage originally was so one

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.339 
where the damage originally was so one
of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> things<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
of the things I like to do is I like to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.990 
of the things I like to do is I like to
know<00:00:31.470> where<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.679> damage<00:00:32.070> originally<00:00:32.850> was

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
know where the damage originally was

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
know where the damage originally was
because<00:00:33.239> it'll<00:00:33.540> give<00:00:33.660> me<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> hint<00:00:34.050> even<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
because it'll give me a hint even if the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
because it'll give me a hint even if the
component<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.850> area<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.390> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
component is not in that area that I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
component is not in that area that I
need<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.809> replace<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.770> happens<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.309> I

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
need to replace what happens is when I

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.799 
need to replace what happens is when I
know<00:00:38.460> where<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> damage<00:00:39.030> originally<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.600> at

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
know where the damage originally was at

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.060 
know where the damage originally was at
least<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.350> an<00:00:40.469> idea<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.829> where

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
least I can get an idea of where

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.430 
least I can get an idea of where
upstream<00:00:41.550> something<00:00:42.420> bad<00:00:42.629> might<00:00:43.320> have

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
upstream something bad might have

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770 
upstream something bad might have
happened<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.210> let's<00:00:45.390> say<00:00:45.539> there's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
happened so you know let's say there's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.840 
happened so you know let's say there's
damage<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.739> logic<00:00:47.250> gate<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> logic

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
damage on one logic gate but the logic

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.490 
damage on one logic gate but the logic
gate<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.090> good<00:00:48.239> maybe<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> signal<00:00:49.200> coming

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
gate is good maybe the signal coming

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.959 
gate is good maybe the signal coming
into<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> logic<00:00:49.980> cave<00:00:50.190> maybe<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> component

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
into the logic cave maybe the component

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
into the logic cave maybe the component
that<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.629> responsible<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.350> may<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.620> bad

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
that was responsible for that may be bad

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.350 
that was responsible for that may be bad
maybe<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> resistor<00:00:53.610> upstream<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> other

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
maybe a resistor upstream on the other

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.150 
maybe a resistor upstream on the other
side<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.719> board<00:00:54.899> may<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.110> bad<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:56.039> never

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
side of the board may be bad you never

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.529 
side of the board may be bad you never
know<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.910> know<00:00:57.030> where<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> damage

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
know but when you know where the damage

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.880 
know but when you know where the damage
originally<00:00:57.930> started<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> general

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
originally started you have a general

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.330 
originally started you have a general
idea<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.430> where<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> look<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.600> all<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
idea of where to look and all of this is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.490 
idea of where to look and all of this is
really<00:01:02.550> narrowing<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.229> very

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
really narrowing down in a very very

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.830 
really narrowing down in a very very
short<00:01:04.650> period<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.220> time<00:01:05.280> where<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.659> have

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
short period of time where it is I have

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.890 
short period of time where it is I have
to<00:01:06.960> look<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> figure<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> problem<00:01:08.040> because

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
to look to figure out a problem because

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
to look to figure out a problem because
we<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> time<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.920> test<00:01:11.100> every

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
we don't have the time to test every

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.679 
we don't have the time to test every
single<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.450> machine

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
single thing in this in this machine

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.940 
single thing in this in this machine
that's<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> want<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that's that's one thing that I want to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
that's that's one thing that I want to
get<00:01:14.100> through<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.840> there

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
get through a lot of you you know there

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.480 
get through a lot of you you know there
are<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> lot<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.380> boards<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:16.920> actually

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
are a lot of boards that are actually

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
are a lot of boards that are actually
fixable<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.060> they<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.600> fixed<00:01:18.930> by<00:01:19.080> us

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
fixable but they don't get fixed by us

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
fixable but they don't get fixed by us
or<00:01:19.590> by<00:01:19.619> other<00:01:19.830> companies<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.400> it's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
or by other companies because it's

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
or by other companies because it's
simply<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.540> worth<00:01:21.840> our<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.920> spend<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
simply not worth our time to spend the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.120 
simply not worth our time to spend the
entire<00:01:23.369> day<00:01:23.640> screwing<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.650> to<00:01:25.650> find<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
entire day screwing with it to find a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
entire day screwing with it to find a
fault<00:01:26.369> we're<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.210> gonna<00:01:27.360> spend<00:01:27.630> eight<00:01:28.259> hours

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
fault we're not gonna spend eight hours

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.340 
fault we're not gonna spend eight hours
on<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> single<00:01:29.100> board<00:01:29.780> just<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> that's<00:01:31.200> just

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
on a single board just that that's just

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.800 
on a single board just that that's just
what<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.130> gotta<00:01:32.490> look<00:01:32.939> at<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.570> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
what it is you gotta look at what this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.770 
what it is you gotta look at what this
is<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.790> an

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
is this is not this is not you know an

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
is this is not this is not you know an
antique<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.159> something<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
antique it's not something that's in a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.170 
antique it's not something that's in a
museum<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.799> basic<00:01:43.799> basic<00:01:44.579> product

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
museum it's a basic basic product

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.109 
museum it's a basic basic product
nothing<00:01:45.840> special<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.640> worth<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.909> certain

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
nothing special and it's worth a certain

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.090 
nothing special and it's worth a certain
amount<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> money<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.960> time<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.860> worth<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
amount of money and time is worth a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.789 
amount of money and time is worth a
certain<00:01:50.220> amount<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.520> money<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> let's<00:01:52.590> see

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
certain amount of money so let's see

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.399 
certain amount of money so let's see
first<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.430> power<00:01:53.780> rails<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:54.899> present<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
first what power rails are present and

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
first what power rails are present and
which<00:01:55.530> ones<00:01:55.740> aren't<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.420> get<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> little

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
which ones aren't they get a little

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.550 
which ones aren't they get a little
basic<00:01:57.810> idea<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:59.130> what's<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.490> on<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
basic idea of what's going on so I get a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.010 
basic idea of what's going on so I get a
green<00:02:01.770> light<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> charger<00:02:02.780> which<00:02:03.780> means

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
green light in the charger which means

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.969 
green light in the charger which means
that<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.350> wire<00:02:04.530> circuit<00:02:04.920> works<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:06.979> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that the one wire circuit works and to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.979 
that the one wire circuit works and to
the<00:02:08.069> fan<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.369> spinning<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.720> actually

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the fan is spinning so it's actually

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.260 
the fan is spinning so it's actually
turning<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.819> which<00:02:11.819> means<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.300> works

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
turning on which means that it works

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.120 
turning on which means that it works
which<00:02:14.020> means<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.500> there's<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.800> good<00:02:14.950> chance

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
which means that there's a good chance

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.560 
which means that there's a good chance
that<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.370> actually<00:02:15.580> don't<00:02:15.880> have<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.120> do<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.240> logic

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
that I actually don't have to do a logic

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.270 
that I actually don't have to do a logic
board<00:02:16.720> repair<00:02:16.960> today<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.890> let's<00:02:18.040> see<00:02:18.130> if<00:02:18.220> it

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
board repair today so let's see if it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.590 
board repair today so let's see if it
turns<00:02:18.460> on<00:02:18.640> when<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.850> plug<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.270> stuff<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
turns on when I plug in the stuff in the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:31.250 
turns on when I plug in the stuff in the
machine<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:28.570> is<00:02:28.780> pretty<00:02:28.960> cool

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.560 

you<00:02:32.260> understand<00:02:32.890> let<00:02:33.820> me<00:02:33.880> see<00:02:34.030> if<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.180> can<00:02:34.360> show

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
you understand let me see if I can show

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.210 
you understand let me see if I can show
you<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.470> hide<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.800> names<00:02:36.010> obviously

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
you I have to hide the names obviously

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.340 
you I have to hide the names obviously
so<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.180> keep<00:02:37.300> in<00:02:37.420> mind<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.660> took<00:02:37.720> about<00:02:38.020> four<00:02:38.260> or

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
so to keep in mind I took about four or

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.500 
so to keep in mind I took about four or
five<00:02:38.530> days<00:02:38.740> off<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.460> class<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.120> this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
five days off to do this class and this

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.690 
five days off to do this class and this
is<00:02:40.630> what<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.780> come<00:02:40.960> back<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.350> like<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.770> this<00:02:42.400> is

what I come back to so um this
is<00:02:46.150> pretty<00:02:46.360> cool<00:02:46.570> because<00:02:46.720> I'm<00:02:47.080> gonna<00:02:47.260> be

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
is pretty cool because I'm gonna be

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.410 
is pretty cool because I'm gonna be
getting<00:02:47.620> something<00:02:47.830> out<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.940> status

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
getting something out of this status

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.380 
getting something out of this status
without<00:02:50.170> actually<00:02:51.130> having<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.460> fix<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.820> so<00:02:51.970> let

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
without actually having to fix it so let

without actually having to fix it so let
me<00:02:52.480> tell<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:52.810> most<00:02:52.990> likely<00:02:53.320> happened

me tell you what most likely happened

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.080 
me tell you what most likely happened
here<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.100> this<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.340> only<00:02:54.820> reason

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
here and this is this the only reason

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.280 
here and this is this the only reason
I'm<00:02:55.180> gonna<00:02:55.270> be<00:02:55.450> uploading<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.930> video<00:02:56.080> is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
I'm gonna be uploading this video is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.050 
I'm gonna be uploading this video is
because<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.860> happens<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.310> me<00:02:57.490> all<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
because it happens to me all the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.700 
because it happens to me all the
time<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.360> it's<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:58.960> something<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.500> you

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
time and it's really something that you

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.380 
time and it's really something that you
should<00:02:59.890> be<00:02:59.980> aware<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:00.640> you're<00:03:00.910> working<00:03:01.210> on

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
should be aware of if you're working on

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.550 
should be aware of if you're working on
these<00:03:01.510> machines<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.020> dealing<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.260> liquid

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
these machines and dealing with liquid

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.680 
these machines and dealing with liquid
damage<00:03:02.710> so<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.850> can<00:03:04.000> dry<00:03:04.210> them<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.540> can

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
damage so you can dry them you can

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
damage so you can dry them you can
ultrasonically<00:03:05.260> clean<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.710> can<00:03:05.830> put<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
ultrasonically clean it you can put the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.650 
ultrasonically clean it you can put the
alcohol<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.490> it<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.760> can<00:03:06.910> dry<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.210> off<00:03:07.360> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
alcohol in it and you can dry it off and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.870 
alcohol in it and you can dry it off and
it<00:03:08.260> won't<00:03:08.440> work<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:08.980> it'll<00:03:09.130> work<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.520> day<00:03:09.640> later

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
it won't work but it'll work a day later

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.160 
it won't work but it'll work a day later
and<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> reason<00:03:10.450> for<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.840> there's<00:03:10.990> still

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
and the reason for that is there's still

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.500 
and the reason for that is there's still
some<00:03:11.350> liquid<00:03:11.500> that's<00:03:12.310> hiding<00:03:12.760> somewhere<00:03:13.300> and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
some liquid that's hiding somewhere and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.790 
some liquid that's hiding somewhere and
that<00:03:13.600> stupid<00:03:13.840> little<00:03:14.110> liquid<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.500> making

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
that stupid little liquid is making

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.760 
that stupid little liquid is making
something<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.910> know<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.360> one<00:03:16.900> kiloohm<00:03:17.350> and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
something you know the one kiloohm and

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.440 
something you know the one kiloohm and
it<00:03:17.860> should<00:03:17.980> be<00:03:18.070> ten<00:03:18.310> kilo<00:03:18.580> ohms<00:03:18.730> because<00:03:19.300> it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
it should be ten kilo ohms because it's

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.580 
it should be ten kilo ohms because it's
it's<00:03:19.600> touching<00:03:19.810> points<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.350> it's<00:03:20.470> not

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
it's touching points that it's not

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.290 
it's touching points that it's not
supposed<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.340> what<00:03:21.850> winds<00:03:22.150> up<00:03:22.240> happening

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
supposed to and what winds up happening

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.450 
supposed to and what winds up happening
is<00:03:22.870> because<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.650> wherever<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.280> it

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
is because of that wherever it is it

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.120 
is because of that wherever it is it
causes<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.940> boy<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.240> not<00:03:25.390> work<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:27.070> is

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
causes the boy to not work so this is

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.290 
causes the boy to not work so this is
it's<00:03:27.370> really<00:03:27.520> important<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.030> dry<00:03:28.240> these

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
it's really important to dry these

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.750 
it's really important to dry these
things<00:03:28.720> all<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.710> way<00:03:29.740> so<00:03:29.920> what<00:03:30.370> I'm<00:03:30.520> guessing

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
things all the way so what I'm guessing

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.360 
things all the way so what I'm guessing
happened<00:03:31.240> here<00:03:31.420> is<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.750> board<00:03:32.050> got<00:03:32.370> got

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
happened here is that this board got got

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.480 
happened here is that this board got got
altra<00:03:33.670> sonic<00:03:34.170> after<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.260> ultrasonic<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.010> put

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
altra sonic after the ultrasonic it put

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.850 
altra sonic after the ultrasonic it put
in<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.840> alcohol<00:03:38.260> bath<00:03:38.500> then

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
in the in the in the alcohol bath then

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.080 
in the in the in the alcohol bath then
it<00:03:38.950> got<00:03:39.070> put<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.370> air<00:03:39.460> filter<00:03:39.790> for<00:03:39.910> an<00:03:40.000> hour

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
it got put in the air filter for an hour

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.700 
it got put in the air filter for an hour
to<00:03:40.270> dry<00:03:40.480> off<00:03:40.660> after<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.320> hour<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.590> their

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
to dry off after the hour and their

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.920 
to dry off after the hour and their
filter<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.250> looked<00:03:42.430> really<00:03:42.670> dry<00:03:42.910> but<00:03:43.450> somebody

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
filter it looked really dry but somebody

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.080 
filter it looked really dry but somebody
tried<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.380> turn<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.220> on<00:03:45.430> they<00:03:45.730> notice<00:03:45.970> it

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
tried to turn it on they notice it

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.670 
tried to turn it on they notice it
didn't<00:03:46.270> turn<00:03:46.360> on<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:46.870> then<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.410> amount<00:03:47.620> of

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
didn't turn on and then in the amount of

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.410 
didn't turn on and then in the amount of
time<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.130> was<00:03:48.220> sitting<00:03:48.520> on<00:03:48.730> my<00:03:49.090> desk

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
time that it was sitting on my desk

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.420 
time that it was sitting on my desk
right<00:03:49.750> by<00:03:50.110> my<00:03:50.410> air-conditioning<00:03:51.100> vent<00:03:51.310> which

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
right by my air-conditioning vent which

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.670 
right by my air-conditioning vent which
is<00:03:51.550> blowing<00:03:51.910> air<00:03:52.060> on<00:03:52.210> it<00:03:52.360> which<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.590> know

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
is blowing air on it which is you know

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.470 
is blowing air on it which is you know
low<00:03:54.190> humidity<00:03:54.640> air<00:03:54.760> obviously<00:03:55.210> since<00:03:55.360> it's

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
low humidity air obviously since it's

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.760 
low humidity air obviously since it's
coming<00:03:55.660> from<00:03:55.750> an<00:03:55.870> air<00:03:55.990> conditioner<00:03:56.380> it

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
coming from an air conditioner it

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.810 
coming from an air conditioner it
decided<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.190> drive<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.790> now<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.630> works<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.820> now

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
decided to drive and now it works so now

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.670 
decided to drive and now it works so now
I<00:04:00.880> get<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.360> look<00:04:01.450> like<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.690> genius<00:04:02.080> who<00:04:02.380> fixed

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
I get to look like a genius who fixed

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.440 
I get to look like a genius who fixed
the<00:04:02.710> retina<00:04:03.040> board<00:04:03.280> in<00:04:03.400> five<00:04:03.820> minutes<00:04:04.240> so<00:04:04.300> when

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
the retina board in five minutes so when

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.230 
the retina board in five minutes so when
I<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.440> hand<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.770> back<00:04:05.800> to<00:04:05.950> them<00:04:06.370> but<00:04:07.030> in

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
I and I hand it back to them but in

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.910 
I and I hand it back to them but in
reality<00:04:07.300> all<00:04:07.720> I've<00:04:08.050> done<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.290> I've<00:04:08.590> literally

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
reality all I've done is I've literally

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.560 
reality all I've done is I've literally
done<00:04:09.370> nothing<00:04:09.430> but<00:04:09.790> sit<00:04:10.060> here<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.360> put<00:04:10.450> this

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
done nothing but sit here and put this

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.000 
done nothing but sit here and put this
 back<00:04:10.900> together<00:04:11.020> so<00:04:11.620> again<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:11.920> reason

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
 back together so again the reason

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.250 
 back together so again the reason
I'm<00:04:12.220> uploading<00:04:12.400> this<00:04:12.760> is<00:04:12.910> my<00:04:13.570> staff<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:14.050> very

pulling the thing out because of

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.489 
pulling the thing out because of
