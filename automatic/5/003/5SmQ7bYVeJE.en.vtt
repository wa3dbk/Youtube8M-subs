00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.970 
you have the idea of jumping into it
you<00:02:47.330> could<00:02:47.480> use<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> variation<00:02:48.319> of<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.620> sort

you could use a variation of this sort

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.979 
you could use a variation of this sort
of<00:02:49.040> into<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> transition<00:02:50.180> into<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> flyweight

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.290 
of into a transition into a flyweight
it's<00:02:51.470> not<00:02:51.650> really<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> flyweight<00:02:52.520> but<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.060> jump

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
it's not really a flyweight but you jump

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.809 
it's not really a flyweight but you jump
on<00:02:53.480> both<00:02:53.959> hands<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.500> top<00:02:54.709> bar<00:02:54.980> throw<00:02:55.700> it

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
on both hands on the top bar throw it

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.910 
on both hands on the top bar throw it
sideways<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.599> Russian<00:02:56.930> soldier<00:02:59.920> it's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
sideways like a Russian soldier it's

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.220 
sideways like a Russian soldier it's
kind<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.160> like<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> flat<00:03:01.580> way<00:03:01.959> now<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.050> don't

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
kind of like a flat way now you don't

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.800 
kind of like a flat way now you don't
necessarily<00:03:03.319> always<00:03:04.100> have<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.819> bar<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
necessarily always have a bar and the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.680 
necessarily always have a bar and the
bar<00:03:06.050> sometimes<00:03:06.890> you'll<00:03:07.489> have<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.670> bar<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.569> a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
bar sometimes you'll have a bar and a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.809 
bar sometimes you'll have a bar and a
wall<00:03:08.900> you're<00:03:09.739> gonna<00:03:09.800> throw<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:10.160> essentially

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
wall you're gonna throw this essentially

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.630 
wall you're gonna throw this essentially
the<00:03:10.970> same<00:03:11.209> as<00:03:11.510> just<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.230> one<00:03:12.440> hand<00:03:12.739> but<00:03:13.519> you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
the same as just the one hand but you

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.150 
the same as just the one hand but you
can<00:03:13.760> put<00:03:13.910> your<00:03:14.030> hand<00:03:14.239> on<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.450> wall<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:15.410> take<00:03:16.040> it

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
can put your hand on the wall so take it

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.350 
can put your hand on the wall so take it
up<00:03:16.510> pull<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.540> around<00:03:17.690> through<00:03:18.080> or<00:03:19.239> put<00:03:20.239> your

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
up pull it around through or put your

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.699 
up pull it around through or put your
foot<00:03:20.600> on<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.870> wall<00:03:21.050> as<00:03:21.290> well<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.480> hands<00:03:23.480> but

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.509 

once<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:27.769> get<00:03:27.860> your<00:03:27.980> Russian<00:03:28.190> pull<00:03:28.340> through

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
once you get your Russian pull through

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.039 
once you get your Russian pull through
down<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.880> can<00:03:29.000> start<00:03:29.209> messing<00:03:29.569> with<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.780> making

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
down I can start messing with it making

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.530 
down I can start messing with it making
your<00:03:30.260> own<00:03:30.290> variations<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.250> weird<00:03:31.489> stuff<00:03:31.760> for

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
your own variations and weird stuff for

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.330 
your own variations and weird stuff for
instance<00:03:32.930> one<00:03:33.140> of<00:03:33.170> them<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.440> we<00:03:33.530> can<00:03:33.560> do<00:03:33.950> it's

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
instance one of them that we can do it's

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.100 
instance one of them that we can do it's
a<00:03:34.370> regular<00:03:34.730> Russian<00:03:34.910> pull<00:03:35.269> through<00:03:35.480> until<00:03:35.870> you

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
a regular Russian pull through until you

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.030 
a regular Russian pull through until you
get<00:03:36.260> all<00:03:36.350> crossed<00:03:36.680> up<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.370> then<00:03:37.519> pop<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.600> back

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
get all crossed up and then pop it back

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.690 
get all crossed up and then pop it back
theoretically<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.190> could<00:03:40.340> just<00:03:40.519> do<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
theoretically you could just do the

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.370 
theoretically you could just do the
front<00:03:40.940> one<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.450> got<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.630> start<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:42.170> little

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
front one you got to start a little

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.660 
front one you got to start a little
weird<00:03:42.799> here<00:03:43.390> go<00:03:44.390> forward<00:03:44.920> but<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.280> play<00:03:46.519> with

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
weird here go forward but you play with

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:55.240 
weird here go forward but you play with
it<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:46.940> figure<00:03:47.299> it<00:03:47.390> out<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:48.290> tightest<00:03:48.980> rush

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.789 

count<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:58.110> that's<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.349> Russian<00:03:58.620> pull

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
count it so that's a Russian pull
