 I like my monthly favorites from you 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 the month of august and the month was yes 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.860
 unfortunately not so mathematically 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.900
 summery but I'm lucky now 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.700
 still on vacation as he is behind me 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.890
 so you probably can not recognize 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 my normal background and there me 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.990
 you can also see a very beautiful 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.550
 berglandschaft 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 even if you are still alright 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.730
 chosen and if in the background 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.750
 Noises are heard there are a few tracks 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 in the pool 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.349
 So just do not get involved 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
 I am disturbing and authentic here, too 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 not too bad so now wish 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.880

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.880
 at the video 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.720
 So really you deal with that pure and 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.849
 try to walk a bit in the shop 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.750
 they are really great ideas and 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:14.170
 grad the color for the autumn 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.879
 bit gaudy and also goes well with 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.840
 the autumnal go now I will show you 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:24.909
 still my fashionblog from these 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.260
 According to the look you have 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.420
 probably already in my look book 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.340
 but seen it is easy 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.739
 My current favorite look because of that 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.689
 I had to show it to you again what 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.180
 but the blouse from hm 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:55.450
 The pants are from the bulls- and I have 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:56.950
 my colleagues and I have her 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.790
 I have to try it 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.790
 I know it's pretty expensive 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:55.940
 because it is practically presented that is 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.940
 Well 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:12.199
