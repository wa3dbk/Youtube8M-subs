tech<00:00:09.240> director<00:00:09.389> hello<00:00:10.519> so<00:00:11.519> Chris<00:00:11.759> at<00:00:12.030> um<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
tech director hello so Chris at um a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.509 
tech director hello so Chris at um a
little<00:00:12.540> bit<00:00:12.719> about<00:00:12.960> how<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.530> build<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
little bit about how you build the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.400 
little bit about how you build the
variables<00:00:15.030> into<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.420> planets<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.020> make<00:00:16.170> them

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
variables into the planets to make them

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.550 
variables into the planets to make them
to<00:00:16.890> give<00:00:17.039> us<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.220> lot<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.369> options<00:00:18.080> yeah<00:00:19.080> we've

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
to give us a lot of options yeah we've

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.080 
to give us a lot of options yeah we've
been<00:00:19.710> using<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.039> program<00:00:20.220> called<00:00:20.430> substance

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
been using a program called substance

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.060 
been using a program called substance
designer<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.660> allows<00:00:21.930> us<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> procedurally

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
designer which allows us to procedurally

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.910 
designer which allows us to procedurally
generates<00:00:24.080> they<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:25.380> set<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
generates they have to be set up in a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
generates they have to be set up in a
certain<00:00:26.130> way<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:26.670> certain<00:00:27.000> things<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.660> we

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
certain way to do certain things but we

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
certain way to do certain things but we
have<00:00:28.050> different<00:00:28.500> features<00:00:28.650> such<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.099> oceans

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
have different features such as oceans

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.860 
have different features such as oceans
land<00:00:30.480> mountains<00:00:31.170> ice<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.300> cloud<00:00:33.300> layers<00:00:33.540> for

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
land mountains ice and cloud layers for

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.319 
land mountains ice and cloud layers for
example<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.030> these<00:00:36.120> different

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
example so with all these different

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.420 
example so with all these different
variables<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.559> hit<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> button<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
variables you can just hit a button and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.100 
variables you can just hit a button and
it<00:00:38.550> randomly<00:00:38.760> generates<00:00:39.360> whatever<00:00:39.809> planet

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it randomly generates whatever planet

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
it randomly generates whatever planet
type<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.559> want<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.190> we'll<00:00:41.670> have

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
type that you want so we'll have

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.220 
type that you want so we'll have
different<00:00:42.950> genres<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.160> planets<00:00:44.850> um<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
different genres of planets um so you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
different genres of planets um so you
can<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.620> an<00:00:46.860> icy<00:00:47.219> planet<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
can have an icy planet you can have a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.630 
can have an icy planet you can have a
mostly<00:00:48.629> ocean<00:00:49.260> planet<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> very

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
mostly ocean planet you can have a very

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.939 
mostly ocean planet you can have a very
rocky<00:00:50.940> planet<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> all<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.590> these<00:00:52.710> are

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
rocky planet and all of these are

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.290 
rocky planet and all of these are
completely<00:00:53.699> procedurally<00:00:54.270> generated

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
completely procedurally generated

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630 
completely procedurally generated
through<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> same<00:00:55.260> material<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.340> one

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
through the same material so it's one

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.340 
through the same material so it's one
material<00:00:56.910> controls<00:00:57.480> all<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.750> planets

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
material controls all the planets

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
material controls all the planets
throughout<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> same<00:00:58.980> type<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> we've<00:01:00.660> got

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
throughout the same type so we've got

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.270 
throughout the same type so we've got
three<00:01:01.050> different<00:01:01.320> types<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> planets<00:01:01.829> we've

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
three different types of planets we've

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310 
three different types of planets we've
got<00:01:02.489> earth-like<00:01:02.940> planets<00:01:03.390> rock<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.870> planets

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
got earth-like planets rock like planets

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.310 
got earth-like planets rock like planets
and<00:01:04.500> gas<00:01:05.460> giant<00:01:05.880> planets<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> all<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.140> them

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and gas giant planets and all of them

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
and gas giant planets and all of them
are<00:01:07.560> set<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> same<00:01:09.090> sort<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> ways<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
are set up in the same sort of ways so

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500 
are set up in the same sort of ways so
they<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.799> within<00:01:11.220> their<00:01:11.520> type<00:01:11.970> be

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
they can all within their type be

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.429 
they can all within their type be
randomly<00:01:13.200> generated<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.570> rock<00:01:16.259> like

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
randomly generated on the rock like

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.560 
randomly generated on the rock like
planets<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.040> example<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:18.240> completely

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
planets for example look completely

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.940 
planets for example look completely
different<00:01:18.659> than<00:01:19.020> earth-like<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.740> they

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
different than earth-like because they

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
different than earth-like because they
lack<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> atmosphere<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
lack the atmosphere and because of that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
lack the atmosphere and because of that
they're<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.740> damaged<00:01:23.460> by<00:01:23.640> asteroids<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
they're more damaged by asteroids and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
they're more damaged by asteroids and
different<00:01:25.080> kinds<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.380> debris<00:01:25.590> hitting<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
different kinds of debris hitting the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.710 
different kinds of debris hitting the
planet<00:01:26.250> itself<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.000> you've<00:01:27.119> got<00:01:27.150> craters

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
planet itself so you've got craters

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.010 
planet itself so you've got craters
you've<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.369> lava<00:01:29.369> flow<00:01:29.759> compared<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.450> earth

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you've got lava flow compared to earth

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.210 
you've got lava flow compared to earth
where<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.500> mostly<00:01:31.860> land<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:33.049> water<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:35.070> gas

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
where it's mostly land or water the gas

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
where it's mostly land or water the gas
like<00:01:35.460> planets<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> lot<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> variety<00:01:37.439> as

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
like planets have a lot of variety as

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.219 
like planets have a lot of variety as
well<00:01:37.770> where<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.220> change<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.630> cloud<00:01:39.869> size

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
well where you can change the cloud size

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.330 
well where you can change the cloud size
the<00:01:40.650> noise<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:42.180> polar<00:01:42.479> coloring<00:01:43.340> everything

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the noise the polar coloring everything

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.620 
the noise the polar coloring everything
is<00:01:44.460> dynamic<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.720> even<00:01:46.290> set<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.579> a<00:01:47.579> dynamic<00:01:48.299> sons

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is dynamic I even set up a dynamic sons

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.080 
is dynamic I even set up a dynamic sons
so<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.439> change<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> colors<00:01:50.820> depending

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so you can change the colors depending

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.030 
so you can change the colors depending
on<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.570> solar<00:01:51.810> system<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.860> have

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
on what solar system and go to they have

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.340 
on what solar system and go to they have
different<00:01:53.250> flares<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.030> everything<00:01:54.630> again<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
different flares and everything again is

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.039 
different flares and everything again is
procedurally<00:01:56.009> generated<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> these<00:01:57.659> planets

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
procedurally generated and these planets

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.749 
procedurally generated and these planets
aren't<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.590> pretty<00:01:58.890> surface<00:01:59.399> they

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
aren't just a pretty surface they

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.520 
aren't just a pretty surface they
actually<00:02:00.240> will<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.659> impact<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
actually will have impact on the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.530 
actually will have impact on the
gameplay<00:02:01.979> how<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.549> interact<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.180> them<00:02:03.390> will

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
gameplay how you interact with them will

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.639 
gameplay how you interact with them will
be<00:02:03.659> different<00:02:03.899> based<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.439> kind<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
be different based on what kind of

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.880 
be different based on what kind of
planet<00:02:04.890> they<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:07.320> takes<00:02:07.530> us<00:02:07.740> into

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
planet they are so that takes us into

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.400 
planet they are so that takes us into
our<00:02:08.039> adventure<00:02:08.550> mode<00:02:08.729> where<00:02:09.450> Kristen<00:02:09.840> Bigard

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
our adventure mode where Kristen Bigard

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.390 
our adventure mode where Kristen Bigard
have<00:02:10.500> been<00:02:10.619> working<00:02:10.920> on

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
have been working on

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.979 
have been working on
putting<00:02:11.549> together<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.849> very<00:02:12.150> early<00:02:12.390> prototype

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
putting together a very early prototype

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.470 
putting together a very early prototype
this<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:14.250> important<00:02:14.700> portion<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
this is a very important portion of the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.140 
this is a very important portion of the
game<00:02:16.189> Sauve<00:02:17.189> guard<00:02:17.430> once<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> go<00:02:17.879> ahead<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
game Sauve guard once you go ahead and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.809 
game Sauve guard once you go ahead and
talk<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.329> little<00:02:18.510> bit<00:02:18.689> about<00:02:18.900> our<00:02:19.819> adventure

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
talk a little bit about our adventure

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.630 
talk a little bit about our adventure
mode<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.269> how<00:02:21.360> that's<00:02:21.510> put<00:02:21.780> together<00:02:22.220> yeah<00:02:23.220> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
mode and how that's put together yeah so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.449 
mode and how that's put together yeah so
this<00:02:24.299> is<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.510> very<00:02:25.079> very<00:02:25.260> early<00:02:25.620> version<00:02:26.129> of<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
this is a very very early version of the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.369 
this is a very very early version of the
adventure<00:02:27.060> mode<00:02:27.269> still<00:02:27.569> but<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.989> wanted<00:02:28.319> to

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
adventure mode still but we wanted to

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.830 
adventure mode still but we wanted to
sort<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:28.980> put<00:02:29.220> everything<00:02:29.370> together<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.720> way

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
sort of put everything together in a way

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.920 
sort of put everything together in a way
that<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.200> could<00:02:31.409> iterate<00:02:31.859> on<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.370> later<00:02:32.489> and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
that we could iterate on it later and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.030 
that we could iterate on it later and
one<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.170> things<00:02:34.200> I've<00:02:34.470> been<00:02:34.620> doing<00:02:34.890> is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
one of the things I've been doing is

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
one of the things I've been doing is
taking<00:02:35.519> those<00:02:36.150> procedural<00:02:37.140> textures<00:02:37.650> that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
taking those procedural textures that

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.349 
taking those procedural textures that
Chris<00:02:39.060> has<00:02:39.450> been<00:02:39.799> grating<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.329> placing<00:02:42.329> them

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
Chris has been grating and placing them

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.619 
Chris has been grating and placing them
into<00:02:42.659> like<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.440> proper<00:02:44.310> data<00:02:44.879> system<00:02:45.450> to

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
into like the proper data system to

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.680 
into like the proper data system to
generate<00:02:46.079> all<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:47.010> those<00:02:47.159> planets<00:02:47.459> at<00:02:48.389> runtime

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
generate all of those planets at runtime

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.670 
generate all of those planets at runtime
and<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:50.040> one<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.030> big<00:02:51.359> benefits<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.959> this

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
and so one of the big benefits of this

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.379 
and so one of the big benefits of this
type<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> procedural<00:02:53.849> approach<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.329> the

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
type of procedural approach to the

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.300 
type of procedural approach to the
texturing<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:56.280> kinds

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
texturing is that we can have all kinds

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.710 
texturing is that we can have all kinds
of<00:02:56.730> different<00:02:57.060> planets<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.659> have

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
of different planets that we can have

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.509 
of different planets that we can have
literally<00:02:58.230> hundreds<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.709> thousands<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.340> them

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
literally hundreds of thousands of them

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.610 
literally hundreds of thousands of them
in<00:02:59.879> a<00:03:00.000> single<00:03:00.299> megabytes<00:03:00.689> of<00:03:00.780> memory<00:03:00.840> yeah

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
in a single megabytes of memory yeah

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.949 
in a single megabytes of memory yeah
this<00:03:01.799> portion<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.370> game<00:03:02.579> will<00:03:03.359> be<00:03:03.480> highly

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
this portion of the game will be highly

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.869 
this portion of the game will be highly
interactive<00:03:04.170> will<00:03:04.680> have<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.859> lot<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.129> different

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
interactive will have a lot of different

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.670 
interactive will have a lot of different
ships<00:03:06.599> flying<00:03:06.840> around<00:03:07.139> doing<00:03:07.530> their<00:03:07.560> own

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
ships flying around doing their own

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.330 
ships flying around doing their own
thing<00:03:07.799> there<00:03:08.609> will<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.790> lot<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.930> know

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
thing there will be a lot of you know

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.460 
thing there will be a lot of you know
randomly<00:03:11.340> generated<00:03:11.879> events<00:03:12.439> there'll<00:03:13.439> be

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
randomly generated events there'll be

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.780 
randomly generated events there'll be
things<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:14.010> explore<00:03:14.569> derelict<00:03:15.569> ships<00:03:15.900> and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
things to explore derelict ships and

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.699 
things to explore derelict ships and
maybe<00:03:17.790> let<00:03:18.030> all<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.299> stuff<00:03:18.599> so<00:03:19.379> what<00:03:19.590> you're

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
maybe let all that stuff so what you're

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.550 
maybe let all that stuff so what you're
looking<00:03:19.919> at<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.579> very<00:03:21.000> first<00:03:21.599> iteration

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
looking at is the very first iteration

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.439 
looking at is the very first iteration
of<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.859> we<00:03:23.459> want<00:03:23.639> this<00:03:23.849> portion<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.329> game

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
of this we want this portion of the game

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.449 
of this we want this portion of the game
to<00:03:24.569> look<00:03:24.720> really<00:03:24.989> good<00:03:25.169> all<00:03:26.069> right<00:03:26.280> everybody

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that was our planetary system and our

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.559 
that was our planetary system and our
