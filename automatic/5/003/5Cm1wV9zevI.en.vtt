really can do any style you want I'm

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.820 
really can do any style you want I'm
using<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.909> two<00:01:12.120> inch<00:01:12.440> barrel<00:01:13.440> but

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
using I think a two inch barrel but

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.440 
using I think a two inch barrel but
basically<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.490> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.909> creating<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
basically I'm just kind of creating a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.310 
basically I'm just kind of creating a
soft<00:01:15.810> curl<00:01:16.230> so<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.070> similar<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.870> your

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
soft curl so it's similar to just your

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.770 
soft curl so it's similar to just your
traditional<00:01:19.620> kind<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.400> spiral<00:01:20.880> curl<00:01:21.180> I'm

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
traditional kind of spiral curl I'm

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.290 
traditional kind of spiral curl I'm
using<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.590> bigger<00:01:22.950> thicker<00:01:23.670> barrel<00:01:23.909> just

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
using the bigger thicker barrel just

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.990 
using the bigger thicker barrel just
because<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> gives<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.320> softer<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.610> looser

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
because it gives a softer kind of looser

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
because it gives a softer kind of looser
curl<00:01:27.240> rather<00:01:27.510> than<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.110> tight<00:01:28.320> spiral

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
curl rather than a really tight spiral

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.380 
curl rather than a really tight spiral
but<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.460> totally<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.120> a<00:01:30.150> tight

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
but you can totally do it with a tight

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.440 
but you can totally do it with a tight
spiral<00:01:30.720> um<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.760> it<00:01:32.790> however

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
spiral um you really can do it however

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.510 
spiral um you really can do it however
you're<00:01:33.659> comfortable<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.890> roll<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.310> all

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you're comfortable I just roll it all

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.450 
you're comfortable I just roll it all
the<00:01:35.549> way<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> scalp<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> hold

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460

the way up to the scalp there and hold
it<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.729> place<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.450> bit<00:01:39.780> give<00:01:39.990> it

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080
