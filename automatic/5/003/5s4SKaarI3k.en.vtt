that I had some rubber cement part of

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.330 
that I had some rubber cement part of

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
the bike tire repair kits that I used to

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.610 
the bike tire repair kits that I used to
make<00:06:28.490> those<00:06:28.640> scourge<00:06:29.030> vests<00:06:29.540> I<00:06:29.720> never<00:06:30.230> use<00:06:30.440> the

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
glue for anything but I realized that if

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.630 
glue for anything but I realized that if
I<00:06:32.750> stuck<00:06:33.020> it<00:06:33.140> on<00:06:33.260> there<00:06:33.560> and<00:06:33.740> let<00:06:33.860> it<00:06:33.890> dry<00:06:34.190> it

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
I stuck it on there and let it dry it

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.880 
I stuck it on there and let it dry it
will<00:06:34.820> become<00:06:35.150> a<00:06:35.180> rubber<00:06:35.450> peg<00:06:35.960> it<00:06:36.530> will<00:06:36.680> become

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
will become a rubber peg it will become

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.710 
will become a rubber peg it will become
a<00:06:36.920> rubber<00:06:37.280> plug<00:06:37.670> that<00:06:37.940> makes<00:06:38.150> a<00:06:38.270> peg<00:06:38.510> hole

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
a rubber plug that makes a peg hole

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.380 
a rubber plug that makes a peg hole
bigger<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.380> peg<00:06:39.770> bigger<00:06:40.250> so<00:06:40.910> that<00:06:41.060> it<00:06:41.120> fits

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
bigger the peg bigger so that it fits

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.380 
bigger the peg bigger so that it fits
into<00:06:41.630> the<00:06:41.810> peg<00:06:42.140> hole<00:06:42.380> better<00:06:42.770> so<00:06:43.550> this<00:06:43.910> way<00:06:44.120> I

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
into the peg hole better so this way I

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.510 
into the peg hole better so this way I
can<00:06:44.630> put<00:06:45.080> a<00:06:45.260> freeriders<00:06:45.770> tail<00:06:45.980> set<00:06:46.220> on<00:06:46.310> a<00:06:46.340> wave

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
can put a freeriders tail set on a wave

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.059
