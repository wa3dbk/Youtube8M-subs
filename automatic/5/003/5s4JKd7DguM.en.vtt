hello<00:00:04.470> welcome<00:00:05.009> back<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.430> another<00:00:05.580> DCUO<00:00:06.210> video

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
hello welcome back to another DCUO video

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.570 
hello welcome back to another DCUO video
I<00:00:06.930> made<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.350> quick<00:00:07.589> video<00:00:07.740> earlier<00:00:08.280> today

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
I made a quick video earlier today

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.009 
I made a quick video earlier today
showing<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.179> guys<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> new<00:00:09.719> advanced

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
showing you guys the new advanced

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.540 
showing you guys the new advanced
mechanics<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.769> been<00:00:10.920> added<00:00:11.099> into<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
mechanics that have been added into the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.610 
mechanics that have been added into the
power<00:00:11.759> gadgets<00:00:12.300> des<00:00:12.840> didn't<00:00:13.080> notice<00:00:13.410> they<00:00:13.590> are

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
power gadgets des didn't notice they are

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.919 
power gadgets des didn't notice they are
at<00:00:13.980> an<00:00:14.160> advanced<00:00:14.820> mechanics<00:00:15.269> into<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.719> all

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
at an advanced mechanics into like all

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.779 
at an advanced mechanics into like all
the<00:00:16.020> old<00:00:16.199> powers<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.800> once<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.220> new<00:00:17.340> powers<00:00:17.640> come

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
the old powers so once a new powers come

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.550 
the old powers so once a new powers come
out<00:00:17.910> guys<00:00:18.210> haven't<00:00:18.539> heard<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.900> those<00:00:19.380> new

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
out guys haven't heard that those new

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.710 
out guys haven't heard that those new
powers<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.310> munitions<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.060> atomic<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
powers are a munitions and atomic and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.050 
powers are a munitions and atomic and
maybe<00:00:22.320> another<00:00:22.500> one<00:00:22.830> I've<00:00:22.980> got<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.699> coming

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
maybe another one I've got are coming

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450 
maybe another one I've got are coming
out<00:00:24.180> sometime<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.260> don't<00:00:25.500> know<00:00:25.590> about<00:00:25.740> soon<00:00:26.130> but

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
out sometime I don't know about soon but

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.730 
out sometime I don't know about soon but
they<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:27.029> coming<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> expect<00:00:28.650> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
they are coming out so I expect that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.200 
they are coming out so I expect that
they're<00:00:28.980> also<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> have<00:00:29.670> some<00:00:29.880> advanced

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
they're also going to have some advanced

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.939 
they're also going to have some advanced
mechanics<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.840> stuff<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.230> things

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
mechanics and stuff like that things

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
mechanics and stuff like that things
that<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.219> don't<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.489> about<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:33.000> excited

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that we don't know about so I'm excited

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
that we don't know about so I'm excited
about<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.870> power<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.380> even<00:00:34.829> more<00:00:35.340> excited

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
about the power and even more excited

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
about the power and even more excited
about<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:36.390> kind<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.630> advanced<00:00:36.930> mechanic<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
about what kind of advanced mechanic it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
about what kind of advanced mechanic it
might<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> has<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> healing<00:00:39.030> one

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
might have if it has like a healing one

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.700 
might have if it has like a healing one
like<00:00:39.329> Ray<00:00:39.510> chest<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> power

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
like Ray chest are like a power

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.400 
like Ray chest are like a power
conserving<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.910> has<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.410> this

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
conserving one like this has and this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.680 
conserving one like this has and this
loadout<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:45.300> hardly

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
loadout actually is going to use hardly

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
loadout actually is going to use hardly
any<00:00:45.930> power<00:00:46.200> at<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.530> even<00:00:47.100> though<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.340> use<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.670> ton

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
any power at all even though I use a ton

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
any power at all even though I use a ton
of<00:00:48.149> powers<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.739> power<00:00:50.039> hungry

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of powers it's not really power hungry

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.380 
of powers it's not really power hungry
at<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.820> you're<00:00:51.030> giving<00:00:51.300> yourself

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
at all because you're giving yourself

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
at all because you're giving yourself
back<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.020> lot<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.350> power<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> portion

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
back a lot of power it's as a portion

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.580 
back a lot of power it's as a portion
but<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.390> quite<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.199> bit<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> power

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
but it is actually quite a bit of power

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.779 
but it is actually quite a bit of power
and<00:00:55.890> you're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.370> able<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> use

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and you're going to be able to use

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
and you're going to be able to use
pretty<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.390> damage<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> guys<00:00:58.140> don't

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
pretty good damage but if you guys don't

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
pretty good damage but if you guys don't
want<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> give<00:00:59.190> yourself<00:00:59.280> power<00:00:59.699> back<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.149> all

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
want to give yourself power back at all

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
want to give yourself power back at all
and<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.480> guys<00:01:00.600> are<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.230> heist<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and you guys are in like heist up or you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
and you guys are in like heist up or you
don't<00:01:02.640> need<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.809> power<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.379> can

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
don't need of the power back you can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.899 
don't need of the power back you can
always<00:01:04.710> switch<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> first<00:01:05.280> power<00:01:05.430> battle

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
always switch the first power battle

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.270 
always switch the first power battle
awareness<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.770> switch<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> with

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
awareness and you can switch that with

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370 
awareness and you can switch that with
the<00:01:08.340> supercharged<00:01:08.790> our<00:01:08.970> robot<00:01:09.270> sidekick<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the supercharged our robot sidekick to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.219 
the supercharged our robot sidekick to
get<00:01:10.560> extra<00:01:10.920> damage<00:01:11.130> from<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:13.020> don't

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
get extra damage from that and you don't

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.929 
get extra damage from that and you don't
have<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.530> use<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> thing<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.400> conserves

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
have to use the thing that conserves

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.030 
have to use the thing that conserves
power<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.299> lot<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.470> cool<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.770> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
power a lot but it is pretty cool and I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.380 
power a lot but it is pretty cool and I
thought<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.250> would<00:01:17.400> show<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.270> know

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
thought I would show it because you know

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.450 
thought I would show it because you know
it's<00:01:18.630> new<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.020> I'll<00:01:19.619> show<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> advanced

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it's new and I'll show all the advanced

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
it's new and I'll show all the advanced
mechanics<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.900> pretty<00:01:22.110> much

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
mechanics in this this is pretty much

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
mechanics in this this is pretty much
the<00:01:22.320> perfect<00:01:22.740> rotation<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.850> use<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.210> in

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the perfect rotation to use because in

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.210 
the perfect rotation to use because in
order<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:25.200> 5th<00:01:25.439> power<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:25.890> I'll<00:01:26.040> go

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
order for your 5th power which I'll go

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.590 
order for your 5th power which I'll go
into<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.520> loadout<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.030> actually<00:01:27.270> talk<00:01:27.420> about

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
into my loadout and actually talk about

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.480 
into my loadout and actually talk about
it<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.700> into<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:29.939> traits<00:01:30.210> under<00:01:31.020> powers

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
it if I go into my traits under powers

the tricks tree you're only going to

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.380 
the tricks tree you're only going to
want<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.550> only<00:02:13.640> reason<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.120> want<00:02:14.150> the

want to and the only reason you want the
first<00:02:14.569> one<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.810> because<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.380> need<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.620> get

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
first one is because you need to get

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.290 
first one is because you need to get
intimidation<00:02:16.160> down<00:02:16.459> here<00:02:16.670> which<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> buff

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
intimidation down here which is a buff

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.199 
intimidation down here which is a buff
and<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.720> can<00:02:17.900> cancel<00:02:18.349> out<00:02:18.700> some<00:02:19.700> attacks<00:02:20.000> not

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
and it can cancel out some attacks not

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.820 
and it can cancel out some attacks not
for<00:02:20.390> your<00:02:20.510> gas<00:02:20.630> but<00:02:20.959> some<00:02:21.319> of<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.470> other<00:02:21.590> ones

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
for your gas but some of the other ones

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.729 
for your gas but some of the other ones
so<00:02:22.459> anyway<00:02:22.910> iconix<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.989> five<00:02:24.200> left<00:02:24.440> over<00:02:24.709> I

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
so anyway iconix have five left over I

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.850 
so anyway iconix have five left over I

you'll see that

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.969 
you'll see that
it's<00:04:22.789> um<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.360> lot<00:04:23.990> harder<00:04:24.289> than<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.560> regularly

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
it's um a lot harder than it regularly

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.089 
it's um a lot harder than it regularly
would<00:04:25.250> so<00:04:25.789> here's<00:04:26.000> paralytic<00:04:26.539> art<00:04:26.949> it's<00:04:27.949> an

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
would so here's paralytic art it's an

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.760 
would so here's paralytic art it's an
AoE<00:04:28.340> now<00:04:28.610> too<00:04:28.669> but<00:04:29.060> anyway<00:04:29.960> i'll<00:04:30.229> use<00:04:30.500> that

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
AoE now too but anyway i'll use that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.649 
AoE now too but anyway i'll use that
after<00:04:31.159> using<00:04:31.340> t<00:04:31.759> three<00:04:32.000> important<00:04:32.419> you'll<00:04:32.539> see

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
after using t three important you'll see

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.600 
after using t three important you'll see
how<00:04:32.780> much<00:04:32.930> stronger<00:04:33.319> hit<00:04:33.530> so<00:04:34.159> i'll<00:04:34.340> have<00:04:34.460> to
