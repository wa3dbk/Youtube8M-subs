00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 good evening I introduce myself my name is 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.750
 matías mier I'm not a bartender here 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.540
 ricotti kibar for those who do not know him 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.690
 rico tiki bar is a bar surfer or bar 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.269
 a tiki bar located in the middle of the sea 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.539
 the Silver Propel no more than the coast 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.509
 from sea 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.890
 when they asked me to prepare a cocktail 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.140
 make a cocktail of your own a cocktail of 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.239
 author the truth is that the cocktails of 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.239
 author that I will get to prepare or what 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.949
 could elaborate were not the most 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.680
 representative nor the most tiki wanted 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.230
 really do something that ends 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.290
 close the history of this place and it is the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.500
 mytouch that for me is the letter of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.649
 presentation of the tiki cocktail bar is a 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.760
 cocktail that is absolutely mystical 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.829
 absolutely complex and yet 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.759
 when it reaches the mouth it arrives in a single 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.229
 flavor so I wanted to be a my time that 

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:55.239
 has all these ingredients of the 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.059
 which I am speaking and until the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.070
 glassware ends up enclosing this 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:06.659
 beautiful history of sea ​​and cocktail 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.960
 to start obviously if we talk about 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.200
 sea 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.770
 we talk about pirates rock is 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770
 principal ingredient 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.310
 so let's use a mixture of 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.030
 ron is a rum rum a rum gold and 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.030
 then we will finish it 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.020
 with a special rum 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.570
 this spiced rum that we have for 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.329
 of course it is home cooking has 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.740
 Three peppers pepper pepper 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.030
 Jamaica green pepper and red pepper 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.030
 which is macerated 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.310
 a week or so 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.840
 when the bartenders of the place 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.310
 they agree to take them out and sometimes can not 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.560
 get to be a month until you can 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.040
 get to sell as an annex with the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.040
 seniority with three years rum is lime 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.380
 but more than the five arts 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.110
 if I told you if it was not even a poster comes 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.110
 all right 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.310
 lime juice 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.400
 and we reserve the lime 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.020
 when I prepare a cocktail and I have to 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.680
 go narrating and I do it in the plural 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.680
 I feel very useful 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.469
 because in plural if the days being me 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.760
 alone and if I'm going to do it alone 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:44.409
 with three rum is lime juice 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.680
 by seth by seat is a syrup 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:52.069
 absolutely complex but his summary 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.720
 it's almonds almonds sugar blonde juice 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.430
 of Lima also has 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.159
 a little citrus 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.900
 but what ends up giving it that 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.200
 complexity is almond to the taste 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.200
 cocktail 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.810
 almíbar rock and easy group is 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:15.350
 basically one syrup two parts in one 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.150
 on the part of sugar for one of water 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.880
 the fact that it is prepared in the place 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.530
 the uncut cocktail with the music of 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.110
 background and with customers who spend well 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.090
 that the people that are arriving please 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.290
 accommodates you arrived just to take a 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.430
 mate 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.430
 justito is spent 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.020
 It seems that I had prepared 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.799
 mar del plata coastal and cold city is 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.800
 this tiqui 115 in Finland because 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.930
 you will not see it in mar del plata 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.800
 3 rum is lime juice syrup 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.800
 triple sec 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.040
 bolt of course 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.020
 lin 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.730
 What is it 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.870
 and we are going to add this is not in the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.780
 original recipe but how we talked 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.300
 just as I told him mathematics he says 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.709
 get ready a constituted the truth I think 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.989
 that no matter how much you make a classic cocktail 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.250
 they are all yours because you are always going to 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.870
 make a small version you're going to 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.550
 change some ingredients and 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.540
 we in this case we add a 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.540
 little bit of orange juice 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.280
 the fact that the bottles have 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.750
 paid labels because we are 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.420
 pluralists and there are flare bartenders in 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.230
 this bar but we love all of us 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.230
 almost a Peronist bar 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.340
 no more ice 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.340
 and beat 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:11.199
 ceramic cup obviously 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:11.199
 Mar del Plata elaboration 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.580
 bringing 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.879
 to collation the image of 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.040
 of old Hawaiian totems of the gods 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.690
 protectors of the islands 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.440
 here is not an island but it is a great 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.870
 city ​​we also need protectors 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.870
 so we evoke them in his figure 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.820
 and as decoration 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.840
 the lime stocking 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.840
 what we had booked 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.930
 we're going to make them jackets because 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.930
 you are there can be and marten 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.640
 in closing the gold brooch 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:20.700
 and a siphon of his hand a star nor 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.700
 to perfume 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.879
 keep doing it we carry 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.630
 rom proof a rum raised in alcohol in 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.630
 alcohol content 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.729
 and the magic touch to learn the 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.729
 games 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.800
 I told you it was 12 cuts they came well 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.969
 and to make it more marplatense 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.020
 we evoked 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.039
 the figure 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.190
 of our fishing boats behind a 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.190
 anchor 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.330
 so this is the fun rich maita 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.310
