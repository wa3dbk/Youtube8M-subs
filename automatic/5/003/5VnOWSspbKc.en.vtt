 back on my videos there is still 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.719
 quite the heg view comments 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.260
 back on twitter back on 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.780
 skype on xbox messages all that stuff 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 does serious serious pleasure right now and 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.350
 so that motivates me a bit more that's 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 true even if had beautiful I always do 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.870
 but usual video at a weekly 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.399
 even two finally it obviously depends on 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.049
 caen i can when i can not my envy 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.369
 all that I can not force myself as I 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.200
 says to make videos and in addition I like 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.119
 not making bets is long 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.310
 short so suddenly there as I saw 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.659
 is almost four son subscribed there on 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.400
 the chain quite silly 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.619
 in a very short time one it is true that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.970
 since shame hbf 4/5 market well suddenly 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.250
 this is true that I have not won 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.509
 badly of subscribers what since so the case 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.820
 since the good and there he comes but 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.320
 really very quickly so I'm going 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.030
 tell you the videos I'm going out 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.200
 for catskill tackle even though I 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.490
 think it will not be exactly to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.950
 4000 subscribers because it takes time 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.850
 do this kind of videos so already I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.960
 will tell you the videos I'm going to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.490
 do you go give me a little your 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.619
 notice because nice weather are I think it 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.009
 to do please I think the idea is 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.659
 good so first video already make a 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.939
 small editing for the 4th subscriber so 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.100
 a montage with clippers ffa en 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.390
 domination I think I'll see the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
 clips that I selected there are some 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.780
 full full full you guys 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.920
 never seen because I've been playing since 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.440
 June finally I believe and I played before 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.750
 a black ops from september to june 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.440
 played so much domination as 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.690
 today now we can say 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.940
 like that in quotation marks and I had 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.680
 full clip so suddenly his clips there 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.260
 with call of duty clips that made 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.730
 to see me in full of old call of 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
 think I do not know at all but I believe 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.680
 that there is still a lot of the old 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.700
 call of 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.940
 I'm going to do a little editing 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.489
 special 4000 subscribers and then so 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.470
 second video it's going to be another 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.720
 montage but this particular time 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.220
 this triple mount 2 so what is this 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.000
 it's a triple montage so it's 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.350
 just a bullet three dead what in 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.070
 big in the assembly of lyon has that this 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.280
 kind of two clips here that tripe 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.420
 to a ball so that's it she'll have very 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.670
 soon will stop second 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.810
 I had already released a so if I think about it 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.310
 I would put the description to you 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.230
 but watch out he's on my channel for 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.700
 see how it looks like it will not have a 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.100
 Thirty I think in there was 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 thirty old ones my heart is going 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.470
 redo the wheel turns quickly 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.940
 on the gameplay so there powers dear 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.850
 27 so I'm 27 years old I'm going to kill 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.019
 I know more discounts so here and this to 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.410
 from there that it really takes 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.620
 understand how I could hear clip 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.180
 from whom forgiveness is good clip end 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.470
 great I want to talk about the gameplay but 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.269
 apparently I'm just dying so 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.170
 I am a hail 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.700
 after that, I have a little more 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.400
 mouth on the ffa blackhawks 2 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.299
 helmets gloves it's also about this game and 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.010
 this game mode what will I talk about after 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.180
 then the loose way 1.9 direct objects 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.500
 which tea party so I took you off the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.140
 passage where I join you can 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.250
 check if the same opponents all 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.410
 pretty short it's the same time that's not it 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.720
 trafficotage or whatever so here and so 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.980
 after I will start doing again in 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.730
 what it is you will see how much that 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.489
 in total 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.430
 and if I win or not my general 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.510
 then the last video of the 4000 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.209
 subscribers because jean do three like 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.260
 I said it's going to be a faq so what 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.100
 what is a faq for those who 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.549
 do not know I think you 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.560
 know 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.359
 it's a fair in question actually and 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.799
 so on this time in question I'm 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.049
 movie would have simply by responding 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.680
 to your questions in fact so that can 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.090
 concern my privacy a little 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.209
 it's a certain limit obviously I 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.280
 want to say that's it depends we can talk 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.500
 my hobbies you can ask me 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.000
 but there will be some 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.620
 limits anyway a little normal when 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.210
 even I have not displayed either so is 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.100
 we're not going to go for what we're not going 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.729
 resume from call of duty the future of 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.590
 our game I'm no jean music 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.300
 know of everything we can ask you 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.520
 questions so if I think about it too you 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.570
 aurelien to the description on to sk so 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.639
 the age about a hundred 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.840
 questions I had asked on twitter and 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.880
 after i these schedule reductions 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.930
 and I will respond directly to the video where 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.070
 you can post it in 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.120
 comments but really if you 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.849
 do not want to worship go on a 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.500
 other site or what's it so I think 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.090
 do it frankly that knowingly 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.880
 what like faq i had never done i 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.560
 think it can be interesting cairo 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.870
 so suddenly I talked a bit about my 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.030
 little shot of the ffa black ops 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.770
 2 so what did you notice 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.930
 a gameplay you notice not a trick m 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.750
 since just now that's pretty 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.039
 open and that really pissing then 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.740
 just look there all the 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.940
 guy I kill it's snipers good he 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.190
 there are still some treat me or what 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.520
 and again I 'm not sure but that 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.159
 snipers I mean I did go I 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.349
 went back to the evening showcase that 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.060
 snipers lobby guys y'a that's it 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.440
 shit is about to turn that 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.550
 waiting for you pawn who leaves his editing of 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.070
 faces there are always the same 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.419
 players and after he says to my guys 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.440
 mountains the facts fat world ya bien 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.840
 played well that his pals that says well 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.990
 played because obviously the guy at 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.610
 play with his pals what alas I have 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.520
 the impression that it's the same guys 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.979
 what snipers I hate that and 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.300
 a lot hate that I talk about it a lot 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.610
 on twitter when I have people on 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.460
 skype and where is it bearable 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.919
 snipers tana 2,3 big maximum in a 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.900
 part it's enough you do not need ten 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.770
 a thousand in the amap it's okay it's really 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.990
 what in the end 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.759
 after you are passed for the collard 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.540
 good it's okay I did not do it 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.430
 think again because there 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.220
 I would still open but I see 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.290
 that there are certain points it's not so 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.340
 good brief there are some who are 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.030
 criticized because they're making the move 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.930
 sniper lobby apparently but good after 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.940
 I do not know if it's true or not 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.350
 maybe yes but it is certain 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.240
 it's serious burnt he plays all the time 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.070
 with their friends and where the ffa black ops 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.960
 of the guys it's not that it's done 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.190
 the ffa at the same time all the evils 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.590
 while short you not playing against them you're 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.690
 what are you not going to do I think that 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.670
 stupid and it does not make me want 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.500
 really to give me back to the fsa black 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.210
 ops of like asking a lot after 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.520
 I 'll talk about maybe the faq if I have 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.290
 a question about that but that's it 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.930
 my feeling what I mean so that 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.730
 snipers cimer what I prefer to have 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.080
 pumps that rock that personally 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.630
 I do not mind what 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.830
 it's a good so there look we 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.110
 go back to the gameplay I did a little 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.630
 blow of mouth chauvet 9 last 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.790
 hervé 9 the loop him of self he was of 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.980
 back son of a bitch and I say it goal me 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.750
 so here I start to stress in good 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.700
 fucking fast and you then both 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.710
 in a row it's all my cat 58 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.180
 that he is a secular marker and they're me 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.090
 kill for the clickable it was the guy 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.460
