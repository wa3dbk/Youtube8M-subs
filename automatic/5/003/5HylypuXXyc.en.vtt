00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.330
 the side we go to another bica lopes region 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.330
 first of all I have no excuse 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.039
 worse than today 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.189
 terrified 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:12.949
 the fish is configured 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.179
 these two 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.179
 go to the beach with a lot less 500 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.869
 many centuries ago 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.990
 in this local work line 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.439
 more sensitive than for yourself 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.439
 china to even work 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.810
 the inter 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.650
 see here we here 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.650
 text document 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.130
 passed the one of toronto because they had access 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.520
 put a take on i know 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.560
 took quite delicate 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.290
 tragedy in haiti 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 in the complementary stage né 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.190
 conquered on Wednesday night 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.880
 who's there gianecchini says 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.490
 It is not there 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.260
 before the law 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 so it's for me 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.130
 required 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 who and where the camps 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 after installing the folder 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.500
 apr 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 for that 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.430
 have an app more than we do them 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.040
 artists 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.280
 sedated 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.280
 fiction tutorials 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.980
 I doubt anyone feels easier except 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.980
 when there is an application the party note 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.070
 this is my biggest 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.410
 and this is less 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.410
 to explain I will speak to the nation configurable 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 without setting up with me 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.710
 Firstly 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.520
 the first option 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.950
 kiki configure 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.490
 I think it's news for 600 six hundred and financial 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.869
 cheese video card 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.429
 I do not have but this is the kissing feeling 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.599
 you are 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.030
 you're putting what makes one of the options I do not have 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.329
 marquinhos 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.569
 pierre-jean only option 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.799
 tinton 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.729
 since they are Luis 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:27.859
 worse than him 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.919
 with a wardrobe 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.919
 all controlled the world 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:36.609
 according to the pressure 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.839
 eight to configure 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.529
 set the buttons 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.009
 that you want and if you want to copy were people - each other 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.089
 the event that is a lawsuit a toothpick region 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.430
 he does not put number 3 aspects 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.479
 I think I'm going to put my feet up. 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.559
 extinguish 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.199
 and the courses that have held the position 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.569
 I've been with 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 Nothing like ok 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.429
 here too 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:14.649
 let's go here 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.659
 This very common baby 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.479
 but that the first option 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.670
 to set up 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.579
 fortunately the risk 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.309
 Cio discovers his 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:26.669
 play station 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.699
 Leader units 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.999
 I ticked the receiver and the only option is to present what I would configure 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.529
 sound 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.919
 if at the time the third option 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.239
 to set up 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.029
 marcus camby option 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:45.749
 controller 2 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.399
 still this year in this team craft 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:49.510
 but I do not know anymore 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.739
 pressure marked 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.409
 with the end of the time 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:55.919
 it's all really 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.779
 initially usgs 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:03:59.829
 19 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.080
 already marking a single one are in the activity 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.769
 painted in cultural 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.769
 who also did not have coverage 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.999
 meanwhile all 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.939
 fabinho replaced michael 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.159
 if the next option 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.559
 I know that the United States will never 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.909
 if everything is ready for you 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.319
 already without the incarnated defense nothing 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.360
 I have to stay 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.530
 here is efe 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.939
 electronic pigeons 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.189
 click the folder 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.189
 to injure luccas 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.919
 I gave it here 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.690
 set and victory 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.129
 Do not make them 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.819
 something that can 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.199
 reference in the folder clicks area 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.240
 other leaders worse than him 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.539
 in thesis they your dvd 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:49.560
 picchi 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.289
 to run cd / dvd 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.289
 borini run 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.349
 kingsley 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.559
 the union wants to be 100% difficult 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.710
 only with 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.259
 I believe this is a political fight 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.370
 but in prison some do not know the grass outside 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.080
 léo kanú recommended and the home 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.550
 I like soccer 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.779
 I hope you have enjoyed it a lot worse than today. 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:19.689
 this too 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.689
 I accessed the multimedia production blog 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:27.589
 come to you 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.259
 if the union 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.879
 so by the typewriter 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.319
 I hope they access blogs 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.349
 in doubt is if you have a gun in your hand 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:53.460
 after posting 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.550
 can make experts to more stringent 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.080
 6 very well on the field without its name new content triple much colder than 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.669
 exchange fairly 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:04.850
 still be 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.069
