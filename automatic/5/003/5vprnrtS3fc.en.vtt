our<00:02:20.510> neck<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.989> think<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.799> this<00:02:21.950> World<00:02:22.130> Cup<00:02:22.250> is

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
our neck I think that this World Cup is

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.160 
our neck I think that this World Cup is
going<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.819> be<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.420> know<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.540> breakthrough<00:02:23.930> for

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
going to be you know a breakthrough for

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.050 
going to be you know a breakthrough for
women's<00:02:24.650> soccer<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.250> think<00:02:25.760> it's<00:02:25.850> probably

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
women's soccer I think it's probably

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.120 
women's soccer I think it's probably
going<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.420> be<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.569> World<00:02:26.810> Cup<00:02:27.049> that's<00:02:27.319> almost<00:02:27.950> as

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
going to be a World Cup that's almost as

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.340 
going to be a World Cup that's almost as
close<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.610> Men's<00:02:28.850> World<00:02:29.000> Cup<00:02:29.180> as<00:02:29.540> we've<00:02:30.140> ever

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
close to a Men's World Cup as we've ever

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.650 
close to a Men's World Cup as we've ever
had<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> think<00:02:31.090> Germany<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.120> going<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.360> put<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.630> a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
had I think Germany is going to put on a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.660 
had I think Germany is going to put on a
show<00:02:33.049> they're<00:02:33.650> gonna<00:02:33.709> pack<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.190> stadiums

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
show they're gonna pack the stadiums

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.000 
show they're gonna pack the stadiums
soccer<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:35.900> respected<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.500> their<00:02:36.650> nation

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
soccer is so respected in their nation

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.039 
soccer is so respected in their nation
they<00:02:37.850> just<00:02:38.000> want<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.180> say<00:02:38.239> good<00:02:38.450> soccer<00:02:38.720> they

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
they just want to say good soccer they

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.140 
they just want to say good soccer they
don't<00:02:39.230> care<00:02:39.410> if<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.769> men's<00:02:40.579> game<00:02:40.880> or<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
don't care if it's men's game or the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.849 
don't care if it's men's game or the
women's<00:02:41.420> game<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.440> think<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.739> that's

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
women's game and I think that that's

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.920 
women's game and I think that that's
what<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.250> summer<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.519> gonna<00:02:43.609> bring
