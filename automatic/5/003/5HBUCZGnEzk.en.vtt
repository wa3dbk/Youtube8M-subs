mods<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.240> had<00:03:01.510> have<00:03:01.780> at<00:03:01.960> your<00:03:02.080> disposal

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
mods that you had have at your disposal

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.070 
mods that you had have at your disposal
there's<00:03:03.400> something<00:03:03.760> called<00:03:03.970> one<00:03:04.420> more<00:03:04.720> slot

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
there's something called one more slot

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.340 
there's something called one more slot
package<00:03:05.710> and<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.750> would<00:03:08.500> allow<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:10.350> see

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
package and that would allow you to see

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.430 
package and that would allow you to see
what<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:11.980> does<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.970> would<00:03:13.300> allow<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.600> say

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
what it does that would allow you say

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.440 
what it does that would allow you say
you<00:03:14.500> had<00:03:14.830> like<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.310> fence<00:03:15.670> or<00:03:15.880> something<00:03:16.120> and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
you had like a fence or something and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.600 
you had like a fence or something and
you<00:03:16.510> want<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.840> put<00:03:16.990> like<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.140> pot<00:03:17.500> there<00:03:17.800> you

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
you want to put like a pot there you

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.630 
you want to put like a pot there you
will<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:18.880> put<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.330> up<00:03:19.630> there<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:21.430> pot

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
will just put this up there and the pot

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.980 
will just put this up there and the pot
would<00:03:21.820> just<00:03:21.970> be<00:03:22.060> right<00:03:22.270> there<00:03:22.570> but<00:03:22.810> when<00:03:22.930> you

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
would just be right there but when you

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.080 
would just be right there but when you
go<00:03:23.110> into<00:03:23.230> live<00:03:23.530> mode<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.310> thing<00:03:24.490> disappears

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
go into live mode the thing disappears

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.410 
go into live mode the thing disappears
so<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.480> doesn't<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.990> doesn't<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.180> doesn't

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
so it doesn't it doesn't so it doesn't

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.870 
so it doesn't it doesn't so it doesn't
have<00:03:28.510> any<00:03:28.660> problems<00:03:29.050> for<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.490> but<00:03:30.490> there's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
have any problems for you but there's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.300 
have any problems for you but there's
something<00:03:31.540> else<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:31.990> kind<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.590> gives<00:03:33.220> you

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
something else that kind of gives you

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.600 
something else that kind of gives you
some<00:03:33.340> hilarious<00:03:34.150> hilarious<00:03:34.840> some<00:03:35.610> results

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
some hilarious hilarious some results

some hilarious hilarious some results
like<00:03:36.820> this<00:03:37.060> resizer<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:39.220> can<00:03:39.370> make<00:03:39.550> sims<00:03:39.850> look

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
like this resizer you can make sims look

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.540 
like this resizer you can make sims look
small<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.780> make<00:03:40.810> some<00:03:41.110> huge<00:03:41.710> or<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.430> can

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
small you can make some huge or you can

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.010 
small you can make some huge or you can
make<00:03:42.670> objects<00:03:43.120> same<00:03:43.510> way<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:44.760> imagine<00:03:45.760> this

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
make objects same way to imagine this

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:55.700 
make objects same way to imagine this
having<00:03:47.020> a<00:03:47.880> sim<00:03:48.880> poke<00:03:49.420> around<00:03:51.390> at<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.690> giant<00:03:53.110> sim

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.410 

and<00:03:56.710> then<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:56.950> giant<00:03:57.370> sim<00:03:57.550> just<00:03:57.730> apparently

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
and then that giant sim just apparently

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.550 
and then that giant sim just apparently
like<00:03:58.570> steps<00:03:58.990> on

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.340 

without<00:04:04.560> even<00:04:04.710> realizing<00:04:04.830> it

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.910 

okay<00:04:09.350> so<00:04:10.220> let's<00:04:10.580> say<00:04:10.790> 25<00:04:11.420> percent<00:04:11.680> but<00:04:12.680> the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
okay so let's say 25 percent but the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:24.680 
okay so let's say 25 percent but the
smalls<00:04:13.250> will<00:04:13.490> get

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.560 

can<00:04:25.260> we<00:04:25.320> move<00:04:25.440> now

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
can we move now

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.630 
can we move now
so<00:04:28.170> for<00:04:28.350> example<00:04:28.490> we'll<00:04:29.490> take<00:04:29.760> our<00:04:30.200> sim<00:04:31.200> here

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
so for example we'll take our sim here

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.580 
so for example we'll take our sim here
we're<00:04:32.640> gonna<00:04:32.760> use<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> cheat<00:04:33.690> here<00:04:36.470> we're<00:04:37.470> gonna

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
we're gonna use a cheat here we're gonna

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.920 
we're gonna use a cheat here we're gonna
take<00:04:37.830> our<00:04:37.980> sim

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.650 

put<00:04:42.470> him<00:04:42.620> right<00:04:42.650> on<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.550> spot<00:04:44.800> look<00:04:45.800> at<00:04:45.920> that

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
put him right on the spot look at that

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.040 
put him right on the spot look at that
he's<00:04:47.660> only<00:04:47.840> 1/4<00:04:48.170> his<00:04:48.410> own<00:04:48.560> size<00:04:49.570> now<00:04:50.570> we<00:04:50.630> take

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
he's only 1/4 his own size now we take

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.670 
he's only 1/4 his own size now we take
this<00:04:51.560> we<00:04:52.490> put<00:04:52.910> it<00:04:53.030> right<00:04:53.180> down<00:04:53.240> there<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.020> what

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
this we put it right down there and what

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.150 
this we put it right down there and what
do<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.830> know<00:04:55.010> a<00:04:55.190> little<00:04:55.550> smaller<00:04:57.010> to<00:04:58.010> be

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
do you know a little smaller to be

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.080 
do you know a little smaller to be
honest<00:04:58.460> is<00:04:58.580> much<00:04:58.730> easier<00:04:59.150> for<00:04:59.210> him<00:04:59.570> if<00:04:59.630> he<00:05:01.090> if

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
honest is much easier for him if he if

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.250 
honest is much easier for him if he if
he's<00:05:02.540> like<00:05:02.690> off<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.140> scale

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
he's like off the scale

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.630 
he's like off the scale
but<00:05:06.260> anyway<00:05:06.620> so<00:05:06.890> basically<00:05:07.040> that's<00:05:07.490> the

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
but anyway so basically that's the

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.670 
but anyway so basically that's the
concept<00:05:08.060> for<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:08.450> just<00:05:08.660> put<00:05:08.900> an<00:05:08.990> object<00:05:09.230> or<00:05:09.620> a

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
concept for you just put an object or a

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.340 
concept for you just put an object or a
sim<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:11.360> right<00:05:11.600> on<00:05:11.720> like<00:05:11.990> right<00:05:12.140> on<00:05:12.200> the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
sim like right on like right on the

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.760 
sim like right on like right on the
right<00:05:13.040> on<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.600> round<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.720> square<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.260> it

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
right on the round the square and it

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.390 
right on the round the square and it
instantly<00:05:16.160> changes<00:05:16.700> size

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.100 

let's<00:05:22.000> use<00:05:22.120> another<00:05:22.150> let's<00:05:22.750> use<00:05:22.870> another

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
let's use another let's use another

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.840 
let's use another let's use another
scale<00:05:23.970> holy<00:05:25.600> that's<00:05:25.780> huge

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
scale holy that's huge
