00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.160 
that the attack and at this year's
marathon<00:05:07.060> Americans<00:05:08.060> cheered<00:05:08.600> all<00:05:08.900> the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
marathon Americans cheered all the

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.100 
marathon Americans cheered all the
harder<00:05:09.500> when<00:05:10.280> he<00:05:10.430> once<00:05:10.640> again<00:05:10.970> across<00:05:11.840> the

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
harder when he once again across the

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.540 
harder when he once again across the
finish<00:05:12.260> line<00:05:12.380> first<00:05:12.800> with<00:05:13.070> an<00:05:13.160> even<00:05:13.370> faster

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
finish line first with an even faster

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.970 
finish line first with an even faster
time

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.400 

that<00:05:20.430> I<00:05:20.460> think<00:05:20.580> is<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.450> hallmark<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:22.290> the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
that I think is a hallmark of the

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.510 
that I think is a hallmark of the
American<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.540> Ethiopian<00:05:24.540> bond<00:05:25.340> we<00:05:26.340> don't

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
American and Ethiopian bond we don't

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.550 
American and Ethiopian bond we don't
give<00:05:26.970> in<00:05:27.180> or<00:05:27.360> give<00:05:27.390> up<00:05:27.720> when<00:05:27.870> things<00:05:27.930> get<00:05:28.290> hard

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
give in or give up when things get hard

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.860 
give in or give up when things get hard
but<00:05:28.890> we<00:05:29.040> come<00:05:29.250> back<00:05:29.400> better<00:05:29.670> and<00:05:29.970> we<00:05:30.540> come<00:05:30.720> back

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
but we come back better and we come back

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.950 
but we come back better and we come back
stronger<00:05:31.380> so<00:05:31.800> there's<00:05:32.070> no<00:05:32.220> doubt<00:05:32.430> that

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
stronger so there's no doubt that

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.870 
stronger so there's no doubt that
Ethiopians<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:34.020> Americans<00:05:34.530> are<00:05:34.770> sprung<00:05:35.640> from

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
Ethiopians and Americans are sprung from

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.490 
Ethiopians and Americans are sprung from
the<00:05:35.970> same<00:05:36.270> root<00:05:36.480> of<00:05:36.570> life<00:05:36.750> we<00:05:37.200> have<00:05:37.320> evidence
