made a new world and I basically remade

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.590 
made a new world and I basically remade
everything<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.320> had<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
everything I had so this is the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200 
everything I had so this is the
flowchart<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:44.059> in<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
flowchart as it is right now in the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
flowchart as it is right now in the
middle<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.539> our<00:00:45.690> factory<00:00:46.520> there's<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
middle we have our factory there's the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
middle we have our factory there's the
tree<00:00:47.879> farm<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.690> wheat<00:00:48.870> farm<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> fence

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
tree farm the wheat farm with a fence

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.580 
tree farm the wheat farm with a fence
because<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.789> had<00:00:51.059> pigs<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> crops

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
because I had pigs going on the crops

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.470 
because I had pigs going on the crops
and<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:54.260> voice<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.410> our<00:00:55.500> system<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.420> i'll<00:00:57.420> just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and the voice in our system so i'll just

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.670 
and the voice in our system so i'll just
show<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.050> around<00:00:58.230> show<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> did<00:01:00.680> I'm

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
show you around show you what I did I'm

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.920 
show you around show you what I did I'm
gonna<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.640> give<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.120> episode<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> number

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
gonna not give this episode a number

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.440 
gonna not give this episode a number
because<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.350> kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.189> between

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
because it's kind of like in between

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.560 
because it's kind of like in between
since<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.600> changed<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.200> stings<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
since I changed up stings so I think the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.000 
since I changed up stings so I think the
best<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.710> from

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
best way to go in here would be from

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.630 
best way to go in here would be from
here<00:01:11.610> did<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.299> break<00:01:12.360> something<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.610> don't<00:01:14.610> think

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
here did I break something I don't think

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.310 
here did I break something I don't think
I<00:01:14.790> broke<00:01:14.939> anything<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.869> moistener

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

i did here is I have an ender chest

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.990 
i did here is I have an ender chest
extractor<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> item<00:01:53.130> sink<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> items<00:01:53.850> in

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
passive supplier for the seeds going

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.069 
passive supplier for the seeds going
into<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> top<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> passive

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.609 
supplier for wheat going in the side and
extractor<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.840> all

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
extractor so that will do all that all

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.600 
extractor so that will do all that all
in<00:02:10.920> case<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.310> stone

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
in case in stone

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.230 
in case in stone
and<00:02:12.730> there<00:02:13.210> is<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> water<00:02:13.930> pipe<00:02:17.700> going<00:02:18.700> into<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000 
can see water pipe going in right there
so<00:02:27.700> while<00:02:28.540> i<00:02:28.570> was<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.290> know<00:02:29.320> making<00:02:29.650> all<00:02:29.890> this

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
so while i was you know making all this

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.400 
so while i was you know making all this
it<00:02:30.220> rained<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.670> lot<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.390> didn't<00:02:32.020> have<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.260> turn

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
it rained a lot I didn't have to turn

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.960 
it rained a lot I didn't have to turn
that<00:02:32.500> thing<00:02:32.650> on<00:02:32.770> once<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.670> filled<00:02:33.880> up

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
that thing on once that just filled up

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.480 
that thing on once that just filled up
because<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.300> rained<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.630> lot<00:02:34.750> naturally<00:02:35.490> so

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
because it rained a lot naturally so

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.860 
because it rained a lot naturally so

hummus<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.430> know<00:02:51.580> one<00:02:52.510> person<00:02:52.870> commented

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
hummus you know one person commented

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.710 
hummus you know one person commented
that<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.680> had<00:02:53.980> set<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.190> crafting<00:02:54.640> pipe<00:02:54.880> 28

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
that I had set the crafting pipe 28

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.940 
that I had set the crafting pipe 28
hummus<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.380> was<00:02:56.500> going<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.650> be<00:02:56.709> an<00:02:56.830> issue

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
hummus and that was going to be an issue

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.949 
hummus and that was going to be an issue
but<00:02:57.250> as<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.820> can<00:02:57.910> see<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.209> carpenter<00:02:58.600> does

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
but as you can see the carpenter does

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.750 
but as you can see the carpenter does
actually<00:02:59.200> output<00:02:59.739> nine<00:02:59.920> hummus<00:03:00.340> when<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:00.670> use

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
actually output nine hummus when you use

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.390 
actually output nine hummus when you use
this<00:03:01.000> one<00:03:01.239> versus<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:02.340> crafting<00:03:03.340> table

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
this one versus the crafting table

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.550 
this one versus the crafting table
recipe<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.280> know<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.459> crafting<00:03:06.790> pipes

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
recipe so you know the crafting pipes

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.699 
recipe so you know the crafting pipes
goes<00:03:08.560> over<00:03:08.770> here<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.140> pulls<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.440> mulch

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
goes over here and it pulls the mulch

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.210 
goes over here and it pulls the mulch
out<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:12.250> ender<00:03:12.550> chest<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.620> the

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
out of this ender chest and this is the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.800 
out of this ender chest and this is the
default<00:03:15.580> route<00:03:15.820> right<00:03:16.060> now<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:19.180> probably

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
default route right now so I probably

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.750 
default route right now so I probably
need<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.140> do<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:23.160> make<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:27.280> item

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
need to do is make it so that this item

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:39.530 
need to do is make it so that this item
sink<00:03:28.269> also<00:03:28.870> wats<00:03:29.940> seeds<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:34.180> I'll<00:03:34.510> get<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.750> seat

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.089 

I'll<00:03:40.349> gonna<00:03:40.500> see<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.579> way<00:03:42.709> I'll<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.950> get

I'll gonna see this way I'll just get
out<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> creative<00:03:45.000> because<00:03:45.599> that<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:45.930> makes

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
out of creative because that just makes

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.970 
out of creative because that just makes
everything<00:03:46.469> so<00:03:46.890> much<00:03:46.950> easier<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:48.560> then<00:03:49.560> what
