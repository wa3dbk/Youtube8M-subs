custom<00:01:37.619> job<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.880> float<00:01:39.180> until<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
custom job like you just float until you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.999 
custom job like you just float until you
accelerate<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.500> something<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009

perfectly<00:01:44.070> flat<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.670> when<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> hit<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> ground

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
perfectly flat and when I hit the ground

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
perfectly flat and when I hit the ground
I<00:01:46.970> didn't<00:01:47.970> bounce<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.420> didn't<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:49.369> damaged<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
I didn't bounce I didn't like damaged a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.910 
I didn't bounce I didn't like damaged a
car<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:51.329> anything<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.869> hit<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.320> ground<00:01:52.770> like

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
car or anything just hit the ground like

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.450 
car or anything just hit the ground like
solid<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.229> weird<00:01:55.340> didn't<00:01:56.340> even

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
solid and that was it weird didn't even

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.490 
solid and that was it weird didn't even
make<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.640> noise

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.100 

this<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:01.640> very<00:02:01.880> similar<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.540> last<00:02:02.720> race<00:02:02.930> we

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
this is very similar to the last race we

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.320 
this is very similar to the last race we
did<00:02:03.260> in<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.620> fact<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:03.920> it's<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.820> really<00:02:05.150> cool

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
did in the fact that it's a really cool

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.990 
did in the fact that it's a really cool
gimmick<00:02:05.720> at<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.380> start<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:06.980> then<00:02:07.220> it's<00:02:07.700> like

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
gimmick at the start and then it's like

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.090 
gimmick at the start and then it's like
granny<00:02:08.600> apple<00:02:08.780> yeah<00:02:09.380> around<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.740> airport

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
granny apple yeah around the airport

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.470 
granny apple yeah around the airport
which<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:10.610> kind<00:02:10.820> of<00:02:10.880> cool<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.270> it'd<00:02:11.390> be

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
which is kind of cool like it'd be

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.540 
which is kind of cool like it'd be
interesting<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.350> with<00:02:12.560> like<00:02:12.770> like<00:02:13.280> a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
interesting to do this with like like a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.520 
interesting to do this with like like a
group<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.090> like<00:02:14.390> 20<00:02:14.930> people<00:02:15.230> or<00:02:15.320> something

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
group of like 20 people or something

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.660 
group of like 20 people or something
just<00:02:16.220> because<00:02:16.420> it'd<00:02:17.420> be<00:02:17.450> funny<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.670> go

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
just because it'd be funny just to go

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:32.800 
just because it'd be funny just to go
around<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.000> loop<00:02:20.180> at<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.390> same<00:02:20.630> time<00:02:30.640> oh<00:02:31.810> I've

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
around the loop at the same time oh I've

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.090 
around the loop at the same time oh I've
got<00:02:33.050> one<00:02:33.080> more<00:02:33.200> checkpoint<00:02:33.709> but<00:02:33.830> there's<00:02:34.010> like

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
got one more checkpoint but there's like

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.680 
got one more checkpoint but there's like
a<00:02:34.160> ramp<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.150> don't<00:02:35.989> know<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:38.330> over<00:02:38.660> a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
a ramp so I don't know it's like over a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.110 
a ramp so I don't know it's like over a
sign<00:02:38.989> oh<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.730> think<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.420> made<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.780> oh<00:02:42.670> I'm<00:02:43.670> not
