00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.810 
rate didn't go too high too early I
stated<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:24.080> some<00:01:24.290> zones<00:01:24.560> without<00:01:25.520> training

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
stated in some zones without training

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.910 
stated in some zones without training
data<00:01:26.180> my<00:01:26.600> performances<00:01:27.229> wouldn't<00:01:27.500> be<00:01:27.560> as<00:01:27.680> good

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
data my performances wouldn't be as good

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.770 
data my performances wouldn't be as good
and<00:01:28.130> that's<00:01:28.430> what<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.640> poll<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.030> 800<00:01:29.570> gives

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
and that's what a poll of the 800 gives

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.660 
and that's what a poll of the 800 gives
me<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.170> race<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.920> have<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.430> get<00:01:34.550> your

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
highest heart rate in the transition so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.540 
highest heart rate in the transition so
it's<00:01:37.310> important<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.850> keep<00:01:37.970> calm<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:40.100> Run<00:01:40.310> is
