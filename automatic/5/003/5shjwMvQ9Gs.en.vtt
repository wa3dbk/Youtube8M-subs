number one James Jones has arguably been
the<00:01:57.360> Heat's<00:01:57.540> best<00:01:57.899> three-point<00:01:58.469> shooter<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the Heat's best three-point shooter so

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.760

three-point range number two and this is
probably<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.610> important<00:02:06.180> when<00:02:06.509> Jones<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.869> on
