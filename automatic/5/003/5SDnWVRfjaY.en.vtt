 with the word man from the field 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.649
 patronage boots malacara and sky boutique 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.450
 higher 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.730
 the rustic with the right measure of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.799
 sophisticated this week's participation 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.990
 comes from the city of montenegro on the river 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.960
 and writes to us. 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.240
 natalia fontana she says here she wants to know 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 which exercises are most appropriate 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.859
 for the hip and rump muscles of a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 Another question is also whether exercise is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.730
 enough or do you need some 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 food supplementation 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.899
 I 'm here then with a vacation that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 specializes in sports medicine and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.760
 Natalia will help what she can do. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.070
 to exercise this point 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.260
 so the first point that should be 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 be careful that if this point is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.879
 able to make this kind of 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.579
 training to add to 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 muscle hypertrophy is the port it should 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.239
 have at least one structure in 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.190
 must be of an age 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.289
 For this we have to always 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.600
 remember that the point it gets ripe 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.309
 for this type of execution is basically 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.189
 from the age of three when the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.010
 episodes are almost closed 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.619
 and mature the vet if they try some 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 exercises that help to hypertrophy the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.540
 muscles of the hindquarters the trot is a 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 exercise that stimulates as a whole 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.259
 especially on soft ground it 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.630
 further stimulates posterior musculature 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.580
 by the force that the animal does to raise 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.270
 and movements on sloping terrain 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.329
 provided the land is am then very 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.759
 folded not with many holes is also 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.890
 a good exercise climb down hill the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.380
 vet says that exercises for the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.650
 muscle hypertrophy should not exceed 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.579
 10 to 15 minutes and the animal can only be 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.549
 required 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.490
 after being properly heated in 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.009
 specific cases such as the natÃ¡lia where the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.070
 goal is to increase muscle mass 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.869
 the specialist in sports medicine 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.780
 recommends non-food supplementation 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.579
 as a musician he will need to be 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.070
 theoretically micro-injured in order to 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.860
 healing and adding more lean mass 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.950
 he needs then at that moment when the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.599
 people are occurs occurs stimulus is good 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.730
 remember to make a parenthesis in this 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.319
 musician he will only add and not 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.800
 moment is running but not 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.780
 time 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.790
 to rest is at that moment that he 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.860
 rest need to heal and 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.720
 aggregate mass it needs to feature 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.490
 to use more than the body in this 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.320
 time can provide 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.210
 Then the supplement comes in. 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.730
 supplements as a fiber protector 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.460
 muscles through the bc which are the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.550
 school teaches lewis hine valine vitamin 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.620
 and selenium that are back protectors 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.000
 healing and and antioxidant properties 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.490
 that the muscle fiber can have a 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.620
 faster and better healing 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.660
 condition and obviously that the protein 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.000
 amino acid between as well as 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.130
 fundamental factor for adding form 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.300
 than muscle fiber 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.300
 in terms of pedophilia
