fingerprints real quick you know that

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.650 
fingerprints real quick you know that
might<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:56.070> option<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.180> let's<00:00:57.329> take<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> look

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
might be one option so let's take a look

might be one option so let's take a look
here<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> couple<00:00:58.199> different<00:00:58.230> things<00:00:58.469> we

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
here at a couple different things we

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.729 
here at a couple different things we
have<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.670> these<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.390> loops<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
have first is these little loops this is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.349 
have first is these little loops this is
pretty<00:01:01.920> nifty<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> basically<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.239> these

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
pretty nifty here I basically have these

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
pretty nifty here I basically have these
little<00:01:03.449> loops<00:01:03.750> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.049> stone<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.890> will

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
little loops kind of stone in that will

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520 
little loops kind of stone in that will
it<00:01:05.729> helps<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.270> ipad<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> the

it helps get the ipad in and out of the
case<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.040> little<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:08.909> down

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
case a little bit and there's one down

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.010 
case a little bit and there's one down
here<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.360> bottom<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.689> one's<00:01:09.869> really

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
here in the bottom this one's really

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
here in the bottom this one's really
handy<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.799> getting<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> case<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
handy for getting it out of the case and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.300 
handy for getting it out of the case and
then<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.020> pocket<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.920> pocket<00:01:14.189> goes

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
then this pocket here this pocket goes

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.440 
then this pocket here this pocket goes
all<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.490> way<00:01:14.670> down<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.420> right

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
all the way down so you can see right

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
all the way down so you can see right
here<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.409> almost<00:01:16.710> opaque<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
here it's actually almost opaque all the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.740 
here it's actually almost opaque all the
way<00:01:17.580> through<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.659> bit

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
way through and this is a little bit

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.090 
way through and this is a little bit
different<00:01:19.049> material<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.500> isn't<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> ultra

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
different material this isn't the ultra

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
different material this isn't the ultra
suede<00:01:20.340> material<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.450> bit<00:01:21.540> different<00:01:21.900> but

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
suede material little bit different but

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
suede material little bit different but
they're<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.560> handy<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.280> maybe

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
they're this would be handy if you maybe

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
they're this would be handy if you maybe
if<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:24.240> papers<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.720> along<00:01:24.930> next

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
if you got some papers going along next

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
general I think are ideal for so the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
general I think are ideal for so the
case<00:01:38.729> inside<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> case<00:01:39.420> thing<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.110> maybe

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
case inside of the case thing so maybe

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.719 
case inside of the case thing so maybe
you<00:01:40.380> got<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> laptop<00:01:40.710> case<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> backpack<00:01:41.700> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.970 
here so all you have to do is grab this
little<00:02:24.930> loop<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.440> really<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.860> is

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
little loop this is really this is

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.560 
little loop this is really this is
really<00:02:26.220> handy<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.850> out<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
really handy to get this out it's a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.820 
really handy to get this out it's a
pretty<00:02:27.750> tight<00:02:27.930> fit<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.410> know<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.710> these

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
pretty tight fit you know so these

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.620 
pretty tight fit you know so these
little<00:02:29.070> loops<00:02:29.340> really<00:02:29.730> definitely<00:02:30.060> come<00:02:30.450> into

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
little loops really definitely come into

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.840 
little loops really definitely come into
play<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:31.980> go<00:02:32.070> in<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.370> way<00:02:32.670> there

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
play so we can go in on that way there

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.730 
play so we can go in on that way there
one<00:02:33.390> way<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.110> do<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.620> is

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
one way that I like to do with it is

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.010 
one way that I like to do with it is
actually<00:02:34.920> put<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.210> dock<00:02:36.390> connector<00:02:36.780> arm

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
actually put the the dock connector arm

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.810 
actually put the the dock connector arm
you<00:02:37.770> know<00:02:37.800> facing<00:02:38.220> out<00:02:38.370> then<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.610> way<00:02:38.790> you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
you know facing out then that way you

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.030 
you know facing out then that way you
can<00:02:39.000> charge<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.540> sync<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.380> device<00:02:40.709> while

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
can charge and sync the device while

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.800 
can charge and sync the device while
it's<00:02:41.280> inside<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.700> case<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:42.570> little

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
it's inside the case but one little

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.360 
it's inside the case but one little

thing to note is it is a little bit
tight<00:02:44.670> fit<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:47.030> rotation

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
lock here on the iPad when he goes all

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.949 
lock here on the iPad when he goes all

the way down the length of the other
case<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.470> coming<00:02:52.770> all<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.010> way<00:02:53.040> out<00:02:53.130> on<00:02:53.520> this

seems to get tripped up so it's one

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.780 
seems to get tripped up so it's one
little<00:02:55.739> downside<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.250> putting<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.550> gets<00:02:56.700> the
