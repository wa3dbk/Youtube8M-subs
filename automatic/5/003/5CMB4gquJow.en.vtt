to<00:00:18.050> help<00:00:18.439> you<00:00:18.590> learn<00:00:18.770> arm<00:00:19.189> vibrato<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:20.630> is

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
to help you learn arm vibrato this is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.269 
to help you learn arm vibrato this is
how<00:00:20.810> I<00:00:20.840> teach<00:00:20.960> my<00:00:21.259> students<00:00:21.650> I<00:00:21.890> want<00:00:21.980> to<00:00:22.099> teach

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
how I teach my students I want to teach

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.900 
how I teach my students I want to teach
you<00:00:22.310> too

the<00:00:23.090> first<00:00:23.300> thing<00:00:23.450> we're<00:00:23.539> going<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.689> do<00:00:23.869> is

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.769 
the first thing we're going to do is
what<00:00:24.410> I<00:00:24.439> call<00:00:24.680> ear<00:00:25.099> vibrato<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.240> we're<00:00:26.689> not

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
what I call ear vibrato so we're not

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.769 
what I call ear vibrato so we're not
going<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:26.960> use<00:00:27.140> our<00:00:27.349> violin<00:00:27.800> or<00:00:28.099> our<00:00:28.519> bow<00:00:28.789> for

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
going to use our violin or our bow for

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.359 
going to use our violin or our bow for
most<00:00:30.050> of<00:00:30.230> this<00:00:30.380> exercise<00:00:30.859> we'll<00:00:31.070> put<00:00:31.220> it<00:00:31.310> all

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
most of this exercise we'll put it all

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.130 
most of this exercise we'll put it all
together<00:00:31.609> at<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.000> end<00:00:32.119> it's<00:00:32.870> going<00:00:33.019> to<00:00:33.080> be

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
together at the end it's going to be

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.770 
together at the end it's going to be
five<00:00:33.470> simple<00:00:34.160> steps<00:00:34.220> so<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.180> first<00:00:35.420> step<00:00:35.629> is

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
five simple steps so the first step is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.079 
five simple steps so the first step is
going<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:35.989> be<00:00:36.050> air<00:00:36.440> righto<00:00:37.100> here<00:00:37.339> we<00:00:37.430> go<00:00:37.550> what

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
getting smaller faster remember to keep

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.790 
getting smaller faster remember to keep
your<00:01:19.880> fingers<00:01:20.180> relaxed<00:01:20.720> make<00:01:21.410> sure<00:01:21.590> we're<00:01:21.770> not

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
your fingers relaxed make sure we're not

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.070 
your fingers relaxed make sure we're not
letting<00:01:22.520> our<00:01:22.640> wrist<00:01:22.880> change<00:01:23.420> position<00:01:23.900> like

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
letting our wrist change position like

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.420 
letting our wrist change position like
this<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.330> is<00:01:26.390> our<00:01:26.750> vibrato<00:01:27.260> there<00:01:28.010> is<00:01:28.130> a

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
this and this is our vibrato there is a

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.470 
this and this is our vibrato there is a
thing<00:01:29.120> called<00:01:29.480> wrist<00:01:29.840> vibrato<00:01:30.350> or<00:01:30.680> it's<00:01:30.800> more

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
thing called wrist vibrato or it's more

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.260 
thing called wrist vibrato or it's more
like<00:01:32.480> this<00:01:32.810> or<00:01:33.770> even<00:01:34.190> some<00:01:34.490> finger<00:01:35.120> vibrato

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
like this or even some finger vibrato

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.600 
like this or even some finger vibrato
but<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.260> iron<00:01:36.500> vibrato<00:01:36.890> gives<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:37.460> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
but the iron vibrato gives you the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.950 
but the iron vibrato gives you the
biggest<00:01:39.640> are<00:01:40.640> really<00:01:40.909> deep<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:41.450> warm

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
biggest are really deep and warm

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960 
biggest are really deep and warm
sounding<00:01:42.800> abroad<00:01:43.040> especially<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.820> get

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
sounding abroad especially when you get

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.790 
sounding abroad especially when you get
good<00:01:44.150> at<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:44.330> they'll<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.140> able<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.350> get<00:01:45.650> the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
good at it they'll be able to get the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.740 
good at it they'll be able to get the
speed<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.340> go<00:01:46.490> quickly<00:01:46.760> so<00:01:46.909> you'll<00:01:47.270> be<00:01:47.420> able<00:01:47.510> to

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
speed to go quickly so you'll be able to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.950 
speed to go quickly so you'll be able to
vary<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.140> intensity<00:01:48.409> from<00:01:49.130> real

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
vary the intensity from real

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.859 
vary the intensity from real
and<00:01:50.920> quick<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:53.080> mellow<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:53.830> wide<00:01:54.270> head<00:01:55.270> wobbly

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
and quick to mellow and wide head wobbly

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.620 
and quick to mellow and wide head wobbly
so<00:01:56.409> this<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.680> really<00:01:57.040> good<00:01:57.630> versatile

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
so this is a really good versatile

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.620 
so this is a really good versatile
vibrato<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.200> learn<00:01:59.820> let's<00:02:00.820> do<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.119> everybody

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
vibrato to learn let's do the everybody

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.660 
vibrato to learn let's do the everybody
again<00:02:02.400> come<00:02:03.400> up<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:04.540> want<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.780> go<00:02:04.930> back<00:02:05.710> and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
again come up so we want to go back and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.070 
again come up so we want to go back and
forth<00:02:07.229> back<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.709> forth<00:02:09.100> back<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.479> forth

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
forth back and forth back and forth

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.710 
forth back and forth back and forth
getting<00:02:11.950> smaller<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:15.300> faster<00:02:17.100> there<00:02:18.100> we<00:02:18.250> go

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
getting smaller and faster there we go

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.360 
getting smaller and faster there we go
okay<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.350> want<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.650> go<00:02:20.739> practice<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.340> a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
okay so I want you to go practice that a

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.890 
okay so I want you to go practice that a
whole<00:02:21.640> bunch<00:02:21.670> when<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.239> get<00:02:22.390> good<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.660> that
