00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 with what feeling do you stay after the one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.359
 a 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.620
 yes afterwards it is a justified result 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.580
 Underneath you maybe 80% the balls 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.720
 you can also do a small number 2 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.099
 lose and 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.379
 [Music] 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.760
 yes this was a match just not us 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.310
 we had the ball a lot but we create 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.070
 few and then you have to be very depressed 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.619
 be attentive because they invite you to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.930
 and we did the same 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.310
 and so there you have the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.210
 keep the screen in the back so first 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.560
 half 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.530
 actually no chance given away but also 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.630
 I myself created little that I stay there 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 difficult because they have a codon of the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 from eight players a kind of handball zone 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 in which play from left to right and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.680
 to understand how they can do more 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.539
 play 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.430
 well that did not work out 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.640
 government print remained fairly easy 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.280
 that the healthy first other sure 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 to hungry for to the three 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.430
 must score points and therefore not 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.430
 done so as of disappointment 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.469
 the pace table was maybe too low yes 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.019
 simple but you need the mole 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.030
 reason why you can switch from one to one 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.369
 already but it's about that shit but that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.130
 point player that you end up there and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.200
 through the sides but no I found 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.630
 found a little flat lactose the fire 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.310
 what it was further down against minus 2 was there 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.420
 today can't kid who blames that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.180
 is not to have worked because to have 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.310
 all of them but it was just not what 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.580
 happened at the counter hit 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.950
 earwax someone behind yes the defender 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.759
 from 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.430
 icon sees the balls or one and 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.500
 was in no and yes they were too 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.729
 easy that that that goal falls 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.200
 because we 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.210
 yes it is just a long ball one 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.799
 person the route 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.990
 actually in it is in the front is behind it 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.039
 but yes I can'm easy to 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.590
 a score 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.049
 yes that should not happen it is it is 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.420
 set a free ball of mass well 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.549
 but they can make so much 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.049
 where did it go wrong with you well me 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.880
 think anyway those opportunities that we 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.130
 got on that dangerous to a until 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.679
 everyone must and then times the match 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.259
 lock if you come for this then 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.789
 you get even more space for in a yes 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.780
 then you got even more chances 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.030
 that didn't happen 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.920
 had to change in everyone 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.410
 case 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.450
 contact each other of oil is that was to 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.160
 move the game a little further forward 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.670
 then forced to go 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.500
 The keeper Aquarius argued with him 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.700
 yes he says it feels it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.620
 like a knee 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.780
 and that you are therefore very rigid and the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.610
 that was now english and is in his hip 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.950
 hope well hopefully it is not you 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.720
 no more because then you are inside 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.520
 two days white 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.780
 that might make the organization one 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.610
 little we make it the level bit 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.410
 restless yes I feel it 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.360
 restless did not become that 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.510
 by the keeper but my you just see 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.650
 that that aquarius that that ray of 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.750
 and rest and yes and then young people come 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.950
 in it he couldn't do anything about that coming and going 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.049
 he stands two millions state one 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.390
 laughed so you 're almost for that 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.100
 coming back to a one what it wasn't 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.049
 a match pretty so okay 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.600
 I also created opportunities what does this mean 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.280
 well equal game nothing wrong 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.030
 you say but considering the result on it 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.580
 other field 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.739
 are a pro of naples and missed opportunity 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.150
 well thats again i think if you 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.280
 who first had to be healthy at home 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.250
 play with respect, of course 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.989
 if you see yes how much threat we 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.420
 yet we don't really care about it 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.920
 percent opportunities but still a lot of threat 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.510
 yes then you have won that match 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.980
 normal time- consuming stuff 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.609
 and we didn't do that 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.609
 screen is the chance
