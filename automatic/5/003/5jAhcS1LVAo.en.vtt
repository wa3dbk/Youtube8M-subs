00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.990 
we're going to show you how this is done
I'm<00:00:45.470> gonna<00:00:45.680> get<00:00:45.890> started<00:00:46.010> by<00:00:46.370> taking<00:00:46.730> a

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
I'm gonna get started by taking a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.880 
I'm gonna get started by taking a
picture<00:00:47.240> of<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:48.010> assembly<00:00:49.180> just<00:00:50.180> because<00:00:50.690> I

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
picture of the assembly just because I

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.620 
picture of the assembly just because I
know<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.100> if<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.310> don't<00:00:52.370> sometimes<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.510> can

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
know that if I don't sometimes you can

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.450 
know that if I don't sometimes you can
get<00:00:53.720> things<00:00:53.990> out<00:00:54.170> of<00:00:54.230> order<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.860> you

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
get things out of order and you

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.800 
get things out of order and you
definitely<00:00:55.670> need<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.150> pay<00:00:56.300> attention<00:00:56.570> to

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
definitely need to pay attention to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.390 
definitely need to pay attention to
which<00:00:57.020> way<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.440> rocker<00:00:57.650> arms<00:00:58.070> are<00:00:58.280> actually

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
which way the rocker arms are actually

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.570 
which way the rocker arms are actually
facing<00:00:59.150> facing<00:00:59.420> out<00:00:59.750> or<00:00:59.930> facing<00:01:00.320> in<00:01:00.470> so<00:01:01.430> you

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
facing facing out or facing in so you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.940 
facing facing out or facing in so you
have<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.090> pay<00:01:02.210> attention<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:03.680> we're<00:01:03.800> gonna

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
have to pay attention and we're gonna

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
have to pay attention and we're gonna
start<00:01:04.250> by<00:01:04.460> removing<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:06.430> pins<00:01:07.430> on<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> end

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
start by removing the pins on the end

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.840 
start by removing the pins on the end
here<00:01:08.270> clips<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.530> pulling<00:01:10.189> those<00:01:10.280> out<00:01:10.520> and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
here clips and pulling those out and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:52.649 
here clips and pulling those out and
then<00:01:11.420> we'll<00:01:11.570> start<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.869> disassembly<00:01:12.140> process

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.240 

we<00:01:53.659> generally<00:01:53.960> try<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.229> lay<00:01:54.469> these<00:01:54.680> out<00:01:54.950> as

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
we generally try and lay these out as

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:34.870 
we generally try and lay these out as
they<00:01:55.460> come<00:01:55.640> apart

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.370 

and<00:02:35.880> then<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.450> looks<00:02:36.600> like<00:02:36.660> our<00:02:36.930> shaft<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.350> in

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
and then it looks like our shaft is in

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.200 
and then it looks like our shaft is in
pretty<00:02:37.620> good<00:02:37.710> shape<00:02:37.830> there's<00:02:38.280> no<00:02:38.460> significant

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
pretty good shape there's no significant

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.570 
pretty good shape there's no significant
wear<00:02:39.870> here<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.500> we're<00:02:40.680> gonna<00:02:40.770> reuse<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.280> shaft

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
wear here so we're gonna reuse the shaft

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.900 
wear here so we're gonna reuse the shaft
and<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:42.960> one<00:02:43.170> power<00:02:43.980> here<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.550> actually

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and this one power here is actually

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.700 
and this one power here is actually
pinned<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.510> locations<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.410> we're<00:02:46.530> going<00:02:46.620> to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
pinned in locations so we're going to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.750 
pinned in locations so we're going to
leave<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:49.410> now<00:02:49.680> we'll<00:02:49.830> go<00:02:50.010> over<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.280> we

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
leave that and now we'll go over and we

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.160 
leave that and now we'll go over and we
face<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.540> rockers<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.690> not<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> good

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
face the rockers this is not a good

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.080 
face the rockers this is not a good
situation<00:02:55.770> here<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.940> make<00:02:57.060> sure

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
situation here you have to make sure

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.570 
situation here you have to make sure
that<00:02:57.330> they<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> correct<00:02:58.340> radius<00:02:59.340> on

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that they have the correct radius on

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.020 
that they have the correct radius on
there<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:02.130> want<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> nice<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.820> even

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
because if this was an adjustable set of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.220 
because if this was an adjustable set of
rockers<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:06.360> would<00:03:06.570> throw<00:03:06.810> off<00:03:06.870> your<00:03:06.900> valve

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
rockers this would throw off your valve

well<00:05:00.690> we'll<00:05:00.810> start<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:01.200> reassembly<00:05:01.680> process<00:05:01.860> by

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
well we'll start a reassembly process by

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.180 
well we'll start a reassembly process by
taking<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.850> little<00:05:02.970> bit<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.770> grease<00:05:04.770> light

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
taking a little bit of grease light

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.750 
taking a little bit of grease light
breeze<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:06.740> clicking<00:05:07.740> on<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.920> shaft<00:05:08.190> here<00:05:08.490> so

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
breeze and clicking on the shaft here so

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.050 
breeze and clicking on the shaft here so
that<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.060> rockers<00:05:09.360> won't<00:05:09.630> be<00:05:10.050> starting<00:05:10.500> dry

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
that the rockers won't be starting dry

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.490 
that the rockers won't be starting dry
this<00:05:12.060> ends<00:05:12.270> you'll<00:05:12.420> probably<00:05:12.660> go<00:05:13.050> on<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.290> sim

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
this ends you'll probably go on the sim

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.040 
this ends you'll probably go on the sim
test<00:05:13.740> anyway<00:05:14.160> but<00:05:14.400> we<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:14.730> to<00:05:14.910> put<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.930> little

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
test anyway but we like to put a little

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:26.149 
test anyway but we like to put a little
bit<00:05:16.170> of<00:05:16.350> grease<00:05:16.530> on<00:05:16.740> there<00:05:16.890> anyway
