00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.370
The Devil is a lot of things.
But he's no dummy.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.830
Ezekiel 28:17 says,
"...thou hast corrupted

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.370
thy" --what? "wisdom
by reason of thy brightness:"

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
So the Devil is wise,
and he knows stuff.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.070
Would you like to know something
that the Devil even knows,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.130
about the scripture,
the literal words of God?

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.090
Hi, I'm David Daniels
from Chick Publications.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.370
So the Devil is wise.
He knows stuff.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.660
When he confronted Jesus,
in the 2nd Temptation,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.260
Matthew 4,
he used scripture,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.530
the absolute, infallible,
undeniable words of the living God.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.199
So what DID he use?

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.890
Realize,
he's like a lawyer,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.359
he's prodding, he's poking,
he's trying to find a chink

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.010
in the Lord's armor.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.030
You can't just "make stuff up"
with the Son of the living God.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.000
He knows EVERYTHING.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.260
So let's start in verse 5.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.790
5 "Then the devil taketh him up
into the holy city, and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.420
setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,"

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.090
By the way, John 2:16,
that's Jesus' Father's house (the temple).

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.010
So Satan sets Him on His father's house.
Remember that.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.820
5 "...a pinnacle of the temple,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.010
6 And saith unto him,
If thou be the Son of God,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.260
cast thyself down:
for it is written,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.110
He shall give his angels
charge concerning thee: and

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
in their hands they shall bear thee up,
lest at any time

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.960
thou dash thy foot against a stone."

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.110
Satan used a scripture,
this infallible scripture,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.850
the LITERAL words, remember,
against God.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.500
But, see...
There's a funny thing about that.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.350
And that is this:
When confronting the Son of God,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.189
he quoted a Psalm!
Psalm 91.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.040
And he used that to say,
"If thou be the Son of God..."

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.829
What's so special about Psalm 91?

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.129
Wait till you see.
That is Psalm 91:11-12,

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.469
But this is gonna be
Psalm 91:1. Take a look.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.950
Get out your Bible, if you've got it.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.189
1 "He that dwelleth
in the secret place of the most High

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.409
shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty."

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.310
"He that dwelleth in
the secret place of the most High..."

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.780
What's
"the secret place of the most High"?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.840
And then it hit me:
"The bosom of the Father."

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.230
"...dwelleth in
the secret place of the most High..."

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.689
You know, John 1:18.

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.819
It says,
18 "No man hath seen God

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.099
at any time;
the only begotten Son,

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.219
which is in the bosom of the Father,
he hath declared him."

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.859
Now, this just blew me away!
And I was going,

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:15.139
"Am I the only person who sees this?"
Because if I am,

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.370
just set it aside.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.079
But guess what?
I found out in

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.560
the guy that came before Spurgeon,
a Baptist preacher named John Gill,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.200
even he saw that Psalm 91 here
is talking about the Son of God.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.639
There are lots of Messianic Psalms.
But there aren't a lot of Psalms

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:40.029
about the Son of God.
So this is a "protection Psalm"

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:43.739
about God the Son
while He was on the earth.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.900
That's why it says,
"the only begotten Son,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.930
which is in the bosom of the Father,
he hath declared him."

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.150
And in Psalm 91,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.799
1 "He that dwelleth
in the secret place of the most High"

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.319
(the bosom of the Father),

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.379
"shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty."

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.249
So while He is on
His earthly ministry

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.540
He's going to be protected.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.319
That's amazing.
So here we go.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.719
Let's get back to the Devil.
He's wise.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:17.829
He knows his scripture.
In fact, he was so wise,

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.280
and thought he was so wise,
he thought he was 2nd to,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.639
or as good as, God Himself.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.949
As it says in Isaiah 14:14,

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.080
14 "I will ascend
above the heights of the clouds;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.340
I will be like the most High."

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.940
So there you go.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.150
So the Devil is wise.
He quotes Psalm 91.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.120
And Jesus didn't call him out
for bad exegesis, by the way.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.460
He went right to it.
It says, instead of saying:

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.539
"Yes, you're right, I lose, you win;"
instead of trying to

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.830
contradict him on the scripture;
instead, He does something else.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.680
You see, Psalm 91 is
not the "be all, end all" of scripture.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.349
There are a lot of other scriptures.
And some are very important.

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.199
So Jesus responds in verse 7.
Listen to this.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.360
Matthew 4:7 "Jesus said unto him,
It is written again,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.810
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.009
So it doesn't matter that
the LORD promised protection for Him

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.990
in His earthly life,
"If thou be the Son of God."

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.199
Yes, He's the Son of God.
"Well, they'll bear You up."

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.400
"Yes, they'll bear Me up,
--BUT--

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.080
"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
You don't interfere with

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.580
the plans and the purposes
of God for His Son.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.379
That was the most important scripture there.
So God's exact words

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:54.840
were so important
that even the Devil had to quote them.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.540
Stick with God's exact words!
God bless you, and have a wonderful day.
