00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
format it just seems like it was

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.840 
format it just seems like it was
yesterday<00:03:42.840> almost<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.860> we<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.520> changed

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
over to the current format i know it was

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.500 
over to the current format i know it was
probably<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> year<00:03:47.430> ago<00:03:47.610> or<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.090> but<00:03:48.330> i

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
probably like a year ago or so but i

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.050 
probably like a year ago or so but i
don't<00:03:49.110> know<00:03:49.200> i<00:03:49.230> saw<00:03:49.800> i<00:03:49.830> spent<00:03:50.430> all<00:03:50.580> last<00:03:50.610> night

don't know i saw i spent all last night
screwing<00:03:51.510> around<00:03:51.660> making<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.350> new<00:03:52.500> banner

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
screwing around making a new banner

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.220 
screwing around making a new banner
which<00:03:53.520> it<00:03:54.330> seems<00:03:54.690> like<00:03:54.840> they<00:03:54.959> just<00:03:55.080> keep

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
which it seems like they just keep

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.360 
which it seems like they just keep
making<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.530> harder<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:55.860> harder<00:03:55.920> for<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
making it harder and harder for the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.610 
making it harder and harder for the
actual<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:57.000> people<00:03:57.690> putting<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.110> videos<00:03:58.410> up

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
actual like people putting the videos up

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.990 
actual like people putting the videos up
it<00:03:58.739> makes<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.010> easier<00:03:59.250> for<00:03:59.400> people<00:03:59.550> viewing

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
it makes it easier for people viewing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.900 
it makes it easier for people viewing
videos<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:00.920> just<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.070> make<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.400> damn<00:04:02.520> banner

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
videos but just to make the damn banner

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.930

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
bouncing back and forth so I don't know

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.159 
bouncing back and forth so I don't know
what<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.729> hell<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.000> going<00:04:24.240> on<00:04:24.330> maybe<00:04:24.990> there's

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
what the hell is going on maybe there's

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.690 
what the hell is going on maybe there's
some<00:04:25.320> bugs<00:04:25.560> or<00:04:25.830> something<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
some bugs or something in the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.670 
some bugs or something in the
system<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.660> maybe<00:04:28.020> check<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.530> make<00:04:28.620> sure

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
system but I maybe check to make sure

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.190 
system but I maybe check to make sure
you're<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:29.220> still<00:04:29.580> subscribed<00:04:30.150> because<00:04:30.510> it

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
you're so still subscribed because it

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.140 
you're so still subscribed because it
seems<00:04:31.530> like<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.040> was<00:04:32.250> maybe<00:04:32.460> kicking<00:04:32.880> people

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
seems like it was maybe kicking people

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.190 
seems like it was maybe kicking people
out<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.360> then<00:04:33.480> adding<00:04:33.750> them<00:04:33.840> back<00:04:34.020> or

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
out and then adding them back or

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.430 
out and then adding them back or
something<00:04:34.910> more<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:36.390> than<00:04:36.690> their<00:04:36.870> normal<00:04:36.900> like

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
something more so than their normal like

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.200 
something more so than their normal like
oh<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.680> got<00:04:38.010> some<00:04:38.220> subscribers<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.910> then<00:04:39.030> maybe

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
oh I got some subscribers and then maybe

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.210 
oh I got some subscribers and then maybe
lost<00:04:39.480> one<00:04:39.750> or<00:04:39.840> two<00:04:39.990> like<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:40.410> was<00:04:40.530> dramatically

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
lost one or two like it was dramatically

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.030 
lost one or two like it was dramatically
just<00:04:41.520> like<00:04:41.670> every<00:04:42.060> couple<00:04:42.420> hours<00:04:42.600> was<00:04:43.470> jumping

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
just like every couple hours was jumping

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.980 
just like every couple hours was jumping
from<00:04:44.370> one<00:04:44.580> number<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:45.030> another<00:04:45.210> so<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.750> don't

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
from one number to another so I don't
