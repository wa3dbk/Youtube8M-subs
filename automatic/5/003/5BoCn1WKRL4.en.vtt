pretty experienced when it comes to
racing<00:00:18.260> games<00:00:18.500> he<00:00:18.710> knows<00:00:18.890> his<00:00:19.070> way<00:00:19.190> around<00:00:19.220> and

racing games he knows his way around and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.370 
racing games he knows his way around and
could<00:00:20.000> give<00:00:20.119> me<00:00:20.270> some<00:00:20.300> great<00:00:20.660> details<00:00:20.900> and

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
could give me some great details and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.740 
could give me some great details and

noting that from a visual perspective
there's<00:00:33.440> a<00:00:33.500> very<00:00:34.070> little<00:00:34.340> in<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.460> way<00:00:34.520> of

there's a very little in the way of

there's a very little in the way of

bland<00:00:36.950> it<00:00:37.220> has<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.489> be<00:00:37.579> said<00:00:37.790> but<00:00:37.940> I<00:00:38.030> think<00:00:38.180> we

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
bland it has to be said but I think we

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.639 
bland it has to be said but I think we
can<00:00:38.450> see<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.020> I<00:00:39.050> think<00:00:39.079> certainly<00:00:39.559> in

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
can see that and I think certainly in

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.889 
can see that and I think certainly in

that<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:42.140> don't<00:00:42.260> really<00:00:42.530> feel<00:00:42.800> is<00:00:42.950> very<00:00:43.130> fitting

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
that I don't really feel is very fitting

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.190 
that I don't really feel is very fitting
with<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.730> overall<00:00:44.090> environment<00:00:44.750> looks<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:45.110> bit

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
with the overall environment looks a bit

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.470 
with the overall environment looks a bit
a<00:00:45.260> little<00:00:45.320> bit<00:00:45.739> too<00:00:45.980> perfect<00:00:46.940> it<00:00:47.090> has<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.390> be

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
a little bit too perfect it has to be

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.450 
a little bit too perfect it has to be
said<00:00:47.690> though<00:00:48.260> he<00:00:48.500> has<00:00:48.590> pointed<00:00:48.920> out<00:00:49.040> some<00:00:49.309> nice

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
said though he has pointed out some nice

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.030 
said though he has pointed out some nice
elevation<00:00:49.960> changes<00:00:50.960> including<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.739> uphill

as<00:00:54.890> well<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.340> you'll<00:00:55.430> notice<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.820> he<00:00:56.000> breaks

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
as well and you'll notice that he breaks

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.029 
as well and you'll notice that he breaks
a<00:00:56.329> bit<00:00:56.480> too<00:00:56.629> much<00:00:56.870> even<00:00:57.260> because<00:00:57.649> you've<00:00:57.800> got

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
a bit too much even because you've got

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.430 
a bit too much even because you've got
to<00:00:58.160> take<00:00:58.309> into<00:00:58.520> account<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.899> gradient

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
to take into account the the gradient

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.840 
to take into account the the gradient
you<00:01:00.559> can<00:01:00.680> actually<00:01:00.890> break<00:01:01.070> later<00:01:01.399> into<00:01:01.730> those

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
you can actually break later into those

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.270 
you can actually break later into those
corners<00:01:02.360> so<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:03.050> does<00:01:03.289> circuits<00:01:04.009> like<00:01:04.100> this

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
corners so it does circuits like this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.709 
corners so it does circuits like this
offer<00:01:04.489> different<00:01:04.789> challenges<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
offer different challenges for the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.870 
offer different challenges for the
driver<00:01:06.100> depending<00:01:07.100> on<00:01:07.100> what<00:01:07.310> car<00:01:07.549> you're<00:01:07.700> in

and<00:01:08.090> how<00:01:08.119> how<00:01:08.719> competitive<00:01:09.139> you<00:01:09.409> really<00:01:09.799> want

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
and how how competitive you really want

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.489 
and how how competitive you really want
to<00:01:10.009> be<00:01:10.189> on<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.399> pace<00:01:10.609> adds<00:01:10.999> a<00:01:11.179> lot<00:01:11.329> of

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
to be on the pace adds a lot of

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.749 
to be on the pace adds a lot of
additional<00:01:12.499> challenges<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.369> reactive

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
additional challenges and reactive

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.789 
additional challenges and reactive
challenges<00:01:14.270> depending<00:01:14.630> on<00:01:14.719> how<00:01:14.899> fast<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.679> get

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
challenges depending on how fast you get

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.199 
challenges depending on how fast you get
into<00:01:16.009> each<00:01:16.130> corner<00:01:16.399> and<00:01:16.639> we<00:01:16.700> see<00:01:16.850> here<00:01:17.060> a

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
into each corner and we see here a

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.669 
into each corner and we see here a
little<00:01:17.450> bit<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.719> wheelspin<00:01:17.869> for<00:01:18.409> him<00:01:18.529> as<00:01:18.649> well

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
little bit of wheelspin for him as well

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.949 
little bit of wheelspin for him as well
so<00:01:19.279> again<00:01:20.029> you<00:01:20.149> want<00:01:20.359> to<00:01:20.420> improve<00:01:20.630> your<00:01:20.689> lap

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:20.959 
so again you want to improve your lap

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.529 
so again you want to improve your lap
times<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:21.499> understand<00:01:21.979> how<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.279> power<00:01:22.549> works

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
times and understand how the power works

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.649 
times and understand how the power works
through<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.840> car<00:01:24.459> noting<00:01:25.459> the<00:01:26.179> delta<00:01:26.509> wing

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
through the car noting the delta wing

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.719 
through the car noting the delta wing
actually<00:01:26.990> how<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.200> loads<00:01:27.560> up<00:01:27.829> through<00:01:28.609> the

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
actually how it loads up through the

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.830 
actually how it loads up through the
high<00:01:28.880> speed<00:01:29.209> corners<00:01:30.249> and<00:01:31.249> how<00:01:32.209> well<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.569> turns

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
high speed corners and how well it turns

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.399 
high speed corners and how well it turns
as<00:01:33.139> well<00:01:33.349> fantastic<00:01:34.130> turning<00:01:34.569> so<00:01:35.569> apparently

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
as well fantastic turning so apparently

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.980 
as well fantastic turning so apparently
it's<00:01:36.560> really<00:01:36.979> good<00:01:37.189> fun<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.520> drive<00:01:37.729> as<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.689> look

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
it's really good fun to drive as we look

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.120 
it's really good fun to drive as we look
now<00:01:39.499> at<00:01:39.529> the<00:01:39.740> willow<00:01:40.039> spring<00:01:40.369> circuit<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:42.130> you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
now at the willow spring circuit and you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.620 
now at the willow spring circuit and you
might<00:01:43.369> feel<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:43.669> is<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:43.849> good<00:01:44.029> example<00:01:44.149> of

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
might feel this is a good example of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.779 
might feel this is a good example of
what<00:01:44.749> the<00:01:44.899> new<00:01:45.049> engine<00:01:45.169> can<00:01:45.560> do<00:01:45.789> interestingly

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
what the new engine can do interestingly

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.909 
what the new engine can do interestingly
notes<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.719> invisible<00:01:48.109> walls<00:01:48.319> are<00:01:48.679> much

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:48.919 
notes the invisible walls are much

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:51.339 
notes the invisible walls are much
further<00:01:49.189> back<00:01:49.520> now<00:01:49.789> which<00:01:50.659> means<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:50.989> can<00:01:51.169> end

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
further back now which means you can end

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:52.859 
further back now which means you can end

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
expanses of desert should you get things

wrong which is nice I know something's

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.989 
wrong which is nice I know something's

has<00:01:59.179> been<00:01:59.389> invisible<00:01:59.689> walls<00:02:00.109> I<00:02:00.319> admit<00:02:00.919> the

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
has been invisible walls I admit the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.260 
has been invisible walls I admit the
invisible<00:02:01.429> walls<00:02:01.609> aren't<00:02:01.819> necessarily

something<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:02.719> bothered<00:02:02.989> me<00:02:03.020> myself<00:02:03.590> but

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
something that bothered me myself but

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.889 
something that bothered me myself but
it's<00:02:04.489> nice<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.759> know<00:02:04.999> they've<00:02:05.299> modelled<00:02:05.659> more

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
it's nice to know they've modelled more

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.690 
it's nice to know they've modelled more
of<00:02:05.989> the<00:02:06.079> scenery<00:02:06.439> now<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.889> that's<00:02:07.369> that

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
of the scenery now and that's that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.869 
of the scenery now and that's that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.600 
in improving the Gran Turismo Xperia
so<00:02:14.450> willow<00:02:14.959> springs<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.500> certainly<00:02:16.340> probably

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
so willow springs in certainly probably

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.850 
so willow springs in certainly probably
the<00:02:16.909> best<00:02:17.120> looking<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.629> new<00:02:17.840> circuit<00:02:18.590> but

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
the best looking of the new circuit but

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.380 
the best looking of the new circuit but
it's<00:02:18.980> more<00:02:19.129> down<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.459> lighting<00:02:19.909> and<00:02:20.060> color<00:02:20.239> and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
it's more down to lighting and color and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.630 
it's more down to lighting and color and
visual<00:02:20.870> feel<00:02:21.170> just<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.890> fidelity<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.489> the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
visual feel just the fidelity of the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.940 
visual feel just the fidelity of the
circuit<00:02:23.060> looks<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.510> lot<00:02:23.930> better<00:02:24.110> I've<00:02:24.769> been

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
circuit looks a lot better I've been

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.770 
circuit looks a lot better I've been
looking<00:02:25.010> at<00:02:25.310> Silverstone<00:02:25.909> I'm<00:02:26.390> still<00:02:26.659> not

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
looking at Silverstone I'm still not

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.449 
looking at Silverstone I'm still not

of<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.610> gradients<00:02:29.180> don't<00:02:29.360> appear<00:02:29.629> quite

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
of the gradients don't appear quite

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.530 
of the gradients don't appear quite
right<00:02:30.400> some<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.519> color<00:02:31.760> appears<00:02:32.299> to<00:02:32.420> be<00:02:32.510> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
right some of the color appears to be a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.530 
right some of the color appears to be a
bit<00:02:32.659> too<00:02:32.780> garish<00:02:33.110> it's<00:02:33.819> not<00:02:34.819> really<00:02:35.060> there<00:02:35.269> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
bit too garish it's not really there and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.930 
bit too garish it's not really there and
I<00:02:36.049> think<00:02:36.319> that<00:02:36.650> certainly<00:02:36.920> from<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.370> tonal<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
I think that certainly from a tonal and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.059 
I think that certainly from a tonal and
palette<00:02:38.269> perspective<00:02:38.840> silverstone<00:02:39.799> still

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
palette perspective silverstone still

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.039 
palette perspective silverstone still
need<00:02:40.220> some<00:02:40.430> work<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.030> doubt<00:02:41.629> that's<00:02:41.870> going

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
need some work and I doubt that's going

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.930 
need some work and I doubt that's going
to<00:02:42.140> be<00:02:42.230> done<00:02:42.409> between<00:02:42.590> now<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.099> release<00:02:43.310> but

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
to be done between now and release but

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.699 
to be done between now and release but
my<00:02:44.299> key<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.569> getting<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.870> feel<00:02:45.140> doing<00:02:45.650> this

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
my key is getting a feel doing this

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.289 
my key is getting a feel doing this
first<00:02:45.980> lap<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.430> more<00:02:46.640> an<00:02:46.730> explorative

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
first lap this is more an explorative

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.420 
first lap this is more an explorative
lat<00:02:47.599> where<00:02:48.170> he's<00:02:48.290> sort<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.739> pushing<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.190> car

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
lat where he's sort of pushing the car

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.430 
lat where he's sort of pushing the car
and<00:02:49.819> getting<00:02:50.269> an<00:02:50.390> idea<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.049> physics

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
and getting an idea on the physics

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.729 
and getting an idea on the physics
forests<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.250> how<00:02:52.790> that's<00:02:52.970> going<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.299> work

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
forests and how that's going to work

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.440 
forests and how that's going to work
under<00:02:54.739> braking<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.400> making<00:02:55.819> mistake<00:02:56.150> there

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
under braking and making mistake there

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.300 
under braking and making mistake there
and<00:02:57.109> again<00:02:57.379> once<00:02:57.590> he<00:02:57.650> gets<00:02:57.799> a<00:02:57.890> wheel<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.069> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
and again once he gets a wheel on the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.899 
and again once he gets a wheel on the
dirt<00:02:58.519> it's<00:02:59.180> all<00:02:59.390> over<00:02:59.780> so<00:03:00.909> understanding

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
dirt it's all over so understanding

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.369 
dirt it's all over so understanding
limit<00:03:02.359> when<00:03:02.540> you're<00:03:02.659> locking<00:03:02.840> up<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.079> brakes

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
limit when you're locking up the brakes

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.130 
limit when you're locking up the brakes
everything<00:03:03.950> else<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:05.659> now<00:03:05.810> he's<00:03:05.959> done<00:03:06.079> an

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
everything else and so now he's done an

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.020 
everything else and so now he's done an
exploratory<00:03:06.650> lap<00:03:06.890> he'll<00:03:07.400> do<00:03:07.549> a<00:03:07.579> lap<00:03:07.790> now

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
exploratory lap he'll do a lap now

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.059 
exploratory lap he'll do a lap now
that's<00:03:08.500> where<00:03:09.500> he<00:03:09.560> puts<00:03:09.739> together<00:03:09.829> the

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
that's where he puts together the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.410 
that's where he puts together the
experience<00:03:10.609> she's<00:03:10.730> gained<00:03:10.970> on<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.239> first

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
experience she's gained on that first

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.300 
experience she's gained on that first
lap<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.870> improves<00:03:12.170> upon<00:03:12.379> it<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.829> say<00:03:13.159> this

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
lap and improves upon it and I say this

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.740 
lap and improves upon it and I say this
to<00:03:13.370> all<00:03:13.489> racing<00:03:14.000> game<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.359> you<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.569> when<00:03:14.690> you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
to all racing game is you know when you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.140 
to all racing game is you know when you

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
go to these events you get on there you

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.569 
go to these events you get on there you
have<00:03:17.299> three<00:03:17.540> laps<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:18.019> their<00:03:18.230> site<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.739> you

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
have three laps on their site and you

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.849 
have three laps on their site and you
just<00:03:19.819> you<00:03:20.120> just<00:03:20.150> got<00:03:20.419> to<00:03:20.470> explore<00:03:21.470> as<00:03:21.560> much<00:03:21.620> as

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
just you just got to explore as much as

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.500 
just you just got to explore as much as
you<00:03:21.950> can<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> first<00:03:22.579> lap<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.090> then<00:03:23.180> put<00:03:23.389> it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
you can on the first lap and then put it

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.690 
you can on the first lap and then put it
all<00:03:23.599> together<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.169> second<00:03:24.530> lap<00:03:24.700> really

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
all together on the second lap really

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.699 
all together on the second lap really
get<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.849> feel<00:03:26.120> for<00:03:26.359> it<00:03:26.389> and<00:03:26.569> for<00:03:27.530> those<00:03:27.650> who

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
get a feel for it and for those who

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.740 
get a feel for it and for those who
aren't<00:03:27.950> racing<00:03:28.370> game<00:03:28.579> is<00:03:28.760> not<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.329> experience

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
aren't racing game is not you experience

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.780 
aren't racing game is not you experience
to<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:29.959> genre<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.950> could<00:03:31.160> take<00:03:31.310> them<00:03:31.519> longer

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
to this genre it could take them longer

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.099 
to this genre it could take them longer
and<00:03:31.970> that's<00:03:32.239> why<00:03:32.359> a<00:03:32.389> lot<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.810> videos

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
and that's why a lot of the videos

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.229 
and that's why a lot of the videos
you'll<00:03:33.349> see<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:34.069> was<00:03:34.220> spinning<00:03:34.639> off<00:03:34.730> every<00:03:35.090> two

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
you'll see it was spinning off every two

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.449 
you'll see it was spinning off every two
corners<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.129> unfortunately<00:03:37.129> that<00:03:37.250> doesn't

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
corners and unfortunately that doesn't

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.890 
corners and unfortunately that doesn't
really<00:03:37.730> give<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.030> an<00:03:38.090> idea<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.510> physics

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
really give you an idea of the physics

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.909 
really give you an idea of the physics
because<00:03:39.109> you're<00:03:39.319> not<00:03:39.379> getting<00:03:39.650> into<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.889> flow

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
because you're not getting into a flow

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.170 
because you're not getting into a flow
certainly<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.010> racing<00:03:43.340> line<00:03:43.370> helping<00:03:43.970> here

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
certainly the racing line helping here

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.400 
certainly the racing line helping here
of<00:03:44.269> course<00:03:44.299> for<00:03:44.690> those<00:03:44.780> who<00:03:44.959> don't<00:03:45.109> know<00:03:45.230> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
of course for those who don't know the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.559 
of course for those who don't know the
circuit<00:03:45.769> very<00:03:45.980> well<00:03:48.819> this<00:03:49.819> might<00:03:50.150> feed<00:03:50.389> his

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
circuit very well this might feed his

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.869 
circuit very well this might feed his
way<00:03:50.720> around<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.379> overall<00:03:52.129> though<00:03:52.310> he<00:03:52.609> says

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
way around so overall though he says

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.479 
way around so overall though he says
that<00:03:53.090> it's<00:03:53.269> very<00:03:53.629> enjoyable<00:03:54.010> has<00:03:55.010> noticed<00:03:55.400> the

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
that it's very enjoyable has noticed the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.430 
that it's very enjoyable has noticed the
development<00:03:56.030> in<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.209> physics<00:03:56.540> that

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
development in the physics that

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.800 
development in the physics that
certainly<00:03:57.889> moved<00:03:58.220> on<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.639> he's<00:03:58.699> a<00:03:59.359> lot<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.660> fun

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
certainly moved on and he's a lot of fun

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.229 
certainly moved on and he's a lot of fun
to<00:03:59.930> drive<00:04:00.139> so<00:04:00.949> there's<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.370> lot<00:04:01.609> in<00:04:01.669> that<00:04:01.849> you

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
to drive so there's a lot in that you

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.210 
to drive so there's a lot in that you
can<00:04:02.480> do<00:04:02.599> in<00:04:02.720> discovering<00:04:03.139> speed<00:04:03.560> from<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:03.889> car

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
can do in discovering speed from the car

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.439 
can do in discovering speed from the car
and<00:04:04.989> finding<00:04:05.989> lap<00:04:06.169> time<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:07.220> certainly<00:04:07.910> the

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
and finding lap time so certainly the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:09.849 
and finding lap time so certainly the
feedback<00:04:08.900> from<00:04:09.049> people<00:04:09.199> playing<00:04:09.590> gran

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
feedback from people playing gran

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.789 
feedback from people playing gran
turismo<00:04:10.220> 6<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.639> very<00:04:11.030> good<00:04:11.329> and<00:04:11.540> again<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.470> look

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
turismo 6 is very good and again I look

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.530 
turismo 6 is very good and again I look
forward<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.099> a<00:04:13.190> hands-on<00:04:13.639> later<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.329> year

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
forward to a hands-on later in the year

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.750 
forward to a hands-on later in the year
to<00:04:15.199> see<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:15.650> know<00:04:15.739> how<00:04:15.859> it<00:04:15.949> works<00:04:16.190> how<00:04:16.459> some<00:04:16.729> of

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
to see you know how it works how some of

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.250 
to see you know how it works how some of
the<00:04:16.849> braking<00:04:17.299> works<00:04:17.539> or<00:04:17.720> some<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.049> cars

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
the braking works or some of the cars

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.020 
the braking works or some of the cars
and<00:04:18.500> everything<00:04:18.560> else<00:04:18.979> on<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.519> issues<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:19.789> had

and everything else on the issues I had
before<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.419> just<00:04:20.660> wasn't<00:04:20.900> feeling<00:04:21.019> some<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:21.709> the

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
before I just wasn't feeling some of the

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.110 
before I just wasn't feeling some of the
cars<00:04:22.010> very<00:04:22.280> well

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120
