they're<00:01:19.049> called<00:01:19.229> gondolas<00:01:19.619> maybe<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.610> it's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
they're called gondolas maybe but it's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.700 
they're called gondolas maybe but it's
really<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.330> useful<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:22.500> kind

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
really not that useful and you're kind

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.320 
really not that useful and you're kind
of<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> sitting<00:01:23.070> duck<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
of a sitting duck when you do that so I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
of a sitting duck when you do that so I
would<00:01:25.049> advise<00:01:25.290> against<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.189> come

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
would advise against that now as we come

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.740 
would advise against that now as we come
around<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.850> we're<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> side<00:01:27.630> of

looks absolutely amazing it looks so
much<00:01:30.990> better<00:01:31.530> than<00:01:31.740> summit<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.189> amazing

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
technology but yeah you can check out

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
technology but yeah you can check out
back<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> flank<00:01:38.280> back<00:01:38.520> around<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
back here you can flank back around to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.660 
back here you can flank back around to
the<00:01:39.180> seaside<00:01:39.659> spawn<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.250> over<00:01:41.520> to

the seaside spawn and and then over to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.980 
the seaside spawn and and then over to
our<00:01:41.790> left<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> snow<00:01:42.750> clad

our left is going to be the snow clad

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.270 
our left is going to be the snow clad
area<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.710> sure<00:01:43.860> there's<00:01:44.040> gonna<00:01:44.130> be

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
area which I'm sure there's gonna be

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.620 
area which I'm sure there's gonna be
hard<00:01:44.490> points<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.939> things<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
hard points and things in you know that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.850 
hard points and things in you know that
was<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.780> really<00:01:45.990> popular<00:01:46.140> building<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.799> the

was a really popular building and the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
was a really popular building and the
summit<00:01:47.189> map<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.579> then<00:01:47.970> over<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.720> is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
summit map and then over right here is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.230 
summit map and then over right here is
where<00:01:49.079> sea<00:01:49.290> domination<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.880> yeah<00:01:51.030> that's

where sea domination is and yeah that's
pretty<00:01:51.420> much<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.659> whole<00:01:52.020> tour<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> Matt<00:01:52.770> now

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
pretty much a whole tour of the Matt now

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
pretty much a whole tour of the Matt now
there<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> few<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.850> things<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.390> want

barrels and you can see over into the
8th<00:02:04.920> side<00:02:05.189> spawn<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.969> other<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.360> right

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
8th side spawn the other one is right

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.839 
8th side spawn the other one is right
here<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.110> hop<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.530> onto<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.429> upper

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
here you can hop up onto this this upper

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.669 
here you can hop up onto this this upper
balcony<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.390> also<00:02:09.810> another<00:02:10.080> way<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.530> do

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
balcony but also another way you can do

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.750 
balcony but also another way you can do
that<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.950> they<00:02:11.099> come<00:02:11.220> over<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.580> heat

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that as they come over here to heat

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.440 
that as they come over here to heat
these<00:02:11.879> bear

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
these bear

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.630 
these bear
jump<00:02:12.960> up<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.260> crouch<00:02:13.560> at<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.860> same<00:02:14.070> time<00:02:14.370> and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
jump up and crouch at the same time and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.520 
jump up and crouch at the same time and
then<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.330> jump<00:02:15.540> across<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.290> top

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
then you can jump across and get up top

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.350 
then you can jump across and get up top
and<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:17.100> also<00:02:17.340> there's<00:02:17.670> another<00:02:17.940> way<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.210> get

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and then also there's another way to get

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.520 
and then also there's another way to get
up<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:18.630> from<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> middle<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.200> map<00:02:19.320> which

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
up here from the middle of the map which

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.020 
up here from the middle of the map which
is<00:02:19.560> very<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.220> useful<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:20.910> just

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
is very very useful and it's just

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.430 
is very very useful and it's just
climbing<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.420> top<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.690> these<00:02:21.750> computers<00:02:22.230> so

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
climbing on top of these computers so

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.560 
climbing on top of these computers so
make<00:02:23.100> sure<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.370> use<00:02:23.520> all<00:02:23.730> three<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.030> those<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
make sure you use all three of those and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.630 
make sure you use all three of those and
then<00:02:24.930> find<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.350> last<00:02:25.800> jump<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.220> spot<00:02:26.400> I've<00:02:26.520> got

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
then find the last jump in spot I've got

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.590 
then find the last jump in spot I've got
for<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.790> guys<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> middle<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.480> map

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
for you guys in the middle of the map

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.570 
for you guys in the middle of the map
that<00:02:27.630> it's<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.500> not<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.740> useful<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:29.520> you

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
that it's really not that useful but you

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.980 
that it's really not that useful but you
might<00:02:29.850> want<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.090> use<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.330> sometime<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.840> game

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
might want to use it sometime in game

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.540 
might want to use it sometime in game
you<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.290> jump<00:02:31.530> up<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> scaffolding<00:02:32.400> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
you can jump up to the scaffolding and
