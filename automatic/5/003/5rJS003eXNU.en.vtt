cooked spaghetti squash and you get nice
long<00:01:01.289> pieces<00:01:01.770> these<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> little

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
long pieces these will be a little

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
long pieces these will be a little
shorter<00:01:02.910> pieces<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.040> not

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
shorter pieces because this is not

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
shorter pieces because this is not
cooked<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.600> start<00:01:06.750> scraping

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
cooked so then you just start scraping

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.590 
cooked so then you just start scraping
it<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.180> now<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> could<00:01:09.570> use

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it out just like that now you could use

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.899 
it out just like that now you could use
a<00:01:09.780> mandolin<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.799> did<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.610> cut<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
a mandolin like I did and just cut it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.740 
a mandolin like I did and just cut it
into<00:01:12.030> large<00:01:12.810> slices<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.060> use<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.270> julienne

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
into large slices and use your julienne

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.679 
into large slices and use your julienne
blade<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> thin<00:01:17.369> setting<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.540> it

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
blade on a thin setting and then it

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.300 
blade on a thin setting and then it
comes<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.220> very

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
comes out just like this and it's very

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.719 
comes out just like this and it's very
easy<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.470> mandolin<00:01:23.040> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
easy to do when you have a mandolin so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.249 
easy to do when you have a mandolin so
once<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> nice<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.659> grater<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.170> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you can use the dry ones if you're going

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.880 
you can use the dry ones if you're going
to<00:02:06.360> use<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> dried<00:02:06.869> ones<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:07.649> not

to use the dried ones that are not

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.710 
to use the dried ones that are not
packed<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.550> want<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.850> rehydrate<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
packed you want to rehydrate them in

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.290 
packed you want to rehydrate them in
some<00:02:09.869> warm<00:02:10.080> water<00:02:10.289> first<00:02:10.800> I'm<00:02:11.489> using<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
some warm water first I'm using the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.880 
some warm water first I'm using the
olive<00:02:12.450> oil<00:02:12.720> ones<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.680> they

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
olive oil ones because I like they

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.559 
olive oil ones because I like they
they're<00:02:14.160> also<00:02:14.489> have<00:02:14.670> flavored<00:02:15.180> with<00:02:15.300> rosemary

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
they're also have flavored with rosemary

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.400 
they're also have flavored with rosemary
so<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.170> adds<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.470> lot<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:17.010> good<00:02:17.610> flavor<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
so it adds a lot of good flavor to the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.770 
so it adds a lot of good flavor to the
sauce<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.300> don't<00:02:21.450> need<00:02:21.569> much

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
sauce and you really don't need much

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.210 
sauce and you really don't need much
additional<00:02:22.050> olive<00:02:22.530> oil<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.100> already
