as you can see it's all semi-transparent
little<00:01:44.490> gradient<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.350> just

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
little gradient on it and we can just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.660 
little gradient on it and we can just
put<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> battery<00:01:46.950> straight<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> back

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
put the battery straight in the back

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.580 
put the battery straight in the back
there<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.630> SIM<00:01:48.930> card<00:01:48.960> first

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
there we just have a SIM card first

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.580 
there we just have a SIM card first
though<00:01:49.920> we'll<00:01:50.820> stick<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.540> stuff<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.350> here

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
though we'll stick that stuff in here

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.139 
though we'll stick that stuff in here
sort<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> spring-loaded<00:01:53.490> thing<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.030> this

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
sort of a spring-loaded thing on this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.200 
sort of a spring-loaded thing on this
one<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:55.229> clip<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.820> then

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
one so you clip it in like that and then

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.200 
one so you clip it in like that and then
we<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.509> shove<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> battery<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.969> once<00:01:59.969> we

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
we can shove the battery on in once we

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.380 
we can shove the battery on in once we
pop<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> back<00:02:01.020> cover<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:02.030> able<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
pop the back cover on able to see that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.819 
pop the back cover on able to see that
we<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.570> still<00:02:03.719> see<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> battery<00:02:04.469> through<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
we can still see the battery through the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
we can still see the battery through the
back<00:02:04.979> cover<00:02:05.450> until<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:06.659> slide<00:02:06.930> in

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

back cover until we actually slide in
from<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> keypad<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.979> sort<00:02:08.160> of

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
from the keypad and then it sort of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.720 
from the keypad and then it sort of
hides<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.970> bit<00:02:09.209> I've<00:02:09.989> also<00:02:10.200> got<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.800> micro<00:02:11.430> SD

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
hides a bit I've also got a micro SD
