00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.740
 Welcome to Biotechnologie TV, the news magazine of 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.629
 Biotechnology de what were the main scientific 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.179
 Discovery of the year 2008 was the subject of the journal Science Gedanken 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.940
 Made and a top ten best work created in seventh place 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.140
 Team from Heidelberg the development biologists are really 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.560
 succeeded in spectacular shots 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.319
 still thousands of zebrafish are unsorted in the Prius 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.169
 as if on a secret command they begin to wander form Zennstrom and 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.429
 condense 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.030
 the Heidelberg researchers around Philipp Keller succeeded for the first time one 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.160
 to shoot three-dimensional movie from the first 24 hours of a zebra's table 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.380
 the photographs captivatingly show a miracle of the genesis of life 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.590
 Incidentally, in the first place of the top ten, it will once also be a biological 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.550
 Topic the conversion of body cells in stem cells to therapeutic ones 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.310
 purposes 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.160
 All scientists are boring space and definitely not cool 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.250
 Journalist Jon wanted to disprove this prejudice and started for 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.720
 the home in the magazine an unusual competition 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.850
 our triggers 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.150
 Albrecht Peltzer 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880
 a polonaise 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.369
 dpa what can Franz so 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.780
 These artists have one thing in common they are in their true lives 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.950
 scientist 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.300
 they followed the call of the passenger train became work 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.119
 For example, the role of 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.470
 Kelly was convinced 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.380
 "We are sure to be a big deal 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.190
 in it's name again says Blue that's due to the dye account for years 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.150
 Bastian Knop a scientist from Wolfsburg has joined in his 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.870
 thesis 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.790
 By the time he was 10 years old he had found out that there was one 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.780
 has positive effect on the human immune system 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.340
 now he wants to try with the blogger dye no drugs against 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.650
 To develop inflammatory diseases 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.510
 2008 was the year of mathematics the science year 2009 is under the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.790
 Motto research expedition Germany this will be a 300 meter long train 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.710
 rebuilt 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.800
 How will science change our lives over the next few years? 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.850
 this question seeks to answer an interactive exhibition the spaces 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.020
 but are not in a building but in a train with twelve 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.109
 Themed wagons 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.809
 one of them deals with biotechnology 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.169
 The exhibition is run by the Federal Ministry of Education and 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.239
 Research organized together with the max-planck-Gesellschaft 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.309
 the Leitzkauer Parkinson break brain cells 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.220
 no problem they could be replaced stem cells 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.640
 that at least some clinics promise on their internet sites and 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.649
 thus aroused hopes that can not be fulfilled 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.569
 The theory sounds promising stem cells can be almost all cells 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.689
 to be bred as we were in the Cretaceous of the past edition 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.830
 have learned 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.090
 novel therapies for previously incurable diseases appear 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.410
 The hopes for patients, for example, are great 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.720
 Parkinson's suffer with amazing healing NVA have since 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720
 Some clinics on the internet for their stem cell therapies 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.879
 Canadian researchers have analyzed and warned about these offers in a study 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.599
 Normally the treatments Norman does not pose risks on the internet 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.530
 is pointed out 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.280
 The animals are also extremely expensive, but especially the use of such 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.670
 Treatments have not been proven because research on stem cell therapy is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.869
 not mature yet 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:15.009
 our category Cretaceous explains terms from biotechnology today in 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.009
 the Cretaceous the Bernina GÃ¼nter Frenz 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.689
 he was a lecturer for us scientists a revolution 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:22.510
 to know about it 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.510
 the information 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:28.649
 Albert can and must be elected 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.649
 in a messenger substance the so-called NRK 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:33.829
 be transmitted 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.919
 with the help of mRNA if then 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.219
 the ice formed 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.369
 what the actual work in the cell is 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.469
 to find out what makes protein as a possibility 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.599
 Turning off this protein used to be quite expensive 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.419
 for it so destroyed 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.459
 leave the plant but then just fell possibilities of the hand 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.879
 by giving her the Air Maroc 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.090
 For that, we have to smuggle a path to a cell 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.089
 again at the appropriate Nr after finished 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.359
 and this Mr is then destroyed 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.519
 this process if the appointed changes 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.890
 he also had a very easy option with the help of the appointed France 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.360
 the excursion to the billing and find out 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 which alone was that 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.670
 the Wars again to look intendant feet and I have to go again
