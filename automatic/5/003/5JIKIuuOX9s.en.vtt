00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.850 
or lightheadedness or the valve might
get<00:02:06.939> even<00:02:07.179> tighter<00:02:07.569> with<00:02:07.929> time<00:02:08.140> such<00:02:08.560> that

get even tighter with time such that

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.919 
get even tighter with time such that
your<00:02:09.459> physicians<00:02:10.060> become<00:02:10.539> even<00:02:10.899> more

your physicians become even more

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.979 
I would say that it's very important to
have<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.489> discussion<00:02:18.700> with<00:02:19.450> your<00:02:19.599> doctors

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
have that discussion with your doctors

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.960 
have that discussion with your doctors
and<00:02:20.319> if<00:02:20.440> you've<00:02:20.560> not<00:02:20.709> seen<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.040> specialist<00:02:21.849> in

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
and if you've not seen a specialist in

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.390 
and if you've not seen a specialist in
this<00:02:22.120> condition<00:02:22.569> cardiologist<00:02:23.560> who<00:02:23.709> sees

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
this condition cardiologist who sees

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.330 
this condition cardiologist who sees
lots<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.849> patients<00:02:25.390> with<00:02:25.540> aortic<00:02:25.900> stenosis

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
lots of patients with aortic stenosis

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.349 
lots of patients with aortic stenosis
that<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.430> probably<00:02:27.640> should<00:02:27.880> do<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.180> and

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
that you probably should do that and

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.050 
that you probably should do that and
really<00:02:28.690> get<00:02:28.780> get<00:02:29.170> more<00:02:29.380> input<00:02:29.829> as<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.700> what

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
really get get more input as to what

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.000 
really get get more input as to what
your<00:02:31.269> next<00:02:31.510> steps<00:02:31.780> might<00:02:32.019> be<00:02:32.260> because<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.680> do

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
your next steps might be because you do

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.960 
your next steps might be because you do
have<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.720> high<00:02:34.720> likelihood<00:02:35.280> requiring<00:02:36.280> surgery

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
have a high likelihood requiring surgery

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.360 
have a high likelihood requiring surgery
and<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:38.230> want<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.829> hands<00:02:39.130> of

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
and you want to be in the hands of

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.690 
and you want to be in the hands of
people<00:02:39.910> who<00:02:40.359> know<00:02:40.720> exactly<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.590> right<00:02:42.340> thing

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
people who know exactly the right thing

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.000 
people who know exactly the right thing
to<00:02:42.880> do<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:44.079> you<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.319> need<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.590> retreat<00:02:44.980> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
to do and if you do need to retreat the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.949 
to do and if you do need to retreat the
right<00:02:45.280> surgeon<00:02:45.609> is<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.970> send<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:46.359> to<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.840> that

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
right surgeon is to send you to so that

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.680 
right surgeon is to send you to so that
you<00:02:47.049> can<00:02:47.200> have<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> surgery<00:02:47.829> performed<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:49.540> a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
you can have the surgery performed in a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.660 
you can have the surgery performed in a
center<00:02:50.170> where<00:02:50.380> there's<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.680> very<00:02:50.950> low<00:02:51.100> risk<00:02:51.340> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
center where there's a very low risk and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.620 
center where there's a very low risk and
a<00:02:52.389> very<00:02:52.600> good<00:02:52.810> outcome<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:53.889> in<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.600> center<00:02:55.600> that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
a very good outcome so in a center that

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.500 
a very good outcome so in a center that
performs<00:02:56.440> lots<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:57.150> aortic<00:02:58.150> valve

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
performs lots of aortic valve

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.620 
performs lots of aortic valve
replacement<00:02:58.660> surgery<00:02:59.549> your<00:03:00.549> risk<00:03:00.880> should<00:03:01.480> be

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
replacement surgery your risk should be

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.990 
replacement surgery your risk should be
quite<00:03:01.989> low<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.829> a<00:03:02.859> very<00:03:03.190> good<00:03:03.400> long-term

outcome

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.350 
outcome
but<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.500> important<00:03:06.430> point<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:07.030> have<00:03:07.210> that

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
but the important point is to have that

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.180 
but the important point is to have that
discussion<00:03:07.810> with<00:03:08.020> your<00:03:08.350> petitions<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.070> make

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
discussion with your petitions and make

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.620 
discussion with your petitions and make
sure<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.520> you're<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.850> right<00:03:09.970> safety<00:03:10.300> net

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
sure that you're in the right safety net

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.810 
sure that you're in the right safety net
to<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.530> done<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:12.250> other<00:03:12.400> thing<00:03:12.670> I'd

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
to have this done the other thing I'd

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.840 
to have this done the other thing I'd
point<00:03:13.300> out<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:14.010> should<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.100> develop<00:03:15.310> any

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
point out is that should you develop any

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.120 
point out is that should you develop any
symptoms<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.600> with<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.170> degree<00:03:17.380> of<00:03:17.620> aortic

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
symptoms and with this degree of aortic

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.360 
symptoms and with this degree of aortic
stenosis<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.850> chances<00:03:19.330> are<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.650> might

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
stenosis the chances are that you might

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.880 
stenosis the chances are that you might
develop<00:03:21.760> symptoms<00:03:22.510> over<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.230> course<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.770> the

develop symptoms over the course of the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.250 
develop symptoms over the course of the
next<00:03:24.070> several<00:03:24.670> years<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.840> don't<00:03:26.050> want<00:03:26.200> to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
next several years you don't want to

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.390 
next several years you don't want to
ignore<00:03:26.320> them<00:03:26.710> it's<00:03:27.580> quite<00:03:28.000> safe<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.660> wait

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
ignore them it's quite safe to wait

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.220 
ignore them it's quite safe to wait
until<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.520> have<00:03:30.760> symptoms<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:31.510> as<00:03:31.900> soon<00:03:32.080> as

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
until you have symptoms but as soon as

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.230 
until you have symptoms but as soon as
you<00:03:32.320> do<00:03:32.470> have<00:03:32.680> symptoms<00:03:32.980> it's<00:03:33.340> no<00:03:33.520> longer<00:03:33.790> so

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
you do have symptoms it's no longer so

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.150 
you do have symptoms it's no longer so
safe<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.810> that's<00:03:34.930> when<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.260> want<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.040> have

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
safe and that's when you want to have

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.500 
safe and that's when you want to have
the<00:03:36.280> surgery<00:03:36.430> done<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.060> some<00:03:37.240> cases

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
the surgery done and in some cases

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.440 
the surgery done and in some cases
because<00:03:38.080> of<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.320> high<00:03:38.470> likelihood<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:39.450> this

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
because of the high likelihood that this

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.620 
because of the high likelihood that this
may<00:03:40.750> happen<00:03:40.990> in<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.710> short<00:03:42.010> term<00:03:42.340> many<00:03:43.300> times

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
may happen in the short term many times

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.810 
may happen in the short term many times
so<00:03:44.020> we<00:03:44.200> recommend<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.830> early<00:03:45.070> surgery<00:03:45.520> where

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
so we recommend the early surgery where

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.520 
so we recommend the early surgery where
the<00:03:45.910> valve<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.360> this<00:03:46.510> tight<00:03:46.780> just<00:03:47.170> because

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
the valve is this tight just because

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.360 
the valve is this tight just because
it's<00:03:47.710> so<00:03:49.350> predictable<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.920> it's<00:03:51.070> going<00:03:51.250> to

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
it's so predictable that it's going to

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.460 
it's so predictable that it's going to
happen<00:03:51.790> at<00:03:52.390> some<00:03:52.420> point<00:03:52.630> in<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.140> near<00:03:53.290> future

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
happen at some point in the near future

happen at some point in the near future
be<00:03:54.310> certain<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.880> measurements<00:03:55.300> are

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
be certain that the measurements are

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.240 
be certain that the measurements are
accurate<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:56.080> may<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.530> may<00:03:56.560> require<00:03:56.800> some

accurate you may that may require some

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.580 
accurate you may that may require some
other<00:03:57.460> tests<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:57.940> validate<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.870> current

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
other tests to validate the current

other tests to validate the current
information<00:03:59.770> you<00:04:00.190> haven't<00:04:00.640> confirmed<00:04:01.180> that

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
information you haven't confirmed that

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.230 
information you haven't confirmed that
the<00:04:02.260> valve<00:04:02.470> is<00:04:02.740> indeed<00:04:03.250> as<00:04:03.520> tight<00:04:03.820> as<00:04:04.060> it

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
the valve is indeed as tight as it

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.710 
the valve is indeed as tight as it
appears<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.630> be<00:04:04.800> but<00:04:05.800> then<00:04:06.400> this<00:04:06.670> has<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.210> very
