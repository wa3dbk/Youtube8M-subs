 johannes here from news.de and in june 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.969
 In 2013, msi introduced the mgs 70 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:19.150
 was a 17.3 inch gaming notebook with 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.400
 Aluminum case very thin enough power 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.920
 to play and really nice 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.990
 design but 17,3 inches are just not so 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.930
 portable and therefore was next to the 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.449
 loud we want a 15 inch 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.690
 device that also offers this design 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.960
 bit smaller and msr reacts 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.190
 and presented the ng s60 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.120
 and here we see otherwise only 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.440
 take a closer look 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.659

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.690
 is a resolution of 2,880 1620 pixels 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:58.620
 that's definitely a lot 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.120
 ips panel had viewing angle stability 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.629
 and there are different models here 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.879
