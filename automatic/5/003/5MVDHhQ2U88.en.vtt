 autocad file 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.970
 solidworks 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.990
 come on let's touch this car tasting 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.380

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.340
 where they have their drawings saved in 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.640
 this case I my drawings I have them 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.989
 saved on the disk then we're going to 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.720
 open them where you have them 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.250
 saved 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:44.080

 autocad 2012 13 11 points is that already 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.940
 We are up to 14 but good to say 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.850

 in autocad 2013 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.280
 I've tried to do this thing 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.769
 transfer files with 2013 and I do not 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.050
 it works then I that's why I get off 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.470
 I save it as a 2007 file 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.130
 I will go here to open trans forgiveness but 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.990
 now like 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.729
 after saving as 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.130
 and I'm going to give you down here where it says 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:21.180
 files of type and place that keep it 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 how to save as autocad 2007 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 coach 2007 is going to be called the same 92 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.280
 of and where will I keep it in my 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.350
 documents 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.350
 with the same name we said save 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.560
 to this is saved I'm going to minimize the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.040
 the autocad and william solid word 2013 I'm going 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.220
 to go file die me open 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.830
 and open documents and I will give in 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.670
 plane in two fingers the plane that we just 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.400
 to do the double click and what here puts me 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.110
 create a new drawing of the solid words 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.940
 I do not want to create a new drawing 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.980
 convert solidworks entities 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.720
 look at this is better option to import to 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.510
 a new 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.160
 import to import a new piece how 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.990
 look at the best option to import 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.190
 a new piece as sketch 2d we give it 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.230
 following 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.120
 and they notice here the first thing we see 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.260
 is the units in which units we are going to 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.860
 pass these drawings 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.050
 we can pass it to millimeters 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.870
 what is it that I am working on in 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.650
 solidworks of work in millimeters but 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.760
 we can also pass it to inches according to 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.760
 according to you see what they work 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.170
 and then add restrictions not 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.920
 import quotas are chosen if I am going to 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.350
 import quotas 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.230
 all fees that I have are lit 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.480
 now I give next and they are fixed 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.110
 next can I work more points 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.360
 close that one thousandth then yes it is a 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.020
 so that in the option or not move him to 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.750
 this 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.750
 and it 's all we just have to finalize 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.660
 and if he chooses he tells me he passed my drawing of 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.050
 of autocad solidworks and chooses 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.550
 you need my sketches and everything to say 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.190
 this part because I do not need it anymore 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.260
 you can erase what you do not 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.270
 that do not need 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.270
 that would not be a problem anymore 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.620
 by saying this I can also erase it 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.810
 your drawing is ready this video what 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.150
 this drawing then comes and is for me 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.480
 next video that is the one of the cup 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.620
 coffee 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.569

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.790
