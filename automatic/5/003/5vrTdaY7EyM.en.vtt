00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.990 
take much effort whatsoever
now<00:02:07.619> each<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> cause<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.879> something

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
now each of the cause is something

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.780 
now each of the cause is something
different<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:10.229> claw<00:02:10.500> opens<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.280> reveal<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
different this claw opens up to reveal a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.000 
different this claw opens up to reveal a
blaster<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:13.230> claw

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
blaster this claw

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.160 
blaster this claw
opens<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.060> reveal<00:02:17.390> stabby<00:02:18.390> things<00:02:18.540> yeah

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
opens up to reveal stabby things yeah

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.699 
opens up to reveal stabby things yeah
that'll<00:02:19.560> work

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
that'll work

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.800 
that'll work
stabbing<00:02:20.310> things<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.410> there<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:22.560> go<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:24.599> teal

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
stabbing things and there we go the teal

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.770 
stabbing things and there we go the teal
is<00:02:24.840> obviously<00:02:25.650> much<00:02:26.190> more<00:02:26.610> work<00:02:27.239> than<00:02:27.510> sorry

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
is obviously much more work than sorry

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.990 
is obviously much more work than sorry
turquoise<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.530> obviously<00:02:29.310> much<00:02:29.760> more

no he kind of looks pretty cool but I
can't<00:03:49.620> recommend<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:50.160> figure<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:51.109> it's

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
can't recommend the figure it just it's

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.629 
can't recommend the figure it just it's
only<00:03:52.560> okay<00:03:53.600> it's<00:03:54.600> not<00:03:54.900> great<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:56.040> does<00:03:56.370> have

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
only okay it's not great it does have

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.180 
only okay it's not great it does have
some<00:03:56.670> poseability<00:03:57.299> problems<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.799> crab<00:03:59.040> mode

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
some poseability problems the crab mode

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.069 
some poseability problems the crab mode
is<00:03:59.340> cool<00:03:59.549> but<00:03:59.849> there's<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.299> lot<00:04:00.599> of<00:04:00.630> robot

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
is cool but there's a lot of robot

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:08.089 
is cool but there's a lot of robot
kibble<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.599> it's<00:04:04.849> the<00:04:05.849> figure<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:07.099> okay

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
kibble and it's the figure is just okay

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.789 
kibble and it's the figure is just okay
there<00:04:08.700> are<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.910> lot<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.299> better<00:04:09.930> figures<00:04:10.530> out

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
there are a lot of better figures out

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.089 
there are a lot of better figures out
there<00:04:11.069> but<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.780> need<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.079> crab<00:04:13.440> figure<00:04:13.859> and

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
there but if you need a crab figure and

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.819 
there but if you need a crab figure and
it's<00:04:14.250> got<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.579> be<00:04:14.669> base<00:04:14.849> of<00:04:15.090> class<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:16.709> know

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
it's got to be base of class you know

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.099 
it's got to be base of class you know
where<00:04:17.010> it'll<00:04:17.099> go<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:18.060> think<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.750> know<00:04:18.870> where<00:04:19.049> to

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
where it'll go I think you know where to

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.260 
where it'll go I think you know where to
go
