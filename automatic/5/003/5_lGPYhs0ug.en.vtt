00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.240 

okay<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.090> now<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.690> battles<00:02:15.080> on<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:16.099> can

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
okay so now that the battles on we can

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.069 
okay so now that the battles on we can
actually<00:02:16.400> switch<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.209> thing<00:02:17.420> on<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.959> can

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
actually switch this thing on so you can

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.650 
actually switch this thing on so you can
see<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.560> kind<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.040> gives<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.459> really<00:02:22.910> nice<00:02:23.180> soft

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
see it kind of gives a really nice soft

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.559
