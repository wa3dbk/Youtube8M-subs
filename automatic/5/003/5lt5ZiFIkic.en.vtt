00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
thing when you're using a sponge is that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390 
thing when you're using a sponge is that

always remember to press blended so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.929 
always remember to press blended so
after<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> foundation<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.310> next<00:01:26.549> step<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
after the foundation the next step is to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.910 
after the foundation the next step is to
use<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.330> powder<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.900> I've<00:01:28.080> got<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> super-state

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
use a powder so I've got a super-state

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.580 
use a powder so I've got a super-state
24-hour<00:01:29.640> waterproof<00:01:30.330> powder<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:31.229> gonna<00:01:31.439> use

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
24-hour waterproof powder I'm gonna use

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.990 
24-hour waterproof powder I'm gonna use
the<00:01:31.680> brush<00:01:31.890> make<00:01:32.340> sure<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.640> brush<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.970> clean

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the brush make sure the brush is clean

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.539 
the brush make sure the brush is clean
and<00:01:33.509> fluffy<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.320> we're<00:01:34.830> just<00:01:34.920> gonna<00:01:35.070> dusted

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
and fluffy and we're just gonna dusted

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.149 
and fluffy and we're just gonna dusted
on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> t-zone<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:37.320> locks<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
on the t-zone so this really locks in

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.580 
on the t-zone so this really locks in
the<00:01:38.520> foundation<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.049> stays<00:01:40.259> for

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
the foundation so that it stays for

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.319 
the foundation so that it stays for
so<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.220> great<00:01:42.399> thing<00:01:42.430> about<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.909> superstay

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
so the great thing about the superstay

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.179 
so the great thing about the superstay
range<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:43.869> that<00:01:44.049> it's<00:01:44.200> heat<00:01:44.409> proof<00:01:44.649> it's<00:01:44.950> sweat

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
range is that it's heat proof it's sweat

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.859 
range is that it's heat proof it's sweat
resistant<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.790> it's<00:01:45.939> fade-proof<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:46.810> you

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
resistant and it's fade-proof so you

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.600 
resistant and it's fade-proof so you
could<00:01:47.020> take<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.200> play<00:01:47.409> from<00:01:47.470> here<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.460> New<00:01:48.579> York

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
could take a play from here to New York

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.740 
could take a play from here to New York
and<00:01:48.970> see<00:01:49.240> look<00:01:49.420> like<00:01:49.540> this<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.570> go
