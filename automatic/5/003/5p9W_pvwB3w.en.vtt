00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:26.960
 I was not making videos with my voice is 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.380
 because I didn't like it and the microphone did 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.680
 he also felt bad so I left 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.480
 I was doing without voices directly 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.010
 putting a background music 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.650
 but now seeing that the microphone is 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.960
 feels good I decided to start 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.880

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.550
