welcome to my channel I dusted off the
mat<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.160> 2010<00:00:06.020> because<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.170> was<00:00:07.319> under<00:00:07.560> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
mat in 2010 because I was under the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.259 
mat in 2010 because I was under the
impression<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.490> patch<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.700> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.179> be

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269

there was a new roster update that was

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.980 
there was a new roster update that was
available<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:18.000> topic<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.570> video<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
available but the topic of this video is

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.290 
available but the topic of this video is
going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:20.810> pro<00:00:21.810> tech<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:23.010> hypo<00:00:23.730> Tech<00:00:24.029> is

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
going to be a pro tech or hypo Tech is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.099 
going to be a pro tech or hypo Tech is
more<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:25.230> doing<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.800> harm<00:00:26.099> than<00:00:26.670> good<00:00:27.109> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
more it's doing more harm than good and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.929 
more it's doing more harm than good and
I<00:00:28.230> believe<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.769> animation<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> step

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I believe that the animation was a step

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
I believe that the animation was a step
in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.150> right<00:00:30.330> direction<00:00:30.890> however<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.099> was

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
in the right direction however it was

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.240 
in the right direction however it was
released<00:00:32.940> too<00:00:33.390> early<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.380> here's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
released too early as you can see here's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.270 
released too early as you can see here's
the<00:00:35.340> rams<00:00:35.610> against<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.149> Saints<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> Rams

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
the rams against the Saints on the Rams

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.889 
the rams against the Saints on the Rams

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
going to come across the middle and I'm

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
going to come across the middle and I'm
gonna<00:00:42.840> throw<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> pass<00:00:43.890> now<00:00:44.399> here<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
gonna throw the pass now here is a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.200 
gonna throw the pass now here is a
perfect<00:00:45.539> example<00:00:45.600> why<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.860> harm

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
perfect example why that's more harm

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.080 
perfect example why that's more harm
than<00:00:48.210> good<00:00:49.550> sharper<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.940> make

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
than good sharper is going to make

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.680 
than good sharper is going to make
contact<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.930> me<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.850> what<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.210> happens

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
contact with me and what it what happens

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
contact with me and what it what happens
is<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.850> he<00:00:56.850> stops<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.510> momentum<00:00:58.190> as<00:00:59.190> soon<00:00:59.340> as

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
is this he stops my momentum as soon as

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490 
is this he stops my momentum as soon as
it<00:00:59.579> makes<00:00:59.760> contact<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.690> believe<00:01:01.230> that

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it makes contact with me I believe that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
it makes contact with me I believe that
there<00:01:01.680> should<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.980> restrictions<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
there should be restrictions on this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.380 
there should be restrictions on this
protec<00:01:03.960> animation<00:01:04.650> set<00:01:04.890> has<00:01:05.129> speed<00:01:06.060> just

green 69 gangman tackles so they

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.590 
green 69 gangman tackles so they
immediately<00:02:46.350> releases<00:02:47.280> animation<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.300> it's

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
immediately releases animation but it's

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.330 
immediately releases animation but it's
doing<00:02:48.840> more<00:02:49.080> harm<00:02:49.260> than<00:02:49.530> good<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.160> right

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340
