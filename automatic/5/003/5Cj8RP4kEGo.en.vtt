but three if one is to the head this
plays<00:00:26.580> very<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> SKS<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> m4

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
1/7 from battlefield 3 I liked those

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.709 
1/7 from battlefield 3 I liked those
guns<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.650> console<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.219> not<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.820> much<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.180> PC

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
guns on console but not so much on PC

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.660 
guns on console but not so much on PC
because<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.200> need<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> make<00:00:34.500> rapid<00:00:35.130> follow-up

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
because you need to make rapid follow-up

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
because you need to make rapid follow-up
shots<00:00:35.910> due<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> number<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.840> shots<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.170> kill

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
shots due to the number of shots to kill

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
shots due to the number of shots to kill
and<00:00:37.680> rapidly<00:00:38.250> clicking<00:00:38.489> while<00:00:38.850> aiming<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and rapidly clicking while aiming is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.119 
and rapidly clicking while aiming is
harder<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> mouse<00:00:40.530> than<00:00:40.770> pulling<00:00:41.010> the

harder to do on a mouse than pulling the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.590 
harder to do on a mouse than pulling the
trigger<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> moving<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> thumbstick<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.540> a

trigger and moving the thumbstick on a
controller<00:00:43.170> you'll<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> iron

of follow-up shots you need means you

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.689

need to shoot quickly or lose your
target<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:57.420> give<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> more<00:00:57.840> recoil<00:00:58.260> and

it's<00:00:58.739> hard<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> scope<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> settle<00:01:00.030> I

it's hard for the scope to settle I

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's hard for the scope to settle I
think<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.899> gun<00:01:01.050> will<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.320> much<00:01:01.530> better<00:01:01.710> if

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
think this gun will be much better if

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
think this gun will be much better if
you<00:01:02.190> unlock<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.789> red<00:01:03.090> dot<00:01:03.270> sight<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> hollow

you unlock a red dot sight or a hollow

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.990 
you unlock a red dot sight or a hollow
sight<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> primary<00:01:05.250> sight<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> have
