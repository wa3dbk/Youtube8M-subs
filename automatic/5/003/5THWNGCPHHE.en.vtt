00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.300
 angelica imagination 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.400
 because her mother ignores her and her relationship with her father is shallow 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.380
 actually carlitos died long ago with his mother so Carlos is a 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.920
 bunch of nerves

 but angelic did not notice the difference between him and his creations 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.820
 he did not follow his orders and in an attack of despair and anger 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.930
