 cloning and what I love and fishing line 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.369
 35 liter artisans therefore one size 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:30.880
 quite small reality for a three 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.290
 days, however, depending on the equipment 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.150
 we carry with us we are enough 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.100
 minimalists can be worn without 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.080
 problems we see immediately of the outside of 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:44.740
 these areas we can not say about 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:48.090
 front side we have transit that there 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.340
 allows access to an internal pocket 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.510
 so deep we can not insert 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.300
 everything 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.580

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.039
 front pocket also view for 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.200
 the peace attack here before we have of 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.890
 loops that allow us to attack 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.640
 pockets or concepts we go to see the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.939
 lower part of his backpack we can 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.679
 see here we have straps there 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.280
 they really were about sticking a slip 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.229
 system 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.560
 we also have wolf in the lower part 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.409
 this backpack is a particularity this 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.409
 frasca carries a knife 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.420
 knife holder brought the mussels hello a 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.850

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.530
 curtains inside this pocket 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:01.479
 we also have a handle for 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.840
 the emergency extraction we have outside 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.719
 drainage on the lower part seen 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.200
 backpack we allow ourselves despite lozano 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.769
 is use resistent to drain water 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.629
 eventually in the train has inside the 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:21.129
 side area this area is covered 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.750
 completely the springs and we have 25 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.290
 size certainly year of 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:31.930
 flatten the volume of our jarno 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:36.209
 on the other hand we have soft money and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.410
 the other two size teams 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.430
 we can note on the top of the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.769
 our zamani we have loops there 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.510
 will allow you to attack go projects 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:53.139
 even carbines we could block here we have 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.680
 another wolf giving us access to the opening 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:59.440
 on zero this adventure there 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.660
 will allow our assets to pass 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.069
 and the antennas or the tour of ours 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.169
 santa dilatation usually speech 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.169
 we have that other part 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.880
 actually the specific port for the 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.390
 our detection bag is placed 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.120
 centrally they are 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.000
 this flight that will allow us to enter 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.210
 in the part that now the back of the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.910
 our deckchair is very padded by a 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.660
 system called three dlc will not work on 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.520
 assist which consists of a cover in 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.230
 backrest mesh and a good thickness 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.470
 so as to circulate the air in a way 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.470
 optimal 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.940
 we have on our shoulder straps 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.210
 adjustments that will allow us to 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.260
 adjust the processing a buy falls it 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.260
 backpack on our shoulders 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.310
 we have dealing on the central part 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.820
 with which we can attach objects to do 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.630
 pass our nation studies 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.950
 lower down 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.670
 we have our chest strap e 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:18.180
 adjustable in height 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.180
 thanks to this sliding system 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.800
 obviously to secure the shoulder straps 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.830
 even better on the bottom 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.930
 we also have a belt 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.970
 thick padded that will allow us to 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.950
 not only unload the weight of the backpack 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.950
 on the shoulders but also on our hips 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.190
 here we can see we have in a big 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:44.980
 very large in which to secure ours 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.980
 belt and the ability to adjust the 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.230
 we can see is very well padded and 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.300
 also springs on the facade that there 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.000
 will allow you to attack the break e 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.670
 take space up to 43 m or molly 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.460
 let's go now to see the inside of the 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:12.800
 ours use the first tank we will go 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:18.440
 to find this superior than with 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.980
 this is basically not the space 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.560
 an internal organism has the possibility 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:29.750
 to have a small hook for ours 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:36.550
 keys a pocket for documents and 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:38.680
 another pocket secured by a meter 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.630
 we can see by the presence of sight 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.630
 very large pockets 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:56.580
 we can see design from the huge one 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:06:01.990
 pienza the front does not have 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:04.930
 organizer the inside instead of the bathtub 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.170
 deep that allows us to fit the 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:12.310
 our faction bag and a network in 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:17.590
 mesh will allow you to organize the 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:20.410
 content masking pointing and the 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.860
 we can practically open case for 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.780
 the whole defense we also have one 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.150
 very resistant handle on the part 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.720
 high will allow us to carry 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.360
 again apologize to this physical
