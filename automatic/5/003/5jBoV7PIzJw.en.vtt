at<00:02:00.810> 165<00:02:01.439> again<00:02:01.829> because<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.780> made<00:02:03.780> weight<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
at 165 again because I made weight so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200 
at 165 again because I made weight so
much<00:02:04.770> last<00:02:05.009> time<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.250> made<00:02:05.520> weight<00:02:05.640> by<00:02:05.790> seven

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
much last time I made weight by seven

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.479 
much last time I made weight by seven
pounds<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:07.950> hurt<00:02:08.340> my

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
pounds and I think they actually hurt my

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.100 
pounds and I think they actually hurt my
