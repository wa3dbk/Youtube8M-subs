 the 400 grams of sugar 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.290
 it's better if we use a saucepan 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.290
 Non-stick 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.110
 a teaspoon of baking 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.260
 baking soda will help us the 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.540
 Milk is not cut and it's also going to 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.320
 serve to give it the dark color of

 It is important to use a wooden spoon 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.479
 and let's bring to a boil and once 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.150
 that is boiling we are going to put to fire 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.810
 slow 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.370

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.800
 let's see what will go slowly 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.020
 changing color in this case as is 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.170
 a sweet pastry milk will stay 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.610
 of a darker color and a 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.610
 firmer consistency 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.730
 to know when to remove from 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.730
 fire the dulce de leche 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.280

 pan and when you can see the bottom 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.800
 is that the dulce de leche is ready 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.020

 let cool
