footprint a little bit looking at
alternatives<00:01:08.670> I've<00:01:08.760> been<00:01:08.880> using<00:01:09.030> bamboo<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
alternatives I've been using bamboo and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.810 
alternatives I've been using bamboo and
I<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.770> man-made<00:01:11.130> alternatives<00:01:11.729> like

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
I think some man-made alternatives like

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.910 
I think some man-made alternatives like
rich<00:01:12.270> lights<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.869> using<00:01:13.110> carbon<00:01:13.409> fiber<00:01:13.439> where

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
rich lights and using carbon fiber where

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.600 
rich lights and using carbon fiber where
I<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:15.380> mix<00:01:16.380> four<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.799> interesting

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
I can mix four just interesting

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.310 
I can mix four just interesting
challenges<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.299> think<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.600> also<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
challenges but I think it's also you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.300 
challenges but I think it's also you
know<00:01:19.380> trying<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.040> bit<00:01:20.159> more

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
know trying to be a little bit more

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
know trying to be a little bit more
proactive<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.030> forward-thinking<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.840> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
proactive and forward-thinking and in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.800 
proactive and forward-thinking and in
terms<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.220> doing<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.540> far<00:01:24.689> I've

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
terms of what I'm doing but so far I've

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.149 
terms of what I'm doing but so far I've
been<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.200> very<00:01:25.380> pleased<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
been very very pleased with it it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.149 
been very very pleased with it it
machines<00:01:26.990> machines<00:01:27.990> quite<00:01:28.409> well<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.920> it's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
machines machines quite well it's it's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.859 
machines machines quite well it's it's
extremely<00:01:29.400> hard<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.060> way<00:01:30.420> harder<00:01:30.840> than

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
extremely hard it's way harder than

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.649 
extremely hard it's way harder than
ebony<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.060> tough<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
ebony so it's it's really tough on the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.870 
ebony so it's it's really tough on the
tools<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> run<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> CNC<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.670> very

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
tools I have to run the CNC very very

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.109 
tools I have to run the CNC very very
slowly<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:37.220> good<00:01:38.220> results<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:38.909> break

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
slowly to get good results and not break

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.710 
slowly to get good results and not break
too<00:01:39.270> many<00:01:39.299> bits<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:42.030> does<00:01:42.270> sand

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
too many bits but it does sand

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
too many bits but it does sand
beautifully<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> takes<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.070> fantastic

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
beautifully and it takes up a fantastic

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.899 
beautifully and it takes up a fantastic
polish<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.700> light<00:01:47.880> reflecting

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
polish you can see the light reflecting

polish you can see the light reflecting
off<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> might<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.930> sort<00:01:49.259> of

conditions<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:51.659> anyway<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
conditions but anyway this is the this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.789 
conditions but anyway this is the this
is<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> new<00:01:54.329> decibel<00:01:54.869> sort<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> signature

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
is the new decibel sort of signature

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.190 
is the new decibel sort of signature
inlay<00:01:56.310> pattern<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:57.390> holding<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:58.110> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
inlay pattern I'm holding it kind of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.100 
inlay pattern I'm holding it kind of
upside<00:01:58.469> down<00:01:58.619> right<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.930> way<00:02:00.930> this

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
upside down right now this is way this

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440 
upside down right now this is way this
is<00:02:01.170> done<00:02:01.469> right<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.820> running<00:02:03.090> along<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is done right now it's running along the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.359 
is done right now it's running along the
treble<00:02:04.110> side<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> fretboard<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.219> it's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
treble side of the fretboard so it's

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
treble side of the fretboard so it's
kind<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.640> at<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> bottom<00:02:06.030> edge

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
kind of at the bottom edge

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320 
kind of at the bottom edge
which<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.680> kind<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.009> unique<00:02:08.340> different

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
which is just kind of a unique different

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.140 
which is just kind of a unique different
thing<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.110> personally<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:10.950> use<00:02:11.009> face<00:02:11.880> dots

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
thing I I personally don't use face dots

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.020 
thing I I personally don't use face dots
all<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.450> much<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:14.430> no<00:02:14.610> problem<00:02:14.940> with

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
all that much I have no problem with

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.300 
all that much I have no problem with
using<00:02:15.300> blank<00:02:15.540> fretboards<00:02:16.140> but<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.130> lot

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
using blank fretboards but I know a lot

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.100 
using blank fretboards but I know a lot
of<00:02:17.340> people<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.120> face<00:02:18.540> dots<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.990> they<00:02:19.050> do

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
of people do like face dots and they do

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.410 
of people do like face dots and they do
rely<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.500> them<00:02:19.770> if<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:20.640> that's<00:02:20.910> become<00:02:21.240> what

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
rely on them if if that's become what

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.770 
rely on them if if that's become what
they've<00:02:21.600> grown<00:02:22.500> used<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:24.120> these<00:02:24.570> can<00:02:24.720> be

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
they've grown used to but these can be

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.030 
they've grown used to but these can be
done<00:02:24.930> along<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.320> base<00:02:25.470> side<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.890> fret

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
done along the base side of the fret

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.560 
done along the base side of the fret
board<00:02:26.100> as<00:02:26.370> well<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:27.240> basically<00:02:27.450> just

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
board as well and it's basically just

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.930 
board as well and it's basically just
it's<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.709> oval<00:02:28.980> from<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> decibel<00:02:29.670> logo

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
it's like the oval from the decibel logo

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.370 
it's like the oval from the decibel logo
which<00:02:30.090> i<00:02:30.180> think<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.420> kind<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.630> cool<00:02:30.690> it's<00:02:31.320> a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
which i think is kind of cool it's a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.990 
which i think is kind of cool it's a
little<00:02:31.560> different<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.520> one<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.850> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
little different but one of the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.210 
little different but one of the
challenges<00:02:33.360> with<00:02:34.080> doing<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:35.130> know

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
challenges with doing that is you know

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.770 
challenges with doing that is you know
one<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.910> products<00:02:36.240> I've<00:02:36.360> really<00:02:36.630> fallen

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
one of the products I've really fallen

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.010 
one of the products I've really fallen
in<00:02:36.959> love<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.470> lumen<00:02:37.860> lei<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.870> they<00:02:39.870> make

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
in love with is lumen lei and they make

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.080 
in love with is lumen lei and they make
it<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.260> rods<00:02:40.470> they<00:02:40.709> do<00:02:40.770> make<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.610> solid

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
it in rods they do make it in a solid

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.720 
it in rods they do make it in a solid
sheet<00:02:42.300> now<00:02:42.510> as<00:02:42.750> well<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.200> small<00:02:43.650> form<00:02:44.340> factors

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
sheet now as well in small form factors

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.170 
sheet now as well in small form factors
that<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.060> cut<00:02:45.239> out<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.510> use<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:45.780> inlay

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
that you can cut out and use as inlay

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.540 
that you can cut out and use as inlay
but<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.360> wanted<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.630> try<00:02:48.870> something

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
but I wanted to try something

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.310 
but I wanted to try something
interesting<00:02:50.550> trying<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.209> synthesize<00:02:51.750> my<00:02:52.170> own

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
interesting trying to synthesize my own

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.860 
interesting trying to synthesize my own
liquid<00:02:52.709> version<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.970> inlay<00:02:54.750> it

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
liquid version of that so I can inlay it

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.780 
liquid version of that so I can inlay it
into<00:02:55.110> more<00:02:55.230> complex<00:02:55.709> shapes<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.640> some

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
into more complex shapes and do some

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.750 
into more complex shapes and do some
interesting<00:02:56.910> things<00:02:57.239> with<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:59.100> there<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
interesting things with it so there is a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.660 
interesting things with it so there is a
you<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.120> lumen<00:03:00.750> lei<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.989> made<00:03:01.170> from<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.670> new

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
you know lumen lei is made from a new

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.900 
you know lumen lei is made from a new
generation<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:03.390> glow-in-the-dark<00:03:04.200> materials

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
generation of glow-in-the-dark materials

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.860 
generation of glow-in-the-dark materials
it's<00:03:05.910> way<00:03:06.270> better<00:03:06.570> than<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
it's way better than the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.360 
it's way better than the
glow-in-the-dark<00:03:07.110> stuff<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:07.830> grew<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.070> with

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
glow-in-the-dark stuff we grew up with

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.580 
glow-in-the-dark stuff we grew up with
and<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> stuff<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:10.020> know<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.230> glows

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
and the stuff is you know it glows

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.490 
and the stuff is you know it glows
incredibly<00:03:11.220> brightly<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.850> grows<00:03:12.750> glows<00:03:13.320> for

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
incredibly brightly and grows glows for

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.130 
incredibly brightly and grows glows for
an<00:03:13.590> incredibly<00:03:13.890> long<00:03:13.980> time<00:03:14.489> as<00:03:14.700> well<00:03:15.140> it's

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
an incredibly long time as well it's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.190 
an incredibly long time as well it's
very<00:03:16.170> easy<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.650> work<00:03:16.830> with<00:03:18.019> provided<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.170> are

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
very easy to work with provided you are

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.570 
very easy to work with provided you are
using<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.890> know<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> good<00:03:20.190> quality<00:03:20.519> resin<00:03:20.940> and

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
using you know a good quality resin and

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.800 
using you know a good quality resin and
not<00:03:23.580> afraid<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.910> experiment<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.420> little<00:03:24.480> bit<00:03:24.630> to

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
not afraid to experiment a little bit to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.390 
not afraid to experiment a little bit to
get<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.989> mix<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.290> right<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.070> this<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.280> my

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
get the mix just right so this is my

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.520 
get the mix just right so this is my
first<00:03:26.670> attempt<00:03:27.209> but<00:03:27.360> as<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.959> can<00:03:28.080> see<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
first attempt but as you can see the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.350 
first attempt but as you can see the
inlays<00:03:28.769> are<00:03:28.890> black<00:03:29.190> or<00:03:29.790> they<00:03:29.910> appear<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.239> be

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
inlays are black or they appear to be

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.840 
inlays are black or they appear to be
black<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.890> I'll<00:03:32.010> explain<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.400> little<00:03:32.459> bit<00:03:32.640> more

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
black and I'll explain a little bit more

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.110 
black and I'll explain a little bit more
about<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:34.140> we<00:03:34.200> go<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:35.010> if<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.850> move<00:03:35.970> it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
about that as we go on but if I move it

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.640 
about that as we go on but if I move it
into<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:37.519> dark<00:03:38.519> here<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:40.080> I'll<00:03:40.290> turn<00:03:40.470> off<00:03:40.620> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
into the dark here and I'll turn off the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.080 
into the dark here and I'll turn off the
light<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:44.010> as<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.519> see<00:03:44.760> they<00:03:45.060> are<00:03:45.090> doing

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
light and as you can see they are doing

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.430 
light and as you can see they are doing
that's<00:03:48.090> why<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.269> had<00:03:48.480> them<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.290> odd

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
that's why I had them in the odd

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.740 
that's why I had them in the odd
lighting<00:03:49.860> conditions<00:03:50.310> now<00:03:50.610> my<00:03:50.910> iPhone<00:03:51.420> camera

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
lighting conditions now my iPhone camera

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.199 
lighting conditions now my iPhone camera
is<00:03:51.989> not<00:03:52.170> picking<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.530> up<00:03:52.590> very<00:03:52.890> well<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
is not picking that up very well the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.120 
is not picking that up very well the
iPhone<00:03:54.510> 4<00:03:54.810> really<00:03:55.049> sucks<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.829> low-light

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
iPhone 4 really sucks for low-light

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:05.460 
iPhone 4 really sucks for low-light
performance

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.300 

so<00:04:06.040> yeah<00:04:06.250> not<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:08.350> appears<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.010> little<00:04:09.160> bit

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
so yeah not it appears a little bit

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.460 
so yeah not it appears a little bit
brighter<00:04:09.520> than<00:04:09.670> that<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:10.180> real<00:04:10.450> life<00:04:10.660> but<00:04:10.930> it's

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
brighter than that in real life but it's

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.130 
brighter than that in real life but it's
not<00:04:11.710> quite<00:04:11.890> as<00:04:12.100> bright<00:04:12.310> as<00:04:12.430> lumen<00:04:12.730> Ling<00:04:13.140> but

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
not quite as bright as lumen Ling but

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.210 
not quite as bright as lumen Ling but
this<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.530> my<00:04:14.680> first<00:04:14.920> experiment<00:04:15.190> with<00:04:15.490> it<00:04:17.220> but

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
this is my first experiment with it but

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.020 
this is my first experiment with it but
what<00:04:18.430> I've<00:04:18.549> done

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
what I've done

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.090 
what I've done
hey<00:04:19.720> there's<00:04:19.930> me<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.230> dream<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.709> knew<00:04:23.100> what

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
hey there's me in the dream I knew what

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.840 
hey there's me in the dream I knew what
I've<00:04:24.190> done<00:04:24.340> is<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.700> started<00:04:25.120> off<00:04:25.240> by<00:04:26.850> cutting

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
I've done is I started off by cutting

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.220 
I've done is I started off by cutting
channels<00:04:28.300> for<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.540> inlay<00:04:28.810> in<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.020> fretboard

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
channels for the inlay in the fretboard

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.520 
channels for the inlay in the fretboard
and<00:04:29.880> then<00:04:30.880> those<00:04:31.060> are<00:04:31.090> filled<00:04:31.540> with<00:04:31.720> black

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
and then those are filled with black

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.820 
and then those are filled with black
resin<00:04:34.170> wait<00:04:35.170> 24<00:04:35.650> hours<00:04:35.680> for<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.690> cure<00:04:38.050> go

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
resin wait 24 hours for that to cure go

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.330 
resin wait 24 hours for that to cure go
back<00:04:39.010> run<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.490> again<00:04:39.850> on<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.540> CNC<00:04:41.050> and<00:04:41.290> cut<00:04:42.190> a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
back run it again on the CNC and cut a

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.450 
back run it again on the CNC and cut a
smaller<00:04:42.820> channel<00:04:43.590> within<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.950> so<00:04:45.430> I

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
smaller channel within that so I

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.860 
smaller channel within that so I
actually<00:04:45.640> have<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> boat<00:04:46.120> 1/2<00:04:46.480> millimeter

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
actually have a boat 1/2 millimeter

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.040 
actually have a boat 1/2 millimeter
black<00:04:47.290> border<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.630> then<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.810> has

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
black border and then that has

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.470 
black border and then that has
subsequently<00:04:50.560> filled<00:04:50.890> again<00:04:51.340> with<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.300> glow

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
subsequently filled again with the glow

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.210 
subsequently filled again with the glow
in<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.690> dark<00:04:52.870> material<00:04:52.900> now<00:04:53.860> this<00:04:53.980> is<00:04:54.100> my

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
in the dark material now this is my

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.780 
in the dark material now this is my
first<00:04:54.460> experiment<00:04:54.820> with<00:04:55.150> mixing<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:56.790> globe

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
first experiment with mixing the globe

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.180 
first experiment with mixing the globe
powder<00:04:58.120> with<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.690> resin<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.230> I<00:04:59.920> went<00:05:00.100> a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
powder with the resin and I went a

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.650 
powder with the resin and I went a
little<00:05:00.220> light<00:05:00.790> on<00:05:00.820> the<00:05:01.060> powder<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.390> little

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
little light on the powder a little

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.430 
little light on the powder a little
heavy<00:05:01.840> on<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.020> resin<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:02.650> it's<00:05:03.610> not<00:05:03.910> as<00:05:04.440> dense

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
heavy on the resin so it's not as dense

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.040 
heavy on the resin so it's not as dense
or<00:05:05.740> intense<00:05:06.160> as<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:06.460> could<00:05:06.730> be<00:05:06.880> but<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:07.870> is<00:05:07.960> my

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
or intense as it could be but this is my

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.380 
or intense as it could be but this is my
first<00:05:08.260> experiment<00:05:08.640> but<00:05:09.640> that's<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.090> 12th

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
first experiment but that's the 12th

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:18.560 
first experiment but that's the 12th
fret<00:05:10.540> inlay<00:05:14.460> just<00:05:15.460> make<00:05:15.730> it<00:05:15.850> at<00:05:15.940> glowing<00:05:16.300> there

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:27.020 

and<00:05:19.570> use<00:05:19.780> my<00:05:21.240> blue<00:05:22.240> LED<00:05:22.750> glow<00:05:23.080> charger<00:05:23.590> that<00:05:23.950> I

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.830 

got<00:05:28.030> from<00:05:28.320> lumen<00:05:29.320> Lane<00:05:30.480> so<00:05:31.480> these<00:05:31.660> things

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
got from lumen Lane so these things

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.680 
got from lumen Lane so these things
charge<00:05:32.200> with<00:05:34.260> ultraviolet<00:05:35.260> light<00:05:35.669> so

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
charge with ultraviolet light so

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.140 
charge with ultraviolet light so
fluorescent<00:05:37.690> lamps<00:05:37.990> are<00:05:38.110> really<00:05:38.320> good<00:05:38.500> if<00:05:38.710> you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
fluorescent lamps are really good if you

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.880 
fluorescent lamps are really good if you
have<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.180> blacklight<00:05:40.780> positioned<00:05:41.560> over<00:05:41.650> your

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
have a blacklight positioned over your

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.760 
have a blacklight positioned over your
guitar<00:05:42.160> rack<00:05:42.850> or<00:05:43.120> your<00:05:43.210> guitar<00:05:43.480> stand<00:05:43.840> that's

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
guitar rack or your guitar stand that's

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.010 
guitar rack or your guitar stand that's
the<00:05:44.890> probably<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.460> best<00:05:45.730> way<00:05:45.910> to<00:05:45.940> do<00:05:46.180> it<00:05:46.330> or

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
the probably the best way to do it or

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.010 
the probably the best way to do it or
you<00:05:47.560> can<00:05:47.680> do<00:05:47.770> it<00:05:47.800> sort<00:05:48.370> of<00:05:48.430> dot<00:05:48.820> by<00:05:49.000> dot<00:05:49.240> with<00:05:49.990> a

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
you can do it sort of dot by dot with a

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.940 
you can do it sort of dot by dot with a
little<00:05:51.120> blue<00:05:52.120> or<00:05:52.419> ultraviolet<00:05:53.110> LED

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
little blue or ultraviolet LED

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.120 
little blue or ultraviolet LED
flashlight<00:05:54.460> like<00:05:54.610> I'm<00:05:54.730> doing<00:05:54.970> here<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.919> about

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
flashlight like I'm doing here and about

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.210 
flashlight like I'm doing here and about
10<00:05:57.430> 15<00:05:57.669> seconds<00:05:58.300> per<00:05:58.450> dot<00:05:58.780> but<00:05:59.680> you<00:05:59.980> know<00:06:00.070> the

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
10 15 seconds per dot but you know the

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.460 
10 15 seconds per dot but you know the
initial<00:06:00.880> intensity<00:06:01.330> does<00:06:01.510> drop<00:06:01.990> off<00:06:02.200> quite

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
initial intensity does drop off quite

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.840 
initial intensity does drop off quite
quickly<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:03.040> then<00:06:03.160> it'll<00:06:03.310> sort<00:06:03.640> of<00:06:03.730> have<00:06:03.820> a

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
quickly and then it'll sort of have a

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.870 
quickly and then it'll sort of have a
sustained<00:06:04.330> glow<00:06:04.720> for<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.050> number<00:06:05.260> of<00:06:05.350> hours<00:06:05.880> but

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
sustained glow for a number of hours but

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.170
