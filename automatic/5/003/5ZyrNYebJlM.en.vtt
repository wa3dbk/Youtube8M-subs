00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.800
 one of the greatest culinary icons of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.840
 Argentine gastronomy is the dulce de leche 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.429
 one thing has a very unique flavor 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.260
 different from condensed milk with a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.390
 texture and richness and with a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.730
 very different taste depth is 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.789
 that I want to teach are those in favor of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 discuss cheat exactly the opposite is that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.420
 let's start to do is text mÃ¡rcia 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:35.450
 discusses whether it will gather 102 grams of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.500
 sugar wise wipes the juice powder butter 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:48.000
 invitation to butter is at temperature 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:50.510
 environment and 50 grams keeps let's beat 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.680
 in an electric mixer 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.680
 it's normal that it can be a bit off 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:10.320
 Let's now add the cornflour and flour 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:14.380
 of wheat is in 125 grams corn and 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.979
 125 grams of wheat flour a little 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.979
 in the streets 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.390
 I'll add an egg 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.110
 We put the power off we put the rest of the 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.329
 machine 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.340
 the rest of the flour is a process that 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:02:01.369
 some patience and some calm 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:02:04.369
 we announce through the workbench the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.500
 mass is already homogeneous 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.539
 butter mixed with soft with 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.539
 More sugar and with a fringe 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:24.799
 always in the hands and put the mixture 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.829
 again in the center of the table to win some 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.829
 space 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.940
 let's trust with some flour 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.150
 we have the dough done 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.170
 I will cut the dough into two for two to 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.030
 four times two more in the arm and said 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.510
 that the mass takes a day of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.290
 This awareness will cut this deadline by 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.760
 two with the help of a roll of pasta 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.760
 I'll stay in my luggage. 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.230
 here what I want is more or less one 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.220
 wafer with the ghetto of this next with the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.200
 cup 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.760
 with the help of a knife can be a 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.410
 knife a little smaller than this 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.410
 we have our cookie 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.410
 Let's put the eraser on the tray. 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.010
 I told a little was to end on 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.010
 tablet 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.970
 I'll put it here like I'm going to do it. 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.349
 we put the last biscuit and we go 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.510
 bring the biscuits a preheated oven 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.599
 259 very quickly four minutes is the 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.310
 enough with the store is committed 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.590
 In this four minutes I remember. 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.609
 I was in the house and keep this pasta 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.440
 to make more cookies from the team 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.660
 we already have a clean bench and our 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.680
 packages should already be 500 then final 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.100
 of the oven a form we have is or not 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.229
 there are 500's and it's still that obviously 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.229
 let's play on the wafers they try hard 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.509
 ball exchanges 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:45.449
 We take the casualties and let them 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:48.180
 affect each other hot and as soon as they 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:52.169
 be cool let's close with 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.410
 Athletic in 2010 in Uruguay made one to 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.509
 favor with two meters in diameter and 80 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.060
 centimeters high and was considered 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:04.800
 until now the greatest favor in the world has been pro 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.490
 The festival is for us and we are already 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.180
 cold 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.159
 Let's now stuffed with dulce de leche 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.880
 a very easy way to do is to place 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:19.110
 one tablespoon of sweet milk in the 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.430
 center of the rubber with the help of another 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.430
 they find it boring 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.730
 let the dulce de leche extend through the 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.730
 eraser 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:47.449
 Let's raining horses to favors by slow 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:51.050
 with sugar what I can do 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:53.419
 a more classical theater as cookies 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.289
 largest food icon us is 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.130
 milk sweet 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.130
 Hope you like it
