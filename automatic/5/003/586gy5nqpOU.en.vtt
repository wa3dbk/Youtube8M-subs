00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
myself and skip off the converters and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.069 
myself and skip off the converters and
kill<00:00:40.770> myself<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:42.120> no<00:00:42.329> idea<00:00:42.390> why<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.750> did

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that anyway there we go carefully

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.630 
that anyway there we go carefully
avoiding<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> zingers<00:00:51.210> again<00:00:52.610> yeah<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
avoiding the zingers again yeah I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.270 
avoiding the zingers again yeah I
probably<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.809> said<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.289> attack<00:00:56.070> them

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
probably like I said you can attack them

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.569 
probably like I said you can attack them
from<00:00:56.340> certain<00:00:56.760> angles<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> be

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
from certain angles but you have to be

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.950 
from certain angles but you have to be
very<00:00:59.609> careful<00:01:00.210> about<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> timing<00:01:02.960> actually

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
very careful about the timing actually

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.240 
very careful about the timing actually
since<00:01:04.140> there's<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.409> lots<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.739> torrent<00:01:05.070> I'm

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
since there's not lots of torrent I'm

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.760 
since there's not lots of torrent I'm
about<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.640> admit<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.210> might<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.049> well<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.320> go

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
about to admit I might as well just go

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.219 
about to admit I might as well just go

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
i'm using the crystal stars to strike

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.820 
i'm using the crystal stars to strike
him<00:06:43.650> like<00:06:43.830> so<00:06:44.070> and<00:06:45.200> when<00:06:46.200> he<00:06:46.260> takes<00:06:46.470> all<00:06:46.620> three

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
him like so and when he takes all three

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.410 
him like so and when he takes all three
hits<00:06:47.010> that<00:06:47.040> is<00:06:47.130> defeated<00:06:47.640> he<00:06:48.210> goes<00:06:48.450> down<00:06:48.800> and

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
hits that is defeated he goes down and

we grab the crystal banana and there you
go<00:06:55.290> better<00:06:55.770> than<00:06:55.860> yet<00:06:56.070> another<00:06:56.100> boss<00:06:56.610> down<00:06:57.470> and

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080

that is the end of lost island and yeah
another<00:07:05.160> simplistic<00:07:05.610> cutting<00:07:05.940> basically

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
another simplistic cutting basically

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.420 
another simplistic cutting basically
saying<00:07:06.630> yeah<00:07:07.260> we<00:07:07.500> did<00:07:07.740> it<00:07:07.860> it's<00:07:08.070> better<00:07:08.340> that

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
saying yeah we did it it's better that

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.920 
saying yeah we did it it's better that
we<00:07:08.670> keep<00:07:08.850> these<00:07:09.060> out<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:09.360> Kremlin's<00:07:09.750> hands

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930

we keep these out the Kremlin's hands
which<00:07:10.200> is<00:07:10.350> simplistic<00:07:11.160> but<00:07:11.400> man<00:07:11.640> it<00:07:11.850> works

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
which is simplistic but man it works

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.570 
which is simplistic but man it works
