00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
because you really there are so many

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.080 
because you really there are so many
shortcuts<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.919> have<00:04:21.099> learned<00:04:21.549> taught

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
shortcuts that I have learned taught

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.240 
shortcuts that I have learned taught
myself<00:04:22.270> over

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
myself over

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.160 
myself over
years<00:04:23.490> rather<00:04:23.820> than<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.630> know<00:04:24.660> because<00:04:25.050> i

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
years rather than you know because i

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.660 
years rather than you know because i
started<00:04:25.500> doing<00:04:25.620> raw<00:04:25.860> food<00:04:26.130> before<00:04:26.460> there<00:04:26.580> were

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
started doing raw food before there were

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.280 
started doing raw food before there were
any<00:04:26.700> books<00:04:27.060> or<00:04:27.330> anybody<00:04:27.660> out<00:04:27.840> there<00:04:28.050> teaching

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
any books or anybody out there teaching

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.400 
any books or anybody out there teaching
so<00:04:28.800> i<00:04:29.010> learned<00:04:29.460> some<00:04:29.790> ways<00:04:30.570> of<00:04:30.870> doing<00:04:31.200> things

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
so i learned some ways of doing things

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.410 
so i learned some ways of doing things
that<00:04:31.680> aren't<00:04:32.040> really<00:04:32.340> what<00:04:32.730> other<00:04:32.880> people<00:04:33.270> do

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
that aren't really what other people do

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.260 
that aren't really what other people do
and<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.500> teach<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.190> because<00:04:35.580> it's<00:04:35.790> it's

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
and so I teach that because it's it's

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.330 
and so I teach that because it's it's
not<00:04:36.480> only<00:04:36.660> just<00:04:36.870> learning<00:04:37.440> recipes<00:04:38.010> it's

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
not only just learning recipes it's

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.760 
not only just learning recipes it's
learning<00:04:38.970> why<00:04:39.420> do<00:04:39.480> you<00:04:39.750> do<00:04:39.900> this<00:04:40.080> in<00:04:40.350> a<00:04:40.440> recipe

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
learning why do you do this in a recipe

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.010 
learning why do you do this in a recipe
and<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.700> I<00:04:41.730> explain<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.540> that's<00:04:42.690> really

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
and so I explain that and that's really

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.470 
and so I explain that and that's really
important<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.800> know<00:04:43.980> that<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.670> we<00:04:44.730> also<00:04:45.120> teach
