00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 hello everyone then today we will see how 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.980
 do and the so-called Romanian cord or 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.220
 macra but the Romanian in practice this 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.180
 cord that is worked into this 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:34.949
 case I worked with a cotton number 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:38.190
 with a cotton number 8 and see put 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.350
 the hand as I worked with a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:48.350
 cotton number 8 and with a crochet hook 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:50.730
 number 75 here then I did the say 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.469
 in short to make him the nice tutorial 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.149
 done with the usual thick ribbon in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.129
 so that we can see this 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.140
 cordoncino you can you can 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.059
 use precisely as a cord for 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.039
 to close bags, etc. or 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.309
 is practically what is used for 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.110
 show these doilies I have 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.560
 learned to make this cord yes 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.170
 call planet jun lee with the lady 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.349
 this particular English though this 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.030
 scheme 

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:20.310
 I took it from Noah to finish Italian 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 Sicilian which of course not 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.220
 I remember the name I'll write it done vi 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.340
 I leave the link there is some work there 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.679
 wonderful beautiful practically and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.869
 this is done here there is all the 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.670
 But this cord these things that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.709
 see in the middle I am a lure only 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.300
 that I wanted to try it because I have 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.670
 had 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.060
 in short, try to do it but in effect 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.480
 it is not really mine that is not mine 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.790
 we don't say to mine 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.950
 what is best is enough 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.830
 lopsided but let's say that then in the middle 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.150
 above a noble he looks good 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.980
 but I think this is really it 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.310
 the last one I will do I wanted to do 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.440
 just for guy and nothing so for 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.390
 any I recommend if you have any 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.170
 questions please write me one less I don't know 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.200
 if in a comment 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.200
 I will try to answer you and seize you 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.369
 also requests and nothing to 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 next leaves me all year 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:21.250
 let's do our noose here in here 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.990
 this case there is this doing this 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.450
 cord the importance to remember 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.310
 don't work tight because otherwise 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.060
 it becomes difficult then we start 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.520
 let's make two chains then insert 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.790
 the crochet hook in a single noose of the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.010
 of the first chain is the first 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.020
 chain we did and then 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.050
 insert crochet you see not 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.640
 normally as we usually do but 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.580
 from beneath which I love well I call my finger on 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.320
 work we ask well and the second time 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:59.770
 we insert from above and pull out now 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.530
 observing we repeat that we have here 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.360
 in the act we have a bar one 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.630
 bar and we will find it only in the first 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.400
 in the first point we will always find 2 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.290
 we must insert to turn precisely 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.890
 see the work here for a little 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.830
 that is to say to turn after ok insert in a cin 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.870
 and then you do n't sign up 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.290
 on the crochet hook from below and its pull 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.940
 well 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.720
 and the second time I thread on the hook 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.290
 from above you see now instead there are two 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.410
 bars 1 and 2 so you will always find 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.270
 these two bars so we vote for little 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.980
 a little 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.290
 we insert a crochet hook for that you have to 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.840
 work fairly wide Veneto the shot 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.470
 I always tend to do this well 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.150
 because in my way of working 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.810
 I always tend to pull too hard 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.950
 wire 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.980
 so if you are 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.849
 like me you pull too much then 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.250
 you could also try using 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.650
 slightly larger crochet or 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.349
 in any case, you do make a case and 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.019
 try to pull well so don't 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.599
 net from below we pull out 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.280
 we pull well and crochet that is thread from 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:21.250
 under 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:26.240
 ok the other two bars we insert 7 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.660
 thread from below we pull the thread well from 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.660
 over it 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.660
 ok let's turn on this is a trust 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.680
 maybe you do not see very well but we 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.260
 when you work 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.479
 I assure you that you see it well too 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.550
 because the camera does not have a high 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.919
 definition ie the camera the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:52.090
 phone 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.090
 here is here I insert beretta shooting from below 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.680
 and thread from above and pull out 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.680
 see the handcuffs here 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:17.360
 elected with some thread that I love 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.030
 and thread from above and throw out e 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.069
 continue as said is a lot 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.970
 simple 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:29.150
 in the end we say that it can be 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.009
 used for short as a cord 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.710
 simply things don't even turn out like 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.889
 the handle as a decoration in short, like 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.639
 more like in short, as yours says 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.620
 fantasy 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:44.389
 here is one last I do little else 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.409
 they remove by hand I show you then 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:51.110
 I would like to give you another one 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.690
 so let's say a straight if you owe it 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.509
 do a whole lot what you need to do 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.400
 you have to have on hand an a 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.870
 brooch in this case I did not have one 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.870
 brooch very large and therefore took 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.220
 a usual paperclip so that you 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.810
 when you finish 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.430
 if I had to give up if you have to 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.460
 leave the job for a moment longer 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.380
 any reason is simply 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.639
 threaded I advise you to thread a 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.939
 brooch like this 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.039
 you can come back in short, yes you don't 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:22.020
 smashes the nod comes undone work 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:26.550
 see I show you the best of the 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:28.949
 cord made with the smallest thread 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.789
 where one sees very well very average the 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:42.779
 processing 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:44.999
 let's hope I do so very comfortable 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:48.000
 here it is and so this was the 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:51.900
 Romanian cord macramè macramè the 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.120
 Roman as it is called ee nothing e 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.170
 I hope you are fixed and useful 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:03.949
 next 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:03.949
