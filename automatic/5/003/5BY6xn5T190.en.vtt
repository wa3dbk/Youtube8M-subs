00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
so you're going to be doing a three loop

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.850 
so you're going to be doing a three loop
wrap<00:00:08.610> pony<00:00:09.020> so<00:00:10.020> the<00:00:10.110> first<00:00:10.320> thing<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.590> want<00:00:10.799> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
do is take about oh maybe a fourth of

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.589 
do is take about oh maybe a fourth of
your<00:00:17.699> hair<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.289> put<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:20.269> mid<00:00:21.269> to<00:00:21.449> low

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
your hair and put it in a mid to low

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.460 
your hair and put it in a mid to low
ponytail<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.980> back<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.810> then<00:00:24.810> start<00:00:25.289> by

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
ponytail in the back and then start by

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.730 
ponytail in the back and then start by
getting<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.160> bangs<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:30.230> lift<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.499> and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
getting your bangs and lift it up and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.440 
getting your bangs and lift it up and
that<00:00:31.949> part<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> go<00:00:32.790> straight<00:00:33.210> back

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that part is going to go straight back

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:43.160 
that part is going to go straight back
into<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.230> middle<00:00:34.980> or<00:00:35.220> top<00:00:35.789> loop<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> secure

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
into the middle or top loop so secure

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.220 
into the middle or top loop so secure
that<00:00:45.770> into<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> top<00:00:47.129> loop<00:00:48.109> and<00:00:49.280> now<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.340> have

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
that into the top loop and now you have

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.389 
that into the top loop and now you have
hair<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.260> either<00:00:52.620> side<00:00:53.269> left<00:00:54.269> to<00:00:54.510> put<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.399> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
hair on either side left to put in the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.829 
hair on either side left to put in the
pony<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> take<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> hair<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.670> and

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
pony so take the hair on the right and

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.810 
pony so take the hair on the right and
pull<00:01:03.839> it<00:01:03.870> pretty<00:01:04.230> tight<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:07.370> twist<00:01:08.370> it<00:01:08.490> across

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
pull it pretty tight and twist it across

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.130 
pull it pretty tight and twist it across
to<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> left-hand<00:01:09.930> loop<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.780> secure<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
to the left-hand loop and secure it so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.470 
to the left-hand loop and secure it so
you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.220> there's<00:01:14.460> kind<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.970> wrap<00:01:15.180> there

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
you can see there's kind of a wrap there

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:25.820 
you can see there's kind of a wrap there
at<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> top

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.630 

so<00:01:26.490> tighten<00:01:26.970> those<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.540> make<00:01:28.490> make<00:01:29.490> them

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
so tighten those and make make them

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.610 
so tighten those and make make them
secure<00:01:30.170> is<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.440> take<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.960> last<00:01:34.200> part<00:01:34.560> of

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
secure is now you take the last part of

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.640 
secure is now you take the last part of
the<00:01:34.710> hair<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.370> left<00:01:35.580> side<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:40.470> can

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the hair that's on the left side you can

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.590 
the hair that's on the left side you can
pull<00:01:40.830> it<00:01:40.950> tight<00:01:41.190> or<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.940> twist<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.510> I

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
pull it tight or you can twist it I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
pull it tight or you can twist it I
recommend<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.960> kind<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.350> twisting<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
recommend really kind of twisting it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.980 
recommend really kind of twisting it
before<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.820> start<00:01:48.210> wrapping<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.810> i<00:01:48.840> think

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
before you start wrapping it i think

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
before you start wrapping it i think
it's<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.890> gives<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.280> more<00:01:50.940> secure<00:01:51.650> wrap<00:01:52.650> and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
it's it gives a more secure wrap and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.100 
it's it gives a more secure wrap and
then<00:01:53.400> wrap<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.700> around<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.680> other<00:01:55.680> ponies<00:01:57.110> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
then wrap it around the other ponies and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.630 
then wrap it around the other ponies and
you'll<00:01:58.770> secure<00:01:59.220> in<00:01:59.550> the<00:02:00.500> bottom<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:02.010> loop

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you'll secure in the bottom right loop

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.150 
you'll secure in the bottom right loop
and<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.870> idea<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.290> once<00:02:04.590> you're<00:02:04.800> done<00:02:04.950> with

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
and the idea is once you're done with

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.070 
and the idea is once you're done with
that<00:02:05.190> that<00:02:05.580> all<00:02:05.760> you'll<00:02:05.940> see<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.510> hair<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
that that all you'll see is the hair and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.070 
that that all you'll see is the hair and
the<00:02:07.140> knot<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.880> can<00:02:11.880> literally<00:02:12.540> tuck<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the knot and you can literally tuck it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.630 
the knot and you can literally tuck it
all<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.470> way<00:02:13.590> under<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.010> can't<00:02:17.310> see<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.580> at

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
all the way under so you can't see it at

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.550 
all the way under so you can't see it at
all<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.540> video<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.200> see<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
all in this video you can see it a

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.350 
all in this video you can see it a
little<00:02:19.680> bit<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.190> if<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.580> dis<00:02:20.850> tucked<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.300> a

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
little bit that if you dis tucked it a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.430 
little bit that if you dis tucked it a
little<00:02:21.510> bit<00:02:21.720> more<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.990> wouldn't<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.260> able<00:02:22.320> to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
little bit more you wouldn't be able to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.660 
little bit more you wouldn't be able to
see<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.690> there<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.870> have<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.670> wrap

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
see it and there you have it a wrap

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.970 
see it and there you have it a wrap
ponytail<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.709> friend

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
ponytail that you can do with a friend

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.060 
ponytail that you can do with a friend
or<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:29.790> by<00:02:29.940> yourself
