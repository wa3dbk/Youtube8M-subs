00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hello everyone, continue the rubric 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 DIY I will show you such a locker 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.190
 which I did for the bathroom do n't even know 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.710
 how to call that is, he goes 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.650
 so floor to ceiling 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:25.019
 as a locker it is a shelf or simply shelves 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.160
 I do not know how it will be right here 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.060
 it means a closed shelf then three such 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.060
 open shelves 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.340
 still one open regiment no junk 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.620
 everyone removed which consists to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 show and below is another closed shelf 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.960
 Here such here they have a little oblique 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.780
 angles like i did because here's another 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.840
 sides on my wall in the corner too 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.270
 this here is like a box there risers 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.940
 all sorts of cool here it was 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.160
 torsos in a cat so boring wall to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.850
 symmetry also decided to make shelves 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.010
 how justified it turned out here 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.880
 well what are the shelves then 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.880
 there are they made of 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.830
 such furniture panels are sold 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.040
 well you can buy there by announcing in 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 construction market or in such stores 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.799
 I have 6 shelves and not three 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.420
 bills needed them in half sawed then 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.659
 There is not in size they are straight almost like 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.009
 should be as it came 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.640
 respectively, then they sawed in size 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:42.869
 how did this corner sawed and how would 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.579
 show here polished a little corners 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.159
 so boring took rounded here and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.470
 then I painted them with a stain that is 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.350
 such wood stain is on sale now 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.040
 different colors are for processing 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.380
 wood 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.240
 so I picked up the backlight to fit 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:07.200
 the doors here are of that color to see here 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.950
 also a little fit here and I tried 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.860
 know what color to match the knife 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.380
 dedicated turned out well in principle under 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:22.190
 Ali conclusion and then varnished them 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.230
 colorless was also special though 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.620
 doubt about how the varnish is all 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.270
 there will be a bathroom already water humidity well 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.330
 already a year ago 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.270
 even longer I made here that there is no 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.240
 there are no problems with these sticks 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.580
 that is, lacquer is fine there is no lacuna 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.390
 smelly and stain too not him on 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.640
 water based 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.230
 Here under the seats he doubted but everything keeps 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.120
 okay no problem here before 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.300
 painting these boards of course needed 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.150
 sanded properly 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.770
 here are several layers of painting 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.739
 produced gives do there are three layers 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.660
 after each layer it is necessary to grind here 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.090
 This is of course the most dreary part 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.300
 work the rest is all pretty 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.290
 yet simple but still further in construction 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.180
 and here also bought three such slats on 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.980
 construction market they cost something 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.370
 there is 60 rubles in my well here this 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.750
 confluences of such 30 on 30 which is one of them 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.510
 I made the stand here that is from the floor to 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.519
 ceiling and in these slats means here I 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.170
 made grooves 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:42.200
 such you see here sawed out and in them 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.269
 just put in the reason they are not like these 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:50.269
 managers are not screwed in just 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:53.780
 held due to the fact that they 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.750
 just keeps shorter in these poses here 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.269
 leaves the rack I flew to the walls 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.959
 By the way here is not closed water otverstvija 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.730
 Well there about the screw decently here on top 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.750
 each so much screwed to the wall a 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:14.180
 they are also at the bottom holds well, as it's for 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:16.910
 account of what goes well, as if strength 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.269
 at the expense of the shelves and below they just stand 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.269
 on the floor 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.930
 but everything seems to be pretty strong nothing 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.540
 nothing swinging dangles that is 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.190
 here and so keeps well that is 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.020
 with virtually no nail she 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.190
 collected 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:38.270
 here are further painted all white white 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.180
 enamel so i bought enamel for there was 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.390
 written on the bank mother for batteries 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.190
 will not say how for the tree is also suitable 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.750
 Well, look, that is here such 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.670
 problems are these now mobile 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.920
 nets they are hooks without knots then 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.890
 there is a different quality but you bought them 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.980
 were with handles and now you see 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.840
 the paint is already in these places but as it were 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.060
 Here has turned yellow such dark 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.560
 stains 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:08.420
 here's another one and here on these racks too 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.060
 if you look here you see a cut here 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.650
 bitch and here he is too 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.900
 that is, it will be necessary the cables do not know 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.170
 even the most paint over or that this 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.340
 there was such a problem what is connected not 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.870
 I know maybe I should have somehow 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.930
 process before painting yet 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.580
 additionally the devil knows not at all 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.370
 specialist that is, this is generally my first 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.780
 a creation like this furniture 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:36.110
 own department nobody 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.450
 I will not what shepherds will pass so 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.970
 here are such flaws of course turned out well 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.860
 here look if there are experts 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.860
 maybe damn me every day and how 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.550
 it was right to do better here and 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:53.450
 still on the shelf which closes at 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:56.540
 doors so here I did not do such 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.070
 the atrocities of opening that well such 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.350
 the form is not very convenient incomprehensible how 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:05.860
 do made such a sliding door 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.090
 such junk can be folded 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.130
 how to do it sold such 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.130
 special accessories give doors 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.890
 they consist of guides such here 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.010
 there are such corners here 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:25.340
 to make a turn and do it yourself 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.830
 strips well as the door itself is going 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.330
 there are such stripes 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.680
 from here they are connected to each other 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.300
 special with them 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.440
 the special is like that 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.910
 inserted each other and here's socks 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.820
 as if they could bend 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.350
 just stick together with tape behind 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.410
 it turns out a single such canvas and with this 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:54.530
 it is inserted here these guides and 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:58.699
 rides on them pretty conveniently like this 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:02.300
 here's what else to say 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:09.500
 so it means that the rack but on top of this 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:12.979
 here's my closed door again 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.020
 I repeat this here is how my first experience well 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.849
 just not interested in doing this 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.220
 My work is mostly mental 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:21.740
 so Olya wants to make hands answer 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.440
 try to make such a locker 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.639
 it turned out to judge you write comments 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.849
 questions subscribe to the channel that's all 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.849
 until
