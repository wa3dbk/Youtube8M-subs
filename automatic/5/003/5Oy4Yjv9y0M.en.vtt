00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.040
 In 2009 more than 650 motorcyclists died on Germany's roads. That's 16 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.900
 Percent of all fatal traffic accidents 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.250
 these ratings are at 50 km / h since the end of an accident in the intersection area 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.580
 which can provide additional protection for moderate accidents 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.500
 novel motorcycle school system revealed the ADAC has undergone this a test 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.310
 The protective dams were two real proof that there should be tested 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.530
 BÃ¶nen a cruise and drop at 50 kilometers per hour and one 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.760
 Single accident if the driver slips away 200 kilometers per hour 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.420
 as another we have the everyday use of the objects 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 tested 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.030
 and individual loads such as the load on the back or 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.270
 chest 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.970
 the test was two shirts jackets with directly integrated Tadic tubes 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.079
 and the upper body 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.450
 against the Nuggets Testament 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.580
 Reason the High Tech House Openmoko 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.870
 The sector will be set up under the motto of the way 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.780
 the passive with Brigus a latte shot from the engine and sport 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.340
 and he has so far the Cayenne and also protects the neck 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.620
 the remaining time of the stock market price for the full protective effect to the right one 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.270
 Time to unfold 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.510
 is triggered by a ripcord 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.430
 There are serious differences with intelligent sensors 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.660
 would probably bring better results here after a trip 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.610
 without damage, the files are replaced by replacing the cartridge 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.050
 fit for use 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.659
 the XPS 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.950
 it dance Jackwerth 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.700
 unfortunately could not convincing in all criteria the triggering time 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.810
 Langers takes half a second that is just too long in the accident 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.530
 and the protection is not available on time 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.720
 The Mutuel of the coast is, mind you, an addition to the obligatory motorcycle 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.560
 equipment 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.070
 and protects by a wrong way back protector triggered by a 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.140
 ripcord 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.430
 compared to a passive c protector HF with which he has a new one 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.800
 higher protection potential with greater protection 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.630
 also here the air catholic can be exchanged the elite time is 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.580
 okay fast enough the scope is extremely large 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.409
 State railways 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.929
 over the neck 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.359
 and he was good at almost all criteria 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.909
 in almost 100 accidents and deputies the asphalt 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.899
 in another test in Astana about the stupidity you stupid 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.139
 it was dropped at a hundred home of the chestnut 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.149
 Here, in the first line, the mother Edith Jeske was able to convince 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.419
 Boll is awakening the files he has Beck hoses on his back 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.579
 are not a substitute for a toe protector they are an extension 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.019
 and only supporters of the necessarily must be improved 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.069
 a special position is the only way in 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.329
 it solves very fast and precise aligners a radio-controlled sensor 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.870
 the unprotected neck area Peter Schuster is not so bad at that 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:07.879
 Handling killed the compromise between Schulz and comfort he is 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.579
 unfortunately too big 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.939
 Currently, none of the systems is one hundred percent mature they have 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.859
 Weaknesses for example at the trigger times and the sensorics or 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.449
 Restricts the comfort too much 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.729
 Also, the protection in the chest area is still too low 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.359
 The ADAC also calls for full coverage of motorcycles 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.449
 Introduction of SAP leaves a penniless protective equipment is important 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.010
 but be careful but appeal to the drivers 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.840
 Responsible driving is also extremely big 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.300
 security problem
