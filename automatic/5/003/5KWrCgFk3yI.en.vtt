mounted to a flywheel so if we want to
be<00:01:02.619> technical<00:01:02.799> chipping<00:01:03.699> is<00:01:03.879> actually

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
be technical chipping is actually

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.450 
be technical chipping is actually
cutting<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.440> result<00:01:05.830> is<00:01:05.979> wood<00:01:06.220> chip

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
cutting and the result is wood chip
