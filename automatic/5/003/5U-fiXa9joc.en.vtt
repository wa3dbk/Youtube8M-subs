00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
following it and this is just a it's a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.010 
following it and this is just a it's a
real<00:03:14.940> great<00:03:15.390> shortcut<00:03:15.990> for<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:18.020> bypassing

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
real great shortcut for just bypassing

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.540 
real great shortcut for just bypassing
the<00:03:19.110> HTML<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.830> just<00:03:20.040> looking<00:03:20.250> at<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.370> plain

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
the HTML and just looking at the plain

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.100 
the HTML and just looking at the plain
types<00:03:20.760> from<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.940> up<00:03:21.150> from<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.480> website<00:03:21.810> again

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
types from the up from the website again

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.820 
types from the up from the website again
that's<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.800> using<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.490> document<00:03:24.380> dot<00:03:25.380> body

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
that's like using the document dot body

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.030 
that's like using the document dot body
