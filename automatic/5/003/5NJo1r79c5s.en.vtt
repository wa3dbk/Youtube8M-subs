00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
stuff six again gameplay can like Dragon

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
thought it's kind of argue asst though

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.740 
thought it's kind of argue asst though
kind<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.740> repetitive<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.360> quite<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
kind of repetitive and quite a bit of
