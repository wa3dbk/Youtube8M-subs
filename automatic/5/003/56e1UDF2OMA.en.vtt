00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.030 
all right this is you are holy like a a
Prince<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.460> Peace<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.680> this<00:00:07.680> one<00:00:07.859> had<00:00:08.010> the

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
Prince of Peace and this one had the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.680 
Prince of Peace and this one had the
really<00:00:08.429> crazy<00:00:08.700> strong<00:00:09.059> patter<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.540> one

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
really crazy strong patter and this one

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.039 
really crazy strong patter and this one
in<00:00:09.780> particular<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.230> wanted<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.590> show<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
in particular I wanted to show you and

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.480 
in particular I wanted to show you and
okay<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.110> we've<00:00:13.650> gone<00:00:13.769> over<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.070> little<00:00:14.190> bit<00:00:14.370> in

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
okay so we've gone over a little bit in

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.250 
okay so we've gone over a little bit in
practice<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.450> maybe<00:00:15.630> just<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.020> kind<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
practice but maybe just to kind of

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.429 
practice but maybe just to kind of
subdivide<00:00:16.890> things<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:18.029> know<00:00:18.930> maybe<00:00:19.230> I'll<00:00:19.320> make

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
subdivide things I know maybe I'll make

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.929 
subdivide things I know maybe I'll make
it<00:00:19.590> more<00:00:19.710> complicated<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.490> maybe<00:00:20.640> like

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it more complicated for you maybe like

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.310 
it more complicated for you maybe like
it's<00:00:21.090> simpler<00:00:21.449> I'm<00:00:22.140> not<00:00:22.350> sure<00:00:22.560> how<00:00:22.710> much<00:00:22.859> help

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
it's simpler I'm not sure how much help

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.509 
it's simpler I'm not sure how much help
if<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.470> will<00:00:25.590> make<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> easier<00:00:26.010> now<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.369> here

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
if this will make it easier now but here

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.230 
if this will make it easier now but here
too<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:26.789> goes

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
too here goes

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.090 
too here goes
so<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:34.020> mean<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> chords<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:34.950> it's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
so you mean we got the chords on it's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
so you mean we got the chords on it's
really<00:00:35.219> easy<00:00:35.489> GCD<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.600> minor<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
really easy GCD a minor that really is

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.639 
really easy GCD a minor that really is
just<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.290> pesky<00:00:41.030> pattern<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.960> hope<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
just a pesky pattern and the hope is to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.020 
just a pesky pattern and the hope is to
try<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.370> everybody<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> same

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
try and get everybody on the same

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.520 
try and get everybody on the same
pattern<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.899> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.170> reasoning

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
pattern so that's kind of my reasoning

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.340 
pattern so that's kind of my reasoning
for<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:47.629> okay<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.570> tempo<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> going

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
for this okay so the the tempo is going

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:03.979 
for this okay so the the tempo is going
to<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.739> I<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.420> gonna<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.660> about<00:01:03.719> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to be you I so it's gonna be about that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.500 
to be you I so it's gonna be about that
temple<00:01:04.700> we're<00:01:05.700> gonna<00:01:05.790> start<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> little

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
temple we're gonna start just a little

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
temple we're gonna start just a little
bit<00:01:06.630> slower<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.560> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
bit slower just to get that that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.660 
bit slower just to get that that
strumming<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.670> goes<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.740> funny

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.249 

so<00:01:16.670> it's<00:01:16.789> crazy<00:01:17.060> I'm<00:01:17.420> I'm<00:01:18.020> actually

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
so it's crazy I'm I'm actually

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.429 
so it's crazy I'm I'm actually
subdividing<00:01:19.039> in<00:01:19.189> sixteenth<00:01:19.880> notes<00:01:20.439> because

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
subdividing in sixteenth notes because

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.010 
subdividing in sixteenth notes because
it's<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:21.770> crazy<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:23.090> know<00:01:23.119> one<00:01:23.990> E

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
it's so crazy it's it's you know one E

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.419 
it's so crazy it's it's you know one E
and<00:01:24.320> two<00:01:25.130> E<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.950> E<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.069> think<00:01:31.280> what

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
and two E and E and and I think what

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.710 
and two E and E and and I think what
most<00:01:31.579> of<00:01:31.789> us<00:01:31.850> were<00:01:32.000> getting<00:01:32.090> hung<00:01:32.390> up<00:01:32.509> on<00:01:32.659> I

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
most of us were getting hung up on I

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.890 
most of us were getting hung up on I
think<00:01:32.929> we<00:01:33.020> all<00:01:33.170> had<00:01:33.350> them

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.960 

I<00:01:38.930> think<00:01:39.590> we<00:01:39.680> all<00:01:39.800> had<00:01:40.010> that<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:40.460> was<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.850> was

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
I think we all had that it was it was

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.530 
I think we all had that it was it was
the<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:42.200> know<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.760> it's<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:43.880> little<00:01:44.030> ticket

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
the you know the it's a little ticket

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.320 
the you know the it's a little ticket
you<00:01:44.870> know<00:01:44.900> part<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:46.130> where<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.820> it's<00:01:47.180> at

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
you know part and where that is it's at

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:55.350 
you know part and where that is it's at
the<00:01:47.450> very<00:01:47.480> end<00:01:47.930> of<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.350> measure<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.370> in<00:01:49.490> view

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.420 

now<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.420> trick<00:01:56.720> is<00:01:56.750> what<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:59.800> is<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:01.100> start

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
now the trick is what the is to start

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.950 
now the trick is what the is to start
down<00:02:03.490> so<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.850> think<00:02:05.030> it's<00:02:05.300> it's<00:02:05.510> easy<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.840> get

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
down so I think it's it's easy to get

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.740 
down so I think it's it's easy to get
one<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.230> go<00:02:06.380> up<00:02:06.980> down<00:02:07.280> but<00:02:08.149> actually<00:02:08.570> you<00:02:08.630> want

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
one it go up down but actually you want

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.530 
one it go up down but actually you want
to<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.899> down<00:02:09.710> cuz<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.729> sets<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.090> up<00:02:11.150> for<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
to go down cuz it sets you up for the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:29.110 
to go down cuz it sets you up for the
downbeat<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.050> one<00:02:12.250> so

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.900 

and<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.420> three

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.650 

it's<00:02:37.270> not<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> crazy<00:02:37.690> what

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.840 

now<00:02:41.530> if<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.710> can't<00:02:41.920> handle<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.250> did<00:02:42.520> get<00:02:42.700> you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
now if you can't handle it did get you

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:59.740 
now if you can't handle it did get you
no<00:02:42.970> that's<00:02:43.150> okay<00:02:43.390> just<00:02:43.540> do

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.500 

you<00:03:00.530> know<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:00.710> you<00:03:00.800> can<00:03:00.920> do<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.190> as<00:03:01.370> well

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
you know so you can do that as well

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.850 
you know so you can do that as well
whatever<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.720> easiest<00:03:02.990> for<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.740> way

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
whatever it's easiest for you so the way

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.930 
whatever it's easiest for you so the way
that<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.070> would<00:03:04.310> sound<00:03:04.520> if<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.730> want<00:03:04.880> to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
that that would sound if you want to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.970 
that that would sound if you want to
play<00:03:05.090> along<00:03:05.330> with<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:06.110> are<00:03:06.260> holy<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.890> gonna

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
play along with you are holy it's gonna

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:57.320 
play along with you are holy it's gonna
sound<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:07.340> this

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.710 

the<00:03:57.930> only<00:03:58.170> weird<00:03:58.440> part<00:03:58.680> right<00:03:58.800> there

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
the only weird part right there

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.420 
the only weird part right there
so<00:04:01.140> then<00:04:01.290> grew<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.650> under<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.890> course<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.310> goes

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
so then grew it under the course it goes

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:53.400 
so then grew it under the course it goes
and<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.030> was

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.050 

yeah<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:53.920> I<00:04:53.950> string<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.310> little<00:04:54.400> bit<00:04:54.610> because<00:04:54.760> I

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
yeah so I string a little bit because I

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.540 
yeah so I string a little bit because I
have<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.330> really<00:04:55.570> think<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:56.320> do<00:04:57.190> one<00:04:57.430> that's

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
have to really think I do one that's

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.370 
have to really think I do one that's
just<00:04:57.670> it's<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.480> same<00:04:58.690> thing<00:04:58.960> but<00:04:59.140> it's<00:04:59.290> a

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
just it's the same thing but it's a

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.780 
just it's the same thing but it's a
little<00:04:59.590> bit<00:04:59.710> more<00:04:59.830> flowering<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.550> little<00:05:00.700> bit

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
little bit more flowering a little bit

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:21.119 
little bit more flowering a little bit
more<00:05:00.940> added<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.270> it

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.969 

you<00:05:21.939> knew<00:05:22.059> that<00:05:22.209> as<00:05:22.389> well<00:05:22.599> so<00:05:23.559> hopefully<00:05:23.830> that

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
you knew that as well so hopefully that

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.599 
you knew that as well so hopefully that
gives<00:05:24.009> you<00:05:24.189> an<00:05:24.339> idea<00:05:24.399> for<00:05:24.729> that<00:05:25.029> song<00:05:25.300> as<00:05:25.449> well
