00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.010
 friends friends today we are going to make a 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.900
 cake different a sponge cake that 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.820
 example does not carry egg yolk ni 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.150
 butter or oil does it 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.869
 simply with 6 egg whites 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.320
 with 250 grams of sugar with 500 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.029
 milliliters of whipped cream or 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.860
 milk cream as the well-known 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.699
 america and 250 grams of strength flour 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.219
 of being bread and a packet of yeast 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.780
 powder chemistry or baking powder is 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.290
 as you know them in america too 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.790
 well all this I'm going to mount the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.710
 clear to the point of meringue and then I'll go 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.120
 adding that is while key engines 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.770
 I add the sugar 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.360
 then I'm adding the little bit to 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.289
 little to integrate it into one's own 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.440
 Meringue 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.890
 and finally add the flour with the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.870
 yeast 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.550
 Well, all this I'll put in a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.250
 mold in the oven that I will have already 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.430
 heated to 180 degrees with the game of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.689
 upside down 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.159
 we go to the usual thing that you are going to see 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.530
 how do I do it to fast camera so that 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.820
 You see how well it is running 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.140
 and then it's like I'm on a diet not 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.240
 I eat a lot but I'll have to try it 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.399
 although I'm sure it's going to be very 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 I know of someone who is going to get 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.450
 very happy 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.530
 the last step the mold put paper of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.670
 oven to piglia mind the base and the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.100
 side 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.180
 Well, because in this way I do not know 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.420
 hit me down 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.030
 and also preserves a little in the background 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.799
 the mold side coupled with 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.030
 butter when you do not need a place 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.800
 that the paper does not stick 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.750
 and now as you see this preparations of 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.270
 dough 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.470
 It is enough that it is almost like 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.470
 a baringo a mounted goal 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.680
 well simply and she alone is divided and 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.430
 now in the oven 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.819
 let's see how it grows and then follow 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.609
 result worth 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.520
 good and here is the result the 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:22.210
 final result of this cake 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.370
 what have I done like that in a little way 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.610
 inventing or mixing ingredients that 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.350
 they are not very common now you have to 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.060
 try it because to date you can see 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.710
 that is whole and I do not know how it is 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.720
 then I will try it and I will summarize 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.950
 in two words I hope to say super 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.950
 always friends
