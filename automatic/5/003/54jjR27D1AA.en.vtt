 reminders here goes the usual 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.960
 first place if you want to get a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.340
 exemplary since you left you can

 up here and you have until the end of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.219
 May 31 also shortly I do not know when

 Exactly the deadline for the video is over 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.820

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.359
 specific video about the translation like this 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:34.290
 that if you want to ask something about 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:36.090
 the topic is good this month has been a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.309
 bit strange because I received or 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.649
 bought many books and I read very 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 little if it is with mobile control but 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.340
 let's start with the book home and in 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.020
 first place I teach you a son of 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 Alejandro Pigeons Evils is a book at 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.950
 that I was really looking forward to crisis 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 channel to the sea and lleyton took then as 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.090
 two years giving for ass to read 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.410
 Alejandro Paloma, but even though he was telling me 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.940
 read it there was no book that I 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.949
 will call as much as it seems and fuck what 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.469
 I need until I read the synopsis of 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.539
 this one in the synopsis caught me I do not know why 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.940
 what but I knew I had to read it and 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.520
 well I'm going in half 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.640
 enchanting I will talk better about rap at 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.550
 the magic but seriously buy the cute 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.380
 and really wonderful from part of 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.160
 bully did not arrive in langley park 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.570
 rhythm 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.890
 and have a somewhat complicated story 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.630
 with this book because I wanted to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.430
 very much read it I think again 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.440
 thanks to chris before he came out on 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.240
 Spanish that happens to let it pass and 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.610
 When the book arrived in Spanish there was 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 as avalanche of avalanche reviews of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 opinions was all very tiresome and I 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.640
 I got sick of the book and how I did not want to read it 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 nor being fed up with him or with 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.440
 expectations so I decided to wait and do 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.390
 a month and a half since bully did not propose 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.220
 review what I said and hey, look, look at me 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.100
 both hype and boredom have passed 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 so let's read it is read already like this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.820
 I take the opportunity to tell you that I 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.860
 loved it is a little gem I know it has its 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.390
 failings I know that not everyone has 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.160
 liked but to me it has sincerely 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.990
 like the wonder of the book 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.360
 bad is that the translation was rather 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.340
 bad but finally I speak better of him in 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.740
 the reviews and that you have below the link 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.390
 I got a box with books though 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.160
 well I had asked for a few but in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.840
 I finally got a box and in it they were 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.860
 the artist rhythm of the mansion of 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.180
 jackson that is a book that I am 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.690
 wanting to read because I'm very fond of 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.730
 Attention 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.590
 a long time ago but I did not know with 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.360
 which one to start and when they told us about 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.160
 rhythm artist in control is that I 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.890
 I fell in love with what they told us so 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.600
 here I have it I am looking forward to reading it 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.700
 see what I think another book that was 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.530
 wishing to read was the prince the state 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 Dean wright admired please the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.000
 edition like this on the black cover the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.310
 red pages is that it's brutal that is me 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.560
 it seems an incredible edition I am very 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.090
 fan dan rise very very fans and when 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.860
 announcement this novel is that I was dying of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.660
 you want to read it because I was going to go back to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.880
 focus on the character of the state 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.070
 thing that I liked also said that 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.810
 it worked like a kind of novel 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.030
 independent of the chronicles that is 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.920
 that you can read it without having read the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.630
 previous and well I have not read it 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.430
 still but I really want to 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.340
 doing so I'll wait until I have 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.930
 time to enjoy it during the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.090

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.720
 reading a little more adult thing that 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.340

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.110
 and well I will tell you surely in 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.030

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.000
 my friend and I do not know why I did not find 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.770
 his book nowhere and he was a 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.900
 little bit high above me it seemed a little 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.490
 ugly that he would have read a novel 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.870
 mine and I would not have read any 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.270
 his novel be 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.130
 it's fine that's worth it do not do it and well 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.170
 in the end I got fed up with not finding it and what 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.330
 I asked for it online I do not know when I'll read it 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.220

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.960

 I will tell you at some point of the 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.830
 existence of montera leading me to 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.140

 beautiful is not in hard cover but look 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.370

 I'm glad you have the review 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.330

 they decide to publish the last book 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.770
 Well, they've already given me that I've decided 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.540
 to read it in English, I've run out of 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.070
 patience with these people I do not know when I 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.020
 I would read because I really want to 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.940

 for editorials and some reports of 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.300

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.860
 correcting also a novel of mine that 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.129
 I hope you see the light very 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.900
 that is to wish me luck and good in summary 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.699
