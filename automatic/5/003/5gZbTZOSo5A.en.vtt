00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.200
 Hello people Salou 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.200
 Bundesliga z matchday 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.310
 the opening match of this game day is between 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.339
 Bayern Munich and 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.929
 Sc freiburg 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 the top match between Scheike 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.199
 and Bayer Leverkusen 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.179
 now come yourself 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.669
 the opening match between Bayern 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.599
 Freiburg Zurich 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.599
 3 such a SID 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.830
 the next meeting is between 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.500
 Werder Bremen and the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.700
 first FC Nuremberg 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.380
 there I think 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.380
 the Bremer evening with 2xu small 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.800
 The next match is between VfL Wolfsburg and the 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 on picture Stuttgart 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 dot, there have always been home wins in the last six matches 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.770
 but I think that changes now 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.550
 us 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.380
 the Stuttgart win with a two to one lies 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.380
 in Wolfsburg 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.550
 only in the next matches between the buttons FC Cologne and BM 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.130
 HSV 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.670
 there I think that the HSV 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.060
 continues to play with his good performance 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 and the Cologne with 2 to 0 defeated 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.720
 the next meeting is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.220
 Kaiserslautern 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.850
 Borussia Monchengladbach 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.920
 I think something 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.190
 say out loud this encounter wins against Gladbach 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 with a 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.230
 the next encounter between FC St Pauli 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.840
 and Eintracht Frankfurt &amp; Cie 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.120
 There has never been a post at this encounter 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.650
 I think that it stays that way but as me 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.819
 think that this game 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 one to one 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:38.790
 the next meeting 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.629
 is between FC Schalke 04 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.069
 Bayer Leverkusen 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.359
 Eleventh second 2004 are 11 goals happening there 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.329
 and 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.349
 Schalke won with 7 to 4 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.069
 so too many goals will probably not have been his kind 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.009
 I think that Leverkusen is the game 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.449
 with a 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.449
 2 to 1 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.019
 the next meeting is 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.349
 between the FSV Mainz 05 and Borussia Dortmund 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.629
 the two 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.139
 Teams like a look 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.789
 at the moment are &amp; Cie 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.789
 actually play great too 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.009
 the last few games have not stumbled 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.499
 but 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.929
 It will be a very exciting games I think 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:37.540
 but no goals will fall 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.540
 it ends 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.019
 the last encounter of this matchday is 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.019
 between TSG Hoffenheim and Hannover 96 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:55.199
 there I think 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.239
 also a draw 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.239
 one to one 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.669
 These were my tips 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.909
 for the toe late work 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.309
 and sliders of comments make suggestions for improvement 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:21.769
 and see you again next monday until then
