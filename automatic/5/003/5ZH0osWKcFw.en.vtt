this another entry level look we have

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.070 
this another entry level look we have
here<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:55.110> wee<00:02:55.410> TJ<00:02:56.280> our<00:02:56.430> model<00:02:56.820> in<00:02:57.080> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
this really basic look and I thought it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.720

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
because it's not intimidating like a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.120 
because it's not intimidating like a
black<00:03:05.370> on<00:03:05.730> black<00:03:06.209> suit<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.620> has<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> little

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
black on black suit but it has a little

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.300 
black on black suit but it has a little
bit<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.880> color<00:03:09.150> combination<00:03:09.840> mm-hmm<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.530> we

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
bit of a color combination mm-hmm and we

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.040 
bit of a color combination mm-hmm and we
paired<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.790> with<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.209> white<00:03:12.450> blouse<00:03:12.570> which<00:03:12.900> is

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
paired it with a white blouse which is

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.740 
paired it with a white blouse which is
definitely<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.830> basic<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.430> every<00:03:14.820> working

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
