I'm like four to the deck checked me
around<00:00:32.099> -<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.360> how<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> began<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
around - so this is how it began the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.290 
around - so this is how it began the
deck<00:00:34.050> checkmater<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:34.829> deck<00:00:34.980> was<00:00:35.130> fine<00:00:35.340> I
