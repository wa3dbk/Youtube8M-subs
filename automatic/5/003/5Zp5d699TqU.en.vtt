00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello friends we will study today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.180
 rumored guitar to start 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.220
 we need to tune the first string 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.670
 I have it now, I am already 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.070
 set up 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.570
 you can also join me now 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 customize your instrument 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.840
 together with me 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.180
 and from him we will start to dance further 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.820
 and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.820
 Here is the first string of notes 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.120
 have set up fine further 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.010
 tune the second string I specifically 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.420
 upset the tool so that together now 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.270
 setting it up with you means doing what 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.100
 we press the second string here we start with 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.809
 first frets somewhere around if you 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.260
 totally upset we need to understand 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.180
 where to twist to tune the string 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.700
 higher or lower for a start take here 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.580
 down on the first palm 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.320
 we hear that the string sounds lower and so 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.760
 little by little we move up 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.210
 until we find our 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.210
 sound 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.970
 and here we found 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 if we have a higher sound that is on the neck 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.670
 we actually have to configure 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 sound the second string by the sound should 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.479
 be here on the fifth palm pressed and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.020
 must be the same sound with the first 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.240
 string 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.299
 we hear different sounds 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.060
 we also have where it means to us 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.189
 string pull up that is higher 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.189
 pull up the second string 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.850
 pulled up a little look further once again 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.780
 and now we have become on the seventh palm 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.710
 should be at 5 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.710
 I still him 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.760
 fine already in the sixth still pull 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.210
 that's almost 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.210
 try to pull up a bit 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.760
 here she is 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.140
 even a little more 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.610
 fine the second string is tuned 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.890
 go ahead tune the third string 3 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.490
 the string is built on the fourth 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.340
 palms 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:31.010
 play open second 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:35.500
 and hold on 3 for 4 daughters 3 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.500
 hear the sound different going up again 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.110
 here somewhere here we pull up 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.120
 excellent on the fifth but we need on 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.120
 the fourth is still pulling 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.840
 still 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.760
 still 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.650
 hear vibrations 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.209
 and if we pull a little up 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.209
 here it does not remain 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.189
 still 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.520
 the sound still fluctuates 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.490
 before pulling the palms we play 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.740
 first string 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.700
 then we twist the ball so we can hear 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.700
 what's going on 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.010
 here we are 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.010
 at 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.160
 the same sound is excellent 1 2 3 with us 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:48.030
 configured 1 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:51.090
 2 4 not at all set up doing the same 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.280
 squeeze the fourth string on 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.840
 fifth palm and here we should have 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:06.690
 sound similar to the third open with us 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:10.460
 not at all looking for here found means 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.460
 we pull again such up 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.130
 now on 7 things they 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.389
 pull even in the sixth 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.050
 few 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:39.360
 it is already high here but it is still not available 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.360
 here we pull it in place let's 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.950
 a little more 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:52.120
 fine there 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.590
 so we tuned the fourth string 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.290
 go on fifth set up 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.750
 the same on 5 little daughter hold fifth 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.770
 the string should have a sound like 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.770
 open 4 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.250
 here is hd on 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.250
 pull a lot of traction 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.410
 now on the seventh 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.410
 on the sixth 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.470
 on the sixth 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.430
 slightly hesitates a little more 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.670
 that's perfect there 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.530
 great left with the sixth string 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.780
 customizable as much as everyone 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:53.540
 the rest except the third hold on the fifth 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.540
 palms in short you need a lot of vats 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.300
 so he pulls 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.680
 on the seventh 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.960
 on the sixth 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.890
 here on the fifth palm we found 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.590
 identical sounds take a guitar chord 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.450
 configured and 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.820
 now also we can all our 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:28.640
 setting check invested there it is for 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:31.160
 more like someone who hears well here 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.520
 hesitations are heard I do not know is heard or not 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.520
 Well 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.750
 do fla vest that is 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.790
 the sixth string we touch over 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.900
 piece of iron over the fifth fret just 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.360
 touch him and play 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.970
 Here we have this sound and the fifth 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.060
 we do the same thing on the seventh palm 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.570
 above seventh 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:59.600
 here we play two together and we will hear 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:05.600
 fluctuations the same we do the fifth and 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:13.480
 fourth here is a little bit of and 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:13.480
