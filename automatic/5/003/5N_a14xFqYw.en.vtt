Hey everybody, Bohus here for FotodioxPro.com.
As of this video we are fresh from NAB and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.699
that is the National Association of Broadcasters
where all the coolest new video cameras get

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.490
marched out, and among them was this beast,
the Blackmagic URSA. But they also announced

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.210
a Blackmagic URSA mini. This is a 4K camera,
this one's 15 pounds, the Mini is much smaller,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.160
as you can see it's making hay with my table.
But I bring this to you becasue there are

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.339
a lot of cool lens options with the URSA,
like this one for example is an EF mount camera,

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.210
so you can use all your Canon lenses, you
can use lots of adapters that we've got here

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.929
if you want to put other lenses on the front.
You can also use our whole line of ND Throttle

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.409
adapters which are adapters with variable
ND built right in--we made a video about just

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.460
that very topic. But we want to talk about
ultra wide angle lenses. There are times when

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.670
you want to add a neutral density filter onto
an ultra wide angle but you can't because

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.110
of the shape of the lens, there are no threads,
there's no really good way to put a neutral

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.810
density on the front. That's why we invented
the WonderPana system, which not only lets

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.869
you put neutral density on the front, but
you can also put a circular polarizer, big

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.719
square filters with gradients, but I'm getting
a little bit ahead of myself. Let me show

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.670
you the magic of the WonderPana and how it
can work with the URSA camera. And by the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.500
way, it will work with either URSA camera,
the big guy or the little guy, because it

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.990
does not require the rod system, this is not
gonna mount on your mattebox or anything,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.729
it all attaches to the lens itself. Let me
show you how that works. This is my little

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.029
Rokinon EF compatible lens, great little lens
that's a 14mm.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.860
So we've got two components

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.060
that are important to the WonderPana. This
is the mount right here, there's this collar

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.330
and this front bit. So first, slip the collar
around the lens, of course this is before

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.330
you mount the lens onto the camera. And now
this front guy, it actually has spots where

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.830
it mates with the tulip hood, that's how it
locks on, and then just spin the collar around

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.650
and now you've got a 145mm thread on your
ultra wide angle lens so you won't get any

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.340
vignetting or any of that kind of stuff. As
you can see it looks a little bit like a trumpet

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.860
right now, but in a moment we're going to
add round filters onto the front. So let's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.680
mount the lens like you normally would on
the camera,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.320
okay, like that we're ready to go

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.740
Now we have a whole huge selection of
these 145mm filters, they're exclusively part

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.760
of the WonderPana system. Like here's a circular
polarizer, great for shooting reflective surfaces

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.620
like water, also great for shooting through
glass and you can dial the reflections out,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.510
and also if you're shooting anything metallic
like a car surface, and there might be very

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.470
very fine scratches, you can actually dial
those out. So, you just screw that on the front like so,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.740
and then this front section
you're able to spin and dial the exact amount

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.440
of circular polarization you need. But we're
here to talk about NDs.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.640
So we offer a whole bunch of NDs for the WonderPana system, ND4 through ND1000, so you're gonna find something there.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.980
This is an ND8.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.980
Fly that on like so, and yes, your ultra wide angle lens has ND8 on it now.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.400
Now I'd like to show you an expansion
on this because not only is the WonderPana

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.510
system for round filters, it's also for our
square filters. So all we have to do is add

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.470
the WP66 square filter holder which is right here.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.290
If you look around here you can see

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.310
that there are these little screw holes right on the back of the WonderPana FreeArc.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.600
Turn that around.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.540
Okay, so now we have a square
filter holder on the front of the camera,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.360
and you can see one of the secrets of the
FreeArc is that the front section rotates,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.260
obviously my lens is locked in, but that means
when you use one of these square filters which

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.890
has a gradient, you can place the gradient
wherever you want it to be in your picture.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.350
A great way to save the sky, which is important
to those of us who shoot video. You know,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.040
photographers, they have all kinds of cool
tricks in Photoshop they can do to bring back

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.290
the exposure of the sky, even with the extended
latitude of a camera like the URSA, it's still

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.700
useful sometimes to be able to just place
the angle effect and place the horizon of

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.980
the effect wherever you want it to be in the
picture. And again, we're not using the accessory

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.710
rods at all, you don't need a mattebox for
the WonderPana to work for you, which means

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.830
it will work equally well on the regular URSA
or the URSA Mini. Now we've got a whole selection

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.580
of filters for the WonderPana system: ND4,
ND8, ND16, ND32, and ND1000, that's like the

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.740
big stopper. We've also got a big selection
of these square filters too. They come in

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.170
.6 and .9 ND, both a soft edge and a hard
edge, depending on what it is you're shooting.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.540
We also offer them in colors: we've got blue,
we've got tobacco, we've got a whole bunch,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.880
if you just check out FotodioxPro.com you
can see the whole selection of WonderPana

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.510
filters both square and round, And oh, that's
right, we've got a round and a square mounted

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.830
at the same time, or you can have two squares
mounted at the same time, either or.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.980
So the WonderPana system is great for those of you
shooting with wide angle lenses on your URSA

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.050
camera or really any camera. I'm very fond
of the 14mm lens myself, they call it the

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.520
Gilliam lens in Hollywood because Terry Gilliam
uses them a lot and I'm a huge Gilliam fan.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.240
So, you've got your URSA, you've got your
URSA mini, and you want options for adding

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.150
an ND and you're shooting with a wide angle
lens like my 14mm, you've got options with

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.470
the WonderPana. So make sure to check the
links down below this video, you'll be taken

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.760

the WonderPana system, and don't forget to
