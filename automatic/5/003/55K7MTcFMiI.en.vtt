this<00:00:54.300> means<00:00:54.510> your<00:00:54.960> pictures<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.250> be

this means your pictures are going to be

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
this means your pictures are going to be
darker<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:59.100> bright<00:00:59.399> lights

in your metering zone as an example of
this<00:01:02.370> candle<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.000> took<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.629> picture<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
this candle I took a picture of this

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.920 
this candle I took a picture of this
candle<00:01:04.670> using<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> spot<00:01:06.030> metering<00:01:06.360> mode<00:01:06.630> and

candle using the spot metering mode and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630 
candle using the spot metering mode and
I<00:01:07.020> made<00:01:07.200> sure<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> candle<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the second example they will be ignored

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410 
the second example they will be ignored
by<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.290> camera's<00:01:19.830> metering<00:01:20.220> system<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> the

photographers so please do not get
frustrated<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.140> remember<00:01:59.100> your<00:01:59.250> camera<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
frustrated just remember your camera is

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.210 
frustrated just remember your camera is
calculating<00:02:00.420> light<00:02:00.630> based<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.439> specific

with the light conditions you are

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.600 
with the light conditions you are
shooting<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.590> effect<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> automatic

shooting in will effect the automatic

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.930 
shooting in will effect the automatic

what<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> recommend<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.510> beginners<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
what I recommend for beginners is to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.220 
what I recommend for beginners is to
just<00:02:14.340> stick<00:02:14.550> with<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.819> evaluative<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.720> spot

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
just stick with the evaluative and spot

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.229
