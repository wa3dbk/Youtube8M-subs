hey guys i'm going to show you my
improved<00:00:03.449> version<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.470> automatic

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
improved version of the automatic

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.570 
improved version of the automatic
furnaces<00:00:05.640> i'm<00:00:06.480> using<00:00:06.870> basically<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.040> locate

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
furnaces i'm using basically to locate

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.490 
furnaces i'm using basically to locate
the<00:00:08.730> patch<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:13.009> advanced<00:00:14.009> redstone<00:00:14.219> mod<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
the patch and advanced redstone mod and

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.990 
the patch and advanced redstone mod and
the<00:00:16.500> tati<00:00:16.740> block<00:00:17.039> mode<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.869> i'm<00:00:19.260> using<00:00:19.850> not<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the tati block mode so i'm using not the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.050 
the tati block mode so i'm using not the
latest<00:00:21.330> version<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.840> elevator<00:00:22.410> pitch

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
latest version of the elevator pitch

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.200 
latest version of the elevator pitch
because<00:00:24.060> that's<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.140> i<00:00:26.130> will<00:00:26.460> so

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
because that's one back but i will so

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
because that's one back but i will so
for<00:00:27.420> now<00:00:27.449> it's<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.109> normal<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:29.310> previous

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
for now it's just a normal the previous

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
for now it's just a normal the previous
version<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.500> see<00:00:31.650> only<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.160> slot

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
version so you can see only one slot

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.810 
version so you can see only one slot
never<00:00:32.940> capable<00:00:33.829> but<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.010> pledge<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.489> really

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
never capable but this pledge is really

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.610 
never capable but this pledge is really
great<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.450> from<00:00:36.780> small<00:00:37.500> dead<00:00:37.710> guy<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
great and it's from small dead guy and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.290 
great and it's from small dead guy and
yeah<00:00:40.620> its<00:00:41.219> handling<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.090> fewer<00:00:43.190> fauna

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
yeah its handling of fewer fauna

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.479 
yeah its handling of fewer fauna
furnaces<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.989> charcoal<00:00:46.500> will<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.219> placed

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
furnaces so charcoal will not be placed

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.270 
furnaces so charcoal will not be placed
here<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> will<00:00:48.629> always<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.960> placed<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
here but it will always be placed in a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.900 
here but it will always be placed in a
few<00:00:50.489> slit<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.600> makes<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.079> design<00:00:52.910> pretty

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
few slit so that makes the design pretty

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.350 
few slit so that makes the design pretty
compact<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.100> automatic<00:00:56.760> planners<00:00:57.120> needs

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
compact so one automatic planners needs

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.700 
compact so one automatic planners needs
a<00:00:58.250> space<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.359> two<00:01:00.359> blocks<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.500> direction

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.740 

13<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.070> direction<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.000> nine

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
13 in this direction and it's nine

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.750 
13 in this direction and it's nine
blocks<00:01:07.170> high<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:10.280> smaller<00:01:11.280> way<00:01:11.729> smaller

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
blocks high so it's smaller way smaller

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.840 
blocks high so it's smaller way smaller
than<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.750> previous<00:01:13.140> version<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:14.310> here

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
than the previous version because here

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.760 
than the previous version because here
you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.330> 20<00:01:15.840> automatic<00:01:16.439> furnaces<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:18.770> my

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you can see 20 automatic furnaces and my

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.390 
you can see 20 automatic furnaces and my
bold<00:01:22.040> design<00:01:23.040> had<00:01:23.430> about<00:01:24.119> five<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.720> them<00:01:25.400> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
bold design had about five of them in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.069 
bold design had about five of them in
the<00:01:26.520> same<00:01:26.759> space<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> basically<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.960> does

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the same space so basically what it does

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.450 
the same space so basically what it does
is<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.939> put<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.680> symmetrical<00:01:34.680> objects<00:01:35.159> into

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
is you put the symmetrical objects into

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.260 
is you put the symmetrical objects into
one<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:35.939> chests<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:37.640> later<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.850> when

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
one of these chests here later on when

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.990 
one of these chests here later on when
it's<00:01:39.420> connected<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.110> other<00:01:40.430> sorta<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it's connected to my other sorta and so

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
it's connected to my other sorta and so
on<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.140> automatically<00:01:43.740> dropped<00:01:44.100> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
on it will be automatically dropped in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.859 
on it will be automatically dropped in
here<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.710> then<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> circle<00:01:47.869> all

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
here and then it's going in a circle all

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.999 
here and then it's going in a circle all
the<00:01:48.930> way<00:01:49.409> down<00:01:51.770> until<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.619> then<00:01:55.619> there

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the way down until here and then there

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.130 
the way down until here and then there
are<00:01:56.040> disco<00:01:56.549> night<00:01:56.790> back<00:01:57.170> if<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.619> smelted

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
are disco night back if it's not smelted

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.810 
are disco night back if it's not smelted
but<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.619> not<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.460> will<00:02:02.640> just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
but if it's not that it will just

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.440 
but if it's not that it will just
fall<00:02:04.630> down<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:06.520> one<00:02:06.790> of<00:02:06.940> those<00:02:07.120> pressure

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
fall down with one of those pressure

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.050 
fall down with one of those pressure
plagues<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.560> sucked<00:02:09.100> into<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.670> furnace

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
plagues and is sucked into the furnace

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.770 
plagues and is sucked into the furnace
and<00:02:10.800> then<00:02:11.800> when<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.190> finished<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.480> will<00:02:13.510> get

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and then when it's finished it will get

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.620 
and then when it's finished it will get
sucked<00:02:14.080> out<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:15.040> activate<00:02:18.000> yeah<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.510> is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
sucked out and activate yeah this is

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.720 
sucked out and activate yeah this is
allocated<00:02:20.110> again<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.980> suck<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.459> next

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
allocated again to suck in the next

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.150 
allocated again to suck in the next
object<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.780> makes<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:25.500> extremely<00:02:26.500> fast

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
object so that makes it extremely fast

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.880 
object so that makes it extremely fast
to<00:02:27.430> play<00:02:27.640> up<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.970> other<00:02:28.120> design<00:02:28.890> because

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
to play up to the other design because

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.960 
to play up to the other design because
it's<00:02:30.959> does<00:02:31.959> not<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:32.740> firm<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.250> dedicated<00:02:33.940> to

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
it's does not one firm is dedicated to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.540 
it's does not one firm is dedicated to
one<00:02:34.300> item<00:02:35.230> item<00:02:35.830> type<00:02:36.070> like<00:02:36.370> gold<00:02:37.060> or

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
one item item type like gold or

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.140 
one item item type like gold or
cobblestone<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:40.680> every<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.550> furnace<00:02:42.940> can

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
cobblestone but every the furnace can

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.790 
cobblestone but every the furnace can
snap<00:02:43.450> every<00:02:43.660> object<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.690> i<00:02:47.080> will<00:02:47.590> show<00:02:47.739> you

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
snap every object so i will show you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.720 
snap every object so i will show you
i'll<00:02:48.550> put<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.060> some<00:02:50.100> gold<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.570> then<00:02:53.580> start<00:02:54.580> it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
i'll put in some gold and then start it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.560 
i'll put in some gold and then start it
up<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:59.320> just<00:02:59.530> copy<00:02:59.709> block<00:03:00.040> will<00:03:00.570> start

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
up so just copy block will start

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.720 
up so just copy block will start
toggling<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.780> see<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.550> items<00:03:06.550> are

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
toggling and you can see the items are

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.140 
toggling and you can see the items are
transported<00:03:07.480> along<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:08.610> they<00:03:09.610> locate<00:03:09.940> them

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
transported along this they locate them

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.009 
transported along this they locate them
chest<00:03:10.570> line<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.620> from<00:03:11.890> here<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:15.959> now<00:03:16.959> you

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
chest line so from here to here now you

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.500 
chest line so from here to here now you
can<00:03:17.230> see<00:03:17.580> doesn't<00:03:18.580> overflow<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.239> all<00:03:19.360> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
can see doesn't overflow so all the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.600 
can see doesn't overflow so all the
items<00:03:19.810> are<00:03:19.930> transported<00:03:20.650> with<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.250> conveyor

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
items are transported with the conveyor

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.020 
items are transported with the conveyor
belt<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.720> other<00:03:22.840> side<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.640> now<00:03:24.760> if<00:03:24.910> you

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
belt to the other side and now if you

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.710 
belt to the other side and now if you
start<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.690> with<00:03:26.590> this<00:03:28.470> level<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.970> will<00:03:30.970> see

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.380 

all<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:35.200> gold<00:03:35.470> blocks<00:03:36.190> are<00:03:36.489> sucked<00:03:36.970> into<00:03:37.090> the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
all the gold blocks are sucked into the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.430 
all the gold blocks are sucked into the
furnaces<00:03:37.860> here<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:40.120> then<00:03:40.390> when<00:03:41.260> it's

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
furnaces here and then when it's

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.740 
furnaces here and then when it's
finished<00:03:41.650> they<00:03:42.130> will<00:03:42.160> get<00:03:42.430> sucked<00:03:42.760> out

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.570 

and<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.930> transported<00:03:49.710> on<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> conveyor<00:03:50.310> belt

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
and I transported on the conveyor belt

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.640 
and I transported on the conveyor belt
into<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.300> direction<00:03:51.740> so<00:03:52.740> it<00:03:52.830> will<00:03:53.040> smell<00:03:54.650> are

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
into this direction so it will smell are

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.740 
into this direction so it will smell are
in<00:03:56.160> nineteen<00:03:56.730> now<00:03:57.000> I<00:04:01.820> said<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:02.940> fill<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.360> last

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
in nineteen now I said to fill that last

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.150 
in nineteen now I said to fill that last
one<00:04:06.440> now<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:08.280> can<00:04:08.460> see<00:04:08.730> it's<00:04:09.240> pretty<00:04:09.480> fast<00:04:10.160> the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
one now you can see it's pretty fast the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:19.850 
one now you can see it's pretty fast the
distribution<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:18.560> don't<00:04:19.560> know<00:04:19.650> what<00:04:19.830> I

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
distribution is so don't know what I

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.840 
distribution is so don't know what I
wanted<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.220> say<00:04:22.280> there<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.370> however<00:04:23.580> one

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
wanted to say there is however one

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.310 
wanted to say there is however one
drawback<00:04:24.950> because<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.190> cannot<00:04:27.320> smell

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
drawback because you cannot smell

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.580 
drawback because you cannot smell
charcoal<00:04:29.280> or<00:04:29.940> make<00:04:30.360> charcoal<00:04:30.900> from<00:04:31.320> would

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
charcoal or make charcoal from would

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.850 
charcoal or make charcoal from would
heal<00:04:31.890> because<00:04:32.670> then<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.180> will<00:04:33.620> sometimes<00:04:34.620> get

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
heal because then it will sometimes get

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.390 
heal because then it will sometimes get
sucked<00:04:35.160> into<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:35.610> direction<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.800> then<00:04:37.800> to

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
sucked into this direction and then to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.030 
sucked into this direction and then to
all<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.850> other<00:04:38.970> elevators<00:04:39.630> down<00:04:39.840> there<00:04:40.140> as<00:04:40.380> a

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
all the other elevators down there as a

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.970 
all the other elevators down there as a
few<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.700> this<00:04:42.570> one<00:04:42.960> pressure<00:04:43.320> plate<00:04:43.620> will<00:04:43.830> now

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
few and this one pressure plate will now

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.670 
few and this one pressure plate will now
get<00:04:44.160> triggered<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.780> can<00:04:45.960> only<00:04:48.680> make

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
get triggered so you can only make

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.520 
get triggered so you can only make
charcoal<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.340> last<00:04:50.700> one<00:04:53.420> so<00:04:54.420> yeah<00:04:55.080> maybe

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530
