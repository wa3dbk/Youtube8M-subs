00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.649
 I think that here it is not only the light of the four indications from where 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.310
 would have been the last week jesus spoke to pedro and joão they followed the man 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.880
 with a pitcher of water that they would show a large room furnished surly 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.570
 Greek regional human capital means a room on the top floor 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.190
 the ones that could be used to eat right and the bedrooms upstairs 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.880
 are always larger but the word furniture in Greek means table and 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.140
 with charles 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.410
 although strange the visitors' room could be used to eat and sleep the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.990
 that we have here is a table with mattresses in the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.190
 there was also a table without it bes is simple but who saw 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.230
 it was for a large room 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.640
 as the lane on the important side resembles that parables when Jesus 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.410
 was invited to a party does not sit in the most important place or else 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.400
 You will be removed from there. 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.220
 they knew that 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.700
 to my left is the humblest place the host presents himself 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 second place and not the first one 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.110
 the person in the symmetry of Western culture I am sitting where the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.040
 host would not be on the important side of the table because the host 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.250
 one assistant is on the left and the other is on the right. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.160
 now speak that word will be open left hand and in tim burton without 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.860
 mystery of the sinister right highlighted everything that is right-handed 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.630
 then the person prefers the story to his right and the other to his left 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.440
 the alert now explain the first place would be the beloved disciple joão 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.010
 who would have to get into debt for Jesus when he wanted to talk to him 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.550
 on the other side of the host would be the guest of honor identified by 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.540
 wet bread from the wine he would be offered by the host readequating 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.030
 jesus who offered bread helps whistle people understood that the guest of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.600
 honor to be with your left remember that after receiving the bread together 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.400
 left the table to betray his centenary we can not know the order 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.200
 who were sitting too much but we know for who was in the humblest place 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.759
 because of three evidences 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.549
 when Peter wanted to know who would betray Jesus he did not scream I hired 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.969
 jesus who will be but he looked into John's eyes and asked in a low voice that 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.969
 would be a traitor joão got in behind his head was left in the chest of jesus 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.869
 ask and see who would be the traitor if John was looking that way 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:32.539
 your taste being hidden from everyone but only someone here would see your eyes 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:37.799
 if we have a basin and a jar and the person who is in the humblest place 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.159
 of the table usually offered to wash the feet of others but no one 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:42.969
 offered 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:48.159
 Jesus then stood up and there went the disciples' feet when the time came 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.059
 of Pedro understood that he was the last because he was in the 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:56.839
 humble this helps us understand why Peter gave up and let Jesus 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.189
 I loved your feet 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.959
 because he was in the place of the one who should wash the feet of the others 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.880
 the last supper was a very intimate moment a meal 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.369
 a table that represents alliance and warns of 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.779
 jesus said in the gospels I wished much commented the post this Easter 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.319
 as if he had planned something carefully as well as the words 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.449
 I wanted to say he was so anxious for this leave 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:27.099
 people said to him he can not give jerusalem to the passover but that era 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.150
 the most joyful night of the year 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.909
 because it resembled the liberation of the 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.049
 God's people in Egypt 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.689
 the crossbar for this meal the last supper took place during the Passover 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.949
 everything fits perfectly as we are understanding event of the 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.279
 salvation in jesus christian phase mirrored in his person 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:52.039
 but in another while you look the same as the last supper one thinks of people 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:56.079
 who took part in that special occasion 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.670
 they were all fishermen 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.960
 were imperfect people because they were invited to stroll with other jesus 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.890
 imagine seeking Jesus would choose perfect people to take the work of God to the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.409
 world 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.629
 but god in your sovereignty or you can choose anyone if he does not need 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.489
 of perfection in fact the bible tells us that God often prefers people 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.719
 imperfect faults and why then their glory can shelter through them 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:31.259
 after supper can celebrate the Passover with his disciples jesus has to use 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.569
 take the home he lives an intense with me for everything that was about to happen 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.199
 Let's see next.
