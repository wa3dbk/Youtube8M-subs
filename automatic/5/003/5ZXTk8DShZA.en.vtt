00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.690 
you do several things well at once
rather<00:01:40.590> than<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:40.860> reel<00:01:41.039> that<00:01:41.220> was<00:01:41.369> very

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
rather than a reel that was very

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.090 
rather than a reel that was very
narrowly<00:01:42.210> defined<00:01:43.110> could<00:01:43.440> only<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.830> two<00:01:44.009> or

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
narrowly defined could only do two or

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.700 
narrowly defined could only do two or
three<00:01:44.160> things<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.539> reels<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.020> great

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
three things and this reels a great

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.880 
three things and this reels a great
example<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.399> versatility<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.360> also

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
example of versatility but also

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.520 
example of versatility but also
top-of-the-line<00:01:50.030> serious<00:01:51.030> reel<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:52.080> very

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
top-of-the-line serious reel for very

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.380 
top-of-the-line serious reel for very
very<00:01:52.890> serious<00:01:53.369> fish<00:01:53.610> yeah<00:01:54.000> there's<00:01:54.240> no

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
very serious fish yeah there's no

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910 
very serious fish yeah there's no
question<00:01:54.600> about<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.229> mean<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.500> know<00:01:55.590> this

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
question about it I mean you know this

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.490 
question about it I mean you know this
the<00:01:56.160> vsx<00:01:56.760> line<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.900> advent<00:01:58.320> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the vsx line you know with the advent of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
the vsx line you know with the advent of
braid<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> advent<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.330> braided<00:02:00.780> line

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
braid with the advent of braided line

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.640 
braid with the advent of braided line
has<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.799> become<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.490> standard<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:03.840> major

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
has really become the standard on major

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.310 
has really become the standard on major
boats<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.400> see<00:02:05.760> offshore<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.110> time

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
boats that you see offshore all the time

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800 
boats that you see offshore all the time
I<00:02:07.590> know<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:09.000> our<00:02:09.060> own<00:02:09.209> case<00:02:09.570> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
I know that you know in our own case I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.400 
I know that you know in our own case I
mean<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.470> replaced<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.190> number<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.150> 50s<00:02:12.630> 70s<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
mean we replaced a number of 50s 70s and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.130 
mean we replaced a number of 50s 70s and
80s<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:14.160> these<00:02:14.340> lighter<00:02:14.670> more<00:02:14.970> powerful<00:02:15.140> vsx

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
80s with these lighter more powerful vsx

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.870 
80s with these lighter more powerful vsx
reels<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.430> perfect

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
reels you know and this is a perfect

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.810 
reels you know and this is a perfect
example<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.540> responsiveness<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:20.160> reel<00:02:20.549> is<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
example of responsiveness this reel is a

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.949 
example of responsiveness this reel is a
little<00:02:21.090> bit<00:02:21.209> narrower<00:02:21.420> than<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:21.780> we're

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
little bit narrower than what we're

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.509 
little bit narrower than what we're
normally<00:02:22.320> used<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> seeing<00:02:22.650> because<00:02:23.340> now

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
normally used to seeing because now

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.190 
normally used to seeing because now
because<00:02:23.730> we're<00:02:23.850> running<00:02:24.030> braided<00:02:24.450> lines<00:02:24.690> we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
because we're running braided lines we

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.990 
because we're running braided lines we
don't<00:02:25.410> really<00:02:25.620> need<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.040> huge<00:02:26.220> volume<00:02:26.850> of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
don't really need that huge volume of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.490 
don't really need that huge volume of
line<00:02:27.180> capacity<00:02:27.750> because<00:02:27.840> we<00:02:28.019> have<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> thin

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
line capacity because we have the thin

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.199 
line capacity because we have the thin
line<00:02:28.709> diameter<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.549> we're<00:02:29.760> able<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.000> get<00:02:30.120> away

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
line diameter and we're able to get away

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.360 
line diameter and we're able to get away
with<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> narrower<00:02:30.930> spool<00:02:31.320> it's<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.010> lot<00:02:32.190> more

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
with a narrower spool it's a lot more

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.430 
with a narrower spool it's a lot more
compact<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.970> easier<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.360> use<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.900> pens<00:02:34.200> done

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
compact and easier to use and pens done

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.380 
compact and easier to use and pens done
a<00:02:34.470> lot<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.829> really<00:02:35.100> cool<00:02:35.280> things<00:02:35.579> here<00:02:35.790> first

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
a lot of really cool things here first

a lot of really cool things here first
of<00:02:36.510> all<00:02:36.690> there's<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.200> hundred<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.829> fifty

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
of all there's a hundred and fifty

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.039 
of all there's a hundred and fifty
degree<00:02:38.310> drag<00:02:38.579> throw<00:02:38.850> that's<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.390> very<00:02:39.600> long<00:02:39.840> way

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
degree drag throw that's a very long way

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
but that's not where the feature stop

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.840 
but that's not where the feature stop
there's<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.230> lot<00:02:58.380> more<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.799> on<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.070> the

angler<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.849> much<00:03:03.090> better<00:03:03.300> position

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
angler this is a much better position

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.720 
angler this is a much better position
on<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.140> top<00:03:04.349> of<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.620> real<00:03:04.769> it's<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.670> the
