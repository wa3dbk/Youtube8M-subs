it is cup shaped and it has an area that
you<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.650> add<00:00:19.830> some<00:00:19.859> water<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.270> minimal

you can add some water it's a minimal
amount<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.350> water<00:00:22.820> so<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.210> be

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
amount of water so you have to be

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.060 
amount of water so you have to be
careful<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.109> use<00:00:25.289> these<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.859> make

careful when you use these that you make
sure<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.789> keep<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.119> PIN<00:00:27.599> cup<00:00:27.960> fill<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.279> it's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
sure you keep your PIN cup fill but it's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.400 
sure you keep your PIN cup fill but it's
also<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> minimal<00:00:30.900> amount<00:00:31.260> of

also going to have a minimal amount of
flowers<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.899> they're<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to be a less quantity of flowers and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.500 
to be a less quantity of flowers and
this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.620> fun<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.070> use<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> tray

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this is fun to use on a tray

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.869 
this is fun to use on a tray
now<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.140> contrasting<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> rag<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.730> with

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
now we're contrasting a rag here with

this is going to make this going to be a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150 
this is going to make this going to be a
statement<00:00:51.210> flower<00:00:51.780> arrangement<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:53.129> a

statement flower arrangement not a
massive<00:00:54.090> flowers<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> statement<00:00:56.210> letting

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
massive flowers but a statement letting

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.830 
massive flowers but a statement letting
the<00:00:57.360> flower<00:00:58.190> show<00:00:59.190> its<00:00:59.370> own<00:00:59.609> personality<00:01:00.270> that

the flower show its own personality that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
the flower show its own personality that
one<00:01:01.020> has<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> nice<00:01:01.410> curve<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.309> we're<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
one has a nice curve so we're going to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.469 
one has a nice curve so we're going to
use<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:05.070> add<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> short<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.000> down<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
use that and add a short one down at the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.179 
use that and add a short one down at the
bottom<00:01:09.170> gonna<00:01:10.170> move<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> center<00:01:11.520> one

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
bottom gonna move on to the center one

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:21.560 
bottom gonna move on to the center one
add<00:01:14.189> some<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> coxcomb

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.250 

if<00:01:22.570> somebody's<00:01:23.020> hanging<00:01:23.290> down<00:01:23.620> leaves<00:01:23.980> off

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.620 

just<00:01:29.920> think<00:01:30.250> this<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.520> just<00:01:30.760> another<00:01:30.970> type<00:01:31.600> of

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
just think this is just another type of

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.790 
just think this is just another type of
flower<00:01:32.200> arranging<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.390> lesser<00:01:34.390> amount<00:01:35.380> of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
flower arranging a lesser amount of

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.400 
flower arranging a lesser amount of
flower<00:01:37.230> letting<00:01:38.230> it<00:01:38.380> stand<00:01:38.800> out<00:01:39.160> on<00:01:39.490> its<00:01:39.760> own

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
flower letting it stand out on its own

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.380 
flower letting it stand out on its own
we'll<00:01:41.410> go<00:01:41.530> back<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.980> the<00:01:42.160> zinnias<00:01:42.820> for<00:01:43.210> this

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
we'll go back to the zinnias for this

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.330 
we'll go back to the zinnias for this
one<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.970> big<00:01:46.210> flower<00:01:46.890> you're<00:01:47.890> doing<00:01:48.220> an

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
one the big flower you're doing an

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.280 
one the big flower you're doing an
arrangement<00:01:48.790> like<00:01:48.970> this<00:01:49.360> if<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.630> have<00:01:49.780> a<00:01:49.810> big

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
arrangement like this if you have a big

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.860 
arrangement like this if you have a big
flower<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.600> want<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.900> cut<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.470> stem<00:01:54.870> short

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
flower you want to cut that stem short

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.390 
flower you want to cut that stem short
get<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.710> impact<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:57.990> flower<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.560> then

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
get the impact of the flower and then

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400 
get the impact of the flower and then
get<00:02:00.670> more<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.180> nice<00:02:01.710> curve<00:02:02.710> on<00:02:03.280> it

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
get more of a nice curve on it

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.870 
get more of a nice curve on it
lay<00:02:05.410> off<00:02:05.650> its<00:02:05.890> curve<00:02:06.280> for<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.900> drama

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
lay off its curve for the for the drama

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.770 
lay off its curve for the for the drama
maybe<00:02:09.880> we<00:02:10.149> can<00:02:10.330> add<00:02:10.660> some<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:14.410> verse

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
maybe we can add some of this verse

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.810 
maybe we can add some of this verse
spite<00:02:16.780> effect<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.770> center<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:20.670> little<00:02:21.670> bit

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
spite effect in the center a little bit

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.910 
spite effect in the center a little bit
more<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.360> leaf<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:25.270> you've<00:02:25.480> got<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.990> you've
