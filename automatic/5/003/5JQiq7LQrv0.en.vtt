about<00:01:15.049> seven<00:01:15.499> meters<00:01:15.619> 30<00:01:16.100> as<00:01:16.399> an<00:01:16.579> average<00:01:16.759> you

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
about seven meters 30 as an average you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.849 
about seven meters 30 as an average you
know<00:01:17.149> you<00:01:17.210> would<00:01:17.420> see<00:01:17.569> it<00:01:17.659> a<00:01:17.719> show<00:01:17.929> we're<00:01:18.619> down

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
know you would see it a show we're down

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.449 
know you would see it a show we're down
to<00:01:19.069> about<00:01:19.270> 620<00:01:20.270> here<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.469> we've<00:01:21.619> made<00:01:21.649> it<00:01:21.950> quite

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
to about 620 here so we've made it quite

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:23.499 
to about 620 here so we've made it quite
a<00:01:22.520> bit<00:01:22.639> shorter<00:01:23.149> than<00:01:23.179> you<00:01:23.359> would<00:01:23.479> normally

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
a bit shorter than you would normally

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.529 
a bit shorter than you would normally
have<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:25.310> can<00:01:25.459> even<00:01:25.579> come<00:01:25.939> shorter<00:01:26.389> than<00:01:26.509> that

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
have you can even come shorter than that

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.359 
have you can even come shorter than that
you<00:01:26.869> can<00:01:26.899> come<00:01:27.200> down<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.499> less<00:01:27.889> than<00:01:27.920> six

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
you can come down to less than six

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.580 
you can come down to less than six
meters<00:01:28.789> and<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:29.869> as<00:01:29.959> a<00:01:30.020> start<00:01:30.319> you<00:01:30.380> know<00:01:30.530> you

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
meters and but as a start you know you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.289 
meters and but as a start you know you
for<00:01:31.100> someone<00:01:31.280> you'd<00:01:31.520> want<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.759> start<00:01:32.060> say

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
for someone you'd want to start say

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.889 
for someone you'd want to start say
something<00:01:32.689> like<00:01:32.840> 6<00:01:33.229> 30<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:33.950> but<00:01:34.609> the<00:01:35.450> idea<00:01:35.840> is

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
something like 6 30 and but the idea is

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.749 
something like 6 30 and but the idea is
the<00:01:36.409> horse<00:01:36.619> Klein<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.189> want<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.459> horse<00:01:37.609> to

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
the horse Klein you want the horse to

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.149 
the horse Klein you want the horse to
climb<00:01:38.090> up<00:01:38.380> landing<00:01:39.380> short<00:01:39.709> that's<00:01:39.950> why<00:01:40.100> you

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
climb up landing short that's why you

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.969 
climb up landing short that's why you
have<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.459> pole<00:01:40.700> inside<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.350> yes<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.740> land

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
have the pole inside so that yes to land

today and when there was a mistake or
rail<00:02:43.410> down<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:44.160> didn't<00:02:44.459> seem<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.700> change

that's<00:03:19.560> sort<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.980> program<00:03:20.370> really<00:03:20.579> right

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
that's sort of the program really right

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.940 
that's sort of the program really right
now<00:03:21.239> we've<00:03:21.720> seen<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.379> other<00:03:22.530> footage

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
now we've seen on the other footage

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.009 
now we've seen on the other footage
you've<00:03:23.370> done<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.700> other<00:03:23.849> grid<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.629> we<00:03:24.720> started

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
you've done the other grid so we started

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.120 
you've done the other grid so we started
with<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.200> cancer<00:03:25.410> poles<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.919> then<00:03:26.010> we've<00:03:26.099> got

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
with the cancer poles and then we've got

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.589 
with the cancer poles and then we've got
some<00:03:26.489> other<00:03:26.609> ones<00:03:26.819> on<00:03:27.000> there<00:03:27.180> would<00:03:27.389> you

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
some other ones on there would you

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.509 
some other ones on there would you
recommend<00:03:28.139> starting<00:03:28.380> with<00:03:28.650> any<00:03:28.919> particular

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
recommend starting with any particular

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.830 
recommend starting with any particular
grid<00:03:29.700> if<00:03:29.849> you've<00:03:29.970> never<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:30.329> done<00:03:30.599> good

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
grid if you've never really done good

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.629 
grid if you've never really done good
work<00:03:30.870> before<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.680> would<00:03:32.190> start<00:03:32.459> with<00:03:32.519> a

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
work before I would start with a

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.099 
work before I would start with a
counterpose<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.480> easiest<00:03:33.840> one<00:03:34.079> to

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
counterpose it's the easiest one to

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.309 
counterpose it's the easiest one to
start<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:35.849> then<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.630> second<00:03:37.049> one<00:03:37.079> is

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
start with and then the second one is

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.470 
start with and then the second one is
the<00:03:37.500> bounce<00:03:37.739> exercise<00:03:38.310> that's<00:03:38.549> that's<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.329> nice

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
the bounce exercise that's that's a nice

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.110 
the bounce exercise that's that's a nice
easy<00:03:39.840> exercise<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.590> build<00:03:40.739> up<00:03:40.980> into<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.579> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
easy exercise to build up into and the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.539 
easy exercise to build up into and the
double-o<00:03:42.750> roxas<00:03:43.109> is<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.260> bit<00:03:43.530> more<00:03:43.769> specialized

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
double-o roxas is a bit more specialized

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.180 
double-o roxas is a bit more specialized
it's<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.030> bit<00:03:45.180> more<00:03:45.769> depending<00:03:46.769> on<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:46.950> level

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
it's a bit more depending on the level

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.690 
it's a bit more depending on the level
that<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.639> want<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:47.880> compete<00:03:48.239> at<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:50.010> idea<00:03:50.220> for

that you want to compete at the idea for

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.879 
that you want to compete at the idea for
me<00:03:50.880> with<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.359> exercise<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.349> want<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.739> horse

Oh Edie coming into these things what do
what<00:04:27.069> would<00:04:27.189> you<00:04:27.250> recommend<00:04:27.430> for<00:04:27.789> rides<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.330> do

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
what would you recommend for rides to do

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.029 
what would you recommend for rides to do
with<00:04:28.689> the<00:04:28.780> approach<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.110> come<00:04:29.530> in<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:29.949> all

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
with the approach that come in and all

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.129 
with the approach that come in and all
that<00:04:30.189> kind<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.520> thing<00:04:30.699> I<00:04:30.909> mean<00:04:31.539> always<00:04:31.720> starts

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
that kind of thing I mean always starts

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.140 
that kind of thing I mean always starts
with<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:32.379> your<00:04:32.680> jump<00:04:32.949> jumping<00:04:33.340> dressage<00:04:33.550> you

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
with you your jump jumping dressage you

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.999 
with you your jump jumping dressage you
have<00:04:34.389> to<00:04:34.539> be<00:04:34.689> confident<00:04:35.259> enough<00:04:35.469> on<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.800> flat

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
have to be confident enough on the flat

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.379 
have to be confident enough on the flat
that<00:04:36.159> your<00:04:36.310> horse<00:04:36.460> can<00:04:36.669> count<00:04:36.939> around<00:04:37.240> the

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
that your horse can count around the

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.080 
that your horse can count around the
corner<00:04:37.719> without<00:04:37.840> arguing<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:40.060> the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
corner without arguing to the to the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.939 
corner without arguing to the to the
approach<00:04:40.509> Vince<00:04:40.810> if<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.080> can't<00:04:41.319> count<00:04:41.680> around

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
approach Vince if you can't count around

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.189 
approach Vince if you can't count around
the<00:04:42.189> first<00:04:42.430> corner<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.419> par<00:04:43.659> on<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.930> floor

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
the first corner to a par on the floor

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.499 
the first corner to a par on the floor
you<00:04:44.740> can't<00:04:45.009> then<00:04:45.250> do<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:45.550> double<00:04:45.909> of<00:04:46.000> boxes<00:04:46.360> or

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
you can't then do a double of boxes or
