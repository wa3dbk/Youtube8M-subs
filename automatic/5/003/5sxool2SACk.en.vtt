and on the right is the skullcap hybrid
case<00:00:22.470> they<00:00:23.039> each<00:00:23.250> cell<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:24.230> 1599<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.710> let's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
case they each cell for 1599 so let's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.140 
case they each cell for 1599 so let's
crack<00:00:26.130> these<00:00:26.279> open<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.789> see<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.029> they're

cases<00:00:33.059> from<00:00:33.390> their<00:00:33.660> packaging<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.649> there's

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
cases from their packaging now there's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.590 
cases from their packaging now there's
nothing<00:00:34.980> included<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> packaging<00:00:36.360> other

than the case of themselves and at 1599

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.639 
than the case of themselves and at 1599
you<00:00:39.390> probably<00:00:39.660> wouldn't<00:00:39.930> expect<00:00:40.320> anything

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
you probably wouldn't expect anything

other than the case now both of these
cases<00:00:42.660> are<00:00:43.050> hybrid<00:00:43.500> style<00:00:43.710> cases<00:00:44.250> they

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
cases are hybrid style cases they

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
cases are hybrid style cases they
feature<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:45.030> inner<00:00:45.270> silicone<00:00:46.050> layer<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
feature an inner silicone layer with a

feature an inner silicone layer with a
hard<00:00:47.100> plastic<00:00:47.370> exterior<00:00:48.120> reminds<00:00:48.960> me<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.170> lot

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
hard plastic exterior reminds me a lot

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
hard plastic exterior reminds me a lot
of<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.739> case<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.160> switcheasy<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
of a case some switcheasy you have the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
of a case some switcheasy you have the
plastic<00:00:51.899> frame<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> inner<00:00:52.980> core<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
plastic frame with the inner core that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.330 
plastic frame with the inner core that
is<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> shock<00:00:55.020> end<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.649> impact

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
is going to be the shock end of impact

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.729 
is going to be the shock end of impact
absorbing<00:00:56.789> material<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.570> I'll<00:00:58.020> pop<00:00:58.260> both<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
absorbing material so I'll pop both the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.439 
absorbing material so I'll pop both the
kind<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.100> frames<00:00:59.430> off<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.300> them

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
kind of frames off so you can see them

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.299 
kind of frames off so you can see them
all<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.719> close<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.739> we'll<00:01:01.890> start<00:01:02.190> with

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
all up close and then we'll start with

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.189 
all up close and then we'll start with
the<00:01:02.609> spider<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.930> I'm<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the spider one first so I'm going to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.100 
the spider one first so I'm going to
take<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:04.439> iphone<00:01:04.739> 5<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:04.979> stick<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.489> into<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
take my iphone 5 and stick it into the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.109 
take my iphone 5 and stick it into the
silicone<00:01:07.110> case<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.700> take<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
silicone case like so and then take the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
silicone case like so and then take the
frame<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.900> kind<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.200> put<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> over<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
frame and just kind of put it over the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.910 
frame and just kind of put it over the
case<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.150> until<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> snaps<00:01:13.260> all<00:01:13.650> into

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
case like so until it snaps all into

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.260 
case like so until it snaps all into
place<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.760> got<00:01:14.880> several

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
place you can see it's got several

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
place you can see it's got several
points<00:01:15.509> where<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> kind<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.200> locks<00:01:16.500> into<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
points where it kind of locks into the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
points where it kind of locks into the
silicone<00:01:18.360> frame<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.380> helps

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
silicone frame and that's what helps

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.620 
silicone frame and that's what helps
keep<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.220> together<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:20.850> piece<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
keep it all together in one piece and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.090 
keep it all together in one piece and
there<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> go<00:01:22.380> there's<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> finished<00:01:23.009> look

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
there you go there's the finished look

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.710 
there you go there's the finished look
definitely<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.299> everyone<00:01:24.360> but

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
definitely not for everyone but

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
definitely not for everyone but
certainly<00:01:25.380> pretty<00:01:25.590> cool<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> spider<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
certainly pretty cool the spider on the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.039 
certainly pretty cool the spider on the
back<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.060> three-dimensional<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.840> kind<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
back it's three-dimensional it kind of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
back it's three-dimensional it kind of
sticks<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.650> off<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.369> back<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.820> gives<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
sticks up off the back that gives you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
sticks up off the back that gives you
that<00:01:30.240> lay<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> back<00:01:30.960> protection<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.799> well

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that lay on the back protection as well

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.910 
that lay on the back protection as well
as<00:01:32.299> an<00:01:33.299> unbelievable<00:01:34.140> amount<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.500> lay<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
as an unbelievable amount of lay on the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.830 
as an unbelievable amount of lay on the
table<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.729> lip<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.329> comes<00:01:36.600> up

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
table you can see that lip that comes up

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.390 
table you can see that lip that comes up
so<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.439> definitely<00:01:37.770> put<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.100> phones

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
so you can definitely put these phones

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.969 
so you can definitely put these phones
the<00:01:38.970> phone<00:01:39.180> screen<00:01:39.570> side<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.829> have

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the phone screen side down and not have

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
let's pop the spider one off and then

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.300 
let's pop the spider one off and then
take<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.299> look<00:02:24.540> at<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> skull<00:02:25.319> one<00:02:25.560> neck<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.159> I'm

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
take a look at the skull one neck so I'm

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.820 
take a look at the skull one neck so I'm
just<00:02:26.459> going<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.819> pop<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.569> plastic<00:02:28.290> frame<00:02:28.590> off

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
just going to pop this plastic frame off

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.830 
just going to pop this plastic frame off
take<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.489> silicon<00:02:30.000> layer<00:02:30.209> off<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.720> then

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
take the silicon layer off and then

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.039 
take the silicon layer off and then
switch<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.670> unfortunately<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.150> even<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
switch it up unfortunately the even the

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.530 
switch it up unfortunately the even the
silicon<00:02:34.530> layer<00:02:34.769> is<00:02:35.069> matched<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.030> frame<00:02:36.269> so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
silicon layer is matched to the frame so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.690 
silicon layer is matched to the frame so
unlike<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.019> case<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.440> switcheasy<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:38.459> can't

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
unlike the case of switcheasy you can't

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.550 
unlike the case of switcheasy you can't
like<00:02:38.819> mix-and-match<00:02:39.209> pieces<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.440> know

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560

like mix-and-match pieces but you know
no<00:02:40.829> big<00:02:40.980> deal<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.579> cases<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.150> come<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.599> ton

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
no big deal the cases do come in a ton

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.080 
no big deal the cases do come in a ton
of<00:02:42.900> color<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:43.709> be<00:02:44.310> nice<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.700> could<00:02:44.819> do<00:02:44.970> that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
of color so be nice if you could do that

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.740 
of color so be nice if you could do that
you<00:02:45.150> could<00:02:45.360> match<00:02:46.200> ones<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.890> same<00:02:47.160> design

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
you could match ones of the same design

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.660 
you could match ones of the same design
you<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.109> not<00:02:49.290> back<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.280> forth<00:02:50.519> between

you know but not back and forth between
the<00:02:50.910> silicone<00:02:51.299> pieces<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.260> there<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:52.590> go<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.799> got

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
the silicone pieces so there we go I got

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.330 
the silicone pieces so there we go I got
the<00:02:53.280> skull<00:02:53.790> one<00:02:54.030> on<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.220> again<00:02:56.220> I'm

just<00:02:56.459> going<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.609> make<00:02:56.730> sure<00:02:56.879> that<00:02:57.030> all<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
just going to make sure that all the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.119 
just going to make sure that all the
corners<00:02:57.629> are<00:02:57.750> locked<00:02:58.019> into<00:02:58.200> place<00:02:58.409> there<00:02:58.980> we

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
corners are locked into place there we

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.819 
corners are locked into place there we
go<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.879> there's<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.750> skull<00:03:01.019> one<00:03:01.230> looks<00:03:01.590> better

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829

go so there's the skull one looks better
in<00:03:02.010> my<00:03:02.129> opinion<00:03:02.159> I<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.970> skull<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.269> black
