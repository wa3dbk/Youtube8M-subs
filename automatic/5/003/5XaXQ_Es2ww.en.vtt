you see we have the frameless seamless
windows<00:00:50.760> okay<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.710> work<00:00:52.890> our<00:00:53.100> way<00:00:53.129> back

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
windows okay and as we work our way back

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.790 
windows okay and as we work our way back

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
through the wind tunnel testing they

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
through the wind tunnel testing they
discovered<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> back<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.539> motor

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
discovered that at the back of a motor

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.860 
discovered that at the back of a motor
home<00:00:57.980> there's<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> big<00:00:59.280> vacuum<00:00:59.579> created<00:01:00.239> so

home there's a big vacuum created so

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
home there's a big vacuum created so
they've<00:01:01.079> kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.440> angled<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> back<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
they've kind of angled that back to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
they've kind of angled that back to
eliminate<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> vacuum<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.080> improve<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
eliminate the vacuum and improve the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
eliminate the vacuum and improve the
fuel<00:01:04.680> economy<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.309> has<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.850> improved<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
fuel economy and has it improved if you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
fuel economy and has it improved if you
look<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.780> significantly<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> class
