00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello friends our subscriber 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:17.220
 from the city of Kremenchug, Poltava region 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:22.080
 asks if there is a mana goal 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.140
 difficult to achieve and is it worth it 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.840
 her turnover may be something easier 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 choose a good question here truth can 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.910
 like it means two things you can 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.860
 say the first is such a principle 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.050
 which is universally present in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.989
 here all these mutil motivational 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.260
 talk there and so on and principle 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.370
 this one sounds like that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.670
 can you imagine you can achieve 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 in your life here and competition if you 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 can't reach and yes that is why the principle 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 visualizations here in all these matters he 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 very important because if you see 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.210
 yourself you see yourself there I don't know 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.639
 scientists you see yourself as an engineer you 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.600
 see yourself as a good mom you see yourself 

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:17.249
 there is a wife and there is a favorite and so on you 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.229
 see yourself that here are the girls on you 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:24.719
 rush to someone that in life you need but 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.219
 when you see yourself yes you can 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.469
 this you can be here 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.450
 let's say ugly some 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.100
 likeable some whole plump 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 bald spots there i don't know what 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.179
 and look in the mirror and say but on 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.130
 no decent woman like that 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:43.350
 Pozar to these here can you can 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.869
 say but if you want you 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.609
 loved women yes and so on and you 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.679
 moving in this way and that's when you 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.259
 can present yourself in this capacity 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.289
 if you can present yourself you can 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.209
 achieve this and there is a mass of history from 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:02.759
 There are wonderful films in life 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:03.960
 On this subject and there is how it is 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.220
 absolutely 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.600
 but as if a battered place means women 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.510
 not necessarily like men who 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.209
 handsome there curly blue-eyed there with 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.200
 cash bag there in every pocket 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.970
 not even so if you can yourself 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.310
 imagine you can do this 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.209
 reach the question is what i think in this 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.569
 forming the one that was given 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.180
 initially matters when we say that 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.920
 this very difficult attainable goal can 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.110
 to be seen as so complicated 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 so as not to achieve in principle 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.600
 not achievable so here's how to know achievable 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.220
 or unreachable 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.739
 because if it is achievable and let 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.780
 even it is difficult to achieve but as if well 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.340
 so it was worth it if such a goal 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.700
 high therefore fundamentally important 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.610
 tell yourself this i can i want this i 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.250
 can i go and i do it but if you 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.720
 see I don't know if I can do it all 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.080
 everything ends at that moment 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.560
 is ending 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.290
 so here going back to the question of the young 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.160
 human if there is a beautiful goal good 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.690
 and even if not so simple goal so 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.940
 good goal and it never happens 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.110
 achievable but you see yourself you 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.290
 understand that you can do it here 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.240
 you go and do and quietly there 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.940
 cool this is the first first moment 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.320
 which we want to illuminate here 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.220
 second moment is hell 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.980
 so many people go on their way 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.650
 find ingenuous they say this what 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.330
 there is in that and glad that's what god sent then 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:53.450
 means from her well and God did not send him 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:58.730
 striving for a higher one did not send 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.330
 God knows that he is craving for something 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.060
 such a 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.220
 and what is difficult to achieve and so on as 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.770
 he did not know he hurt it or something, or there 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.160
 I almost did not consider it necessary to give 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.430
 that's why this kind of 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.609
 downshifting yes there is good and what are you 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.310
 there is even from what is, here is the good and 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.799
 or there it is 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.660
 I can not or do not want I do not want because 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.390
 I can't because I don't want 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.100
 time here and here and here now and rested and and 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:35.530
 got up against the wall and all my life there just 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:38.450
 eat therefore come back to the question 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.520
 man is not just in the light of day 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.260
 appeared he appeared with a certain 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.380
 destination above given 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.840
 destination and if intended 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.330
 let's say something so serious 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.630
 do not necessarily achieve much 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.250
 it is given god yes shout 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.330
 for god's sake there are people who are completely 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.960
 other purpose 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.810
 but if you have it and you 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.240
 shirking his father from him 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.460
 giving up your destination is 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.190
 terrible thing is a spoiled life 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.960
 crippled when it's not happy 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.750
 fate therefore should not be put before 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.300
 are such tasks that it is clear that 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.730
 easily achievable and like you're done and Th 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.160
 well done to you a lot of you 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.010
 ask a lot and what do you say and I 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.620
 here with troechnikami sat very much you 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.420
 build nicknames sat and did not become a doctor 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.670
 Physics and Mathematics 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.300
 as you should for example if you plowed 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.550
 tried hard 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.830
 your eyes would shine and you would know what 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:47.530
 then it does why why and so it seems 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:50.880
 it was easier that's why you need to be careful 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:54.660
 be with setting such goals that are not 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.270
 Well, as if the challenge in them there is no call 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.200
 as for Russian translate this call 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.090
 no, no call, well, where are you going 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.400
 to enable your comfort zone 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.360
 more and more complicated things all 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.640
 more more different things you are not growing 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.470
 if those are meant to grow here before 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.010
 level so that the same has been provided that 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.900
 I will say so besides 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.260
 that when you start walking already 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.960
 this way when you start well 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.080
 some achievements 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:33.820
 write down all there books of life so here 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.410
 it is surprisingly satisfying such 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.210
 process he he gives an incredible 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.850
 pleasure and satisfaction from life 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.530
 from the fullness of life and you no longer want 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.080
 therefore stops very, very 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.750
 it is important to start and feel this buzz 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.860
 from the fact that you set the task and decided and 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.080
 uneasy 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.620
 because everyone will solve a simple problem 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:57.129
 well there is a 90 percent solution but if you 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.539
 let's say I don't know if you belong to a tank 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:00.400
 5 percent were their 10 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.469
 how do you set such a task which 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.110
 only 5 percent or 10 can decide 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:09.030
 otherwise it will not suit you otherwise it is just 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:12.039
 Well, how to say no, life failed 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:16.270
 we want to face in a steep way 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:17.530
 eggplant hatcher I failed here I 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.069
 would probably be on it 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:26.710
 and ended up without being there at all 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:28.659
 somewhere where were climbing but these 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:32.229
 two things i would say you need to constantly 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:34.090
 keep in mind and no no no not break on 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:39.039
 these don't give up putting 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:41.680
 goals are high and not not to lose 

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:43.689
 you won't bite off your life 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.650
 you know, that's why right here 

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:46.650
 neatly happy
