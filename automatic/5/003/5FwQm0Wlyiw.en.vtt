a ding has one gig one gig of memory the
battery<00:02:10.299> on<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.660> thing<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:10.989> an<00:02:11.080> 1800

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
battery on this thing is an 1800

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.190 
battery on this thing is an 1800
milliamp<00:02:12.190> lithium-ion<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:13.959> embedded
