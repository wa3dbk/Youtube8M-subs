00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.850
 the pope speaks beauty guys frei that you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.150
 one more video this time a video of one 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.180
 new subject and mg 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.810
 I think you all know the mgm game 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.550
 is a gb style home page of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.390
 competitive character and other games 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.170
 also 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.050
 but anyway play pretty well your faith th 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 there most of you should know more 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.120
 unfortunately today is much too much 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 weak in the issue of number of players 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 Of Quality 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.140
 you take a game more then the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.850
 fring and a radio is 10/1 at the most you are 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 It's very difficult for you to get that cut. 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.300
 six hours and you got guys 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 really good 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.239
 top page etc then it is not that it gave a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.729
 discouraged to play gb and started the saga 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.540
 the schedule is part of the gain almost nothing 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.119
 from sp 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 When I lose I lose 30 then those 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 animals still play I 'll probably go 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.500
 Back to gb for real in xbox one 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 because there you go and then I'll go 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.080
 gain a normal type or normal loss 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.400
 I will not lose or gain much is good 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.170
 But I do not like it here, it's going to be very difficult. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.900
 to realize if I 'm going to play I'll play a 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.680
 account and secondary that I can leave 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.840
 that description honestly windowed but 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.930
 Anyway, I know what you're about. 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.320
 the mg on the lakers that are broken 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.840
 bet and motivated me to play a lot 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.540
 mg because besides having its partners 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.820
 bets is basically all the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.560
 gringos players and most of beige 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.619
 are also migrating to the can 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.570
 playing quite there then in that time 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.060
 that I am free to play 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.360
 departure from sainz and with the team 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.890
 so we came back to play in the mg 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.649
 to vote these rules are part of the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.000
 retired like I said and that 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.140
 the face of why you defend yours 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.149
 money knows 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.819
 even if it's a dollar for $ 2 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.080
 Like you're going to play giving life to 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.200
 earn that money back 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.850
 and won the opponent in case then I 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.620
 I'll explain a little to you guys. 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.940
 matches wagered like her 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.010
 works and basically this is how you create 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.380
 just consuming genders is obviously fine 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.290
 simple as well as explanatory like gb 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.910
 so there is not much mystery and you create 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.810
 Your google account that catches me that one. 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.670
 whole thing 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.490
 and how does it work? 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.080
 sassoeiros you have to buy 5 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.610
 Credit dollars you can pay via 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.620
 paypal for example 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.780
 and those five dollars is the minimum amount 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.630
 You can not buy one or two without 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.150
 buy at least 5 and with that 5 you 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.680
 can make bets that you want can 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.380
 bet a dollar to 2 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.950
 I know you guys had to choose and 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.440
 obviously the bet is not on time 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 each player bet on the value of each 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.959
 team after a dollar or each had 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.840
 two dollars and you create your 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.340
 team and you can leave from there 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.280
 enables the inter- module 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.130
 and when you open the way this one 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.900
 will accept your departure and soon in 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.459
 then you already ask for the money you 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.620
 retired for example you had five 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.620
 dollars you've posted to your account already 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.480
 loses when you get 4 and you go 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.660
 play the match if you win will stay 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.269
 the way I was with 4 if you win 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.300
 you will earn your money back 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.870
 but the other team's money staked 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.239
 then you would be in the case with $ 6 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.830
 you had five years and won more 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.650
 one of the other team 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.480
 and you still earn a buck more 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.459
 need is a money of fees 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.540
 so for example I came from the 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.269
 dollar bill 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.070
 so I ended up earning a dollar and 80 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.070
 I do not know why this more tense rate 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.050
 rate then type the team guy lost 1 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.880
 dollar but I ended up winning from the dollar and 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.459
 80 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:10.890
 so that's how it works and 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.540
 It works in the butcher shops and rock 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.850
 no mg works 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.430
 I liked the two maps the team that has 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.810
 more wins and more ranking say 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.289
 so that team 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.860
 so if you get variant and if the team 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.469
 have more wins and an egg is the best 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.909
 You will find two maps. This is a 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:34.520
 good advantage in the gringos account and when 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.830
 was this idea different story 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.539
 because in this leader is the team that has the 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.210
 d better government 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.159
 after strong rounds then the secret is you 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.620
 to win as many games as possible in 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.930
 face gringo and get on the br gives you a 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.750
 stick in the war from 6 to 16 to 2 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.169
 so the team that wins the most rounds 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.669
 the pb - nÃ© is the team that will pull the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.860
 third map 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.599
 so much is that in the list of faces she has there 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.870
 the first team kick the gringo 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:07.020
 theirs , and vice versa the second and the third is 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.960
 tb that it's a must I do not know 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.729
 exactly when what is but means 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.240
 that the team that wins or loses less 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.909
 games by adding the first two maps 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.900
 so basically this is it people i 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:23.939
 I recommend you play mg because you are 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.879
 very cool my players who were 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:30.479
 in mg white mg and many neighborhoods too 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:33.629
 migrating as I said and have these 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.580
 laws are for retirees who 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.490
 do you want to play more? 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:42.330
 so because gp is losing a lot 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.389
 xp and earning little then for me not 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.479
 it's worth it more will play again 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.330
 gp for the next netbox code in the 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.629
 year if this is the case because xp will be 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.990
 generated and there will not be much problem there 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:06:01.110
 As I grab you each type the gain of the 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.240
 common in xp get into radio gains and xp 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.419
 maximum and when I lose from the 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.759
 tray radio I lose 2030 so it's medium 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.110
 infeasible to play and so too 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.629
 stapled mg 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.240
 along with these laws there that add 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:17.129
 enough there in my desire to play 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.779
 so that's basically it I recommend 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.180
 that you all know some mg because 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:24.300
 It's cool, it's a well organized site. 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.099
 and has everything to grow big 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.409
 So that's it folks if nobody 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.180
 comes from the description as it always has things 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.339
 important if you want to follow the 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.169
 work on social networks 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.810
 It's only you, then, to stay connected in the 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.810
 news from the channel and in the news 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.160
 mine in general is this 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.800
 from the heart to all of you who accompany 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.800
 the videos said and until the next video
