00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
thing one of the reasons that we find

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.450 
thing one of the reasons that we find
difficulty<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:13.070> reserving<00:01:14.070> time<00:01:14.220> for

difficulty in in reserving time for

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
difficulty in in reserving time for
prayer<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:16.049> our<00:01:16.259> lives<00:01:16.470> are<00:01:16.650> so

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
prayer is because our lives are so

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
prayer is because our lives are so
fast-paced<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.030> live<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> very

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
fast-paced right so we live in a very

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.510 
fast-paced right so we live in a very
busy<00:01:18.750> world<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.380> noisy<00:01:19.590> world<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.310> there's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
busy world a very noisy world so there's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
busy world a very noisy world so there's
two<00:01:20.700> things<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.299> adjust<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.500> our

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
two things that we can adjust in our

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
two things that we can adjust in our
lives<00:01:23.040> without<00:01:23.790> adding<00:01:24.180> anything<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.750> our

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
lives without adding anything to our

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.899 
lives without adding anything to our
to-do<00:01:25.110> list<00:01:25.439> that'll<00:01:26.040> make<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.369> space<00:01:26.549> for

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
those punctuation marks as I found this

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.640 
those punctuation marks as I found this
great<00:03:20.980> iPhone<00:03:21.400> app<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.420> basically

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
great iPhone app and it basically

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.670 
great iPhone app and it basically
replicates<00:03:23.650> an<00:03:23.829> old<00:03:24.090> grandfather<00:03:25.090> clock<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
gongs at every hour and so my iPhone

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.860 
gongs at every hour and so my iPhone
goes<00:03:30.100> off<00:03:30.310> at<00:03:30.489> every<00:03:30.700> hour<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.209> all<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.420> simply

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
goes off at every hour and all I simply
