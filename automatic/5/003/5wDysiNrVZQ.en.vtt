two<00:01:14.450> cars<00:01:14.720> as<00:01:15.050> they<00:01:15.080> go<00:01:15.320> over<00:01:15.410> so<00:01:15.680> we<00:01:15.800> have<00:01:15.890> a

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
two cars as they go over so we have a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.250 
two cars as they go over so we have a
formula<00:01:16.220> f<00:01:16.610> program<00:01:17.240> which<00:01:17.450> uses<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.050> same

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
formula f program which uses the same

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.870 
formula f program which uses the same
engine<00:01:18.619> as<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.800> fit<00:01:19.159> but<00:01:19.460> then<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.700> goes<00:01:19.850> into

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
engine as the fit but then it goes into

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.990 
engine as the fit but then it goes into
an<00:01:20.330> open-wheel<00:01:20.900> race<00:01:21.260> car<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:21.920> have<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.130> starter
