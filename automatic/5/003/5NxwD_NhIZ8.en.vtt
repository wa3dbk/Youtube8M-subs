00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to tone back cover here and flipping it

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.210 
to tone back cover here and flipping it
around<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.230> front<00:00:25.439> you've<00:00:25.769> got<00:00:26.039> what

around to the front you've got what

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.140 
around to the front you've got what
looks<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.730> match<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.660> four<00:00:27.869> inch<00:00:28.080> leaks<00:00:28.380> and

display<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.899> vertically<00:00:34.860> higher<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.670> this

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
display going vertically higher so this

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.569 
display going vertically higher so this
is<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> original<00:00:36.210> iPhone<00:00:36.570> 4s<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.430> is

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is the original iPhone 4s and this is

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.810 
is the original iPhone 4s and this is
how<00:00:39.210> big<00:00:39.450> how<00:00:40.170> tall<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.770> new<00:00:40.950> iPhone<00:00:41.700> display

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
how big how tall the new iPhone display

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.360 
how big how tall the new iPhone display
would<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.649> assuming<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.890> mock-up<00:00:44.190> is

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
would be assuming that this mock-up is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.889 
would be assuming that this mock-up is
actually<00:00:44.640> legitimate<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.570> gotten<00:00:45.809> a
