00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.599
 as one of business a doctrine to the person in charge of the old town 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.830
 where the classic 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.950
 PrÃ¶ll's classical students percent among the younger and around me then 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.040
 have to know my piano from playing from the sheet is not that far ago 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.480
 times the way - and thus more to start in a classical way to the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.970
 did so earlier in his music 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.890
 from the Rems is normal and so you set off three points so be it now 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.160
 Percent of Offhaus Mix for example, 60 years of FRG life 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.930
 In Classic Rock, that makes Daniel Barenboim worth with Owen's ninth 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 the seven percent so on the monitor mix are currently synonymous current year 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.020
 William Regal will be a beautiful the means kings Mennonites I can as 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.950
 are quietly silent 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.360
 and as the third vertex around 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.350
 sends UNO were called for percent musical XVI Max Raabe November 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.260
 be present 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.190
 but really holds 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.130
 decisive for the game this time varied 2 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.380
 this is still a lot much, despite the training 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.490
 Do it Yourself 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.510
 take care of yourself 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.580
 No one is open to new at MoMA, what's new in the market 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.810
 or just listen to a format that only exists here and there below 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.010
 It still takes care of itself very important 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.480
 and I think that 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.360
 into the lot and you do it down long enough for wood chips 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.830
 Reasonable results delivered in the past 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.830
 then still brings that Mauch celebrity malus economic power 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.490
 what have or around 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 all the microphones have no power board to keep 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.550
 so except the condenser microphone arm the Prime Heimito of 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.930
 I came across by accident and a year and a half ago with colleagues 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.799
 Percent 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.439
 and pro forma said above of the try if the ASV Loh so great 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.239
 um and the eighth drove between Weston 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.129
 promt the 22- more up and down 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.669
 and more of the 28-year-old one comes to take the Piccolos 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.010
 Dieter Ammer 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.799
 Abendlicht also became in the room Bonn the summer itself only as additional microphone 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.719
 on Owen, of course, ideally 30 grams 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.189
 and he 40 4 bass guitar while Dr 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.389
 almost completely flat science what now 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.089
 Benecken used 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.139
 very minimal Jun da 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.139
 um what is he a hero is a guitar a Solon has as a cabinet 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.899
 ten-month-high 10 hertz resonant frequency easy in the 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.369
 Cadillac is in it 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.079
 to pull the house 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.319
 or in the in the playoffs 40 alone, Rent Fricke at his best for years 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.679
 training otherwise are the 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.610
 almost no critical old local filter and done 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.639
 Father Pierre 30 through the big capsule 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.989
 then one transmits frequency range and much better in the Lena Nick 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.869
 through the exercises fire area 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:12.789
 as a percent 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:16.059
 Misano dynamic as usual anyway so far had tried 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.839
 I've done midterrand shots Smith son mixed setups middle 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.669
 Forest of the 30th 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.409
 the capacitors band microphones where to make then and mix for 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.139
 Thanks to Philip 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.299
 must say that is already percent takes with full stuff was water 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.339
 really three completely different sundays of the APA 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:39.299
 Miracle that BA 30 water Neumann probably Wally in between of the characteristic 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.669
 love it is it's natural weigh Grossman Burn condensate extreme 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.899
 open down in the frequency domain 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.339
 but forms of the newer of transients he kinda anyway 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:52.669
 Abraded Unison if she was not classic in the court listener 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.019
 So I drive down there excited by and the colleagues with the ship 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.209
 recorded and in simple situations also said so Bonn that nice and gentle 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.709
 great result and at roach the mix of the 3 real percent of 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.229
 harmful characters that complement each other well or discarded great thing 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.229
 since I tried these roommates 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.829
 so far 30 times before the door 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.079
 So it is but it has to be said 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.729
 that is crazy 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.479
 terribly good 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.749
 I came across that from real Metal songs like Sophie 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:29.599
 If she had sat on the Peter Kraus of Eon tried that more possible 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.080
 that's 50 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.889
 that was the part of us really hurt and prevented 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.699
 and that or by 30 so wonderfully transposed it's even the transients 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.539
 how one has ground down the swim a bit 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.560
 Cologne that only know as usual from mother and daughter Kaiko 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.110
 use Luckert filters set and devastated 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 So that was the result of having heard full but he gets 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.990
 overwhelmed me again
