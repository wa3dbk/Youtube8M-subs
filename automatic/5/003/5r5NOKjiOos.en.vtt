ultimately started to wander if it were

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.340 
ultimately started to wander if it were
this<00:01:09.470> great<00:01:09.770> in<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.040> deposit<00:01:11.050> how<00:01:12.050> come<00:01:12.229> you

this great in the deposit how come you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.859 
this great in the deposit how come you
can't<00:01:12.649> find<00:01:13.159> any<00:01:13.550> I<00:01:13.670> mean<00:01:13.909> what<00:01:14.270> what<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.659> it

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
can't find any I mean what what is it

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.219 
can't find any I mean what what is it
they<00:01:15.229> see<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.970> know<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.119> started<00:01:17.840> looking

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
they see and you know I started looking

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.310 
they see and you know I started looking
into<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.710> more<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:18.979> more<00:01:19.690> what<00:01:20.690> I<00:01:20.720> came<00:01:21.020> across

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
into it more and more what I came across

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.279 
into it more and more what I came across
was<00:01:21.800> these<00:01:22.490> interesting<00:01:23.149> pictures<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:24.020> river

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
was these interesting pictures of river

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.070 
was these interesting pictures of river
rock<00:01:24.590> up<00:01:24.950> on<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.280> side<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.789> hill<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.479> it

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
rock up on the side of the hill and it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.660 
rock up on the side of the hill and it
sure<00:01:27.440> didn't<00:01:27.800> make<00:01:27.950> any<00:01:29.890> sense<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.160> me<00:01:31.190> why<00:01:31.640> I

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
sure didn't make any sense to me why I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.850 
sure didn't make any sense to me why I
would<00:01:31.850> find<00:01:32.210> River<00:01:32.570> Rock<00:01:32.869> on<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.380> side<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.800> the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
would find River Rock on the side of the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.880 
would find River Rock on the side of the
hill<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.429> wasn't<00:01:34.940> because<00:01:35.240> somebody

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
hill and it wasn't because somebody

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.529 
hill and it wasn't because somebody
dumped<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.009> in<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.310> big<00:01:37.520> trunk<00:01:37.940> or<00:01:38.149> there<00:01:38.360> was<00:01:38.509> a

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
dumped it in a big trunk or there was a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.600 
dumped it in a big trunk or there was a
dump<00:01:38.899> there<00:01:40.060> what<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.179> turns<00:01:41.420> out<00:01:42.340> he<00:01:43.340> used<00:01:43.490> to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
dump there what it turns out he used to

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.889 
dump there what it turns out he used to
be<00:01:43.789> a<00:01:44.259> major<00:01:45.259> glacier<00:01:46.039> that<00:01:46.310> was<00:01:46.490> here

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
be a major glacier that was here

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.840 
be a major glacier that was here
thousands<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.020> years<00:01:48.289> ago<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:49.840> actually<00:01:51.850> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
thousands of years ago that actually the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.810 
thousands of years ago that actually the
earth<00:01:53.060> was<00:01:53.450> pushing<00:01:53.960> up<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.820> rising

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
earth was pushing up and rising

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.260 
earth was pushing up and rising
underneath<00:01:56.299> it<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.009> it<00:01:58.009> would<00:01:58.490> push<00:01:58.759> up<00:01:59.060> and

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
underneath it and it would push up and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.020 
underneath it and it would push up and
crush<00:01:59.630> Rock<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.380> when<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.340> would<00:02:01.490> melt<00:02:01.759> it

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
crush Rock and when it would melt it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.780 
crush Rock and when it would melt it
would<00:02:02.210> wash<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.479> away<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:04.189> would<00:02:04.369> continue

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
would wash it away and it would continue

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.819 
would wash it away and it would continue
that<00:02:05.149> process<00:02:05.750> for<00:02:06.079> thousands<00:02:06.649> of<00:02:06.740> years<00:02:07.189> and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
that process for thousands of years and

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.280 
that process for thousands of years and
ultimately<00:02:09.829> it<00:02:10.519> washed<00:02:11.150> all<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.540> dirt<00:02:11.989> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
ultimately it washed all the dirt and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.280 
ultimately it washed all the dirt and
the<00:02:12.799> fines<00:02:13.130> away<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:15.650> ground<00:02:16.190> down<00:02:16.570> any<00:02:17.570> veins

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the fines away and ground down any veins

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.979 
the fines away and ground down any veins
of<00:02:18.620> quartz<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.190> were<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.910> mountains<00:02:20.630> of

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
of quartz that were in the mountains of

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.350 
of quartz that were in the mountains of
rocks<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.680> were<00:02:21.860> there<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.450> grounded<00:02:24.110> into

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
rocks that were there and grounded into

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.000 
rocks that were there and grounded into
polished<00:02:26.360> round<00:02:26.690> smooth<00:02:27.200> rock<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.040> sand<00:02:29.000> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
polished round smooth rock and sand and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.349 
polished round smooth rock and sand and
turns<00:02:31.010> out<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.989> that's<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.350> sign<00:02:33.799> of<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:35.150> whole

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
turns out that that's a sign of a whole

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.009 
turns out that that's a sign of a whole
lot<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:36.220> washing<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.340> crushing<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.209> that's

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
lot of washing and crushing and that's

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.890 
lot of washing and crushing and that's
pretty<00:02:39.380> much<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:40.010> takes<00:02:40.940> place<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.299> a<00:02:41.660> gold

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
pretty much what takes place in a gold

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.490 
pretty much what takes place in a gold
mining<00:02:42.230> operation<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.630> washing<00:02:45.290> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
mining operation and that washing and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.819 
mining operation and that washing and
crushing<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.130> very<00:02:46.400> expensive<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.359> do<00:02:47.829> well

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
crushing is very expensive to do well

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.800 
crushing is very expensive to do well
the<00:02:49.010> billions<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.579> years<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:50.000> washing<00:02:50.630> and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
the billions of years of washing and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.390 
the billions of years of washing and
crushing<00:02:51.350> have<00:02:52.040> left<00:02:52.400> behind<00:02:52.700> an<00:02:53.420> enormous

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
crushing have left behind an enormous

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.909 
crushing have left behind an enormous
amount<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.609> gold<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.269> sits<00:02:56.980> underneath<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
amount of gold that sits underneath the

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.730 
amount of gold that sits underneath the
pastures<00:03:00.919> out<00:03:01.760> there

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
pastures out there

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.020 
pastures out there
and<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:05.620> interested<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.370> lot<00:03:06.550> of<00:03:06.700> people

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
and it's interested a lot of people

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.470 
and it's interested a lot of people
because<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.350> lot<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:08.950> people<00:03:09.430> look<00:03:09.850> around<00:03:10.030> and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
because a lot of people look around and

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.920 
because a lot of people look around and
they<00:03:10.600> see<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.930> deposit<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.860> gold<00:03:12.700> like<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.360> and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
they see a deposit of gold like that and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.880 
they see a deposit of gold like that and
first<00:03:14.860> thing<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.250> want<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.490> do<00:03:15.640> is<00:03:15.760> figure<00:03:16.000> out

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
first thing you want to do is figure out

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.370 
first thing you want to do is figure out
how<00:03:17.890> they<00:03:18.100> can<00:03:18.400> get<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.270> it<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.570> work<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.990> it<00:03:20.230> you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
how they can get to it to work on it you

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.120 
how they can get to it to work on it you
know<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.530> they<00:03:21.810> ultimately<00:03:22.890> have<00:03:23.890> two

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
know and they ultimately have two

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.290 
know and they ultimately have two
choices<00:03:24.460> either<00:03:26.070> buy<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.130> lander<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.940> steal

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
choices either buy the lander you steal

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.270 
choices either buy the lander you steal
the<00:03:28.540> land<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.170> well<00:03:30.510> back<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:31.750> Jeff<00:03:32.710> Dennis's
