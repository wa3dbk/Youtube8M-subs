00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 with the burning youtube in valencia gave a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.000
 little trick for a bit the glory 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.040
 Integral applications 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.210
 here we have what is the samsung galaxy 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.700
 and in reference g of 53 60 basically 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.119
 consists of first installing the memory 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.390
 microsd phone effect comes with the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.609
 2 GB memory this will allow us 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 transfer some applications to the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.510
 microsd memory and thus free up a bit of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.680
 space 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.310
 it basically consists of entering here 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.320
 configuration 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.970
 look let's look at what is minor the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.450
 available storage space 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:44.570
 card we have total space of 1.85 in 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:47.030
 the micro sd and 94 points 99 megabytes 395 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.790
 megabyte available for applications 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.080
 which is little then what we should 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.600
 enter the option to 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.280
 applications go to administrator 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.399
 Applications 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.699
 and find which of these 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.100
 applications has the option to move to 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.720
 the available memory card this is not 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.610
 allows it 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.170
 let's see if a play club allows it, not what 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.119
 allows this widget that weighs 34 - 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.860
 effectively allows to move the 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.290
 application on the memory card 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.799
 then let's move it we click 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.140
 here 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.610
 we wait while the option of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.580
 moving 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.790
 and so we released some space for 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.470
 another application that we want to install 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.470
 another option that they can do 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.190
 but you should do it when these three 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 recent have bought the phone 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.320
 is to uninstall these two only what 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.790
 You can do it when you have just 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.380
 installed the phone because if it does 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.410
 at this moment there are installed 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.350
 external kernel play servers on the google 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.100
 projector is that it remains without 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.009
 functioning 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.500
 for and to fix this it's up to restore 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.900
 the factory phone and go back to 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.060
 configure all the phone so why 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.649
 the time not advisable to do this 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.810
 fix option because it is complicated 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.850
 the simplest thing is to just enter 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.150
 for each application and look to see the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.280
 allows you to move the card as you will see 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.550
 we released little memory let's see the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.830
 Storage capacity capacity 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.110
 rose to 100 megabytes we're in 93 94 here 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.120
 if we gain a little space and so 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.460
 we can go looking through all the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.970
 applications which can be moved to the 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.680
 sd card and so we increase without having 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.780
 to do a root memory 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.540
 samsung galaxy phone applications 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.310
 people with the phones that have more 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.250
 that the entire operating system or 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.990
 gingerbread that was all for the management 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.710
 thank you very much for watching saw not forget
