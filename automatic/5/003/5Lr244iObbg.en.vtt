refrigerator unit here that is for GPS
tracking<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> platform<00:00:57.270> or

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
tracking you can see that platform or

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
tracking you can see that platform or
the<00:00:57.600> maintenance<00:00:57.960> personnel<00:00:58.469> stand<00:00:58.800> that's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the maintenance personnel stand that's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
the maintenance personnel stand that's
that<00:00:59.820> nice<00:01:00.210> extra<00:01:00.719> metal<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> done<00:01:01.379> well

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that nice extra metal and done well

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.390 
that nice extra metal and done well
there<00:01:02.780> they've<00:01:03.780> got<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.140> metal<00:01:04.470> wheels<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there they've got all metal wheels so it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920 
there they've got all metal wheels so it
provides<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> smoother<00:01:06.299> ride<00:01:06.420> there's<00:01:06.780> no

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
provides for a smoother ride there's no

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
provides for a smoother ride there's no
balance<00:01:07.290> problem

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
balance problem

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620 
balance problem
I've<00:01:08.430> ran<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.820> around<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> track<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> couple

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
I've ran this around the track a couple

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.250 
I've ran this around the track a couple
times<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.770> wonderful<00:01:11.310> results<00:01:11.960> we've<00:01:12.960> got<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
times with wonderful results we've got a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.499 
times with wonderful results we've got a
couple<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.770> cut<00:01:13.979> levers<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.760> each<00:01:15.000> end<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> see

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
couple or cut levers on each end you see

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
couple or cut levers on each end you see
that<00:01:15.630> yellow<00:01:15.840> wire<00:01:16.080> running<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> coupler

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that yellow wire running by the coupler

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.440 
that yellow wire running by the coupler
so<00:01:21.259> that's<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.890> both<00:01:23.250> ends<00:01:23.549> they're<00:01:23.729> done<00:01:24.180> very

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so that's on both ends they're done very

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.920 
so that's on both ends they're done very
well<00:01:25.580> we've<00:01:26.580> basically<00:01:26.790> got<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> nice

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
well we've basically got a nice

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.850 
well we've basically got a nice
underbody<00:01:28.829> detail<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:30.470> as<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.710> see

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
underbody detail here as you can see

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.760 
underbody detail here as you can see
there's<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:32.460> metal<00:01:32.790> wheels<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:34.380> provide

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
there's all metal wheels that provide

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.810 
there's all metal wheels that provide
that<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.189> ride<00:01:35.810> as<00:01:36.810> well<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.119> also

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
that good ride as well and we also

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.340 
that good ride as well and we also
notice<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.939> there's<00:01:42.299> 24<00:01:42.869> different<00:01:43.020> Road

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
notice that there's 24 different Road

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.230 
notice that there's 24 different Road
numbers<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.040> thing<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.640> purchased

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
numbers that this thing can be purchased

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.499 
numbers that this thing can be purchased
in<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.799> buy<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.640> entire<00:01:47.909> fleet<00:01:48.210> for

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
in so you can buy an entire fleet for

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
in so you can buy an entire fleet for
these<00:01:48.630> guys<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.530> print<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.250> great

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
these guys the print on this is great

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.350 
these guys the print on this is great
even<00:01:51.920> under<00:01:52.920> magnification<00:01:53.090> crystal<00:01:54.090> clear

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
even under magnification crystal clear

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.450 
even under magnification crystal clear
BLM<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.320> did<00:01:55.470> their<00:01:55.560> homework<00:01:55.740> then

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
BLM a really did their homework then

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310 
BLM a really did their homework then
went<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.729> visited<00:01:56.850> relex<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.869> physically

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
went and visited relex to physically

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.690 
went and visited relex to physically
measure<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> prototype<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
measure the prototype so you have a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.209 
measure the prototype so you have a
scaled-down<00:02:00.149> accurate<00:02:01.130> representation<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
scaled-down accurate representation of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.389 
scaled-down accurate representation of
the<00:02:02.280> prototype<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.259> all<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.740> markings<00:02:05.219> are

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the prototype and all the markings are

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.010 
the prototype and all the markings are
correct<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.180> did<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> great<00:02:06.540> job<00:02:06.630> there

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
correct so they did a great job there

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.440 
correct so they did a great job there
and<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.280> available<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.000> scale<00:02:09.300> as

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and this is available in in scale as

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.869 
and this is available in in scale as
well<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:11.039> other<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.640> wanted<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
well and the other thing I wanted to

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.520 
well and the other thing I wanted to
mention<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.450> these<00:02:12.629> refrigerator<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
mention is these refrigerator you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.250 
mention is these refrigerator you
that<00:02:14.130> everybody<00:02:14.630> always<00:02:15.630> wants<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.200> the
