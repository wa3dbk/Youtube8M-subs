00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.530
 I think for a long time probably interesting to all 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.190
 find out what kinds of protein there are in general 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.009
 and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.800
 what kind is responsible for what and why and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.160
 necessary passed interesting well yes 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.420
 let's tell not 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.010
 can divide proteins into several 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.199
 species, that is, manufacturers divide them into 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.150
 a number of subspecies it will say so fast and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.470
 proteins 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.000
 complex proteins and slow proteins 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.700
 and by and large each species has its own 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.899
 the task is fast proteins to us 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.640
 are needed if we are after 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 workouts need to replenish stock 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.329
 amino acids i.e. they are the fastest 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.840
 enters the blood and we get 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.000
 necessary set of amino acids in the blood 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.239
 complex proteins they are more convenient 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.010
 someone during the day can't often 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.579
 eat further for some reason he 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.229
 skips eating their food over 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 long release period of amino acids 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.390
 so within a few hours we will 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.580
 get equal amount of oil words 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.070
 grass yes if we are there it is the condition 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.850
 eat and slow proteins to them 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.009
 refer to the zin-zin is the slowest kind 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.040
 protein and it is usually taken on 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.780
 night at that moment there are nights we cannot 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.580
 eat up the body all the time 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.880
 works and he needs to constantly 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.850
 amino acid crimes therefore when 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.829
 casino night reception we get here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.299
 this is the very set of amino acids that 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.430
 will be released throughout the night 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.869
 and the body will receive the necessary 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.840
 service level and restoration 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.549
 follow you fast proteins so 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.909
 call fast protein and also divides 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.390
 on these things this serum 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.009
 isolation and hydrolysates that is roughly 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.840
 saying they are also divided by speed 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.390
 hydrolyzate is the purest type of protein 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.380
 which contains the maximum amount 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.509
 amino acids and the maximum amount 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.820
 irreplaceable so called they number 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.820
 come true with branched chains 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.679
 isolates they are a little bit slower on 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.270
 respectively, a little bit less from them 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.990
 amount of protein but they are not worse that is 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.120
 they have a longer period of action and serum 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.760
 how would they be among the fast proteins 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.810
 we have the slowest 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.060
 they will talk that is but they 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.220
 faster than her kaizen complex and here 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.950
 depending on the species to depending on 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.870
 your mode and schedule you can yourself 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.790
 choose one or another type of protein 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.270
 which will be convenient for you because 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.450
 there is no universal but for a beginner 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.330
 just about a beginner who start 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.680
 engage need to choose this choice 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.020
 so difficult for him that he even 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.940
 shy go to the store partner 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.200
 dating and newbies I would probably 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.830
 still recommended integrated 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.590
 protein 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.450
 as they contain both serums 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.190
 and isolates including Kozin because 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.380
 that moment when a person starts 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.750
 train not yet formed he 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.700
 day schedule the schedule is correct therefore to him 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.430
 probably a comfortable newbie will apply 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.440
 exactly protein complexes that will be 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.790
 let's say smooth some flaws 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.900
 in the diet well, and that is to sum up 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:22.010
 exactly for protein a day this is how we got up 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.440
 in the morning this is how we tripled and go to bed 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.230
 sleep here this cycle for example us day 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.519
 workout and the day they workout when 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.610
 do you take protein 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.560
 Well, everything depends on the regime yes but 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.080
 simple scheme can be calculated so if 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.160
 we take complex protein but probably 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.860
 it would be more convenient in the morning to have breakfast further 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.900
 between breakfast and lunch and turn on 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.470
 portion of protein 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.880
 next we have lunch next afternoon between 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.310
 lunch and dinner take another one 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.950
 a portion of the protein complex and if not 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.570
 the possibilities are allowed as a rule 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.310
 eat even before bedtime what then we 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.250
 we can include another portion before 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.340
 sleep arduino on training days we 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.799
 we do the same thing just shift reception 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.570
 protein closer to training that is if 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.890
 there is an opportunity we eat somewhere for 2 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.660
 hours before training from no 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.239
 opportunities somewhere an hour before the workout 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.820
 kill a portion of protein another portion 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.170
 protein or gainer we drink immediately 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.320
 by 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.630
 workouts i mean we workout this 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.120
 let's say fill the body with building 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.830
 tereshina and after each horns 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.470
 we have a certain window of debt carbohydrate 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.330
 it opens we also we give the necessary 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.880
 the amount of youth to start 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.620
 body recovering you through 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.450
 times we touched the gainer what is carbohydrate 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.790
 sports supplement probably then 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.390
 let's get to it because with protein 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.990
 Is everything clear then what is our 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.210
 protein everyone hears the word protein everywhere 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.130
 nychki it discusses but the gainer is the same 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.750
 such a more narrowly specialized to 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.110
 fewer boards about it 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.330
 knowledge of people let's tell about 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.130
 money 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.700
 giner is probably the most popular one 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.870
 among the newbies additive 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.620
 popularity and and probably explains 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.240
 the fact that giner is the most probably 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.370
 working product that helps 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.650
 build muscle mass because we 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.590
 know what to dial 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.510
 the required amount of muscle yes we need 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.670
 always so that the energy in the body was in 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.320
 excess so that the body does not take energy 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.070
 at nights on of our muscles chose 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.720
 muscle amino acids to get 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.960
 the amount of me is small to you always 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.760
 need a lot of carbohydrate heiner just that 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.200
 the most additive which includes itself and 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.780
 muscle growth protein 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.000
 and including carbohydrates to 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.560
 give us energy to workout for 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.450
 workout or for later 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.930
 recovery 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.200
 so gainers probably newcomers along 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.580
 there with protein should be included in the diet 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.920
 only restriction as it were yes I would 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.060
 advised the gainer to people with whom 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.040
 suffer overweight 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.630
 because all the same excess calories yes 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.400
 he is still good for a beginner 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.210
 athletes who do not quite know 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:19.620
 your body will not give anything that giner 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:23.170
 have sugar and more 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.340
 simple so let's say carbohydrates are located 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.530
 and it is difficult yes there is 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.230
 there are they are divided by protein composition 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.480
 differ in carbohydrate composition in 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.910
 including gainers which includes 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.310
 yourself as 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:41.820
 protein whey isolates and in quality 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.370
 carbohydrates complex carbohydrates eat i measure 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:49.080
 which includes complex protein 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:53.010
 and simple carbohydrates in the form of sugar and those and those 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:56.340
 money has a place to be up depends on 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.050
 what goals you want to achieve and from 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.120
 inclination let's say let's say 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.970
 the fullness is a matter of how the shot 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.790
 catch things so gainers where more 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.160
 sugar they are more suitable for people who 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.110
 very poorly gaining weight like 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.850
 maximize the color by 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.910
 simple sugars this is probably 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.970
 easy way to dial there 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:20.820
 some kilos very thin guys 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:24.389
 for those who have some extra weight 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.580
 d'alema let's gain good 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:29.160
 muscle mass but would still for them 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.940
 there and preferred will be gainers with 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.940
 complex carbohydrates
