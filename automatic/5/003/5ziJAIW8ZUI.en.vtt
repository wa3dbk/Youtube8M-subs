00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.440
 and how about all the friends of youtube 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.540
 who are seeing us and greetings to all 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.180
 those of the forum to inform dyn in the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.119
 section of carnivorous plants and good the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.500
 first question of this video is 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.740
 what kind of water do our 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.450
 plants as everyone already knows 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.180
 carnivorous plants need water 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.790
 distilled what does it mean water without 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.790
 salts or nutrients or be completely 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350
 pure and how to know if our water that you 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.629
 we throw to our plants is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.080
 completely pure because it 's easy and 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.260
 simple there was a physicist named michael 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.920
 Faraday who discovered the following 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.680
 problem that is called electrolysis that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.910
 electrolysis when there is a substance 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.270
 in the water in this case 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.809
 nhl which is sodium chloride or is made 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.110
 salt and when you put two electrodes in 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.640
 solution 1 is positive and 1 is 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.180
 negative then he nhl the chloride 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.070
 sodium has two sides in line that 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.170
 is positive and the cl that is negative 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.979
 then online that is positive 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.400
 you can say it's line to the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.460
 electrode 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.400
 negative this happens because they attract and 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.100
 the cele which is negative joins the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.140
 positive electrode and it is thus signs 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.020
 different attract or that's supposed to 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.470
 they make the magnets more or less and well that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.380
 is what it does is like forming a bridge 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.000
 what causes that in this case like this there is 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.390
 a little connected the focus on that 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.950
 turn on and then if this happens 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.190
 when you add salt or any other 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.530
 substance then what happens if you put the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.630
 electrodes in the absence of some other 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.600
 substance or those things is simply 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.840
 pure water as nothing more and nothing less than 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.120
 that bridge does not occur and therefore the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760
 focus does not turn on then the focus is like 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.430
 an indicator 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.049
 if you turn on that there are salts if you turn on 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.230
 little is that there are few salts and if not 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:23.019
 it catches nothing is that there is nothing of salts 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.930
 then this is the point of my video 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.650
 and let's check this theorem 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.970
 maikel 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.970
 and good let's start 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.260
 Well first of all I'm going to give you a 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.209
 small recommendation 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.209
 and it's next if they are going to buy water 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.120
 for your plants in a market or in a 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.739
 commercial store should be posted here 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.940
 on the information label 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.480
 nutrimental 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.100
 that does not contain anything at all 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.350
 of sales 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.810
 ok here says sodium 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.670
 but we do not look there are other there are other 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.940
 watermarks that contain 5 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.400
 milligrams that helps us because it contains 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.600
 5 milligrams of sodium then what 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.880
 we need is that I have nothing 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.840
 absolutely nothing as you can see this 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.840
 it has nothing 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.870
 here we have commercial water 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.770
 rainwater from this bottle as what 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.770
 can see be dirty 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.650
 and here we have tap water ok now 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.840
 we will proceed to verify the theory of 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.510
 a moment ago but it was a 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.800
 home device 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.270
 while 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.270
 make an opinion to the video 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.400
 and there are likes 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.860
 ok good that tap or tap water 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.220
 as you want to call it and let's see what 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.220
 happens 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.890
 the focus turns as I saw the 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
 internal theory that means that 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.470
 contains salts in the water then by 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.370
 So it does not work for our plants 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.640
 what is rainwater and let's see what 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.950
 pass 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.569
 they noticed it light very little 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.700
 comparison of this one 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.400
 then it means that you have very 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.870
 few salts in the water therefore if 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.430
 It's good for our plants but still 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.239
 contains salts 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.500
 and now let's see the commercial water that 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.500
 we buy that does not contain salts 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.700
 As you can see, nothing happens 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.820
 that means that it contains nothing 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.280
 absolutely nothing of salts which 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.380
 means that it is optimal fit and 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.290
 special for our plants so 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.390
 You already know where and how to buy your 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.550
 water for your plants 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.430
 if they want to put together a device like 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.040
 these 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.040
 it's very easy very simple if it sounds 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.160
 wrong then well for you if you do not ask for the 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.730
 video if it reaches 50 likes I'll upload it 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.730
 it will continue as 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.180
 those are my carnivorous many sticks 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.180
 follicular 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.310
 they are very large either good yet 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.240
 He is not an adult but he is already big 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.240
 he is very handsome 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.850
 and he gave me nothing 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.080
 there is a small thing 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.230
 and this was sold to me as a dependent 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:51.060
 That can be the truth I do not know if it is or not 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.060
 write what they think how they see it 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.950
 well then 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.870
 let me tell you that those three plants 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.870
 are the ones that have given me the best 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.990
 I have rude 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.900
 but the only real island and 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:19.759
 deformed 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.759
 I have the spatulata experience 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.190
 but not those I do not know why they are not like that 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.050
 supposed to be easy 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:32.849
 you can already create on the sofa lotus 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.600
 and you can redeem it 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.780
 good 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:42.300
 that has been everything and I hope that if I am 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.300
 something wrong that say 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.529
 if you liked the video of the little hand 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.109
 above 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:53.109
 are committed subscribe 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:58.469
 see you next video 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.410
 one
