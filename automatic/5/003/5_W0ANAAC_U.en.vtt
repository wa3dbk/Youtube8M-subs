00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
not all that surprising when you look at

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.910 
not all that surprising when you look at
the<00:00:36.390> figures<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:36.899> instance<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.739> said

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the figures for instance like you said

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.260 
the figures for instance like you said
and<00:00:38.040> mention<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> US<00:00:38.879> will<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.180> actually

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and mention the US will they actually

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.869 
and mention the US will they actually
spend<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.780> 10<00:00:40.020> times<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.469> much<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:41.430> Russia

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
spend about 10 times as much as Russia

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.729 
spend about 10 times as much as Russia
and<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.149> comes<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> its<00:00:42.540> military<00:00:42.870> also<00:00:43.350> you

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and it comes to its military also you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.260 
and it comes to its military also you
got<00:00:43.860> other<00:00:44.040> nation<00:00:44.460> countries<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.000> Britain

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
got other nation countries of Britain

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.360 
got other nation countries of Britain
France<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.559> there's<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.800> lot<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> try<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
France and then there's a lot to try and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
France and then there's a lot to try and
they're<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.579> above<00:00:47.969> Russia<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> constant

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
they're all above Russia and a constant

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.560 
they're all above Russia and a constant
military<00:00:50.070> spending<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> expect<00:00:51.300> them<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
military spending so you expect them to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.000 
military spending so you expect them to
be<00:00:51.629> putting<00:00:51.960> aside<00:00:52.050> more<00:00:52.440> when<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> comes<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
be putting aside more when it comes to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.270 
be putting aside more when it comes to
research<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> development<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.980> it's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
research and development now really it's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
research and development now really it's
not<00:00:56.460> about<00:00:56.610> what's<00:00:57.390> been<00:00:57.660> said<00:00:57.870> rather<00:00:58.079> how
