America<00:00:32.300> at<00:00:33.300> first<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.690> saw<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.900> sailed<00:00:34.290> around

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
America at first I saw a sailed around

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.370 
America at first I saw a sailed around
the<00:00:34.770> Caribbean<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> saw<00:00:37.230> those

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the Caribbean and then I saw those

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.200 
the Caribbean and then I saw those
sailed<00:00:37.650> around<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:38.310> North<00:00:38.460> Atlantic<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
sailed around the North Atlantic and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.120 
sailed around the North Atlantic and
then<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> saw<00:00:40.140> sailed<00:00:40.500> around<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> world

stopping<00:00:41.610> twice<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.340> now

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
stopping twice so now

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.290 
stopping twice so now
so<00:00:49.070> I've<00:00:49.220> learned<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.520> lot<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.700> things<00:00:49.940> along

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
so I've learned a lot of things along

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.120 
so I've learned a lot of things along
the<00:00:50.480> way<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.810> then<00:00:50.930> going<00:00:51.500> forward<00:00:51.950> to<00:00:52.040> do

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
the way and then going forward to do

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.290 
the way and then going forward to do
things<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.460> little<00:00:52.550> bit<00:00:52.730> differently<00:00:53.120> in

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
things a little bit differently in

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.720 
things a little bit differently in
assembling<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:54.560> have<00:00:55.040> four<00:00:55.340> children

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
assembling I have four children

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.690 
assembling I have four children
I<00:00:55.850> have<00:00:56.030> 11<00:00:56.210> grandchildren<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.410> it's<00:00:58.400> gonna

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
I have 11 grandchildren and it's gonna

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.979 
I have 11 grandchildren and it's gonna
be<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:58.850> little<00:00:59.090> different<00:00:59.239> for<00:00:59.510> me<00:00:59.630> this<00:00:59.780> time

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
be a little different for me this time

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.410 
be a little different for me this time
because<00:01:00.380> I<00:01:00.410> didn't<00:01:01.309> have<00:01:01.489> all<00:01:02.210> those

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
because I didn't have all those

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.060 
because I didn't have all those
grandchildren<00:01:02.780> before<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.440> left

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
grandchildren before I left

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.190 
grandchildren before I left

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
so it's interesting leaving my 10 year

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.380 
so it's interesting leaving my 10 year
old<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.650> 12<00:01:07.340> year<00:01:07.550> old<00:01:07.729> grandchildren

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
trapped and I'll have the opportunity of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.010 
trapped and I'll have the opportunity of
the<00:01:57.170> email
