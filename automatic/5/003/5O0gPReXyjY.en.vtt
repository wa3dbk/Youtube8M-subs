opinion the Jeep is proportioned well
for<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> most<00:01:10.020> part<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:11.159> from<00:01:11.430> above<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
for the most part but from above the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.990 
for the most part but from above the
sides<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.530> diagonal<00:01:14.010> angle<00:01:14.549> due<00:01:14.850> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
sides go off at a diagonal angle due to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.660 
sides go off at a diagonal angle due to
how<00:01:15.150> he<00:01:15.210> transforms<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:19.590> rolls<00:01:19.830> along<00:01:20.040> okay

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
how he transforms it rolls along okay

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.030 
how he transforms it rolls along okay
but<00:01:21.479> only<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.409> surfaces<00:01:24.439> in<00:01:25.439> general

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
but only on some surfaces in general

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.740 
but only on some surfaces in general
it's<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.299> bad<00:01:27.570> vehicle<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> size<00:01:29.750> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it's not a bad vehicle for the size the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.010 
it's not a bad vehicle for the size the
transformation<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.860> pretty<00:01:32.490> basic<00:01:32.750> as<00:01:33.750> you'd

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
