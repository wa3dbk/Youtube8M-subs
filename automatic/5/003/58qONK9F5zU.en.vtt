00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.179 
to so they can use as much memory on my
computer<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.240> possible<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.950> breaks

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
computer as possible and it like breaks

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
computer as possible and it like breaks
up<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.610> some<00:01:38.759> reason<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.479> it'll<00:01:39.630> break

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
up for some reason now like it'll break

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.679 
up for some reason now like it'll break
it<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.799> 200<00:01:41.610> two<00:01:42.180> minutes<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it up in them like 200 two minutes and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.679 
it up in them like 200 two minutes and
50<00:01:42.899> second<00:01:43.259> parts<00:01:43.590> kind<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> thing<00:01:44.399> i<00:01:44.689> really

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
50 second parts kind of thing i really

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.499 
50 second parts kind of thing i really
don't<00:01:45.930> know<00:01:45.990> why<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.549> video<00:01:47.820> turns<00:01:48.360> out

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
don't know why but one video turns out

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.590 
don't know why but one video turns out
to<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.720> about<00:01:48.930> 16<00:01:49.500> gigabytes<00:01:50.180> once<00:01:51.180> i<00:01:51.299> delete

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to be about 16 gigabytes once i delete

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.270 
to be about 16 gigabytes once i delete
the<00:01:51.810> actual<00:01:52.110> thing<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.290> render<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:52.829> an<00:01:52.920> mp4

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the actual thing and render it as an mp4

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.060 
the actual thing and render it as an mp4
which<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:53.970> makes<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.360> about<00:01:54.770> 300<00:01:55.770> megabytes

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
which then makes it about 300 megabytes

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
which then makes it about 300 megabytes
so<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> pretty<00:01:57.149> big<00:01:57.360> difference<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
so that's a pretty big difference I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.959 
so that's a pretty big difference I
really<00:01:58.140> don't<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.320> why<00:01:58.500> they<00:01:59.189> do<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.520> but

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
really don't know why they do that but

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.569 
really don't know why they do that but
they<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:01.710> sorry<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.430> was

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
they do and I sorry for this I was

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.370 
they do and I sorry for this I was
trying<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> chitchat<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.020> accidentally

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
trying to chitchat and I accidentally

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.340 
trying to chitchat and I accidentally
hit<00:02:04.500> running<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:06.000> shift<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.659> then<00:02:06.840> hit<00:02:07.049> tab

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
hit running the shift and then hit tab

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
hit running the shift and then hit tab
and<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:08.369> brings<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> same<00:02:09.060> thing<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
and that brings up the same thing and I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.550 
and that brings up the same thing and I
really<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.840> wanted<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.229> bring<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.440> the
