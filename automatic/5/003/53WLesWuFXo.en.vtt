00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
well I did most of it myself but it is a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.200 
well I did most of it myself but it is a
1989<00:02:05.020> alcohol<00:02:05.829> funny<00:02:06.100> car<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.579> i<00:02:06.610> modified

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
1989 alcohol funny car that i modified

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.539 
1989 alcohol funny car that i modified
myself<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.869> then<00:02:08.500> we<00:02:08.679> built<00:02:08.890> all<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.160> rest<00:02:09.340> of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
myself and then we built all the rest of

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.750 
myself and then we built all the rest of
it<00:02:09.700> but<00:02:10.470> something<00:02:11.470> something<00:02:11.890> drastic<00:02:12.579> went

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
it but something something drastic went

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.210 
it but something something drastic went
along<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.209> motor<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.769> fuel<00:02:15.010> tank

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
along in the motor and but the fuel tank

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.310 
along in the motor and but the fuel tank
was<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.489> fire<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.730> haven't<00:02:16.150> figured<00:02:17.110> what

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
was on fire and haven't figured what

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.039 
was on fire and haven't figured what
caused<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:18.070> happen<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:19.269> now<00:02:19.540> we<00:02:19.840> did<00:02:20.019> a

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
caused that to happen and now we did a

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.440 
caused that to happen and now we did a
backfire<00:02:20.680> or<00:02:20.739> something<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.850> fuel<00:02:22.120> tank<00:02:22.360> was

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
backfire or something the fuel tank was

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.810 
backfire or something the fuel tank was
actually<00:02:22.810> on<00:02:22.930> fire<00:02:23.170> before<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.620> backfired<00:02:24.130> and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
actually on fire before it backfired and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.430 
actually on fire before it backfired and
so<00:02:25.299> that's<00:02:25.450> really<00:02:25.660> strange<00:02:26.079> sometimes

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
so that's really strange sometimes

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.810 
so that's really strange sometimes
they'll<00:02:26.799> back<00:02:26.980> fire<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.370> fire<00:02:27.579> I'll<00:02:27.670> get

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
they'll back fire in a fire I'll get

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.699 
they'll back fire in a fire I'll get
into<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.239> but<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:29.019> some<00:02:29.230> reason<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.590> was

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
into it but for some reason it was

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.100 
into it but for some reason it was
already<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.190> fire<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:31.090> now<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.570> something

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
already on fire so now is that something

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.630 
already on fire so now is that something
that<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.350> can<00:02:32.500> take<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.860> car<00:02:33.070> apart<00:02:33.190> take<00:02:33.519> the

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
motor apart and find out exactly what

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.960 
motor apart and find out exactly what
happened<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.280> we<00:02:36.370> don't<00:02:36.549> have<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.850> problem

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970
