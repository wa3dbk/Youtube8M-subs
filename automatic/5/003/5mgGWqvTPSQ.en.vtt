00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.879
 [Music] 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:24.199
 [Music] 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.300
 now image of capillary loaded and me 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.740
 now let go some different ways 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.839
 see where you can convert this photo 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.190
 to black and white 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.300
 first way is image mode 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.450
 grayscale 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.219
 I choose that I eat then goes 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.190
 he all color information from it 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.600
 delete file well that's one 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.890
 way of black and white 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.079
 I'm going to show different ways 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.610
 to be able to do that together 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.270
 I will compare in it 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.399
 history palette here just a recording 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.750
 make the conversion that I did now 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.180
 have got 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.620
 so i press new recording i will take that 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.989
 also mention 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.710
 grayscale then I also know what I am 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.590
 and now I can go back to 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.180
 I can use the original file again 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.040
 show another way of converting 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.960
 with grayscale 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.030
 you also get all red green and blue 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.049
 information from the image 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.470
 you can also do it in a different way 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.909
 solve can choose image 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.700
 modifications 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.590
 hue and saturation well it colors 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.479
 then you can put all the colors in the photo 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.340
 I like to change once 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.360
 try but we don't find anything 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.460
 with it 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.649
 the brightness that makes it lower 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.119
 you make the photo dark or lighter 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.799
 how much nothing but I go with that 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.960
 middle works 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.750
 the saturation that I can raise some 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.070
 all the sparkling 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.229
 and if I increase it even further 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.790
 it unusable 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.310
 surreal but I can also see the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.700
 decrease saturation and if I do 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.229
 almost do for example up to min 100 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.670
 to that example he must min 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.659
 100 then I have a black and white image 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.330
 I'll also have a new one there 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.670
 include recording in the story palette 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.670
 okay and then you might think he is 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.870
 same but are already 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.000
 differences in as you see between so 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.049
 the grayscale conversion and the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.940
 conversion 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.290
 through the saturation I will have that too 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.909
 saturation 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.909
 they can recognize him 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.959
 good to have two this way 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.450
 conversions I'm going back to 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.670
 my original file and I'm still ahead 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.110
 a third conversion 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.269
 that third order for shipment is actually the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.569
 most beautiful conversion 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:48.060
 you can choose for 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.060
 image adjustments black and white filter 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.670
 and with that it already makes one 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.799
 black and white image but the good thing is i can 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.569
 now with the color information provided in the 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.120
 picture is going to play 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.459
 and I can do that with slides 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.500
 for example you can get all the red information 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.060
 in the image 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.040
 make them lighter to those they red 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.840
 in but for example blue information 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.260
 I can make it lighter but what a sky 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.819
 so light i can also choose to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.230
 not to do that 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.640
 I can also do this completely outside 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.849
 put the picture 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.519
 so waste this way and what you now 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.069
 what I see in the image is that I have a pipette 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.130
 to see get a pipette is very beautiful 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.489
 instrument because if I do 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.859
 impression and hold then I see one 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.319
 finger come into view with the arrow 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.030
 to the left or right 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.400
 that actually means that I have a color 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.950
 in the picture 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.769
 I now populate the blue fairly fairly 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.260
 know that your sky is originally blue as 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.109
 I now move the slide to the right while 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.530
 me holding the mouse button 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.840
 all blue information lighter 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.569
 I put the mouse left becomes all 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.370
 blue information darker 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.560
 maybe a lot of interesting we 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.019
 this makes contrast high 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.530
 between the clouds in the sky so you want 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:15.280
 I do in this case 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.440
 well kind of extreme this way i can 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.280
 for example also here on the trees 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.560
 hold down and take a look 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.900
 what happens if I for example those 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.510
 Create shade lighter 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.210
 well that just doesn't seem right to me 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.020
 during because I think it's beautiful that 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.430
 those villages stand out compared to the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.780
 surroundings 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.370
 so I actually want to go the other way 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.420
 yes then i go with that to my site 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.340
 left 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.160
 and the more I go to the left 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.140
 it doesn't have to be darker that child 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.180
 exaggerate but this is certainly possible 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.150
 I think 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.380
 so and so you can if you have more colors 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.610
 you can sit in a photo there 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.860
 all play along 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.810
 I press OK and I have a whole one again 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.670
 other conversion besides we this the neighborhood 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.550
 have much more control 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.650
 if we now have a recording entertainment 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.200
 Then you see that this is the first one 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.870
 conversion to grayscale 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.460
 this is the second color tone conversion 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.900
 saturation where I put the saturation on 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.970
 100 set 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.600
 this is the third and for me the 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.100
 best way to make this 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.830
 image adjustments black and white 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.240
 where I can color with the slide 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.240
 and stick to it 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.520
 [Music] 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.570
 my tip would make you feel all this 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.370
 conversions 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.870
 put it out of your mind when you go to that 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.390
 places and landscape 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.810
 You know exactly why I put it best 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.810
 to suit you
