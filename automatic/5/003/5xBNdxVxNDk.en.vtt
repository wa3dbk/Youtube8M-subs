unfortunately I need costumes ready

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.710 
unfortunately I need costumes ready
because<00:03:29.130> he<00:03:29.459> thinks<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:30.000> they<00:03:30.180> will<00:03:30.420> be

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
because he thinks that they will be

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.440 
because he thinks that they will be
perfect<00:03:31.350> for<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.680> part<00:03:31.709> but<00:03:32.310> doesn't<00:03:33.209> he<00:03:33.300> have

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
perfect for the part but doesn't he have

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.140 
perfect for the part but doesn't he have
to<00:03:33.480> interview<00:03:34.080> them<00:03:34.260> first<00:03:34.560> their<00:03:35.519> callback

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
to interview them first their callback

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.820 
to interview them first their callback
so<00:03:36.450> they<00:03:36.570> might<00:03:36.720> as<00:03:36.870> well<00:03:37.019> already<00:03:37.350> be<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.800> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
so they might as well already be in the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.940 
so they might as well already be in the
bag<00:03:38.220> but<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.209> can't<00:03:39.570> because<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.620> have<00:03:40.830> to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
bag but I can't because you have to

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.070 
bag but I can't because you have to
understand<00:03:41.550> how<00:03:42.209> long<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.570> takes<00:03:42.780> for<00:03:43.050> one

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
understand how long it takes for one

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.710 
understand how long it takes for one
piece<00:03:43.800> of<00:03:43.950> clothing<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.370> be<00:03:44.550> made<00:03:44.790> let<00:03:45.450> alone
