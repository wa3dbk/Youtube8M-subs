 multiplication method 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.560
 let's look at the beginning as usual 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.119

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.589
 powerful number of kenesh 15 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.169
 square erected 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.169
 we all know what happens is 10 25 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 no usually cheater 15 0 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.640
 15 ovens 15 5 says the phrase do not know 35 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.899
 so here it is just to stay 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.860
 ten 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.860
 5 from May 10, cisse 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.289

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.469
 and now I'll show you the ways of the Afipsky 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.010
 investment 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.560
 question graphically means sorry 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.480

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 such a 15 squared is 15 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 need to 15 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.930
 the first number here but 15 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.640
 we will draw 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.970
 and vertical 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.970
 I'll show you everything 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.290

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.550
 one striped 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.990
 then we have five pages first number 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.890
 equip number draws glasses wands 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.890
 dispatcher will not count 5 vertical 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.900
 minin of cuts 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.360
 four 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.940
 at 5 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.490
 octane number blinkin draw 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.140
 Zanthary Magat I mean this number on the left 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.740
 right vertically authors number above 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.340
 down horizontally we have a dozen 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.960
 because today shot 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 five units 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 draw them as close as possible 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.220
 near so ok 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.620
 start on the left upper edge of 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.810
 tutmos at the intersection 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 1 st 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.719
 here and because we have 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.889
 it turns out 1 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.869
 now here weeks 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.849
 since access is obtained from us 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.320
 almost 4 5 at times two 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.180
 3 4 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.199
 5 these 15 years so that something like that has not left yet 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.670
 and here is a chance 2 3 4 5 game with 24 5 10 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.649
 so well we have already received but we have but 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.279
 such an approach to dinner 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.029
 now just follow the currency 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.029
 exclude by number 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.889
 but preferably with a view from the top down who 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:44.909
 subscribe 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.019
 in the direction 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.019
 we see it here 25 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.359
 Well, no, this should not be because 25 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.069
 should stay at 5 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.869
 that is, in the bank we will invite in 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:59.199
 superior 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.219
 court number 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.219
 that is, 10 plus two turns 12 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:08.679
 but we see and that here 12 12 should be 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.679
 there should be two cakes left 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.919
 so we are not transferring units yet 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.919
 superior one plus one 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.249
 from the demolition is obtained 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.399
 bar 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.889
 for convenience, you can cross out Kiev here 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 what we transfer 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.249
 here is a bank 5 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.249
 all that answer 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.789
 but not immediately clear 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.709
 and do a little bit 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.709
 not released show another way 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.209
 count the other numbers are not already 15 submit 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.289
 example 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.149
 21 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.069
 nonna lukoil cop what is he with this 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.059
 eg 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:05.089
 in the third minute of game 10 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.089
 need a lot 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.389
 eleven 400 thousand need to love their descendants
