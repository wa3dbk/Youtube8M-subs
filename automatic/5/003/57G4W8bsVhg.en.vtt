versus drum lines hands and you know
what<00:00:17.789> technique<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.359> kind<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.840> it

what technique do you kind of do is it
more<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.230> drum<00:00:19.500> line<00:00:19.650> thing<00:00:19.920> or<00:00:20.130> drum<00:00:20.340> set

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
more of a drum line thing or drum set

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.420 
more of a drum line thing or drum set
thing<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:22.289> question<00:00:22.680> kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.949> mystifies

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
thing and the question kind of mystifies

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
thing and the question kind of mystifies
me<00:00:23.460> because<00:00:23.939> good<00:00:24.240> hands<00:00:24.660> are<00:00:24.779> good<00:00:24.930> hands<00:00:25.410> you

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
me because good hands are good hands you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.130 
me because good hands are good hands you
have<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> complete<00:00:26.340> toolbox<00:00:26.910> or<00:00:27.480> an<00:00:27.840> incomplete

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
have a complete toolbox or an incomplete

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.880 
have a complete toolbox or an incomplete
toolbox<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.789> find<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:31.590> old

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
toolbox so I find that the old

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.069 
toolbox so I find that the old
stereotype<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.450> drum<00:00:33.660> line<00:00:33.840> guys

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
stereotype is that the drum line guys

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.310 
stereotype is that the drum line guys
are<00:00:34.350> very<00:00:34.500> rigid<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.219> tight<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
are very rigid and tight and

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.840 
are very rigid and tight and
unfortunately<00:00:37.320> yes<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.190> used<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> be

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
unfortunately yes it used to be

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.360 
unfortunately yes it used to be
especially<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.809> way<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
especially that way and you know the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.100 
especially that way and you know the
drum<00:00:41.610> line<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.059> drum<00:00:42.300> sets<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.629> oh<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.989> all

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
drum line the drum sets like oh it's all

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500 
drum line the drum sets like oh it's all
just<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.500> flowing<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.160> natural<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.879> yes

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
just so flowing and natural and yes

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.459 
just so flowing and natural and yes
that's<00:00:45.899> great

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that's great

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.740 
that's great
sometimes<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.149> tell<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.719> sure

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sometimes but I can tell you for sure

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.920 
sometimes but I can tell you for sure
that<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> students<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.480> drum

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that of all the students I get the drum

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.100 
that of all the students I get the drum
set<00:00:52.170> players<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:53.090> without<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.239> doubt<00:00:54.360> way

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
set players are without a doubt way

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470 
set players are without a doubt way
tighter<00:00:55.760> consistently<00:00:56.760> than<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> drum

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
tighter consistently than all the drum

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.189 
tighter consistently than all the drum
line<00:00:57.660> guys<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.989> use

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
line guys so I don't really have you use

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.779 
line guys so I don't really have you use
different<00:01:01.410> tools<00:01:01.770> depending<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.609> you're

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
different tools depending on what you're

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.539 
different tools depending on what you're
playing<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.989> there's<00:01:04.530> complete<00:01:04.979> technique

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
playing so there's complete technique

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
playing so there's complete technique
where<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.360> allows<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.110> anything<00:01:07.500> on

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
where it allows you to do anything on

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
where it allows you to do anything on
any<00:01:08.189> surface<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.330> definitely<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
any surface and that's definitely what I

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.730 
any surface and that's definitely what I
teach

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
teach

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
teach
I<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.280> delineate<00:01:11.850> between<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.360> two<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
I don't delineate between the two you

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
I don't delineate between the two you
know<00:01:13.260> sometimes<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.159> play<00:01:14.280> something<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
know sometimes you play something a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.570 
know sometimes you play something a
little<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.180> more<00:01:15.210> refined<00:01:15.810> or<00:01:16.320> defined<00:01:16.860> other

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
little bit more refined or defined other

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.429 
little bit more refined or defined other
times<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.150> let<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.570> fly<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.140> flop<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
times you let it just fly and flop a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
times you let it just fly and flop a
little<00:01:19.799> more<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.700> thing<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.000> we're<00:01:21.750> doing

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
little more but the thing is we're doing

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
little more but the thing is we're doing
that<00:01:22.140> these<00:01:22.320> days<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.799> both<00:01:23.189> sides<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that these days on both sides on you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.440 
that these days on both sides on you
know

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
know

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.100 
know
rudimental<00:01:25.350> drum<00:01:25.770> line<00:01:25.979> ish<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.460> drum<00:01:26.970> set<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
rudimental drum line ish and drum set so

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.510 
rudimental drum line ish and drum set so
it's<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.950> matter<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.189> having<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it's really just a matter of having a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.870 
it's really just a matter of having a
complete<00:01:29.790> toolbox<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> drum

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
complete toolbox the you know the drum

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
complete toolbox the you know the drum
set<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.420> tend<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> play<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> lot<00:01:34.560> more<00:01:34.590> free

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
set I tend to play a lot more free

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.969 
set I tend to play a lot more free
stroke<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.119> Moeller<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:37.409> based

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
stroke and a lot more Moeller just based

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.649 
stroke and a lot more Moeller just based
on<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> vocabulary<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> instrument

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
on the vocabulary in the instrument

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
on the vocabulary in the instrument
being<00:01:39.869> played<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:41.100> drum<00:01:41.549> line<00:01:41.729> wise

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
being played and then drum line wise

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.200 
being played and then drum line wise
well<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> play<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.259> things<00:01:43.590> right

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
well I play the same things right

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.940 
well I play the same things right
sometimes<00:01:45.210> there's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.479> little<00:01:45.600> bit<00:01:45.750> more

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
sometimes there's a little bit more

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.499 
sometimes there's a little bit more
downstrokes<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.159> kite<00:01:47.340> definition<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
downstrokes to kite definition and it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
downstrokes to kite definition and it
has<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.200> order<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> execute<00:01:49.979> some<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
has to be in order to execute some of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.469 
has to be in order to execute some of
those<00:01:50.399> things<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.880> can't<00:01:51.060> have

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
those things you can't have

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.660 
those things you can't have
