3g<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.519> off<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:23.880> turn<00:00:24.090> bluetooth<00:00:24.390> on

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720

3g on and off you can turn bluetooth on
on<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> off<00:00:25.320> Wi-Fi<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.369> off<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.820> just

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
on and off Wi-Fi on and off and just

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.660 
on and off Wi-Fi on and off and just
edge<00:00:27.599> data<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.289> off<00:00:28.380> now<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> biggest

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
edge data on and off now the biggest

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.749 
edge data on and off now the biggest
benefit<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.900> my<00:00:31.050> opinion<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.130> 3g

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
benefit of this in my opinion is the 3g

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.330 
benefit of this in my opinion is the 3g
toggle<00:00:33.300> because<00:00:33.930> 3g<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.980> battery

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
toggle because 3g is just a battery

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.790 
toggle because 3g is just a battery
using<00:00:36.030> whore<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.559> turn<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
using whore and because you can turn it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.170 
using whore and because you can turn it
off<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.070> you're<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:38.430> using<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.850> really

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
off when you're not using it really

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.340 
off when you're not using it really
quickly<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> makes<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> lot<00:00:40.290> more

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
apps but I don't really use it the same

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
apps but I don't really use it the same
way<00:01:17.189> most<00:01:17.369> people<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.600> use<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> like

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
way most people do I just use it to like

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.469 
way most people do I just use it to like
preview<00:01:19.860> apps<00:01:20.070> look<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> free

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
preview apps look that don't have a free

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.210 
preview apps look that don't have a free
version<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.259> bottom<00:01:22.530> later<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
version so I can bottom later because I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
version so I can bottom later because I
believe<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.640> supporting<00:01:23.790> developers<00:01:24.750> but

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
believe in supporting developers but

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.840 
believe in supporting developers but

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
so it's not too much to that application

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.039 
so it's not too much to that application
now<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> next<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> show<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> guys

is my why I've already done have one
video<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.920> application<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:39.060> basically

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
video on this application but basically

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.850 
video on this application but basically
what<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.750> lets<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> lets<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
enabled device now all you have to do is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.249 
enabled device now all you have to do is
turn<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.579> Wi-Fi<00:01:50.909> tethering<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
turn on the Wi-Fi tethering and then you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.690 
turn on the Wi-Fi tethering and then you
can<00:01:52.380> add<00:01:52.470> security<00:01:52.799> options<00:01:53.250> everything<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
can add security options everything you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.280 
can add security options everything you
can<00:01:53.820> put<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> large<00:01:54.149> security<00:01:54.630> code<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.020> so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
can put a large security code on it so

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.039 
can put a large security code on it so
not<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.040> anybody<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.490> use<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.049> your
