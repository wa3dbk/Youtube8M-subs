00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.799
 in January 2001 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.480
 the social workers decided not to take the children out because 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.649
 cleaned the apartment 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.730
 the things in the house are much easier the bigger baby see ni 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.490
 they take place in a daycare 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.669
 and who have their parents for him alone all day 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.070
 with all this attention how will it come out in the skill test 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.300
 you can not do it 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.840
 start you can put a maximum of three 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.120
 this is very smart 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.190
 very well 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.990
 efe the theater has a brilliant job at the moment they continue 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.180
 very lie 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.010
 we have not raised 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 everything is one more 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 contrary 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.490
 mayor authority 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.310
 is to say this 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.100
 15 27 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 me too 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.740
 the creator is indeed very good 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.380
 according to Kelly and if it would not pass the test they did 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.560
 and they can already before is so smart 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.700
 I feel very good but now 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.850
 in this track so changed 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.570
 You can put the birthday cake in another place for Japan 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.130
 so then I can finish with the rest of the kitchen itself and then 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.130
 to see what the cake looks like 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180
 Carol prepares for tennis's number one birthday 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.560
 increases but I do not have much money but I bought a little here and there 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.340
 weekly 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 maybe because I planned it in advance 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.170
 nobody ask me anything they want 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.810
