there's<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.490> very<00:00:17.699> good<00:00:17.880> reason<00:00:18.029> why<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.449> is

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
there's a very good reason why this is

so tactically superior as well as even

so tactically superior as well as even
with<00:00:22.320> power<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.359> uppercut<00:00:25.019> when

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
with power one is that the uppercut when

with power one is that the uppercut when
it<00:00:25.560> comes<00:00:25.769> through<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.189> under<00:00:26.670> your

focus on coming in the inside tend to go
to<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> outside<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.289> focus<00:01:01.559> more<00:01:01.710> on

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
to the outside and focus more on

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.799 
to the outside and focus more on
striking<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> center<00:01:03.300> line<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.570> usually

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
striking so the center line is usually

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.620 
striking so the center line is usually
open<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.589> your<00:01:04.920> attacker<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:06.119> other<00:01:06.240> thing<00:01:06.479> is

that<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.409> uppercut<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> primary<00:01:08.369> target

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that in the uppercut the primary target

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
that in the uppercut the primary target
there<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.600> chin<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> come<00:01:11.340> up

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
there is the chin so when you come up

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.330

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the chin that is there that can be a

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.999 
the chin that is there that can be a
knockout<00:01:15.090> blow<00:01:15.170> what<00:01:16.170> ends<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.409> happening<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
knockout blow what ends up happening is

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
knockout blow what ends up happening is
it<00:01:17.340> tends<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> throw<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> head<00:01:18.659> back<00:01:18.930> hits<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it tends to throw the head back hits the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.289 
it tends to throw the head back hits the
nerves<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> back<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> spine<00:01:21.000> here

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
nerves in the back of the spine here

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.850 
nerves in the back of the spine here
really<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.750> cinches<00:01:22.170> down<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
really this cinches down on them and it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.429 
really this cinches down on them and it
can<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.159> instant<00:01:23.610> knockout<00:01:23.850> blow<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> very

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
can be an instant knockout blow and very

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.190 
can be an instant knockout blow and very
very<00:01:25.680> powerful<00:01:25.970> now<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.390> problem<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.930> though

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
very powerful now the problem is though

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.649 
very powerful now the problem is though
with<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> uppercut<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.240> number<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.540> if

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
with the uppercut it's the number one if

with the uppercut it's the number one if
you're<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> boxing<00:01:31.530> ring<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.280> don't

you're trying to punch with an uppercut

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.449 
you're trying to punch with an uppercut
you<00:02:08.340> end<00:02:08.489> up<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> angle<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
you end up the way that the angle is is

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.309 
you end up the way that the angle is is
that<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.849> wrist<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.330> already<00:02:12.810> starting<00:02:13.290> to

make I fit my target what ends up
happening<00:02:18.629> is<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.260> really<00:02:19.470> folds<00:02:20.010> my<00:02:20.129> wrists

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
happening is it really folds my wrists

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.740 
happening is it really folds my wrists
and<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:21.060> don't<00:02:21.209> want<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> take<00:02:21.540> out<00:02:21.690> your

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
and you don't want to take out your

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.259 
and you don't want to take out your
primary<00:02:22.500> striking<00:02:23.040> tool<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.489> you're<00:02:23.580> just

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
primary striking tool if you're just

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.300 
primary striking tool if you're just
hand<00:02:24.480> right<00:02:24.810> here<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.620> want<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.040> able<00:02:26.160> to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
hand right here you want to be able to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.100 
hand right here you want to be able to
be<00:02:26.610> able<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.790> use<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.239> without<00:02:27.660> having<00:02:28.050> a

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
be able to use this without having a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.869 
be able to use this without having a
broken<00:02:28.379> wrist<00:02:28.769> not<00:02:29.010> be<00:02:29.160> able<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.400> strike<00:02:29.700> with

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
broken wrist not be able to strike with

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.699 
broken wrist not be able to strike with
it<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.450> there's<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.690> better<00:02:30.930> alternative<00:02:31.140> to

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
it so there's a better alternative to

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.250 
it so there's a better alternative to
the<00:02:31.980> uppercut<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.730> uses<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.360> same<00:02:33.660> benefits

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the uppercut that uses the same benefits

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410 
the uppercut that uses the same benefits
here<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.680> that's<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.220> use<00:02:35.250> your<00:02:35.610> palm<00:02:35.849> heal

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
here and that's to use your palm heal

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.750 
here and that's to use your palm heal
with<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.170> uppercut<00:02:37.590> now<00:02:38.099> here's<00:02:38.310> why<00:02:38.459> it's<00:02:38.640> so

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
with the uppercut now here's why it's so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.160 
with the uppercut now here's why it's so
powerful<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.180> all<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.660> has<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> same

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
powerful that all it has the same

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.350 
powerful that all it has the same
benefits<00:02:40.709> here<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.130> coming<00:02:41.849> in<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> center

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
benefits here as coming in the center

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360 
benefits here as coming in the center
line<00:02:42.540> okay<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.290> with<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> palm<00:02:44.160> heal

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370

better body function here puts more
power<00:03:23.850> behind<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.569> have<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> larger<00:03:25.560> striking

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.340 
power behind it I have a larger striking
service<00:03:26.549> than<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:26.910> my<00:03:27.030> knuckles<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.109> have
