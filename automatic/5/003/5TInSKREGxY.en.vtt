00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.280
 my 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 he 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello to all and today it's a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 great day because I just came from 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.300
 receive via chronopost 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.369
 a brand new console is a 3ds 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 xl special edition evoli and yes 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.550
 he has the right to his special edition and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.350
 I'm pretty happy because he was 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 time he finally makes a pokemon that has 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.670
 of the rating as evoli then it's gone 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.040
 for the discovery of this console everything 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.750
 right away then a little word anyway 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.420
 to start this console for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 acquire it which is not very easy 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.860
 for the 15 years of pokÃ©mon center he 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.570
 organized a lottery you could you 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.410
 register in stores or send 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.510
 nomination 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.790
 then you are drawn for 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.290
 know who will be the lucky ones elected and 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.840
 that they will be able to acquire this console 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.940
 and to be able to buy it especially yes 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 so frankly it's not super simple 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.180
 and it does not even surprise me later 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.880
 she will be good side because she 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.020
 really editing well limit go 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.850
 let's find out right away 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.490
 little wonder a little trick when 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.640
 even on the side of the packaging carton while 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.600
 in Japanese of course and seen 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.310
 edition to mention here is the back and 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.450
 the other side with a little heavy who 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.280
 make a little wink well 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.570
 nice 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.270
 let's open talata bearing now 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.189
 drum and yes a string obviously 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.229
 of records again as in 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.830
 any console as if we did not have 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.659
 already enough 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.670
 so that's all you can have 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.400
 of good denges I will not detail by 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.729
 against and there it looks like small 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.159
 playing cards of some heroes of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.740
 nintendo as you can see mario 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.600
 kirby link except rabon by cons I 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.570
 do not see I leave it as is and 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.560
 now discover the console in its 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.000
 protection at the top the colors that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.070
 represents the creature 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.650
 it reminds me of the wallpaper of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.729
 with me even if it's Saint Paul is 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.239
 nice colors anyway 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.610
 the inside here all in white 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.180
 it is true that he could have added a 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.640
 little bit of 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.170
 little artwork of the little evolis a would have 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.209
 well been no it was maybe too much 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.849
 ask for white back there a 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.060
 little artwork of the little evolved who is 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.519
 nice white too and on the sides 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.569
 it's the same as white keys l 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.799

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.230
