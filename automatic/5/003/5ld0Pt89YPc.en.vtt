00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
basis that literally like everything

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
basis that literally like everything
every<00:01:20.820> single<00:01:20.939> thing<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> be

every single thing that's going to be

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.289 
every single thing that's going to be
shown<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.590> video<00:01:23.030> literally<00:01:24.030> took<00:01:24.180> me

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
shown on this video literally took me

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179 
shown on this video literally took me
like<00:01:24.420> 30<00:01:24.570> minutes<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.049> less<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.890> probably

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
like 30 minutes or less it's probably

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.060 
like 30 minutes or less it's probably
one<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.369> two<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.330> probably<00:01:28.070> didn't

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
one or two think that probably didn't

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.340 
one or two think that probably didn't
take<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.400> short<00:01:30.270> amount<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> time<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.750> longer

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
take that short amount of time to longer

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.719 
take that short amount of time to longer
because<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.860> has<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.130> an<00:01:32.220> other<00:01:32.460> longer

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
because it has to be an other longer

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.120 
because it has to be an other longer
obviously<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:34.880> I'll<00:01:35.880> show<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.600> guys<00:01:36.810> that
