00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 the sum left offensive started 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.469
 toyota segment now in the smallest hybrid 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.230
 the world, so to speak, that the yaris hybrid 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.299
 the hammer now presented reals 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.310
 So hybrid has the precedent that is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.990
 one of the smallest blood of its class 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.539
 is affordable for everyone too is one 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 full vehicle and a frugal 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.189
 vehicle with dirty hybrid technology 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 and just has the advantage of saying that 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.830
 okay that's a vehicle being in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.770
 built in france 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.640
 It is an independent vehicle and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.920
 This can also be done by form of 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 optics of the designers of everything 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.329
 What kind of driving characteristics do we have 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.879
 European vehicle that means we 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.469
 have here 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 characteristics of the european market 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.989
 correspond to the vehicle together on the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 street we have the letter automatics us 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.350
 let everyone on the first 15 meters 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 Researchers at the traffic light stand that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.510
 means an acceleration is enormous 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.939
 of course after 12 15 meters until then 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 Also so far 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.730
 we have to have the annual campaign 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.600
 we too 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.880
 a good a good good standing and 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 in the reason that the vehicle also 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.020
 produced in france in europe 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.090
 it also benefits the price too 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.830
 stable and not not fired 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.620
 because essential to those or 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.400
 fluctuations offered that is at 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.370
 17,000 euros 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.730
 a fifth vehicle with a very good one 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.480
 Equipment even already standard 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.430
 a rear view camera has that means one 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.770
 integrated rear view camera really 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.800
 look back and even the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.250
 second planters can be seen 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.780
 become 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.690
 in addition there is one more 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.160
 outfit the famous taj ingo das 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.100
 Touch info means a system 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.250
 with the me at utah apps 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.100
 can download and directly on 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.010
 can see what big screen 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.650
 I can see all the information 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.230
 I can see where are they 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.230
 cheapest fuel prices near me 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.290
 now there are free parking lots 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.360
 So free apps I connect with 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.030
 can after registration and then immediately at 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.830
 Driving can see what 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.880
 just what other hybrid brings few 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.480
 offensive goes on 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.200
 we have the granddaddy of hybrid 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.500
 prius 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.110
 and he comes from one now 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.300
 so-called plug in option maybe in 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.180
 Fraction means celebration until now 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.580
 outlook does not necessarily record that 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.340
 you go into a socket the vehicles 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.350
 always load themselves on it is why 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.480
 not that loads when braking the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.360
 is surplus energy if the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.360
 Batteries always loaded now there is one 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.670
 new option for the letter , in that respect 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.190
 that I go and I say could be a 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.110
 plug-in optional that I have please 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.170
 actually still a plug still on 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.310
 vehicle and could then go and 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.680
 have a garage or possibility 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.709
 a socket then i could mine 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.140
 vehicle in the evening then plague now to say 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.060
 connect and then have in the morning if 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.459
 I always drive out then a full 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.200
 Battery full of batteries and I have directly 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.720
 the performance then I have him 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.750
 Of course, this means something to consumers 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.170
 less this is the plug in the system 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.360
 more and more and passes because in 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.390
 Berlin is a green city, yes 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.760
 already hardware stores and so on the much 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.040
 clientele already 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.590
 it offers free plug-in systems 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.760
 mean when I go shopping could 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.519
 I then when I am the technical 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.129
 opportunity to shop as 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.470
 incentive I could dock there 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.980
 and during the purchase, so to speak 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.730
 Charge my batteries for free 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.379
 There is also the possibility of such a load 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.590
 Also, that means there are 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.720
 also a set with a carport or if 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.660
 you give us a chance somewhere 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.060
 has a tent to build that from the 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.830
 solar energy directly also the vehicle 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.470
 can also charge 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.830
 it is also so this plugin system so 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.169
 this is a new development than as 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.020
 option in the critical that is for 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.870
 hybrid theme we can also use hybrid 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.760
 now at toyota the prius plus too 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.880
 Welcome it in seven sitting families 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.250
 although the first family van with 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.350
 hybrid technology, too, so it works 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.380
 So a little further for the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.320
 families on the offer here and in the 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.030
 Then we return to september 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.980
 official street racing back 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.260
 so to speak that means the new gt 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.870
 86 presented this is a 2 + 2 seater 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.220
 as a four-seater a sports coupe with 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:17.580
 two liter machine and 200 ps drive 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:20.250
 boxer engine and the ddc 86 will remember 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.160
 So gt comes reminiscent of the legendary 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:31.260
 tour there is the 2000 from the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:33.570
 james-bond-film was and the 86 has something 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.410
 with the bore of the engine to do that 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.290
 that in 86 mm core holes in the engine 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.330
 which points out therefore comes the 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.849
 name is therefore an athlete 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.669
 So we're back in 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:50.189
 the sports world came after that yes 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.409
 the chemists and awesome if i am more im 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:55.619
 So we return to model project 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:57.569
 Sport back to motorsport that fits 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:01.459
 also to the whole development on from 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:04.830
 toyota with the le mans 24 hours race 

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:07.110
 vehicles brings race car that you 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.869
 Now the races started 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.009
 and you also started with that 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:13.819
 Year again in the rally sport 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.819
 to return
