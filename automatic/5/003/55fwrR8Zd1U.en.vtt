00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.639
 chocolate pancakes is that we will fragrant 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.009
 inside the crib a name not 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.890
 added famous chocolate sauce with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.310
 cocoa it's gone ok so we have a 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.699
 flour 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.590
 you have to mix it with as soon as she 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.029
 is in bitter cocoa 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 all those who backed away gave the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.990
 color then better use of the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.650
 bitter cocoa because there is no sugar 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.610
 in still not if you stir up that and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.989
 we will add a nice pass and salt 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 and a butt passed sugar that's 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.760
 to compensate for the bitterness of cocoa sees 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.559

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.900
 especially not very tiring it is especially 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.330
