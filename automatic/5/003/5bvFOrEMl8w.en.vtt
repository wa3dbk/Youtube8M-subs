it's a little bit difficult I like to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.520 
it's a little bit difficult I like to
just<00:01:58.310> open<00:01:58.580> up<00:01:59.210> those<00:01:59.420> two<00:01:59.720> stitches<00:01:59.960> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
needle into the both of them so there's

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.330
