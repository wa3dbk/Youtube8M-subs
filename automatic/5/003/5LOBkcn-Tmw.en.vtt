all<00:02:00.300> up<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.720> get<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:01.080> chunks<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
all up to get all the chunks and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080 
all up to get all the chunks and
everything<00:02:01.800> since<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.190> oil<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.610> little

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
everything since the oil is a little

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.890 
everything since the oil is a little
cooler<00:02:03.990> than<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.940> beeswax<00:02:05.940> was<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.750> will

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
cooler than the beeswax was so it will

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.780 
cooler than the beeswax was so it will
make<00:02:07.080> some<00:02:07.260> chunks<00:02:07.620> in<00:02:07.800> there<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.610> got<00:02:08.670> to

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
make some chunks in there and you got to

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.730 
make some chunks in there and you got to
melt<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.210> again<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:10.229> move<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.619> to

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
melt it all down again then move on to

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.080 
melt it all down again then move on to
the<00:02:10.830> next<00:02:10.979> ingredient<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.580> can<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:11.940> add

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the next ingredient you can really add

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.770 
the next ingredient you can really add
these<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.420> any<00:02:12.600> order<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.230> want<00:02:14.780> just

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
these in any order that you want just

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.820 
these in any order that you want just
make<00:02:15.900> sure<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.230> you're<00:02:16.350> stirring<00:02:16.710> in

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
make sure that you're stirring in

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.260 
make sure that you're stirring in
between<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.370> don't<00:02:17.550> end<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.760> with<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> big

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
between so you don't end up with a big

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.480 
between so you don't end up with a big
old<00:02:18.450> chunky<00:02:18.840> mess<00:02:19.140> by<00:02:19.740> adding<00:02:20.100> them<00:02:20.250> all<00:02:20.340> at

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
old chunky mess by adding them all at

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.630 
old chunky mess by adding them all at
the<00:02:20.520> same<00:02:20.610> time<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.459> want<00:02:23.610> to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the same time so then you want to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.760 
the same time so then you want to
carefully<00:02:23.880> pick<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.600> your<00:02:24.930> little<00:02:25.080> bowl<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
carefully pick up your little bowl and

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.740 
carefully pick up your little bowl and
this<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.580> not<00:02:26.820> what<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.120> want<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.300> do<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.600> do

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
this is not what you want to do you do

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.360 
this is not what you want to do you do
not<00:02:27.930> want<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.290> pour<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> directly<00:02:28.709> into<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
not want to pour it directly into the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.580 
not want to pour it directly into the
containers<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.300> see<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:31.080> little

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
containers as you can see the little

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.010 
containers as you can see the little
concoction<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.700> separating<00:02:33.570> because<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.900> does

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
concoction is separating because it does

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.100 
concoction is separating because it does
have<00:02:34.170> oil<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.650> water<00:02:35.100> products<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.880> there<00:02:36.270> you

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
have oil and water products in there you

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.229 
have oil and water products in there you
don't<00:02:37.320> want<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.830> pour<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.430> directly<00:02:38.850> into<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
don't want to pour it directly into the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.880 
don't want to pour it directly into the
container<00:02:39.660> rather<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:41.640> should<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.930> stir<00:02:43.860> it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
container rather you should just stir it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.660 
container rather you should just stir it
up<00:02:44.100> until<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.970> becomes<00:02:45.709> cool<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.400> starts

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
up until it becomes cool and it starts

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.810 
up until it becomes cool and it starts
getting<00:02:47.820> thicker<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.070> chunkier<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.550> you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
getting thicker and chunkier and you

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.100 
getting thicker and chunkier and you
just<00:02:50.940> want<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.120> keep<00:02:51.269> stirring<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:51.989> like

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
just want to keep stirring kind of like

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.190 
just want to keep stirring kind of like
whipping<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.519> can<00:02:53.790> actually

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
whipping it up so that you can actually

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.860 
whipping it up so that you can actually
put<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.350> directly<00:02:55.890> into<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.730> containers<00:02:57.600> by

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
put it directly into the containers by

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.540 
put it directly into the containers by
scooping<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.560> there<00:02:58.769> instead<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.250> pouring

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
scooping it in there instead of pouring

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.110 
scooping it in there instead of pouring
it<00:02:59.760> in<00:02:59.910> there<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.440> now<00:03:01.709> it's<00:03:01.950> ready<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.250> use<00:03:02.459> or

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it in there so now it's ready to use or

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.860 
it in there so now it's ready to use or
to<00:03:03.600> store<00:03:04.380> up<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.980> give<00:03:05.519> away<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:06.239> Christmas

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
to store up and give away for Christmas

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
time if you like you can just apply it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.250 
time if you like you can just apply it
all<00:03:11.310> over<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> skin<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.480> then<00:03:12.630> wipe<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.140> off

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
all over the skin and then wipe it off

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.860 
all over the skin and then wipe it off
with<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.709> damp<00:03:13.980> washcloth<00:03:14.820> use<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.540> just<00:03:15.720> like

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
with a damp washcloth use it just like

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.900 
with a damp washcloth use it just like
ultra<00:03:16.410> bland<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.070> takes<00:03:17.280> off<00:03:17.489> pretty<00:03:17.790> much

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
ultra bland and it takes off pretty much

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.220 
ultra bland and it takes off pretty much
everything<00:03:18.360> sometimes<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.780> do<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.110> go
