also try using a free lookup service
those<00:00:21.600> are<00:00:21.840> usually<00:00:22.170> inaccurate<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.189> I'll

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
those are usually inaccurate and I'll

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.660 
those are usually inaccurate and I'll
explain<00:00:24.210> why<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.750> next<00:00:24.990> slide<00:00:25.519> you<00:00:26.519> can

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
explain why on the next slide you can

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.570 
explain why on the next slide you can
also<00:00:26.820> try<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> paid<00:00:27.750> lookup<00:00:28.199> service<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:29.400> these

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
also try a paid lookup service now these

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
also try a paid lookup service now these
can<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.939> usually<00:00:30.119> accurate<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:31.050> their<00:00:31.199> costs

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
can be usually accurate but their costs

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.459 
can be usually accurate but their costs
can<00:00:31.859> vary<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> guess<00:00:33.809> you're<00:00:34.020> wondering<00:00:34.410> at

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
can vary so I guess you're wondering at

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.959 
can vary so I guess you're wondering at
this<00:00:34.530> point<00:00:34.950> what<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> best<00:00:35.940> thing<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.210> do

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
this point what is the best thing to do

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.459 
this point what is the best thing to do
so<00:00:38.969> before<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.750> answer<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.050> let<00:00:40.350> me<00:00:40.410> just

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
so before we answer that let me just

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
so before we answer that let me just
quickly<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.250> over<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.969> difference<00:00:42.329> between<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
quickly go over the difference between a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.290 
quickly go over the difference between a
free<00:00:42.930> service<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> paid<00:00:43.770> service<00:00:44.300> are

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
free service and a paid service are

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
free service and a paid service are
there<00:00:45.570> such<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> thing<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.410> accurate<00:00:46.860> free

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
there such a thing as an accurate free

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.940 
there such a thing as an accurate free
service<00:00:48.469> unfortunately<00:00:49.469> cell<00:00:49.739> phone

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
service unfortunately cell phone

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.880 
service unfortunately cell phone
companies<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.610> charge<00:00:50.940> other<00:00:51.300> companies

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
companies will charge other companies

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.229 
companies will charge other companies
for<00:00:52.890> access<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.399> their<00:00:53.640> name<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.940> address

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
for access to their name and address

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.430 
for access to their name and address
database<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:56.449> this<00:00:57.449> cuts<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> free

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
database so this cuts out the free

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.099 
database so this cuts out the free
services<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> answer<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> question

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
services so the answer to that question

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.070 
services so the answer to that question
is<00:01:01.469> no<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.039> really<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.030> paid<00:01:03.239> service<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is no and really the paid service is the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100 
is no and really the paid service is the
only<00:01:04.229> way<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.630> does<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> mean<00:01:06.960> I'll

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
only way to go and does that mean I'll

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.600 
only way to go and does that mean I'll
have<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> pay<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> lot<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.830> money<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.430> paid
