00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.360
 what is a colleague wearing so you 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.599
 understood it very important especially for 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.219
 foreign partners here I am all the time 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.170
 I say that Russian football is not 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.140
 professional football he 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.490
 state criminal football from 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.460
 professional football 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.919
 It is distinguished by the fact that in Russia it is very 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.960
 little that the organization itself is not 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.820
 football organization is unprofessional but 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.239
 and considering that he is corrupt 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.190
 criminal in is even here level 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.230
 corruption is so high that level 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.990
 match fixes that in the west in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.080
 general will be pursued with this and this 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.170
 wise if he is the minimum we have 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.150
 very high level of corruption very 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.010
 high level of contractual games himself from 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.110
 what's the most scary thing with this state 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 not fighting that's why he doesn't 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.200
 professional football in that form 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.490
 which in the west is therefore natural 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.769
 professional football where level 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.229
 corruption is very low yes there is easier 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.240
 predict because you take 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.030
 original purely sports 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 These figures to which I 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.360
 I look through all games all 8 games and there 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.050
 already you see as the class here 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.090
 and I'm basically happy when the Champions League 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.500
 predicting practically not mistaken but 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.659
 that's about going back to 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.880
 Russian league yes considering those 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.820
 the facts that I listed, I especially 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.970
 not professionalism and corruption 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.090
 here 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.670
 hard to predict and in principle here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.040
 I can see the nuances because I 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.110
 himself had to play to the hungry 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.880
 games and i know 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.400
 technology contract other games 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.330
 I as an analyst can 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.520
 beta can be analyzed 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.910
 contractual game but as a professional 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.400
 I put the outcome still on the assumption that 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.630
 should actually be today 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.420
 day by power ratio 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.310
 something to depend on 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.670
 situations someone needs glasses someone doesn't 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.399
 i need i can take these factors into account but 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.110
 I do not take into account because they need 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.240
 to argue and speak up to games looking 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.800
 this is negotiable this is about merging in 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.040
 corruption if you can not prove and I 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.980
 just guess what can i 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.700
 I can be held responsible for 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.790
 slander 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.400
 so in Russian in Russian 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.109
 the championship was and will be negotiated 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.799
 games and therefore difficult to predict 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.510
 because in this league in this case 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.400
 the state must fight with regard to 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.409
 extinguish state mainly 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.560
 the state has an impact on 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.019
 football development and controls it she 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.239
 not fighting corruption on the heads of the world 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.849
 yes everyone who says to me tote 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.069
 good luck but most importantly 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.189
 don't be upset with lesions especially in 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.060
 Russian football risk losing very 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.590
 tall and don't fall into euphoria when you 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.939
 win because today you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.019
 you guessed it and tomorrow you might as well 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.549
 can play 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.549
 especial Russian league
