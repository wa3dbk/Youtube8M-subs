00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.720 
as you see it's it's the pink version of
it<00:00:22.920> because<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.119> cheaper<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.519> think

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
serious it's not it's not just a game

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
serious it's not it's not just a game
you<00:00:53.480> can<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.629> rid<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> box<00:00:57.469> it<00:00:58.469> has<00:00:58.649> some

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you can get rid of box it has some

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.430 
you can get rid of box it has some
plastic<00:00:59.100> over<00:00:59.910> it<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.600> easily<00:01:00.989> removed

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
plastic over it but it's easily removed

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.660 
plastic over it but it's easily removed
so<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.949> throw<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.550> away<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:03.000> well

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
so you just throw that one away as well

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.660 
so you just throw that one away as well
it<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:05.880> developed<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.110> has<00:01:07.320> only<00:01:07.670> 0.2

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it has developed so it has only 0.2

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670 
it has developed so it has only 0.2
seconds<00:01:09.240> response<00:01:09.720> time<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.500> that's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
seconds response time I think that's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160 
seconds response time I think that's
considered<00:01:11.130> being<00:01:11.280> 500<00:01:11.640> Hertz<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.689> something

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
considered being 500 Hertz or something

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.749 
considered being 500 Hertz or something
like<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.730 

it<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:18.000> supports<00:01:18.509> full<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> ghosting<00:01:19.560> if

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it has supports full and the ghosting if

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
it has supports full and the ghosting if
you<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.220> through<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> piece<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.270> like

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you use it through the piece to it like

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
you use it through the piece to it like

cases<00:02:40.470> well<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:43.090> doesn't<00:02:43.330> weight<00:02:43.540> too

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
cases well it's it doesn't weight too

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.900 
cases well it's it doesn't weight too
much<00:02:44.020> but<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:46.060> not<00:02:46.300> too<00:02:46.840> light<00:02:47.050> iron<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.010> the

much but it's not too light iron so the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.250 
much but it's not too light iron so the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
plastic so that's good feels durable too

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
flip up so you can get the tilt as a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.050 
flip up so you can get the tilt as a
version<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.780> keyboard<00:03:08.200> but<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:09.640> working<00:03:09.970> as

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
version of keyboard but it's working as

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.990 
version of keyboard but it's working as
far<00:03:10.239> as<00:03:10.420> today's<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:12.250> keyboard<00:03:12.519> here<00:03:12.820> was

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
far as today's this keyboard here was

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.150 
far as today's this keyboard here was
using<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.540> MX<00:03:13.810> brown<00:03:14.050> switches<00:03:14.080> which<00:03:14.680> gives

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
using the MX brown switches which gives

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.880 
using the MX brown switches which gives
you<00:03:15.400> tactic<00:03:16.000> tactile<00:03:16.660> feedback<00:03:17.049> not<00:03:17.410> tactical

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
you tactic tactile feedback not tactical

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.949 
you tactic tactile feedback not tactical
tactile<00:03:18.310> feedback<00:03:18.579> so<00:03:19.180> when<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.420> push<00:03:19.930> down

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
tactile feedback so when you push down

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.229 
tactile feedback so when you push down
the<00:03:20.260> key<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.590> can<00:03:20.769> like<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.640> can<00:03:21.700> feel<00:03:22.000> like

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
the key you can like you can feel like

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.360 
the key you can like you can feel like
it<00:03:22.540> midway<00:03:23.110> through<00:03:23.140> pushing<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.860> down<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.190> get

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
it midway through pushing it down it get

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.920 
it midway through pushing it down it get
some<00:03:24.549> kind<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.760> response<00:03:25.360> from<00:03:25.450> pushing<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
some kind of response from pushing it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.080 
some kind of response from pushing it
down<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:26.799> it's<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.250> better<00:03:27.579> feeling<00:03:27.850> for

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
down so it's like a better feeling for

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.330 
down so it's like a better feeling for
when<00:03:28.840> typing<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.530> get<00:03:29.680> more<00:03:29.860> sense<00:03:30.160> of

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
when typing and you get more sense of

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.800 
when typing and you get more sense of
when<00:03:30.489> you're<00:03:30.610> actually<00:03:30.850> pushing<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.209> keys<00:03:31.540> I

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
when you're actually pushing the keys I

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.580 
when you're actually pushing the keys I
was<00:03:32.680> using<00:03:33.000> Steel's<00:03:34.000> here<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.390> 6g<00:03:35.170> before<00:03:35.560> I

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
was using Steel's here is 6g before I

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.930 
was using Steel's here is 6g before I
think<00:03:35.709> this<00:03:35.890> keyboard<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.250> called<00:03:36.519> using<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
think this keyboard is called using the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.530 
think this keyboard is called using the
MX<00:03:37.840> blacks<00:03:38.799> which<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.489> think<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.790> was<00:03:39.910> which

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
MX blacks which is I think it was which

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.660 
MX blacks which is I think it was which
doesn't<00:03:40.900> have<00:03:41.019> textile<00:03:41.530> tactile<00:03:42.040> feedback<00:03:42.310> so

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
doesn't have textile tactile feedback so

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.970 
doesn't have textile tactile feedback so
it's<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:42.970> linear<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.110> only<00:03:44.230> way<00:03:44.440> time

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
it's just linear so the only way time

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.560 
it's just linear so the only way time
you<00:03:45.100> feel<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.340> key<00:03:45.640> is<00:03:45.790> when<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.060> push<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.299> all

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
you feel the key is when you push it all

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.900 
you feel the key is when you push it all
the<00:03:46.660> way<00:03:46.750> down<00:03:46.780> otherwise<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.709> just<00:03:48.100> push<00:03:48.730> it

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
the way down otherwise you just push it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.729 
the way down otherwise you just push it
yeah<00:03:49.769> not<00:03:50.769> much<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.239> it's<00:03:52.239> also<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:53.530> black

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
yeah not much to it it's also this black

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.479 
yeah not much to it it's also this black
one<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.640> requires<00:03:55.120> more<00:03:55.680> more<00:03:56.680> force<00:03:57.310> to

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
one here it requires more more force to

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.539 
one here it requires more more force to
push<00:03:57.670> down<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:57.970> key<00:03:58.209> than<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.660> does<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:59.459> for<00:04:00.459> the

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
push down a key than it does for for the

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.180 
push down a key than it does for for the
keyboard<00:04:00.730> with<00:04:01.000> brown<00:04:01.239> switches<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.590> it's

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
keyboard with brown switches so it's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.340 
keyboard with brown switches so it's
very<00:04:03.820> easy<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.180> push<00:04:04.510> these<00:04:04.660> keys<00:04:04.989> but<00:04:05.290> you

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
very easy to push these keys but you

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.530 
very easy to push these keys but you
also<00:04:05.560> feel<00:04:05.829> like<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.489> textile<00:04:06.910> feedback<00:04:07.359> when

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
also feel like the textile feedback when

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.890 
also feel like the textile feedback when
pushing<00:04:07.930> them<00:04:08.019> down<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:10.269> goes<00:04:10.299> faster

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
pushing them down so it goes faster

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.330 
pushing them down so it goes faster
please<00:04:11.140> Pham<00:04:11.500> keys<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.769> guess<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:14.340> another

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
please Pham keys I guess and another

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.180 
please Pham keys I guess and another
feature<00:04:15.579> of<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:16.000> keyboard<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.600> in<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.410> upper

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
feature of this keyboard is in the upper

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.820 
feature of this keyboard is in the upper
corner<00:04:18.519> we<00:04:18.820> get<00:04:19.030> f9<00:04:19.599> to<00:04:19.810> f12<00:04:20.260> keys<00:04:20.979> which

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
corner we get f9 to f12 keys which

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.750 
corner we get f9 to f12 keys which
toggles<00:04:23.830> how<00:04:24.160> fast

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
toggles how fast

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.120
