00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
pictures of the weapons in their little

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.949 
pictures of the weapons in their little

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
icon in the bottom right but still

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.709 
icon in the bottom right but still
creating<00:02:26.439> weapons<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.129> blast<00:02:27.999> and<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.689> a

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
creating weapons is a blast and I have a

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.599 
creating weapons is a blast and I have a
lot<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.019> fun<00:02:29.290> doing<00:02:29.439> it

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
lot of fun doing it

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.599 
lot of fun doing it
but<00:02:31.609> you<00:02:32.030> see<00:02:32.269> there<00:02:32.569> are<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:34.310> Clive

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
but you see there are like little Clive

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.399 
but you see there are like little Clive
bots<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.239> come<00:02:35.510> along<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.019> blow<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.260> up

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
bots that come along and blow you up

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.240 
bots that come along and blow you up
there's<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:37.599> first-place<00:02:38.599> blimp<00:02:39.290> that's<00:02:39.799> kind

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
there's a first-place blimp that's kind

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.130 
there's a first-place blimp that's kind
of<00:02:40.370> like<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> smaller<00:02:41.239> version<00:02:41.359> of<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.870> blimp

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
of like a smaller version of the blimp

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.780 
of like a smaller version of the blimp
that<00:02:42.640> travels<00:02:43.640> around<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:45.019> track<00:02:45.409> here

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
that travels around this this track here

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.170 
that travels around this this track here
and<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.840> pipe<00:02:48.109> section<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.859> actually<00:02:49.790> really

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
and this pipe section is actually really

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.640 
and this pipe section is actually really
tough<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.200> navigate<00:02:51.969> and<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.379> by<00:02:54.620> no

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
tough to navigate and this is by no

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.390 
tough to navigate and this is by no
means<00:02:54.859> an<00:02:55.430> easy<00:02:55.579> track<00:02:56.170> but<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.650> know<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.069> lot<00:02:58.250> of

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
means an easy track but I know a lot of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.849 
means an easy track but I know a lot of
people<00:02:58.639> have<00:02:58.849> said<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.209> they<00:02:59.359> have<00:02:59.389> had

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
people have said that they have had

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.770 
people have said that they have had
troubles<00:03:00.859> with<00:03:01.069> that<00:03:01.609> pipe<00:03:02.090> area<00:03:02.329> but<00:03:02.599> there's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
troubles with that pipe area but there's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.449 
troubles with that pipe area but there's
really<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:03.169> a<00:03:03.230> lot<00:03:03.379> that<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.829> could<00:03:04.010> do<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:04.280> fix

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
really not a lot that I could do to fix

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.509 
really not a lot that I could do to fix
it<00:03:04.700> because<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.329> guess<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.620> problem<00:03:07.099> is<00:03:07.280> with

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
it because I guess the problem is with

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.420 
it because I guess the problem is with
the<00:03:07.760> pipes<00:03:08.060> shape<00:03:08.810> it's<00:03:09.139> just<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.819> cylindrical

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
the pipes shape it's just a cylindrical

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.949 
the pipes shape it's just a cylindrical
track<00:03:13.430> rather<00:03:13.760> than<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> straight<00:03:14.419> track<00:03:14.689> so

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
track rather than a straight track so

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.869 
track rather than a straight track so
you'd<00:03:15.139> be<00:03:15.319> like<00:03:15.769> moving<00:03:15.980> from<00:03:16.250> side<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.489> side<00:03:16.849> a

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
you'd be like moving from side to side a

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.929 
you'd be like moving from side to side a
lot<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:17.870> I'm<00:03:18.079> getting<00:03:18.439> my<00:03:18.560> butt<00:03:18.799> kicked<00:03:18.939> by

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
lot but I'm getting my butt kicked by

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.920 
lot but I'm getting my butt kicked by
the<00:03:20.510> AI<00:03:20.719> in<00:03:21.319> this<00:03:21.620> in<00:03:21.829> this<00:03:22.609> race<00:03:22.969> um<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:23.810> it

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
the AI in this in this race um so it

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.770 
the AI in this in this race um so it
sort<00:03:24.169> of<00:03:24.230> looks<00:03:24.290> like<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.889> can't<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.819> can't<00:03:26.629> even

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
sort of looks like I can't I can't even

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.399 
sort of looks like I can't I can't even
navigate<00:03:27.349> my<00:03:27.500> own<00:03:27.650> race<00:03:27.859> without<00:03:29.409> being

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
navigate my own race without being

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.550 
navigate my own race without being
completely<00:03:30.799> blown<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.579> bits<00:03:31.609> but<00:03:32.150> um<00:03:32.359> yeah<00:03:33.349> the

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
completely blown to bits but um yeah the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.689 
completely blown to bits but um yeah the
AI<00:03:33.769> is<00:03:34.010> normal<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.419> track<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.079> not

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
AI is normal on this track it's not

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.979 
AI is normal on this track it's not
master<00:03:37.699> difficulty<00:03:38.299> even<00:03:38.569> though<00:03:38.659> it<00:03:38.780> kind<00:03:38.900> of

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
master difficulty even though it kind of

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.589 
master difficulty even though it kind of
looks<00:03:39.229> like<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.709> um<00:03:39.949> but<00:03:40.669> I<00:03:40.760> try<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> keep<00:03:41.269> all

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
looks like it um but I try to keep all

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.420 
looks like it um but I try to keep all
of<00:03:41.659> my<00:03:42.079> tracks<00:03:42.349> with<00:03:42.620> normal<00:03:43.040> difficulty

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
of my tracks with normal difficulty

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.899 
of my tracks with normal difficulty
because<00:03:43.879> I<00:03:43.909> know<00:03:44.180> how<00:03:44.949> how<00:03:45.949> cheap<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.430> AI<00:03:46.579> can

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
because I know how how cheap the AI can

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.409 
because I know how how cheap the AI can
be<00:03:46.939> sometimes<00:03:48.549> but<00:03:49.549> yeah<00:03:49.699> I<00:03:49.729> hope<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.120> guys

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
way if anybody knows how to make a

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.129 
way if anybody knows how to make a
conveyor<00:03:54.829> belt<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.299> moves<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.569> player<00:03:56.780> along

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
conveyor belt that moves a player along

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.159 
conveyor belt that moves a player along
sort<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.620> like<00:03:57.829> what<00:03:58.389> happened<00:03:59.389> in<00:03:59.509> sugar<00:03:59.900> rush

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169

not<00:04:04.879> figure<00:04:05.120> out<00:04:05.239> with<00:04:06.169> the<00:04:06.319> conveyor<00:04:06.620> belt<00:04:06.919> in

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
not figure out with the conveyor belt in

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.399 
not figure out with the conveyor belt in
the<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:08.859> the<00:04:09.859> trash<00:04:10.459> compactor<00:04:10.639> area<00:04:11.299> so<00:04:12.049> it
