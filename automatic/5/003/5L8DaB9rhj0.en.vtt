00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.180 
on this side over here too

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.060 
on this side over here too
well<00:07:33.170> it<00:07:33.230> doesn't<00:07:33.380> really<00:07:33.530> make<00:07:33.770> a<00:07:33.830> difference

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.070

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.450 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.240 

and<00:07:55.960> now<00:07:56.080> we're<00:07:56.320> making<00:07:56.620> a<00:07:56.680> signal<00:07:56.980> video

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.250 
and now we're making a signal video

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.930 
and now we're making a signal video
showing<00:07:58.090> how<00:07:58.390> it<00:07:58.510> looks<00:07:58.750> at<00:07:59.320> nighttime<00:07:59.940> with
