close-range power as pistols are made
for<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:52.070> usually<00:01:52.310> have<00:01:52.730> a<00:01:52.940> lower

for that and you usually have a lower
reload<00:01:54.050> time<00:01:54.260> too<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:54.710> that's<00:01:54.980> something<00:01:55.730> nice

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
reload time too so that's something nice

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.940 
reload time too so that's something nice
to<00:01:56.210> have<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.630> because<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.380> are<00:01:57.500> more<00:01:57.650> mobile
