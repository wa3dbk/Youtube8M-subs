to see what cool things it offers so the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.310 
to see what cool things it offers so the

icon for iPod touches there it is I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.929 
icon for iPod touches there it is I
actually<00:01:03.440> don't<00:01:03.890> like<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.399> I<00:01:04.489> like<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.819> one

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
actually don't like it I like the one

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.609 
actually don't like it I like the one
that<00:01:05.059> they<00:01:05.149> had<00:01:05.329> before<00:01:05.509> a<00:01:05.749> lot<00:01:06.170> better<00:01:06.499> I

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
that they had before a lot better I

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.800 
that they had before a lot better I
think<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.130> one<00:01:07.340> just<00:01:07.579> looks<00:01:07.789> stupid<00:01:08.569> to<00:01:08.689> be

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
think this one just looks stupid to be

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.469 
think this one just looks stupid to be
quite<00:01:09.049> honest<00:01:09.469> but<00:01:09.799> at<00:01:10.759> least<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.359> know

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
quite honest but at least you know

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.270 
quite honest but at least you know
they're<00:01:11.719> working<00:01:11.929> on<00:01:12.259> it<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.560> they<00:01:12.829> recognize

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
they're working on it and they recognize

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.550 
they're working on it and they recognize
that<00:01:13.850> they<00:01:13.999> need<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.179> change<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.840> but<00:01:15.109> I<00:01:15.380> don't

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
that they need to change it but I don't

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.840 
that they need to change it but I don't
know<00:01:15.649> it<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.100> me<00:01:16.219> it<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:16.399> kind<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:16.639> looks<00:01:16.789> like

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850

it<00:01:22.609> it<00:01:22.759> just<00:01:22.939> looks<00:01:23.090> stupid<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.109> me<00:01:24.229> but<00:01:24.609> that's

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
it it just looks stupid to me but that's

it it just looks stupid to me but that's
one<00:01:25.939> of<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.119> things<00:01:26.329> that<00:01:26.479> they've<00:01:26.630> changed

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990

one of the things that they've changed
in<00:01:27.289> iOS<00:01:27.710> 4.3<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.759> because<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.149> is<00:01:29.179> just<00:01:29.659> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
in iOS 4.3 and because it is just the

beta one still that could change and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.149 
beta one still that could change and
they<00:01:32.990> could<00:01:33.200> make<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:33.499> look<00:01:33.649> different<00:01:34.039> but

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
they could make it look different but
