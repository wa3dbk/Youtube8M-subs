change there we go your network in case
it<00:02:07.420> doesn't<00:02:07.689> want<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.899> work<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:08.709> hit

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
it doesn't want to work you just hit

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.500 
it doesn't want to work you just hit
Ethernet<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.709> is<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.550> for<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.000> and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
Ethernet and that is it for that and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.259 
Ethernet and that is it for that and
let's<00:02:14.200> continue<00:02:14.709> with<00:02:15.250> massacre

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
let's continue with massacre

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.640 
let's continue with massacre
now<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.590> should<00:02:17.920> boot<00:02:18.160> up<00:02:18.310> hopefully<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
now it should boot up hopefully and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:33.630 
now it should boot up hopefully and
there<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.459> go<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:22.030> installing<00:02:22.510> now

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.300 

now<00:02:34.240> this<00:02:34.720> first<00:02:34.960> boot<00:02:35.500> since<00:02:35.830> you've<00:02:36.040> created

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
the VM on the SSDs it's gonna work like

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.880
