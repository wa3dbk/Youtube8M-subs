 Hello everyone today, I whistle Arseny 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.710
 tell and show you about the next 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.800
 jordan brand model lifestyle 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.830
 whose name is jordan eclipse 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.009
 and not as many consider but very similar 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 on our wounds from t shirt and of course it 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.189
 not in a bad way you can say everything 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.489
 the best 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.520
 they borrowed because there are people 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.550
 who kinda monogamous in terms of brands 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.110
 Well, it is you can only say one thing here 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 and jordan brand how to be considered 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.430
 borrowed ideas in my opinion so that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.920
 satisfy some preferences 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 people sneakers these really turned out 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.430
 very light and external 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.480
 divided into three parts this is such 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.880
 front of the finger area then 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.189
 can say the rest of this 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.759
 model bends around another one-piece 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.640
 piece here it is well and the third part is 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.189
 the tongue is this area 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.280
 can also say well somehow stands out 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.560
 here, well, these sneakers are made 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.229
 you are watching from the mesh on the sides it 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.389
 here more rigid well in the sense of not 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.850
 minded and apparently it's all thanks 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.590
 thanks to such an inner lining 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.639
 which keeps the shape of this model 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.639
 Here I show you the structure of this grid 

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:34.639
 closer 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.700
 so now show the front part but already 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.200
 on the other sneakers here as we 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 see only mesh 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.280
 it is immediately apparent how easy it is 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.900
 minded well and definitely it is excellent 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.869
 Well, the material vents in hot weather 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.200

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.200
 uvula in this model with this you see 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.820
 a strip which by the way is 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.270
 reflective well still here 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.470
 reflective such male stripes well 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.959
 then the contour here on both sides too you them 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.600

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.540
 lace holes all this of course 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.610

 for comfort, by the way , we are still here 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.800
 seeing such an asymmetrical ankle 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.700
 that is, here you see the outside 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.490
 this model 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.550
 less than 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.000
 internal well all this for comfort this 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.160
 Well, decisions do not hinder our movements 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.260
 still responsible for the feeling of naturalness 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.280
 and such a cutout here you see to the sides of this 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.960
 models here he is all husband 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.330
 say specially calculated in order 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.000
 Well, this cutout is present in that place 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.730
 where sneakers and will bend that 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.160
 accordingly well allow it 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.540
 sneakers serve us even longer but 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.590
 also all this for comfort but now 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.040
 move on to the sole 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.470
 it is made of foam material well 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.450
 which of course is for comfort and cushioning 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.490
 responsible for this is still responsible air 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.430

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.990

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.810
 the sole pattern in front of you is introduced in 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.780
 good old Christmas tree with such cuts 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.930
 again in the fold places is not all for 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.140
 clutches and these notches give 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.150
 extra sense of naturalness 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.780
