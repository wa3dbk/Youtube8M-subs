thing<00:00:20.039> when<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.279> was<00:00:20.400> using<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.150> found<00:00:21.750> myself

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
thing when I was using it I found myself

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.310 
thing when I was using it I found myself
since<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.119> ceramic<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.840> does<00:00:25.050> clog

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
since it is ceramic and it does clog

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
since it is ceramic and it does clog
fairly<00:00:25.769> easily

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
fairly easily

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.509 
fairly easily
I<00:00:26.369> found<00:00:27.210> myself<00:00:27.420> wishing<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.470> had<00:00:28.560> both

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
I found myself wishing that I had both

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.319 
I found myself wishing that I had both
sides<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.960> individual<00:00:31.500> stones<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.279> use<00:00:32.520> if

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
sides of the individual stones to use if

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.240 
sides of the individual stones to use if
I<00:00:33.570> needed<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.559> get<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:34.980> bit<00:00:35.100> more

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I needed to to get a little bit more

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.209 
I needed to to get a little bit more
aggressive<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.530> side<00:00:37.770> would<00:00:37.980> fill<00:00:38.190> up

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
aggressive then this side would fill up

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.670 
aggressive then this side would fill up
and<00:00:38.640> I'll<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.940> stuck<00:00:39.239> unless<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.140> cleaned<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.649> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and I'll be stuck unless I cleaned it I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.340 
and I'll be stuck unless I cleaned it I
would<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.070> stuck<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.719> Nolan<00:00:42.930> doesn't

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
would be stuck with this Nolan doesn't

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.029 
would be stuck with this Nolan doesn't
cut<00:00:43.530> very<00:00:43.739> well<00:00:44.090> same<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> white<00:00:45.510> side<00:00:46.039> so

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
cut very well same for the white side so

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.290 
cut very well same for the white side so
what<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.309> did<00:00:47.390> was<00:00:49.460> got<00:00:52.760> these<00:00:53.760> two<00:00:54.030> stones

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
what I did was got these two stones

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.319 
what I did was got these two stones
separate<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.949> use<00:00:56.190> both<00:00:56.820> sides<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
separate so now I can use both sides of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.470 
separate so now I can use both sides of
the<00:00:57.420> stones<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:58.079> course<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.180> these<00:01:00.180> stones

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and they're both extremely hard so they

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.969 
and they're both extremely hard so they
would<00:01:21.509> eventually<00:01:21.780> wear<00:01:22.229> themselves<00:01:22.500> out

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
would eventually wear themselves out

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.800 
would eventually wear themselves out
rubbing<00:01:23.640> against<00:01:24.000> each<00:01:24.060> other<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.600> least

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
at the very least change the grit rating

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.069 
at the very least change the grit rating
I<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.590> fine<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> grit<00:01:30.810> rating

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
I know the fine can have the grit rating

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.940 
I know the fine can have the grit rating
changed<00:01:31.470> by<00:01:31.680> abrasion<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> people

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to keep these two together so I went to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.380 
to keep these two together so I went to
Lowe's<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.229> got<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.390> drawer

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
Lowe's and I got some of this drawer

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.740 
Lowe's and I got some of this drawer
liner<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:02.189> got<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> perforated<00:02:03.060> kind<00:02:03.270> also

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
liner and I got the perforated kind also

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.469 
liner and I got the perforated kind also
but<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.020> doesn't<00:02:04.320> work<00:02:04.469> as<00:02:04.649> well<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.729> found

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
but it doesn't work as well and I found

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.020 
but it doesn't work as well and I found
the<00:02:06.600> hidden<00:02:06.869> purpose<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.680> which<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the hidden purpose for this which the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.170 
the hidden purpose for this which the
perforated<00:02:09.569> liner<00:02:09.720> wouldn't<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.229> anyway<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.180> I

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
perforated liner wouldn't do anyway so I

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.699 
perforated liner wouldn't do anyway so I
put<00:02:12.390> these<00:02:12.540> two<00:02:12.720> together

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
put these two together

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.089 
put these two together
fits<00:02:14.189> just<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:15.140> nice<00:02:16.140> little<00:02:16.650> compact

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
fits just like that nice little compact

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.729 
fits just like that nice little compact
package<00:02:17.629> won't<00:02:18.629> rub<00:02:18.900> up<00:02:19.140> against<00:02:19.409> won't

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
package won't rub up against won't

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.220 
package won't rub up against won't
damage<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.519> stones<00:02:20.970> when<00:02:21.810> they<00:02:21.900> rub<00:02:22.110> up

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
damage the stones when they rub up

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.050 
damage the stones when they rub up
against<00:02:22.530> each<00:02:22.650> other<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:25.400> little<00:02:26.400> liner

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
against each other and this little liner

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.920 
against each other and this little liner
serves<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:28.079> dual<00:02:28.890> purpose<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.670> actually<00:02:30.540> noticed

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
serves a dual purpose I actually noticed

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.309 
serves a dual purpose I actually noticed
that<00:02:31.470> when<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.650> lay<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.069> down<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:33.780> strop<00:02:34.140> my

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
that when I lay this down and I strop my

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.589 
that when I lay this down and I strop my
blades<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.829> it<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.640> brought<00:02:35.939> back<00:02:36.209> a

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
blades on it that it brought back a

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.839 
blades on it that it brought back a
knife<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.290> had<00:02:37.439> kind<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.950> degraded<00:02:38.700> edge

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
knife that had kind of a degraded edge

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.899 
knife that had kind of a degraded edge
it<00:02:39.239> actually<00:02:39.810> worked<00:02:40.049> as<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.709> strop<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.370> has

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
it actually worked as a strop it has

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.360 
it actually worked as a strop it has
kind<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.299> tactile<00:02:42.810> almost<00:02:43.620> rubbery<00:02:44.069> feeling

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
kind of a tactile almost rubbery feeling

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.940 
kind of a tactile almost rubbery feeling
to<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:47.209> I'm<00:02:48.209> not<00:02:48.510> saying<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
to it and I'm not saying it's the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.300 
to it and I'm not saying it's the
perfect<00:02:50.280> strop<00:02:51.019> but<00:02:52.019> in<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.290> pinch<00:02:52.590> when<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.040> come

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
perfect strop but in a pinch when I come

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.369 
perfect strop but in a pinch when I come
off<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:53.670> white<00:02:53.879> stone<00:02:54.359> if<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.720> have<00:02:54.900> kind<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
off this white stone if I have kind of a

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.770 
off this white stone if I have kind of a
hairy<00:02:55.650> edge<00:02:56.030> sometimes<00:02:57.030> they<00:02:57.209> get<00:02:57.359> like<00:02:57.569> that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
hairy edge sometimes they get like that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.289 
hairy edge sometimes they get like that
especially<00:02:57.989> with<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> ceramic<00:02:59.120> sometimes<00:03:00.120> it's

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
especially with a ceramic sometimes it's

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.330 
especially with a ceramic sometimes it's
hard<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> clean<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> burr<00:03:01.019> off<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:02.010> will

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
hard to clean the burr off this will

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.099 
hard to clean the burr off this will
actually<00:03:02.549> work<00:03:02.879> as<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> strop<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.870> did

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
actually work as a strop and this did

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.649 
actually work as a strop and this did
actually<00:03:04.379> sharpen<00:03:05.159> the<00:03:05.909> knife<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.480> was

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
actually sharpen the knife that I was

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.050 
actually sharpen the knife that I was
playing<00:03:06.900> around<00:03:07.019> with<00:03:07.379> it<00:03:07.439> on<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.609> that's

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
playing around with it on so that's

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.250 
playing around with it on so that's
pretty<00:03:09.329> cool

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
pretty cool

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.140 
pretty cool
didn't<00:03:10.859> intend<00:03:11.159> for<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.549> happen<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:11.909> it

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
didn't intend for that to happen but it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.390 
didn't intend for that to happen but it
just<00:03:12.269> kind<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.510> worked<00:03:12.659> that<00:03:12.810> way<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.859> I'm

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
just kind of worked that way and I'm

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.490 
just kind of worked that way and I'm
happy<00:03:14.700> about<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.180> mean<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.540> was<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:15.840> five

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
happy about it I mean this was just five

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.039 
happy about it I mean this was just five
or<00:03:16.650> six<00:03:16.859> bucks<00:03:17.159> it<00:03:17.340> came<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.639> huge<00:03:17.910> roll<00:03:18.180> at

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
or six bucks it came in a huge roll at

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.710 
or six bucks it came in a huge roll at
Lowe's<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:20.069> just<00:03:20.400> traced<00:03:21.209> around<00:03:21.419> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
Lowe's and I just traced around the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.309 
Lowe's and I just traced around the
stone<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.260> cut<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.799> out<00:03:22.949> and<00:03:23.870> then<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:24.900> found

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
stone and cut it out and then just found

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.170 
stone and cut it out and then just found
out<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.859> it<00:03:26.069> actually<00:03:26.220> worked<00:03:26.669> as<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
out that it it actually worked as a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.800 
out that it it actually worked as a
strop

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
strop

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.970 
strop
so<00:03:28.109> there's<00:03:28.889> kind<00:03:29.159> of<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.310> field<00:03:29.669> expedient

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
so there's kind of a field expedient

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.610 
so there's kind of a field expedient
package<00:03:31.980> right<00:03:32.250> here<00:03:32.549> from<00:03:32.940> medium<00:03:33.930> filing

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
package right here from medium filing

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.039 
package right here from medium filing
all<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.859> way<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.040> strop<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:36.000> that's<00:03:36.720> fairly

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
all the way to strop so that's fairly

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.460 
all the way to strop so that's fairly
cool<00:03:37.409> I<00:03:37.709> just<00:03:38.099> wanted<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.370> show<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.549> guys<00:03:38.790> and
