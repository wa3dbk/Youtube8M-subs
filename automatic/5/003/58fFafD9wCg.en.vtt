00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.650
 The dressing is ready for the salad 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.840
 Cut here is your storm cucumber 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.150
 and you see here black ops 2 i have 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 at that time with the mp 7 with silencer 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.050
 played fast on high-tech magazine 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 and I packed light weight with it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.720
 I always nice down through the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 machine room back and forth can wash 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.939
 so as not to be on top of the deck where 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.619
 Weapons are far too wide 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.599
 I'm exposed like that for example 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.920
 all normal storm guns and me 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.750
 the smg is simply no chance 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 But that's not my topic 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 but my topic here at the first 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.420
 junior offenders are 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.309
 modifications because I find that they 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.510
 all affect and everyone uses which 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.250
 even if it may not 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.320
 you notice and that you go through 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.420
 modifications the experience of a game 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.739
 can expand and just that too 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 can experience how to do it personally 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.110
 would like to make modifications 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 in my opinion, two species once 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.379
 the installable where you have anything 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.930
 from so must install or files 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.879
 Change must be in folder or executable 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.100
 modification where you start a program 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.939
 and then something changes me 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.950
 go now to the first 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.510
 installable one and I'm there for 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.640
 the singleplayer area a game 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.840
 That's called minecraft yes 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 many of you know minecraft 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.409
 probably who does not know it is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.540
 play an 8 bit where at the blocks 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.619
 stacking on each other can be worthwhile 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.150
 every case is to play or yourself 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.890
 to look at the one or the other video 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.490
 then, of course, understands something better 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.680
 I mean 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.930
 Well, the game is very simple 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 Thousands of so-called modifications 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.979
 mods this is the abbreviation because many 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.600
 have height of the game me 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.210
 simple because I need the one or 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.369
 other ryanair is on and catching 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.659
 already with texter textures packages 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.939
 this word really serious with 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.619
 textures packages because this 8 bit graphic 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.229
 not everyone falls and there's even hd 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.970
 textures so that everything is more beautiful and the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.979
 Smooth edges are there and thus the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 people just like it then it works 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.270
 continue with new npcs so casual 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 which streak through the forests or new ones 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.119
 animals or just a few 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.030
 butterflies flying around with them 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.040
 The world itself is a bit busier and acts 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.140
 something nice by and as 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.549
 Finally there are the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.020
 possibility that the world is different 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.700
 when minecraft is generated 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.160
 that starts and creates a world 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.930
 randomly generates a world 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.450
 with wings 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.400
 see all sorts of things and this mossberg 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.079
 is still intervening in this system and 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.459
 adds a variety of villages 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.260
 what I find really cool that one 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.620
 really so deep in the game mechanics 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.299
 can dive with a modification 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.700
 then it goes on with the multiplayer 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.709
 also as an installable modification 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.889
 I chose minecraft again 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.420
 because it is unlikely it starts with 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.280
 certain programs the one 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.959
 it has to install and start something like that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.400
 both at once I would say and 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.900
 by itself a server starts on the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.000
 you play with other buddies together 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.290
 can and then there is for this server 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.840
 again different possibilities 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.669
 modifications called plug-ins that 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.260
 That's why I do not know why 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.000
 as well as said that one the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.829
 can reinstall others 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.439
 things to start for example paintball 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.730
 slaughter which causes the dynamics and the 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.219
 construction of the arch so to speak 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.019
 is transformed by the the because 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.340
 has created this murder and then you 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.169
 Paintball has weapons with paintball 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.489
 balls then leave color what 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.319
 really cool is how to get out of such a 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.419
 simple thing like the bow in the game 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.819
 so what can do awesome and really 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:16.819
 yes the whole thing can change and thereby 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.530
 discovered a new way of playing and 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.790
 a new way of playing there i come 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.220
 directly to the next point in the 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.359
 multiplayer and that's daisy for people 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.239
 who they do not know 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.519
 it is a zombie survival game on the 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.780
 base of a military one 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.030
 military simulation I would say 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.229
 namely arma 2 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.329
 but I think someone has two pretty much 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.709
 I liked it a lot and was on my knees 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.510
 I'm too boring on the duration of me 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.189
 would like to have zombies and then has 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.259
 started to program the daisy 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.750
 a separate game and there you can see 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:46.759
 the possibilities of modifications in 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.049
 People like the games but it 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.400
 will boring you then in the long run 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.409
 Think about what they could do 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.239
 make me beautiful in the long term 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.519
 can tease me longer on that 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.799
 play and try to build songs 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.799
 they create completely new games without 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.479
 absolutely no new game at all 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.500
 so to create his game too 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.120
 I would say develop 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.259
 they do not have to new engine 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.180
 nothing new they just take something 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.609
 old and build it after yours 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.019
 wish and that I find a good one 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.180
 example of the possibilities that one 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.949
 Modification can be brand new 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.570
 create games on the basis of old ones 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.269
 play that I find really easy 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.070
 only really cool then we come 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.730
 time to the executable modifications 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.040
 I would say 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.840
 from about modifications knows 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.740
 probably everyone I'll start 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.540
 with hacks yes where alex 22 realizes that 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.340
 all big topic on children community 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.080
 I do not want to go over that 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.700
 simplified the community has but 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.070
 are just files so excel 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.050
 files that you have to start and then 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.270
 Does he take any data? 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.890
 for example at a time hectic of yes in 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.570
 these rectangles on where one behind the wall 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.890
 is and this he attacks at the 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.300
 Information delivered to the pc 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.980
 get off and then he shows you one 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.450
 simple yes there is an opponent like that 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.400
 it's about to come off, I guess 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.680
 I do not know exactly but about that 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.060
 It could work and be there on board 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.880
 then automatically pulls on the 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.680
 breast and as the last modification would 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.930
 I determined my head tainan things 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.580
 Everyone knows when you play mw3 at black 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.560
 ops 2 is already built in that one 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.000
 field of view can change and the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.310
 five challenger probably uses 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.140
 Relatively many people of you call of 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.090
 So have played duty modern mp3 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.810
 warfare 3 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.400
 and that will really be me 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.930
 What do you generally care about 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 Modifications uses whether he's the talk 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.950
 changer used or if you minecraft 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.630
 modifications or plays on the 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.040
 still something completely different knows what 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.120
 which I have not noticed 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.840
 writes it definitely times in the 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.890
 Comments 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.140
 I will definitely do everything 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.880
 read through and I hope you have mine 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.920
 video my first appearance at 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.450
 the junior offender and if it is you 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.850
 I'll definitely like it again 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.850
 often see the cucumber is out here
