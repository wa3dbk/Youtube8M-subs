probably forget everything yeah I will
forget<00:05:53.300> everything<00:05:53.449> that<00:05:53.720> was<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:53.990> total<00:05:54.259> waste

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
forget everything that was a total waste

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.990 
forget everything that was a total waste
of<00:05:54.500> time<00:05:56.139> may<00:05:57.139> not<00:05:57.320> just<00:05:57.530> splice<00:05:57.919> scenes<00:05:58.400> yeah

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
of time may not just splice scenes yeah

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.260 
of time may not just splice scenes yeah
that's<00:05:59.180> a<00:05:59.300> good<00:05:59.449> idea<00:06:00.610> we're<00:06:01.610> not<00:06:01.729> exactly<00:06:01.910> in

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
that's a good idea we're not exactly in

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.890 
that's a good idea we're not exactly in
the<00:06:02.360> same<00:06:02.539> spot<00:06:02.750> but<00:06:03.289> whatever<00:06:07.720> basically<00:06:08.720> it

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
then there is love electric spark

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.089 
then there is love electric spark
Thunder<00:06:14.810> whatever<00:06:15.650> they<00:06:15.770> call<00:06:16.039> it<00:06:16.070> these<00:06:16.340> days
