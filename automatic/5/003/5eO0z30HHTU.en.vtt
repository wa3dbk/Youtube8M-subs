it looks like this is actually what a
finished<00:01:41.310> piece<00:01:41.610> would<00:01:41.850> look<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.180> I've<00:01:42.420> done

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

it<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> contrast<00:01:43.439> color<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.070> kind

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it in a contrast color so you can kind

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.020 
it in a contrast color so you can kind
of<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.939> creates<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.829> over<00:01:47.030> cast

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
of see that it creates this over cast

look<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> edge<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.850> great

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
look to the edge here it's a great

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
look to the edge here it's a great
finish<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.840> edge<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.140> blankets<00:01:52.649> and
