tweaks<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:08.000> tricks<00:00:09.230> has<00:00:10.230> been<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.740> wildly

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
tweaks and tricks has been so wildly

tweaks and tricks has been so wildly
popular<00:00:12.349> I'm<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.710> another<00:00:13.920> one<00:00:14.160> now

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890

what<00:00:16.890> I've<00:00:17.010> done<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.820> put<00:00:18.650> caulking

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
what I've done here is I put caulking

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.570 
what I've done here is I put caulking
right<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:23.510> around<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.750> outlets<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> seal

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
right here around the outlets so to seal

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.859 
right here around the outlets so to seal
off<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:26.939> air<00:00:27.779> leaks<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:29.150> also<00:00:30.150> put<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> around

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
off any air leaks I also put it around

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.830 
off any air leaks I also put it around
this<00:00:31.199> blowhole<00:00:31.890> because<00:00:32.489> only<00:00:32.759> air<00:00:33.540> should

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
this blowhole because only air should

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.470 
this blowhole because only air should
come<00:00:34.020> out<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.730> now<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.149> most<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
come out of that now I know that most of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.920 
come out of that now I know that most of
you<00:00:36.540> audio<00:00:36.899> files<00:00:37.230> don't<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> PhD<00:00:38.040> in

you audio files don't have a PhD in

you audio files don't have a PhD in
sonic<00:00:40.370> engineering<00:00:41.370> from<00:00:41.550> MIT<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.480> do

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
sonic engineering from MIT like I do

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
sonic engineering from MIT like I do
so<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> forgive<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:46.370> bad<00:00:47.370> comments<00:00:48.620> but

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so I forgive all your bad comments but

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.000 
so I forgive all your bad comments but
let's<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.160> layman's<00:00:50.520> terms<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:52.010> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
let's put it in layman's terms what a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.760 
let's put it in layman's terms what a
speaker<00:00:53.370> does<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.910> push<00:00:54.149> air<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:55.050> pushes<00:00:55.469> air

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
speaker does is push air it pushes air

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.180 
speaker does is push air it pushes air
that<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.930> for<00:00:57.930> every<00:00:58.199> action<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:58.920> must<00:00:59.070> be

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
that way for every action there must be

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.119 
that way for every action there must be
a<00:00:59.219> reaction<00:00:59.879> an<00:01:00.000> equal<00:01:00.510> reaction<00:01:01.129> therefore

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
a reaction an equal reaction therefore

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.000 
a reaction an equal reaction therefore
must<00:01:02.520> push<00:01:02.850> air<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.600> other<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.260> into<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
must push air the other way or into the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.250 
must push air the other way or into the
cabinet<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> cabinet<00:01:09.659> needs<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.140> be

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
cabinet so the cabinet needs to be

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.280 
cabinet so the cabinet needs to be
sealed<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.390> much<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.540> possible

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.800 

now<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.130> speaker<00:01:17.549> did<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:17.909> push<00:01:18.210> air<00:01:18.450> into

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
now if the speaker did not push air into

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.980 
now if the speaker did not push air into
the<00:01:19.530> cabinet<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> use<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.439> an<00:01:22.439> equal

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
the cabinet and use it as an equal

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.080 
the cabinet and use it as an equal
reaction<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> force<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.700> speaker

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
reaction to the force of the speaker

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.240 
reaction to the force of the speaker
then<00:01:28.049> think<00:01:28.320> about<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> wouldn't<00:01:28.950> need

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
then think about it you wouldn't need

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.569 
then think about it you wouldn't need
any<00:01:29.729> enclosures<00:01:31.070> why<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
any enclosures why not just have the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.929 
any enclosures why not just have the
speaker's<00:01:33.979> because<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.280> speaker's<00:01:35.640> would<00:01:35.850> be

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
speaker's because the speaker's would be

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.149 
speaker's because the speaker's would be
pushing<00:01:36.299> air<00:01:36.420> backwards<00:01:36.750> into<00:01:37.170> dead<00:01:37.470> into

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
pushing air backwards into dead into

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460 
pushing air backwards into dead into
open<00:01:38.909> air<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> nothing<00:01:39.840> would<00:01:39.930> come<00:01:40.200> forward

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
open air and nothing would come forward

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.319 
open air and nothing would come forward
I<00:01:41.659> hope<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> makes<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.079> little<00:01:43.200> bit<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.470> sense

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
I hope that makes a little bit of sense

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.190 
I hope that makes a little bit of sense
the<00:01:45.329> trick<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> most<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:47.040> all

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the trick here is that most or all

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.340 
the trick here is that most or all
cabinets<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:50.210> modified<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:53.130> push<00:01:53.610> better

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
cabinets can be modified to push better

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
cabinets can be modified to push better
air<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.799> better<00:01:56.040> sound<00:01:56.479> especially<00:01:57.479> at

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
air and better sound especially at

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.319 
air and better sound especially at
higher<00:01:57.780> decibels<00:01:59.000> because<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> higher

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
higher decibels because the higher

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.010 
higher decibels because the higher
decibels<00:02:01.640> larger<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> speaker<00:02:03.119> pushes<00:02:03.810> more

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
decibels larger the speaker pushes more

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.039 
decibels larger the speaker pushes more
air<00:02:04.290> therefore<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.189> causes<00:02:05.369> more<00:02:06.049> pressure

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
air therefore it causes more pressure

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.699 
air therefore it causes more pressure
inside<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> case<00:02:09.020> now<00:02:10.020> I'll<00:02:10.140> give<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.349> one<00:02:10.590> of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
inside the case now I'll give you one of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.200 
inside the case now I'll give you one of
my<00:02:10.800> other<00:02:10.920> secrets<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.580> how<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
see if your speaker enclosures leak

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.440 
see if your speaker enclosures leak
