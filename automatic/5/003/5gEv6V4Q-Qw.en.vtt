work against these sonic bastards in a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.979 
work against these sonic bastards in a
way<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> think<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:15.030> was<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.360> perfect<00:04:15.540> stage

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.819 
due to the background and of course
