that I gave this book a see I I really

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.529 
that I gave this book a see I I really
enjoyed<00:01:11.920> it<00:01:12.070> but<00:01:12.549> I<00:01:12.610> didn't<00:01:12.939> think<00:01:13.240> it<00:01:13.450> was

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
enjoyed it but I didn't think it was

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.499 
enjoyed it but I didn't think it was
anything<00:01:13.899> too<00:01:14.259> spectacular<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:16.030> let's<00:01:16.359> talk

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
anything too spectacular now let's talk

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.209 
anything too spectacular now let's talk
about<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.840> characters<00:01:17.200> I<00:01:17.469> didn't<00:01:18.130> really

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
about the characters I didn't really

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:19.469 
about the characters I didn't really
feel<00:01:18.430> like<00:01:18.490> there<00:01:18.729> was<00:01:18.789> enough<00:01:19.030> chemistry

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
feel like there was enough chemistry

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.020 
feel like there was enough chemistry
between<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.170> characters<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.700> think<00:01:21.909> it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
between the characters and I think it

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.190 
between the characters and I think it
has<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.210> do<00:01:22.509> with<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.750> fact<00:01:22.899> that<00:01:23.020> the

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
has to do with the fact that the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.560 
has to do with the fact that the
character<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.979> main<00:01:24.159> character<00:01:24.310> Lexi<00:01:24.880> didn't

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
character the main character Lexi didn't

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.749 
character the main character Lexi didn't
really<00:01:25.780> have<00:01:25.960> as<00:01:26.200> much<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.890> personality<00:01:27.130> as

really have as much of a personality as
i<00:01:27.969> would<00:01:28.030> have<00:01:28.240> liked<00:01:28.659> she<00:01:29.409> had<00:01:29.679> enough<00:01:30.009> of<00:01:30.130> a

along<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.429> right<00:01:39.579> way<00:01:39.789> but<00:01:39.850> she<00:01:40.210> didn't<00:01:40.479> have

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
along the right way but she didn't have

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.709 
along the right way but she didn't have

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.889 
to be there I think the most interesting
characters<00:01:50.340> were<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.999> people<00:01:52.420> who<00:01:52.450> live<00:01:52.689> on

really<00:02:03.369> make<00:02:03.640> up<00:02:03.819> for<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.119> lack<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.569> chemistry

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
really make up for the lack of chemistry

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.590 
really make up for the lack of chemistry
and<00:02:05.829> personality<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.939> other<00:02:07.060> characters

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
and personality and the other characters

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.240 
and personality and the other characters
I<00:02:07.840> would<00:02:08.170> have<00:02:08.259> liked<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.619> see<00:02:08.800> more<00:02:09.009> out<00:02:09.220> of

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
I would have liked to see more out of

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.100 
I would have liked to see more out of
the<00:02:09.520> characters<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.179> understand<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:10.929> this

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
the characters I understand that this

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.440 
the characters I understand that this
crazy<00:02:11.440> thing<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:11.890> going<00:02:12.069> on<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.700> if<00:02:12.850> that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
crazy thing was going on and if that

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.410 
crazy thing was going on and if that
were<00:02:13.569> really<00:02:13.600> happening<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.670> entire<00:02:16.090> town

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
were really happening the entire town

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.880 
were really happening the entire town
would<00:02:16.690> be<00:02:16.810> focused<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.709> one<00:02:17.950> crazy<00:02:18.400> event

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
would be focused on that one crazy event

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.100 
would be focused on that one crazy event
but<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.700> book<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.090> feel<00:02:20.330> like<00:02:20.510> there<00:02:20.810> needs<00:02:20.840> to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
but in a book I feel like there needs to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.870 
but in a book I feel like there needs to
be<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.260> little<00:02:21.530> bit<00:02:21.680> more<00:02:21.800> development<00:02:22.550> than

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
be a little bit more development than

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.050 
be a little bit more development than
just<00:02:23.150> what's<00:02:23.360> going<00:02:23.660> on<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.050> plot<00:02:24.319> and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
just what's going on in the plot and

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.670 
just what's going on in the plot and
while<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.330> wasn't<00:02:26.540> too<00:02:26.870> bad<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.290> wasn't<00:02:27.380> too

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
while it wasn't too bad it wasn't too

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.559 
while it wasn't too bad it wasn't too
noticeable<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.550> didn't<00:02:29.000> really<00:02:29.090> feel<00:02:29.510> that

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
noticeable it didn't really feel that

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.570 
noticeable it didn't really feel that
way<00:02:29.750> until<00:02:30.020> after<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.440> finished<00:02:30.920> reading<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
way until after I finished reading it I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.780 
way until after I finished reading it I
feel<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.330> there<00:02:32.630> could<00:02:32.660> have<00:02:32.900> been<00:02:33.020> more

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
feel like there could have been more

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.030 
feel like there could have been more
development<00:02:34.790> with<00:02:35.750> everyone<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.709> everything

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
development with everyone and everything

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.980 
development with everyone and everything
let's<00:02:37.670> talk<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.910> little<00:02:38.090> bit<00:02:38.420> about<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.780> plot

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
let's talk a little bit about the plot

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.470 
let's talk a little bit about the plot
the<00:02:39.380> plot<00:02:39.530> was<00:02:39.650> very<00:02:40.459> able<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.880> confusing

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
the plot was very able to confusing

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.820 
the plot was very able to confusing
which<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.780> how<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:41.959> feel<00:02:42.230> about<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.560> plot<00:02:42.770> was

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
which is how I feel about the plot was

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.190 
which is how I feel about the plot was
confusing<00:02:43.490> because<00:02:44.240> there<00:02:44.690> were<00:02:44.780> some<00:02:44.989> things

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
confusing because there were some things

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.290 
confusing because there were some things
that<00:02:45.380> were<00:02:45.590> too<00:02:45.860> developed<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.580> feel<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:47.000> and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
that were too developed I feel like and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.030 
that were too developed I feel like and
to<00:02:47.540> spend<00:02:47.780> too<00:02:47.989> much<00:02:48.110> time<00:02:48.170> talking<00:02:48.560> about<00:02:48.830> it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
to spend too much time talking about it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.250 
to spend too much time talking about it
too<00:02:49.370> much<00:02:49.400> time<00:02:49.730> worrying<00:02:49.970> about<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.720> then

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
too much time worrying about it and then

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.750 
too much time worrying about it and then
there<00:02:51.440> are<00:02:51.470> other<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.980> other<00:02:52.220> things<00:02:52.520> that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
there are other and other things that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.910 
there are other and other things that
could<00:02:53.239> have<00:02:53.390> been<00:02:53.630> developed<00:02:54.110> more<00:02:54.380> all<00:02:54.650> of

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
could have been developed more all of

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.970 
could have been developed more all of
the<00:02:55.010> focus<00:02:55.400> was<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:55.850> one<00:02:56.360> thing<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.709> feel

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
the focus was on one thing and I feel

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.100 
the focus was on one thing and I feel
like<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.489> could<00:02:59.150> have<00:02:59.209> been<00:02:59.510> spread<00:02:59.900> out

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
like it could have been spread out

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.220 
like it could have been spread out
evenly<00:03:00.530> among<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:02.300> certain<00:03:02.750> things<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.140> it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
evenly among the certain things that it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.220 
evenly among the certain things that it
was<00:03:03.260> on<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:04.090> some<00:03:05.090> other<00:03:05.269> important<00:03:06.050> factors

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
was on and some other important factors

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.160 
was on and some other important factors
now<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.190> little<00:03:07.550> bit<00:03:07.760> about<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.120> writing<00:03:08.360> this

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
now a little bit about the writing this

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.040 
now a little bit about the writing this
is<00:03:09.470> Victoria<00:03:10.130> Schwab<00:03:10.340> first<00:03:10.880> novel<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.510> I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
is Victoria Schwab first novel and I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.960 
is Victoria Schwab first novel and I
think<00:03:12.320> as<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.890> first<00:03:13.130> novel<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.700> was<00:03:13.940> a

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
think as the first novel it was a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.449 
think as the first novel it was a
complete<00:03:14.570> success<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:15.320> don't<00:03:15.950> think<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.250> could

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
complete success I don't think I could

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.699 
complete success I don't think I could
have<00:03:16.610> written<00:03:16.640> something<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.510> good<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.440> for

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
have written something this good but for

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.070 
have written something this good but for
someone<00:03:18.950> who<00:03:19.220> has<00:03:19.459> read<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.970> lot<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.480> lot<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.780> lot

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
someone who has read a lot a lot a lot

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.789 
someone who has read a lot a lot a lot
of<00:03:21.560> why<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> books<00:03:22.190> my<00:03:22.850> expectation<00:03:23.720> for<00:03:24.320> a<00:03:24.380> good

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
of why a books my expectation for a good

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.670 
of why a books my expectation for a good
book<00:03:25.070> have<00:03:25.910> increased<00:03:26.570> like<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:28.840> lot<00:03:29.840> what's

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
and this book has pretty much had

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.410 
and this book has pretty much had
everything<00:04:12.769> that<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.340> needed<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.670> be<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:14.030> great

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
everything that it needed to be a great

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.770 
everything that it needed to be a great
why<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.660> novel<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:16.519> think<00:04:17.359> that's<00:04:17.570> something

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
why a novel and I think that's something

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.520 
why a novel and I think that's something
that<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.410> can't<00:04:18.769> just<00:04:19.220> come<00:04:19.900> by<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:20.930> think<00:04:21.380> you

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
that you can't just come by I think you

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.740 
that you can't just come by I think you
have<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.769> actually<00:04:22.070> be<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.430> good<00:04:22.640> writer<00:04:22.880> to

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
have to actually be a good writer to

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.750 
have to actually be a good writer to
have<00:04:24.110> those<00:04:24.650> things<00:04:24.860> in<00:04:25.070> your<00:04:25.250> story<00:04:25.520> those

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
have those things in your story those

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.990 
have those things in your story those
elements<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.990> are<00:04:27.050> needed<00:04:27.410> I<00:04:27.770> think<00:04:28.280> is<00:04:28.430> the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
elements that are needed I think is the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.950 
elements that are needed I think is the
longship<00:04:29.419> it

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
longship it

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.029 
longship it
a little<00:04:30.139> more<00:04:30.259> time<00:04:30.470> on<00:04:30.500> character

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
a little more time on character

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.980 
a little more time on character

don't<00:05:11.060> remember<00:05:11.389> that<00:05:11.570> just<00:05:11.810> because<00:05:11.870> I<00:05:12.199> was

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
don't remember that just because I was

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.520 
don't remember that just because I was
so<00:05:13.039> I'm<00:05:13.280> reading<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:13.729> quickly<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.780> was<00:05:15.080> so

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
so I'm reading so quickly and I was so

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.219 
so I'm reading so quickly and I was so
confused<00:05:15.800> as<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.550> what<00:05:16.849> was<00:05:16.970> going<00:05:17.030> on<00:05:17.389> I<00:05:17.720> don't

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
confused as to what was going on I don't

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.260 
confused as to what was going on I don't
remember<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:19.280> I<00:05:19.310> don't<00:05:19.639> think<00:05:19.849> that<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.120> was<00:05:20.240> a

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
remember so I don't think that it was a

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.110 
remember so I don't think that it was a
great<00:05:20.720> ending<00:05:20.960> but<00:05:21.740> i<00:05:21.800> think<00:05:21.889> that<00:05:22.130> where<00:05:22.490> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
great ending but i think that where the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.080 
great ending but i think that where the
development<00:05:23.720> left<00:05:24.080> led<00:05:24.409> up<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.949> ended<00:05:25.849> in<00:05:25.970> a

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
development left led up to it ended in a

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.089 
development left led up to it ended in a
very<00:05:26.300> like<00:05:26.509> it<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:27.139> actual<00:05:27.289> ending<00:05:27.919> was<00:05:28.069> a

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
very like it the actual ending was a

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.159 
very like it the actual ending was a
good<00:05:28.280> ending<00:05:28.639> but<00:05:29.240> what<00:05:29.449> led<00:05:29.659> up<00:05:29.840> to<00:05:29.870> the

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
good ending but what led up to the

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.640 
good ending but what led up to the
ending<00:05:30.639> what<00:05:31.639> is<00:05:31.759> confusing<00:05:32.659> wanting<00:05:33.530> any

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
ending what is confusing wanting any

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.680 
ending what is confusing wanting any
sense<00:05:33.919> i<00:05:34.099> don't<00:05:34.250> know<00:05:34.340> but<00:05:34.789> i've<00:05:35.389> started

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
sense i don't know but i've started

cover actually ended up as but I really

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.749 
cover actually ended up as but I really
really<00:05:50.900> like<00:05:51.139> the<00:05:51.289> cover<00:05:51.530> when<00:05:51.830> I<00:05:51.860> first<00:05:52.219> guy<00:05:52.460> I

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
really like the cover when I first guy I

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.240 
really like the cover when I first guy I
thought<00:05:52.969> it<00:05:53.030> was<00:05:53.120> really<00:05:53.360> cool<00:05:53.830> but<00:05:54.830> now<00:05:55.009> that

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
thought it was really cool but now that

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.790 
thought it was really cool but now that
is<00:05:55.789> gone<00:05:56.060> I<00:05:56.389> really<00:05:56.659> don't<00:05:56.840> like<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:57.349> I<00:05:57.380> don't

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
is gone I really don't like it I don't

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.670 
is gone I really don't like it I don't
like<00:05:58.039> how<00:05:58.759> the<00:05:58.820> font<00:05:59.300> is<00:05:59.570> so<00:05:59.780> dark<00:06:00.139> and<00:06:00.409> then

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
like how the font is so dark and then

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.830 
like how the font is so dark and then
she<00:06:01.550> is<00:06:01.789> so<00:06:02.000> white<00:06:02.240> i<00:06:02.270> think<00:06:02.599> they<00:06:02.659> need<00:06:02.810> to

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
she is so white i think they need to

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.230 
she is so white i think they need to
change<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.349> opacity<00:06:03.440> a<00:06:03.889> little<00:06:04.219> bit<00:06:04.370> and<00:06:04.639> make

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
change the opacity a little bit and make

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.870 
change the opacity a little bit and make
her<00:06:05.389> a<00:06:05.419> little<00:06:05.690> bit<00:06:05.870> more<00:06:06.080> visible<00:06:06.620> but<00:06:07.550> i

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
her a little bit more visible but i

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.540 
her a little bit more visible but i
really<00:06:08.419> like<00:06:08.539> the<00:06:08.659> font<00:06:08.900> and<00:06:09.259> i<00:06:10.159> really<00:06:10.400> like

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
really like the font and i really like

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.339 
really like the font and i really like
to<00:06:10.580> model<00:06:11.030> that<00:06:11.180> they<00:06:11.270> chose<00:06:11.509> and<00:06:12.050> how<00:06:12.139> it's

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
to model that they chose and how it's

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.390 
to model that they chose and how it's
all<00:06:12.469> sheer<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:12.889> stuff<00:06:13.039> like<00:06:13.130> that<00:06:13.219> i<00:06:13.340> just

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
all sheer and stuff like that i just

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.870 
all sheer and stuff like that i just
think<00:06:13.729> that<00:06:13.789> is<00:06:14.000> a<00:06:14.150> little<00:06:14.419> bit<00:06:14.570> too<00:06:14.870> opaque

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
think that is a little bit too opaque

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.279 
think that is a little bit too opaque
now<00:06:16.880> i<00:06:16.909> know<00:06:17.240> that<00:06:17.870> you<00:06:18.020> guys<00:06:18.139> are<00:06:18.259> just

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
now i know that you guys are just

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.899 
now i know that you guys are just
wondering<00:06:18.740> whether<00:06:19.009> or<00:06:19.159> not<00:06:19.250> this<00:06:19.400> has<00:06:19.639> the<00:06:19.789> it

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
wondering whether or not this has the it

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.529 
wondering whether or not this has the it
factor<00:06:19.940> and<00:06:20.690> i<00:06:21.469> think<00:06:21.740> that<00:06:22.009> it<00:06:22.430> does<00:06:22.909> have<00:06:22.940> the

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
factor and i think that it does have the

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.350 
factor and i think that it does have the
it<00:06:23.659> factor<00:06:23.690> to<00:06:24.650> be<00:06:24.860> a<00:06:24.889> good<00:06:25.099> why<00:06:25.250> a<00:06:25.280> book<00:06:25.639> but

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
it factor to be a good why a book but

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.260 
it factor to be a good why a book but
it's<00:06:26.659> not<00:06:26.840> something<00:06:27.080> that<00:06:27.320> you<00:06:27.680> need<00:06:27.889> to<00:06:28.270> jump

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
it's not something that you need to jump

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.779 
it's not something that you need to jump
to<00:06:29.599> read<00:06:29.840> now<00:06:30.560> i<00:06:30.590> have<00:06:30.949> heard<00:06:31.400> other<00:06:31.669> people
