00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
coating process in such a way that he

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.500 
coating process in such a way that he
can<00:00:45.360> apply<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> product<00:00:46.789> very<00:00:47.789> evenly

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
can apply the product very evenly

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.369 
can apply the product very evenly
without<00:00:49.170> sags<00:00:49.739> without<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.700> texture<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> what

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
without sags without a texture and what

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.220 
without sags without a texture and what
that<00:00:52.590> allows<00:00:53.489> us<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> preppers<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> really

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that allows us is the preppers to really

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
that allows us is the preppers to really
work<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:55.949> efficiently<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.059> product

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
work more efficiently on that product

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.000 
work more efficiently on that product
because<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> take<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
because they have to take all of that

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
because they have to take all of that
texture<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> better<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.530> Clint

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
texture out and so the better that Clint

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.310 
texture out and so the better that Clint
can<00:01:02.100> apply<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.000> gel<00:01:03.270> coat

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
can apply the gel coat

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.370 
can apply the gel coat
the<00:01:04.800> easier<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.310> is<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:05.850> Preppers<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:07.230> get

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the easier it is for the Preppers to get

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.130 
the easier it is for the Preppers to get
up<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.100> painting<00:01:08.430> stage<00:01:08.700> quicker<00:01:09.140> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
up to the painting stage quicker you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
up to the painting stage quicker you
know<00:01:10.230> I'll<00:01:10.620> Pat<00:01:10.980> myself<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> back<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
know I'll Pat myself on the back a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.430 
know I'll Pat myself on the back a
little<00:01:12.090> bit<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.480> typically<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.230> those

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
little bit but typically when those

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.980 
little bit but typically when those
speakers<00:01:13.800> come<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.610> they're<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.540> real

striving to put out the best speaker
that<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.250> possibly<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:14.580> all<00:02:14.700> have

that love and that desire you know

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.410 
that love and that desire you know
that's<00:02:16.739> what<00:02:17.070> we<00:02:17.250> want<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.700> that's<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
that's what we want to do that's the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.360 
that's what we want to do that's the
that's<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.470> focus<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> key

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.550 

I've<00:02:27.090> always<00:02:27.239> felt<00:02:27.480> kind<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.959> an<00:02:28.170> artist

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
I've always felt kind of like an artist

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.600 
I've always felt kind of like an artist
and<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:31.340> guess<00:02:32.340> each<00:02:32.640> speaker<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.330> my<00:02:33.599> I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
and so I guess each speaker is my I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.949 
and so I guess each speaker is my I
don't<00:02:35.610> know<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.209> my<00:02:36.390> painting

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
it's my masterpiece and that's that's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.690
