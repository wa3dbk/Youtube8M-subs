00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Today we test for you the panasonic 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.089
 lumix g 7 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.069
 I have her in Japan before 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.450
 the game class in hand now but 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.099
 times the right test now she could 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.849
 also two times three weeks right through 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.500
 Test what this elfi holiday city ​​trip 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.210
 camera so it have the learn her 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.600
 today so always looking intently 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.600
 see you soon 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.520
 in the lumix g f 7 comes a so-called 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.220
 mft sensor for use or a sensor 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.320
 format a bit smaller than in 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.240
 the entry-level dslr cameras or 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.340
 system cameras for example from samsung 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.280
 but still much larger than in 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.870
 compact cameras and just with the mft 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.520
 standard so the bayonet is 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.530
 standardized olympus for example 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.970
 exactly the same a big advantage 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.700
 You just have a very, very 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.170
 good objective choice otherwise in things 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.640
 design you can already see the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.330
 camera the very very small slim 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.100
 held 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.780
 a bit of metal with it so not 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.829
 quite as cheap as others now 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.170
 beginner dslr front just with his 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.940
 Recent she leather optics at least as from 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.530
 It's actually pretty good 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.090
 of course very small now for big ones 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.440
 Hands do not offer much space 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.750
 I think it's actually so far 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.170
 okay, otherwise you also have one 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.759
 retractable lightning on the camera says there 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.619
 it does not come from that either 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.270
 really big you do not have any 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.310
 possibility over the accessory shoe still 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.020
 to connect additional accessories and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.479
 of course the very big highlight 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.670
 if the camera is then start again 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.360
 of course the 180 degrees swiveling 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.340
 display 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.080
 biggest advantage because of course accepted 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.509
 she wanted to do it then it works 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.179
 Of course, so much better than if 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.399
 you know all this then somehow 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.200
 not firmly mounted or would have 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.360
 the smartphone app for that after order 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.500
 fancy display thought there you have 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.390
 even the main target group the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.130
 is really recognized by panasonic 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.200
 a bit than the scm camera for 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.060
 people thought to take on service 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.470
 want and how good that looks 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.240
 Let's think about the people 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.770
 to make two meadows know it is so 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.759
 if I have to hold a camera like that 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.380
 I still trigger the same time 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.929
 can push then sometimes is pretty 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.119
 shaky construction at the camera 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.709
 you can just as easily as you do 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.869
 it just wants because it still has 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.700
 various other triggering modes for 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.230
 For example, two people can easily join 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 Merging in the face then solves 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.230
 the camera from that has my japan 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.000
 ever shown or you to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.700
 example, once through the picture so that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.870
 The face that is hidden smiles 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 then, of course, like me now, of course 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.620
 not at all and then the camera is released 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.209
 Immediately off and who exactly the display 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.800
 looks even sees that the camera times 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.660
 try the front eye on 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.430
 focus so photographically 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.650
 even really does everything right 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.420
 to do it right is cool thing 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.960
 and whatever I like what he does 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.600
 on the other hand 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.850
 To many other eleven cameras a pro 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.890
 features is you can do this selfio 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.720
 use mode in all modes that is with 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.800
 Manual exposure dazzle priority 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.500
 time priority 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.600
 with iso automatic or without that means 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.520
 you can still see photographically 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.350
 Set everything as it have want 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.150
 only the cameras then completely again 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.190
 classically responsible for focusing 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.530
 you also have a cappucci for her 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.350
 For example, they filter you a very slim one 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.700
 Unfortunately, it is not possible to make a face 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.290
 quite as realistic as my face 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.390
 and when it is so inwardly by building 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.100
 So therefore with caution 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.810
 It also ensures that that 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.260
 live picture starts pretty strong too 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.660
 jerk 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.370
 So that is not optimal 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.420
 but the rest of the functions are 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.240
 self we are definitely good 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.580
 implemented by panasonic record videos 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.910
 can one with the panasonic lumix g 7 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.950
 but in principle it is not 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.750
 real professional purposes suitable for her 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.880
 can not go anywhere at all 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.710
 external microphone connect what stop 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.870
 in things audio quality already so his 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.540
 disadvantages also has a problem, of course 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.830
 their content is theirs 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.750
 microphones now so we just got 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.340
 there is virtually no wind there 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.990
 probably just again company 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.060
 but as soon as the really 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.110
 you can hear the softest wind 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.120
 of course in these integrated 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.640
 Microphones very very fast very strong 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.380
 So who should want to record videos 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.210
 In any case, other slm 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.620
 looking for where it is an external 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.260
 Microphone to the ceilings can 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.670
 or is there otherwise of the quality 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.770
 was actually in order 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.090
 on up to 50 microseconds it so 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.730
 no problem there you get one 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.350
 good full hd material out can be synonymous yes 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.550
 still different styles on it pack 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.710
 So all for themselves that there is no 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.150
 problem that I found so far good but 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.710
 somehow said for me biggest manko 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.530
 simply no external microphone what you 

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.390
 this is a bit silly now 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.340
 but still on a very important topic 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.540
 Of course this is the picture quality of the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.550
 lumix g 7 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.350
 I was personally honest 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.850
 a little surprised how good that is 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.880
 just in a little light I was 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.740
 Munich has to go he has to go 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.690
 3,200 highly photographed and even the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.690
 Pictures actually looked really good 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.030
 So I say so until iso 6,400 can 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.160
 now really big for a4 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.500
 maybe even use three expressions 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.580
 who was the only way to 10 x 15 so that my 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.690
 picture wants to print too much 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.700
 go much higher that there is no 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.130
 problem 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.720
 also for the web is iso 6.400 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.370
 quite usable that I thought so 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.230
 a camera such a very compact camera 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.790
 with a not too bright 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.570
 objectively what I had in mind really 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.910
 really good 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.530
 So there's really a thumbs up for 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.120
 Panasonic well done and otherwise 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.680
 really very nice dynamics and 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.420
 was a very very good picture 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.260
 with the right lenses out 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.870
 the supplied 12 to 32 mm kit 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.340
 Objectively there you notice the edge towards the 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.080
 is pretty blurred as well 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.090
 really really crisp and sharp pictures 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.070
 the edge wants to have it 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.680
 Obtain objective but in the center is also 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.750
 that really really good things 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.820
 Picture quality really a tree almost two 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.820
 Thumb up the tgf 7 pretty chic 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.450
 the panasonic 7 is really very very 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.070
 quietly in series images and the 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.200
 knows about the mechanical closure 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.000
 Since the camera comes close to five 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.650
 six pictures per second depending on whether 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.690
 her with a continuous autofocus 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.580
 or with a single image autofocus 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.440
 I want to work very well 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.420
 You may have heard a long time 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.310
 the camera does not hold this pace 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.500
 Just seven pictures fit inside 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.360
 buffer so let's say so 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.830
 a little over a second she creates 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.350
 the pace and then it is already immediately 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.700
 at least if your ear pictures 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.450
 wanted to record if only the epic 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.910
 takes pictures 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.500
 just under 40 pictures fit purely depending 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.430
 how fast the memory card is too 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.620
 a few more 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.060
 but who really long long series in 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.260
 would like to record higher only with the 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.700
 Camera definitely not good advice 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
 there are definitely better ones 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.740
 Of course, for a little bit more 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.420
 money 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.370
 The autofocus would finally have been so good 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.290
 fallen and contrast autofocus system 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.610
 So no phases of fw sensors around 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.330
 now especially fast maybe 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.770
 to work 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.210
 it also takes the camera 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.770
 not because she does not have that either 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.880
 problem that they pump properly strong 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.990
 must or something even in low light 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.330
 point are still very much 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.340
 so reliable in matters 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.200
 autofocus actually a good package what 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.120
 Panasonic the game especially for 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.380
 this compactness and of course the 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.930
 Price class slim 749 euro costs 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.700
 currently the g7 with the kit lens that 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.860
 we have here in the test is natural 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.840
 No really low praise one has to 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.030
 already know if one because then 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.220
 I personally value the value 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.160
 for example, the olympus pen e p1 7 a 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.560
 better better camera costs scarce 499 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.660
 euro with the cheapest kit objectively there 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.250
 is also a bit 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.230
 up but definitely 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.850
 noticeably cheaper actually even 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.100
 a bit better processed but 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.150
 not quite as compact as the gf 7 and 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.130
 that's probably the one here 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.210
 main advantage together with the possible 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.130
 very very good and up 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.190
 foldout display and just the 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:21.920
 whole functions in the area 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.360
 but photography brings 47 euros 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.460
 really a very proud 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.440
 Price and for that I would have at least 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.510
 a microphone input awaits for the 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.100
 Video mode that the only thing the 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.050
 you can criticize it in any case 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.400
 otherwise as I said no real 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.600
 Weak points should be at the circle 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.090
 Of course not 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.620
 what do you say you would be the camera 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.540
 like to buy in the bottom once 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.270
 otherwise already write the comments 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.380
 addressed eps 7 from olympus finds 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.760
 her course in here sometimes 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.350
 maybe it 's a bit linked 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.060
 of course you have to have something for you 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.290
 just say otherwise like once many 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.850
 Thanks for the audience, too 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.540
 thumbs up for this video and 

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.540
 until next week
