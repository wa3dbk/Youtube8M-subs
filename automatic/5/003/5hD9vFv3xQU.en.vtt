00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.210
 Hi there, this video has no 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.699
 one two dangerous 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.699
 i will introduce you to gaming islam 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.869
 e 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.150
 The first is the device company Microsoft 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.100
 showed to the public in 2009 for the production 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.789
 project natal name 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.929
 the name was also changed to a penalty 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.679
 opportunities remain the same 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.589
 This accessory allows you to play without 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.310
 Any control Ann is sufficiently strengthened 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.070
 its body is made of quality 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.260
 Markov glossy plastic 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.380
 the device is equipped with two compositions 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.120
 by which she builds ranks 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.200
 set off ambient 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.090
 spaces 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.810
 considering your movements 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.540
 these two cameras are used for 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.680
 face recognition video chat and 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.260
 snapshots lower parts hidden 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.080
 quality island 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.410
 which may well replace 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.590
 setting a penalty is easy 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.440
 connect console accessory 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.550
 arrange it exactly 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.700
 or cranes 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.790
 run incremental calibration 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.210
 fst 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.079
 using the film academy function 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.799
 the camera can recognize players 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.600
 frame and automatically upload their profile 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480
 This feature works well 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.230
 only desirable to carry out the procedure 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.360
 scanning at different times of day pirates 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 illumination then kin will not 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.080
 get to know us faster 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.530
 also kick allows you to drive 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.080
 console using gestures true only 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.330
 inside a separate so-called menu 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.570
 calves aut 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.729
 new number of items is small 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.060
 and manipulating them takes time 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.860
 to press the button on it is necessary 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.119
 put hand cursor 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.030
 during the detention of Ivano Frankivsk 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.290
 voice commands can also be used 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.430
 However, this information is lippy Russian speech 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.430
 film expert does not recognize 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.310
 As for the games, the speech is first of all 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.690
 goes rendered on projects produced 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.110
 especially for kinex 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.250
 for example, when the first part suggests 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280
 placement in the heads were behind in 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.640
 zero gravity 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 if a cat on a mountain river on an inflatable 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.780
 boat your time jumping collection 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.249
 bonus coin 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.789
 in any case will have to show 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.399
 activity wave your arms and legs 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.409
 bend down and so on 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.959
 lazy here does not like 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.680
 to take the example of a high jump 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.259
 must really try 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.629
 in Minsk it is now Stone that the minister is not 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.879
 characterized by particular diversity and may 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.249
 quickly get bored 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.339
 DJ Wright is a simple arcade game. 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.219
 racing with avatar fox box 360 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.579
 player profile players 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.889
 the car accelerates somatically and you 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.689
 it remains to twist an imaginary role 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.919
 use don't waste throwing away your hands 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.019
 forward 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.480
 fluent plain 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.620
 win over computer 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.299
 components pretty easy 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.979
 but the game is very colorful more 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.219
 designed for people this is incomplete different 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:48.919
 modes 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.539
 regular check-in with 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.709
 using weapons with a set 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.709
 points for tricks and so on 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.389
 so we are countries of our roof 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.539
 Kinex ports is a set of sports 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.229
 beach volleyball table tennis 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.179
 bowling 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.149
 athletics discipline in berlin 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:07.989
 since i 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.169
 and still suddenly smell 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.669
 sorry just for the athletes 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.259
 moves around the field themselves 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.489
 you just have to beat block or 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.149
 give gear 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.009
 despite general income because 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.759
 what's a person 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.309
 Financial impressions since the best 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:23.469
 it is a pity that complete with the device 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.659
 free give a penalty less 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:26.749
 not so 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.579
 note that drunk requires good 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:29.379
 lighting 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.759
 and quite a lot of free space 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.069
 we must move away from the screen at least 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.779
 two meters 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.579
 if the villagers gathered we eat 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.039
 will have moved back another meter and a half 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.349
 otherwise the device will work 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.699
 incorrectly 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:43.960
 before the release kicks off 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.940
 Many were worried about the issue of delay cheats 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.059
 war of movement 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.360
 let's say frankly 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.339
 she is and vietnam's eye 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.070
 however for their placement 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.939
 how exactly did it 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.899
 it is not constructive 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.659
 GDP 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.480
 starting line long 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.209
 can not be called original 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.199
 but generally not exactly a high reading 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.890
 movement 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.249
 will certainly disappoint hardcore gamers 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.230
 but still 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.510
 empty what attracts its 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.520
 universality 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.750
 great potential 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.230
 and specific sensations 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.469
 futuristic 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.449
 skin communication by voice and 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.120
 gestures 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.229
 it's like engaging a scene from a fantastic 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.319
 the movie
