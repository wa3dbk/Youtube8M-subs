00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
more suited to that task so now the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.060 
more suited to that task so now the
attack<00:03:13.330> will<00:03:13.570> proceed<00:03:13.960> along<00:03:14.230> two<00:03:14.560> fronts

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
come down fleeing in the tree is this is

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.170 
come down fleeing in the tree is this is
probably<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:23.110> pretty<00:04:23.350> good<00:04:23.620> example<00:04:23.910> as<00:04:24.910> we

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
probably a pretty good example as we

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.800 
probably a pretty good example as we
digs<00:04:25.450> up<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.780> 73<00:04:26.350> kills<00:04:26.740> already<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.600> I'm<00:04:28.660> gonna

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
digs up to 73 kills already so I'm gonna

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.460 
digs up to 73 kills already so I'm gonna
make<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:29.110> 80<00:04:29.290> kills<00:04:29.640> my<00:04:30.640> knee<00:04:30.700> kills

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
make that 80 kills my knee kills

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.280 
make that 80 kills my knee kills
yeah<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.400> just<00:04:33.430> keeps<00:04:33.930> going<00:04:34.930> up<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:38.110> that's

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
yeah it just keeps going up so that's

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.540 
yeah it just keeps going up so that's
enough<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:38.770> let's<00:04:39.280> go<00:04:39.880> back<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.360> me<00:04:40.810> fight

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
enough of that let's go back to me fight

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.510 
enough of that let's go back to me fight
at<00:04:42.550> least<00:04:42.760> what<00:04:42.970> will<00:04:43.180> be<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.450> main<00:04:43.570> flight

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
at least what will be the main flight

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.160 
at least what will be the main flight
currently<00:04:45.520> we're<00:04:46.000> just<00:04:46.210> moving<00:04:46.870> our

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
currently we're just moving our

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.690 
currently we're just moving our
attendants<00:04:47.560> into<00:04:47.770> position<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.340> we're<00:04:48.550> going

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
attendants into position and we're going

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.730 
attendants into position and we're going
to<00:04:48.790> use<00:04:48.910> them<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.540> breach<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:50.260> have

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
to use them and to breach I have

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.860 
to use them and to breach I have
attempting<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.310> get<00:04:51.400> my<00:04:51.550> foes<00:04:51.820> in<00:04:52.390> but<00:04:52.690> they're

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
attempting to get my foes in but they're

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.660 
attempting to get my foes in but they're
not<00:04:52.960> really<00:04:53.020> going<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.590> be<00:04:53.740> there<00:04:53.980> in<00:04:54.160> time<00:04:54.430> to

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
not really going to be there in time to

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.820 
not really going to be there in time to
make<00:04:54.790> much<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.360> difference<00:04:55.830> so

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
make much of a difference so

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.590 
make much of a difference so
understanding<00:04:57.400> will<00:04:57.520> just<00:04:57.790> speed<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.180> up<00:04:58.450> a

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
understanding will just speed this up a

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.010 
understanding will just speed this up a
little<00:04:58.750> bit<00:04:59.520> so<00:05:00.520> again<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:01.030> want<00:05:01.480> routing<00:05:01.930> the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
little bit so again I want routing the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.140 
little bit so again I want routing the
position<00:05:02.440> now<00:05:03.250> there's<00:05:03.460> not<00:05:03.550> much<00:05:03.850> really

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
position now there's not much really

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.540 
position now there's not much really
depending<00:05:04.660> on<00:05:04.780> since<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.110> town<00:05:05.350> so<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.190> borrow

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
depending on since the town so to borrow
