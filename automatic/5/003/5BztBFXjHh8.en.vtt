00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.500
 Now go for it and say let yourselves 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.809
 time caught down in any case so on 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.070
 that you do not start at the ankle 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.440
 but the whole already from the beginning 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.180
 Visitors here are attracted to enough freedom 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 The step has because it is crucial 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 that you are really up to the stop 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.470
 The legs optically for the top place 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.640
 has to finish and then to that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 here in the shoulders the suit so much 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.390
 buoyancy of the market also brings 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.829
 you nothing if you are limited above 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 something like agility in the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.300
 shoulder area so now later that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.219
 so we are free from below 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 start with a lot of play 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:53.340
 The final stage is 553 minutes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.110
 sometime then last ten seconds 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.210
 should that what I say now already 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.989
 have done long ago and that hangs 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.730
 the positioning certainly also of it 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.960
 from how fast you are so if 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.939
 somehow knows the people a bit 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.650
 the ye since classify as you think 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.510
 is good to swim with but before 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.710
 all in which direction of the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.740
 work that is very crucial 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.000
 someone who two years ago already that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.130
 most points make if one 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170
 please breathe that from around 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:34.020
 shield when you go to 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:37.979
 on the right only free water did that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.810
 you no bars so always right 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.810
 or left exhibition brings 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.610
 then I would not recommend that to you 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.900
 fast at super that always entices 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:01.790
 because with my eyes it is 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.800
 important that you do not overdo it 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.930
 because the pain I was the first 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.759
 three four minutes has inserted the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:21.790
 stefan daviter government in any case 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:25.060
 not free and tell me that I am 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.060
 the professionals 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:41.660
 and I think that's the next one as well 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:43.069
 I think it's a real one before that 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.480
 it would make sense to do the 20 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.670
 minutes then we have to do it again 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.769
 half an hour before the race into the water 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.269
 if necessary, dry again 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.799
 and all the stuff and that costs 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.560
 especially in a race especially what 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.150
 when it comes to the long distance what then 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.430
 in most cases say as once 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.630
 ten hours plus - it lasts 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.110
 just not worth it if it is still so 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.820
 long 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.850
 I believe that is much more meaningful 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.400
 makes a bit of energy and at the beginning 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.599
 to keep calm 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.129
 and maybe a bit loose 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.370
 were a bit too jogging too jogging 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.769
 maybe make a little bit of it 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.560
 Loosely maybe pull small 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.140
 liegestÃ¼tzen serie back then not around 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.730
 somehow popping 420 home popping 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.340
 but maybe 45 enough 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.340
 a bit faster and I think
