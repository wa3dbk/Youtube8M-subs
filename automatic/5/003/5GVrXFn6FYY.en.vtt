00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.250
 I wanted to say that the great 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.110
 as our Minister of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.049
 secretary of civil aviation to be the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.680
 port has a name of the greatest poets 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:22.020
 in this country one of the greatest artists of this 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.640
 country and whose name is synonymous with 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.029
 high quality 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.019
 recognized and appreciated. 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.059
 only for Brazilians more for me 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.780
 I believe for all those who love 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.450
 music in every corner of the world and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.320
 The airplane samba is in fact one of its 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.640
 most famous songs and this samba 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.180
 airplane he makes a connection between brazil 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.610
 today's brazil because the samba 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.000
 of the airplane describes the arrival in Brazil 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.350
 and especially in the galleon of Brazilians 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.350
 who returned to Brazil after the amnesty 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.600
 some after 21 years of exile others 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.130
 members than that but that's the reality 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.070
 of the airplane samba is this is in fact and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.610
 This week is a special moment. 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.659
 is in fact a tribute to the exiles and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.090
 He talks about beautiful things, he says. 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.970
 a certain time in the beginning my soul 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.299
 sings I see a soul sings 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.729
 see Rio de Janeiro and I'm dying 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.240
 I miss you 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.909
 see that this song she shows 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 two things for an exile that was the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.110
 Brazil is the mythic memory of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.380
 Brazil is Rio de Janeiro, and it's mine. 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.009
 soul sings and beyond further ahead 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.290
 says River March sky sun within 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.079
 more or less we will be arriving at 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.790
 galleon 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.240
 arriving here on the galleon 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.780
 and then in the end says tighten the belt 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.060
 Let's get brighter that it's a 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.940
 key thing shining water serve 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.890
 water shine 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.320
 Look the lane coming up and let's land 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.360
 I think the image is beautiful because 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.960
 I believe that the exile does not return in the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.440
 Brazil land landing 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.480
 then it is a perfect synthesis of what the 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.560
 miss you from Brazil 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:42.600
 The memory of Brazil and best of all 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.600
 back to brazil coming to union 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.590
 Sorry for the emotion but in fact I have 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.330
 certainty in homage to the exiles who 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.380
 souls sing 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.640
 hence the enormous responsibility 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.300
 of this concession 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.600
 the enormous and immense responsibility here 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.380
 is a place where, in addition to 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.150
 Canton souls career is special here 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.380
 is a place of a certain mythic form in 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.640
 relation to brazil 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 the brazil has changed is that more people 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.470
 entered the middle class 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.430
 precisely because of the data we have 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.840
 around 42 million people 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.930
 transforming only the Brazilian c class 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.700
 called the middle class both the new 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:50.880
 traditionally responsible for 55% of 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:54.269
 population outside class a / b village 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.670
 this means that an option of people 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.910
 a huge number of people who 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.780
 had never used this means of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.540
 transport for which people are 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.550
 people used to dress 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.150
 arranged to go on the plane 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.930
 today is a means of transportation of the people 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.890
 and therefore demanded of us 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.680
 will always require us a level of 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.540
 treatment of an airport that has been 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.390
 be a mass transport in 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.180
 not transporting a layer of 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.300
 is privileged for this is that the port 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.870
 we are doing this process today 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.200
 concession for us to have an idea 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.410
 between 2006 and 2013 the number of 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.380
 passengers per year in the galleon went from 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.070
 9 million to 17 million 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:56.380
 which is extraordinary growth of 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.900
 10% per annum means an increase of 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.110
 very welcome demand but mean 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.190
 pressure for an increased supply of 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.810
 quality 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.060
 that's why we started running 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.000
 some works out here she had 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.940
 reform of terminals 1 and 2 began 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.220
 recovery and revitalization of 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.040
 runway system and courtyards 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.570
 but we know that we have to do a lot 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.680
 more than this 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.000
 that is why within our policy of 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.190
 grant 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.170
 the aeropostos stood out the galleon and the 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:41.710
 airport in this last step 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.800
 but also the brasilia airport and the 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.900
 two from são paulo viracopos and guarulhos 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.680
 beyond the airport 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.080
 there on the great northern river and amarante 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.750
 They are gonçalo do amarante 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.390
 these six airports are part of this 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:03.430
 process of granting the initiative 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:07.090
 and is a response to the challenge of 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.330
 radically change the conditions for 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.750
 airport operation 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:18.010
 To conclude, I'm going back to the 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:21.040
 I think there's a big 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.950
 symbology of this airport as well as 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.470
 represented for many the arrival in the 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:30.910
 Brazil for us 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:34.060
 Now that he surpassed that this 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.330
 historical time long suffered for 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.840
 we represent 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:45.130
 I believe it represents 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.650
 two things first the strength of brazil 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.390
 according to the beauty of Brazil that these 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.930
 two things we want to show 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:56.260
 both in the cup and in the Olympics 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:00.100
 the strength and beauty of Brazil and Brazil 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:03.010
 say the following and it is very opportune that 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.550
 this is said here in this city in this 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:10.350
 state us to all who come to 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:13.660
 Brazil we will guarantee a reception 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.630
 absolutely friendly fraternal and cheerful 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.670
 because that's what this country is 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.890
 especially in this cup crown 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.370
 I liked the other day I saw the success of a 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:27.970
 advertisement that said football is 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:32.110
 I'm going back home because I liked this. 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:34.510
 propaganda because in fact the English are 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.780
 said that the English invented 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.340
 but no doubt his house here 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.730
 football house, that 's why I have 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:46.060
 sure that a galleon will also be a 

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:52.980
 football home spin symbol 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:52.980
 thank you very much to close this ceremony
