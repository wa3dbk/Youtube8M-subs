00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.760 
alright because basically what I'm
looking<00:01:49.889> for<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.429> to<00:01:51.270> stick<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.749> guy<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.469> ends

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
looking for is to stick a guy that ends

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
looking for is to stick a guy that ends
up<00:01:52.829> killing<00:01:53.130> me<00:01:53.429> and<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.389> kill<00:01:54.780> him

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
up killing me and then I kill him

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.569 
up killing me and then I kill him
because<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.649> stuck<00:01:55.979> him<00:01:56.069> with<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.340> semtex

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
because I stuck him with the semtex

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.480 
because I stuck him with the semtex
right<00:01:57.139> and<00:01:58.139> it<00:01:58.259> doesn't<00:01:58.529> have<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.829> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
right and it doesn't have to be it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.620 
right and it doesn't have to be it
doesn't<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.789> to<00:01:59.850> be<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.270> stick<00:02:00.539> them

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
doesn't have to be that you stick them

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.910 
doesn't have to be that you stick them
with<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.959> just<00:02:01.139> that<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.289> kill<00:02:01.560> him<00:02:01.649> with<00:02:01.799> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
with it just that you kill him with it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620 
with it just that you kill him with it
but<00:02:02.039> it's<00:02:02.159> obviously<00:02:02.549> best<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.329> stick<00:02:03.600> him

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
but it's obviously best if you stick him

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.590 
but it's obviously best if you stick him
right<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.859> semtex<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.179> played<00:02:06.569> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
right with the semtex so I played a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.509 
right with the semtex so I played a
bunch<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.289> different<00:02:07.409> matches<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.189> running

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
bunch of different matches just running

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.360 
bunch of different matches just running
around<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:09.299> the<00:02:09.420> MK<00:02:09.659> 32<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.739> know<00:02:10.860> okay

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
around with the MK 32 and you know okay

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.009 
around with the MK 32 and you know okay
yeah<00:02:11.580> sure<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.879> killed<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.269> guy<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.840> he

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
yeah sure I killed that guy but he

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:13.590 
yeah sure I killed that guy but he
didn't<00:02:13.260> kill<00:02:13.439> me

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
didn't kill me

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.260 
didn't kill me
first<00:02:13.870> right<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.590> idea<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.610> launcher

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
first right the idea is with launcher

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.390 
first right the idea is with launcher
make<00:02:16.720> sure<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.080> guys<00:02:17.260> looking<00:02:17.770> at<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.100> so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
killing him with the semtex just like I

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.340 
killing him with the semtex just like I
did<00:02:30.010> right<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.030> yeah<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.810> took<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.080> little
