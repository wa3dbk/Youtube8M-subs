00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
when he lost it in the loops and took

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.450 
when he lost it in the loops and took
you<00:01:51.899> over<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> berm<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.560> mean<00:01:52.740> you're<00:01:53.100> thinking

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you over the berm I mean you're thinking

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
you over the berm I mean you're thinking
you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.329> second<00:01:55.079> isn't<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.619> bad

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you know what a second isn't that bad

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.289 
you know what a second isn't that bad
compared<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.520> i<00:01:56.549> had<00:01:56.759> last<00:01:56.939> year<00:01:57.119> with

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
compared to what i had last year with

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.940 
compared to what i had last year with
the<00:01:57.390> fifth<00:01:57.600> or<00:01:57.750> sixth<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.619> always<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.920> worse

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the fifth or sixth can always be worse

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.440 
the fifth or sixth can always be worse
but<00:01:59.540> yeah<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> think<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
but yeah I think you know if you you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.670 
but yeah I think you know if you you
know<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.840> said<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.140> got<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.409> smart

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
know like you said you got to be smart

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.190 
know like you said you got to be smart
about<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.549> hear<00:02:05.790> him<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.000> feeling

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
about it you you hear him you feeling

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.699 
about it you you hear him you feeling
I<00:02:07.399> could<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.780> know<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> could<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.470> write

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I could do you know I could just write

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.280 
I could do you know I could just write
it<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.129> normally<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:12.290> basically

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it like I normally would and basically

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.520 
it like I normally would and basically
we<00:02:13.650> would<00:02:13.910> collide<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:16.140> would<00:02:16.260> either<00:02:16.379> end

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
we would collide and it would either end

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.589 
we would collide and it would either end
of<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.220> did<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.550> Atlanta<00:02:18.180> last<00:02:18.330> year

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
of it like it did it Atlanta last year

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.920 
of it like it did it Atlanta last year
or<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.640> know<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.970> or<00:02:21.269> he<00:02:21.720> could<00:02:21.900> have

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
or you know we or he could have

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.589 
or you know we or he could have
advantage<00:02:22.440> or<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.709> would<00:02:22.860> go<00:02:22.950> down<00:02:23.129> so<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:24.510> know

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
advantage or I would go down so you know

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.520 
advantage or I would go down so you know
just<00:02:25.519> what<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.580> take<00:02:26.760> from<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.690> his
