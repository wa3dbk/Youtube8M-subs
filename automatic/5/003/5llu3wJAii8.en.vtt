00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
probably put probably to the perfect but

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.380 
probably put probably to the perfect but
then<00:02:06.960> again<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.350> sad<00:02:07.649> these<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.610> right

so i think i got call mine stored

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.460 
so i think i got call mine stored
powered<00:02:20.370> light<00:02:21.209> screen<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.720> roost<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.230> course

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.530 
powered light screen and roost of course
roots<00:02:23.159> for<00:02:23.310> recovery<00:02:23.790> stuff<00:02:24.150> that's<00:02:24.360> all

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
roots for recovery stuff that's all

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.660

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
about momentum a roost there he

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.770 
about momentum a roost there he
earthquakes<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.269> that's<00:02:27.450> not<00:02:27.540> doing

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
earthquakes but that's not doing

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.509 
earthquakes but that's not doing
anything<00:02:27.959> i<00:02:28.140> think<00:02:28.319> he<00:02:28.379> had<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.860> earth

anything i think he had like a earth

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.399 
anything i think he had like a earth
jammer<00:02:29.970> saw<00:02:30.329> her<00:02:30.450> ground<00:02:30.720> gym<00:02:31.019> or<00:02:31.170> whatever

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.720 
but he's gonna bring in bravery i'm
gonna<00:02:33.659> go<00:02:33.750> for<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.989> roost<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.530> probably<00:02:35.280> should

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
gonna go for the roost I probably should

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.460 
gonna go for the roost I probably should
have<00:02:35.760> gone<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.329> stored<00:02:36.599> power<00:02:36.780> here<00:02:37.170> even

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
have gone for the stored power here even

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.679 
have gone for the stored power here even
though<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.590> only<00:02:38.159> have<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.849> boost<00:02:39.120> but<00:02:39.480> still

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
though I only have to boost but still

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.539 
though I only have to boost but still
it's<00:02:39.989> stabbed<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.500> do<00:02:40.739> some<00:02:41.010> damage<00:02:41.189> to<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
it's stabbed and do some damage to the

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.479 
it's stabbed and do some damage to the
bravery<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.319> decide<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.859> know<00:02:43.980> if<00:02:44.189> he<00:02:44.310> just

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
bravery but I decide you know if he just

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.949 
bravery but I decide you know if he just
goes<00:02:44.640> for<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.879> turn<00:02:45.090> i<00:02:45.299> can<00:02:45.450> probably<00:02:45.659> take

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
goes for you turn i can probably take

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.809 
goes for you turn i can probably take
that<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.680> go<00:02:46.889> for<00:02:47.099> another<00:02:47.280> call<00:02:47.609> mine

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
that and just go for another call mine

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.970 
that and just go for another call mine
