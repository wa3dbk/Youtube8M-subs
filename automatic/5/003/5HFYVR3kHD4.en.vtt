that you have extra double-a cells in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.120 
that you have extra double-a cells in
your<00:01:05.369> backpack<00:01:06.140> but<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.439> say<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> nice

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
your backpack but like I say it is nice

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.980 
your backpack but like I say it is nice
to<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:09.180> cut<00:01:09.330> down<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> weight<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
to have to cut down on the weight to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
to have to cut down on the weight to
have<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.830> 3.2<00:01:11.430> megapixel<00:01:11.549> camera<00:01:11.970> back<00:01:12.330> here

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
have the 3.2 megapixel camera back here

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.840 
have the 3.2 megapixel camera back here
you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.500> also<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> speaker<00:01:14.640> here

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you can also see this is a speaker here

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.490 
you can also see this is a speaker here
and<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> front<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.840> believe<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and on the front here I believe this is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.580 
and on the front here I believe this is
the<00:01:16.590> microphone<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.850> we're<00:01:17.970> actually<00:01:18.090> able<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
the microphone so we're actually able to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.469 
the microphone so we're actually able to
record<00:01:19.590> video<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.159> stills<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.360> say

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
record video and stills so like I say

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.420 
record video and stills so like I say
you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.780> leave<00:01:21.930> leave<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.890> least<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.130> thing

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you can leave leave at least one thing

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
you can leave leave at least one thing
back<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.759> Basecamp<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> form<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> your

camera and obviously as it is a GPS your

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.740 
camera and obviously as it is a GPS your
pictures<00:01:28.229> will<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.380> geotagged<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> can

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
pictures will be geotagged so you can

underneath<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.649> batteries<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> slot<00:01:45.119> for

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
underneath these batteries is a slot for

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
underneath these batteries is a slot for
a<00:01:45.329> micro<00:01:45.390> SD<00:01:45.899> card<00:01:46.200> comes<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.860> 8<00:01:47.040> gigabytes

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
a micro SD card comes with 8 gigabytes

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.609 
a micro SD card comes with 8 gigabytes
of<00:01:47.520> memory<00:01:47.579> standard<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> device<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.590> can

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
of memory standard on the device you can

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.100 
of memory standard on the device you can
expand<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.189> using<00:01:51.090> micro<00:01:51.360> SD<00:01:51.659> which<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.079> I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
expand it using micro SD which like I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.389 
expand it using micro SD which like I
said<00:01:52.200> plugs<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.710> underneath<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> batteries

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
said plugs in underneath the batteries

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.910 
said plugs in underneath the batteries
here<00:01:54.079> there<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> bottom<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
here there on the bottom we have a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840 
here there on the bottom we have a
standard<00:01:56.430> mini<00:01:56.969> B<00:01:57.590> USB<00:01:58.590> port<00:01:59.130> which<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.610> used

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
standard mini B USB port which is used

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.119 
standard mini B USB port which is used
for<00:02:00.530> syncing<00:02:01.530> map<00:02:01.829> data<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> device<00:02:07.129> so

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
for syncing map data to to the device so

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
for syncing map data to to the device so
like<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.580> say<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.030> locking<00:02:09.330> mechanism

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
like I say with this locking mechanism

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.170 
like I say with this locking mechanism
you<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.229> actually<00:02:10.319> kind<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.970> gaps

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
you can actually kind of see the gaps

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.760 
you can actually kind of see the gaps
I'll<00:02:12.420> seal<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.840> when<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.140> when<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.440> lock<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
I'll seal up when you when you lock it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
I'll seal up when you when you lock it
down<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.190> there's<00:02:14.550> rubber<00:02:14.760> gaskets<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.360> here

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
down and there's rubber gaskets in here

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.790 
down and there's rubber gaskets in here
so<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.930> say<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.230> actually<00:02:16.560> waterproof

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so like I say it is actually waterproof

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.040 
so like I say it is actually waterproof
not<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:17.310> water-resistant<00:02:17.940> obviously<00:02:18.930> you

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
not just water-resistant obviously you

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.360 
not just water-resistant obviously you
wouldn't<00:02:19.290> be<00:02:19.350> going<00:02:19.530> scuba<00:02:19.890> diving<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.190> this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
wouldn't be going scuba diving with this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.890 
wouldn't be going scuba diving with this
thing<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.240> drop<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.750> puddle

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
thing but if you drop it in a puddle

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.870 
thing but if you drop it in a puddle
it'll<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.410> fine

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
it'll be just fine

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.790 
it'll be just fine
now<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> free<00:02:24.360> three-inch<00:02:25.020> resistive

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
now this is a free three-inch resistive
