my best bet is to keep all your buttons
facing<00:00:40.450> downwards<00:00:40.930> on<00:00:41.110> your<00:00:41.800> controller<00:00:42.780> like

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
facing downwards on your controller like

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.240 
facing downwards on your controller like
XO<00:00:44.050> everything<00:00:44.590> down<00:00:44.740> that<00:00:44.770> way<00:00:44.950> it<00:00:45.130> doesn't

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
XO everything down that way it doesn't

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.860 
XO everything down that way it doesn't
fall<00:00:45.430> out<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:46.600> get<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:48.540> su<00:00:49.540> keyboard

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
fall out and you get your su keyboard

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
with your thumb sticks on and I find it

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
with your thumb sticks on and I find it
easiest<00:00:52.660> to<00:00:53.410> put<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.800> thumb<00:00:53.950> sticks<00:00:54.220> in<00:00:54.310> first

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
easiest to put the thumb sticks in first

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.500 
easiest to put the thumb sticks in first

you'll hear it click into place and
everything<00:00:58.570> slowly<00:00:58.989> slotting<00:00:59.470> then<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.730> get

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
everything slowly slotting then to get

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.850 
everything slowly slotting then to get
your<00:01:01.239> rimmel<00:01:01.630> motors<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.170> putting<00:01:02.739> the

can literally tell that us that's right

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.610 
can literally tell that us that's right
down<00:01:21.040> they'll<00:01:21.280> fall<00:01:21.520> out<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:23.080> next<00:01:23.229> step<00:01:23.440> is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
down they'll fall out the next step is

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.969 
down they'll fall out the next step is
to<00:01:23.740> put<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.310> back<00:01:24.430> case<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.820> not<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:26.320> and

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
to put the back case in not like so and

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.590 
to put the back case in not like so and
the<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:27.340> find<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.700> easiest<00:01:27.850> way<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.060> do<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.270> is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
the I find the easiest way to do this is

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.890 
the I find the easiest way to do this is
to<00:01:28.810> put<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.260> so<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:30.070> battery<00:01:30.790> clips<00:01:31.360> sliding

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
to put it so the battery clips sliding

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.990 
to put it so the battery clips sliding
in<00:01:32.049> on<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.290> bomb<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.340> you<00:01:36.430> got<00:01:36.610> nice

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
in on the bomb like so and you got nice

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.580 
in on the bomb like so and you got nice
little<00:01:37.330> clickers<00:01:37.720> everything<00:01:37.990> slots<00:01:38.440> into

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
little clickers everything slots into

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.210 
little clickers everything slots into
place<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:40.479> says<00:01:40.780> controller<00:01:41.440> looking<00:01:41.950> a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
place that says controller looking a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.039 
place that says controller looking a
little<00:01:42.909> bit<00:01:43.090> snazzy<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.510> lot<00:01:43.720> brighter<00:01:43.900> than

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
little bit snazzy a lot brighter than

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.250 
little bit snazzy a lot brighter than
before<00:01:45.240> very<00:01:46.240> simple<00:01:46.570> modification<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:47.080> do

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
before very simple modification to do

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.200 
before very simple modification to do
very<00:01:47.770> very<00:01:48.010> simple<00:01:48.340> everything<00:01:48.760> works<00:01:48.970> all

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
very very simple everything works all

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.810 
very very simple everything works all
your<00:01:49.330> ports<00:01:49.600> compress<00:01:53.310> right<00:01:54.310> now<00:01:54.760> I'm

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
your ports compress right now I'm

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.310 
your ports compress right now I'm
screwed<00:01:55.150> back<00:01:55.299> in<00:01:55.479> you've<00:01:55.659> got<00:01:55.780> seven<00:01:56.049> screws

screwed back in you've got seven screws

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.590 
screwed back in you've got seven screws
as<00:01:56.619> before<00:01:56.979> now<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.549> find<00:01:57.820> often<00:01:58.000> easiest<00:01:58.509> way

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
as before now I find often easiest way

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.999 
as before now I find often easiest way
is<00:01:58.810> simply<00:01:59.170> just<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.350> swap<00:01:59.650> them<00:01:59.860> in<00:01:59.950> the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
is simply just to swap them in the

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.899 
is simply just to swap them in the
little<00:02:00.100> holes<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.400> come<00:02:00.580> with<00:02:00.700> news<00:02:00.909> bomb<00:02:01.119> 4

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
little holes that come with news bomb 4

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
little holes that come with news bomb 4
is<00:02:03.909> open<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.420> start<00:02:04.659> screwing

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.750 
not too tight snug
I<00:02:18.180> think<00:02:18.480> me<00:02:18.720> yeah<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.110> term<00:02:19.319> would<00:02:19.440> be<00:02:19.760> quite

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
I think me yeah the term would be quite

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:37.030 
I think me yeah the term would be quite
snug<00:02:30.140> on<00:02:31.140> there<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:31.709> go<00:02:31.830> eventually<00:02:32.520> found<00:02:32.819> it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.530 

now<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.099> easiest<00:02:38.610> way<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.030> top<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.420> to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
now the easiest way to this top is to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.330 
now the easiest way to this top is to
literally<00:02:39.900> place<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.470> screw<00:02:40.890> on<00:02:41.040> top<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
literally place the screw on top of the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.800 
literally place the screw on top of the
screwdriver<00:02:42.590> line<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.709> with<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.950> hole<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.810> it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
screwdriver line up with the hole and it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:57.680 
screwdriver line up with the hole and it
goes<00:02:45.959> like<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:52.290> won't<00:02:56.420> screw<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.569> like

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
goes like so this won't screw it in like

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.449 
goes like so this won't screw it in like
so<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:59.870> don't<00:03:00.870> do<00:03:00.989> these<00:03:01.230> too<00:03:01.440> tight<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:02.310> you

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
so I don't do these too tight if you

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.400 
so I don't do these too tight if you
find<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:03.000> working<00:03:03.239> 100%<00:03:03.930> like<00:03:04.290> you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
find it it's not working 100% like you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.500 
find it it's not working 100% like you
want<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.799> slacking<00:03:05.640> off<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> little<00:03:06.030> bit<00:03:06.180> you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
want to slacking off a little bit you

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.949 
want to slacking off a little bit you
can<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.660> little<00:03:06.840> bit<00:03:07.019> too<00:03:07.080> tight<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.870> it

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
can a little bit too tight and then it

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.710 
can a little bit too tight and then it
works<00:03:10.110> bitterly<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:11.299> nice<00:03:12.299> little<00:03:12.510> clicking

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
works bitterly that nice little clicking

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.699 
works bitterly that nice little clicking
noise<00:03:14.060> too<00:03:15.060> tight<00:03:15.269> I'll<00:03:16.260> show<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.590> again

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
noise too tight I'll show you again

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.060 
noise too tight I'll show you again
they'll<00:03:19.709> not<00:03:20.030> simply<00:03:21.030> not<00:03:21.269> click<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.920> one

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
they'll not simply not click this one

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.550 
they'll not simply not click this one
clicks<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:24.269> doesn't<00:03:24.470> slacking<00:03:25.470> off

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
clicks this one doesn't slacking off

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.610 
clicks this one doesn't slacking off
half<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.280> turn<00:03:26.900> let's<00:03:27.900> see

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620
