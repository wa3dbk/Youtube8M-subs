00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.460
 It's good to be alive. 

00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:15.021
 Yeah, you can say that * 

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:16.478

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:21.843
 They thirst to live 

00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:25.097
 Sometimes I wonder: do they go to the good source? You see? 

00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:25.836
 Oh, it really is. 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.933

 They want to live with the heart and the free spirit. 

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:49.707
 Even with all your medicines you are always depressed 

00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:52.349
 You live in full democracy but feel overwhelmed 

00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:55.108
 From the list of happy people your name is deleted 

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:57.900
 You thirst to live but you drink in the bad fountain. 

00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:00.532
 The results: you are completely dehydrated * 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.221
 You give up, you feel like you've lost everything. 

00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:04.919
 You no longer have joy to live, 

00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:06.226
 joy of speaking 

00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:07.551
 joy to continue 

00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:09.018
 You just want this to end. 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.715
 Too many evenings * ruminating black ideas 

00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:16.083
 But the One who created the rainbow is able to give color again to our lives 

00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:18.785
 Able to disarm the Molotov cocktail 

00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:21.469
 * Water of pure life is what these words offer you 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.148
 Living is a job, we are all on temporary contract 

00:01:24.228 --> 00:01:26.893
 * But with Christ in our hearts we signed an indefinite contract 

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:28.016
 So what do you expect? 

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:30.218

 May the Lord keep you and may He lead you 

00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:59.348
 May He add to his thirst for living the joy of living 

00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:01.922
 And may He * help you bear the burdens of life 

00:02:02.013 --> 00:02:04.506
 Good party to the dads and good party to the moms. 

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.235
 Be honored as the commandment says 

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:09.984
 May the Eternal sustain you and fortify you in your difficult times 

00:02:10.044 --> 00:02:12.741
 Because there is no more difficult task than that of being parents. 

00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:15.392
 To live, some consult your horoscope 

00:02:15.654 --> 00:02:18.185
 But this is like quenching your thirst with hot water 

00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:19.577
 * Oh, bad to drink 

00:02:19.712 --> 00:02:23.345
 But in the fountain of Christ the water is always fresh to drink 

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:25.043
 So come with us 

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:29.112
 Whether you are very rich or have nothing to eat *, you will not be deceived 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.171
 Never mind your potential 

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:33.934
 God can use you in an exceptional way!

00:02:55.203 --> 00:02:58.402
 (...) 

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:01.098
 Because my heart remains grateful 

00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:03.743
 I'm not a child anymore, I'm not a teenager anymore 

00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:06.408
 Forced to manage my life intelligently 

00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:09.105
 Even if the trials of life come frequently 

00:03:09.183 --> 00:03:11.741
 I will believe that the Eternal can act mightily 

00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.468
 In the blocks, in the cities, in the regions *

 In the islands, countries and continents 

00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:19.825
 The Eternal honors those who honor Him 

00:03:19.888 --> 00:03:22.452
 He is a rewarder of those who seek Him 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.277
 And when they find Him, the way of thinking, of speaking 

00:03:25.364 --> 00:03:27.203
 The way to behave changes 

00:03:27.302 --> 00:03:30.344
 If He knocks at the door of your heart, do not 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.027
 Do not let your life slip between your fingers 

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:35.409
 It is short and more valuable than gold and money 

00:03:35.503 --> 00:03:38.206
 And yet many men and women slowly
