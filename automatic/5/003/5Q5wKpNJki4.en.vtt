00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the card you get with it I think that's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.889 
the card you get with it I think that's
how<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.130> say<00:00:32.399> his<00:00:32.430> name<00:00:32.840> it's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> German<00:00:34.380> name

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
how you say his name it's a German name

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
how you say his name it's a German name
so<00:00:36.899> yeah<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:39.590> it's<00:00:40.590> actually<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.950> much<00:00:41.100> more

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
so yeah and it's actually a much more

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.150 
so yeah and it's actually a much more

and three proto white weapons the design

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.249 
and three proto white weapons the design
or<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> mold<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> proto<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
or the mold is not a proto but the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
or the mold is not a proto but the
actual<00:01:55.560> color<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.219> actually<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> proto<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.149> guess

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
actual color is actually a proto I guess

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.160 
actual color is actually a proto I guess
you<00:01:57.630> could<00:01:57.780> say<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:59.119> yeah<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.780> only<00:02:00.869> thing<00:02:00.990> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you could say but yeah the only thing I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.499 
you could say but yeah the only thing I
didn't<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.250> why<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> brown

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
didn't really get is why you get a brown

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.990 
didn't really get is why you get a brown
minifig<00:02:04.229> stand<00:02:04.619> instead<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.250> black<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
minifig stand instead of a black one I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.910 
minifig stand instead of a black one I
would<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.270> black

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
would think black

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.249 
would think black
sit<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.280> much<00:02:07.460> better<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:08.000> whatever<00:02:08.479> or<00:02:08.840> maybe

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
sit it much better but whatever or maybe

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.719 
sit it much better but whatever or maybe
even<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.590> white<00:02:09.770> one<00:02:09.950> if<00:02:10.099> they<00:02:10.220> make<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.580> in

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
even a white one if they make that in

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.320 
even a white one if they make that in
that<00:02:10.970> color<00:02:11.709> but<00:02:12.709> anyways<00:02:12.980> um<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.090> see

back in August at brickfair that were
kind<00:03:18.920> of<00:03:19.040> rare<00:03:19.190> then<00:03:19.430> but<00:03:19.730> now<00:03:19.850> they're<00:03:20.030> not

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
kind of rare then but now they're not

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.250 
kind of rare then but now they're not
that<00:03:20.390> rare<00:03:20.450> now<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:23.120> yeah<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.870> just<00:03:23.989> get

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
that rare now so yeah you just get

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.000 
that rare now so yeah you just get
regular<00:03:24.500> white<00:03:24.859> pants<00:03:25.370> nothing<00:03:26.209> special<00:03:27.010> the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
regular white pants nothing special the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.860 
regular white pants nothing special the
torso<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.609> come<00:03:28.790> apart<00:03:29.120> just<00:03:29.359> like<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.570> regular

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
torso can come apart just like a regular

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.819 
torso can come apart just like a regular
lego<00:03:30.290> torso<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.810> only<00:03:32.930> thing<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.320> did<00:03:33.620> see

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
lego torso and the only thing I did see

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.900 
lego torso and the only thing I did see
that<00:03:33.859> was<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.130> mistake<00:03:35.019> but<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.290> guess<00:03:37.040> it's<00:03:37.640> just

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
that was a mistake but I guess it's just

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.000 
that was a mistake but I guess it's just
not<00:03:38.420> perfect<00:03:38.840> if<00:03:39.109> you<00:03:39.799> look<00:03:39.950> very<00:03:40.010> carefully<00:03:40.459> I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
not perfect if you look very carefully I

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.259 
not perfect if you look very carefully I
think<00:03:43.010> my<00:03:43.100> camera<00:03:43.310> can<00:03:43.670> really<00:03:43.910> pick<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.239> up

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
think my camera can really pick that up

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.620 
think my camera can really pick that up
but<00:03:44.769> right<00:03:45.769> there<00:03:46.040> actually<00:03:46.430> yes<00:03:46.549> again<00:03:46.880> see

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
but right there actually yes again see

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.080 
but right there actually yes again see
those<00:03:47.780> dots<00:03:48.230> right<00:03:48.560> there<00:03:48.829> it's<00:03:49.700> kind<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:49.970> like

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
those dots right there it's kind of like

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.160 
those dots right there it's kind of like
a<00:03:50.150> sprinkle<00:03:51.100> of<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.790> printing<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.840> went

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
a sprinkle of the printing that went

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.870 
a sprinkle of the printing that went
across<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.709> don't<00:03:54.890> know<00:03:54.980> how<00:03:55.220> they're<00:03:55.430> printing

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
across I don't know how they're printing

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.240 
across I don't know how they're printing
machine<00:03:56.239> works<00:03:56.510> but<00:03:56.959> i<00:03:57.170> guess<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.709> flips<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
machine works but i guess it flips the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.920 
machine works but i guess it flips the
tour<00:03:58.430> show<00:03:58.640> or<00:03:58.819> something<00:03:58.970> but<00:03:59.510> at<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.690> same

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
tour show or something but at the same

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.140 
tour show or something but at the same
time<00:04:00.109> they've<00:04:00.350> got<00:04:00.980> some<00:04:01.220> down<00:04:01.370> there<00:04:01.579> but

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
time they've got some down there but

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.050 
time they've got some down there but
it's<00:04:02.269> really<00:04:02.450> not<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.660> noticeable<00:04:03.880> so<00:04:04.880> it's

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
it's really not that noticeable so it's

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.729 
it's really not that noticeable so it's
not<00:04:05.120> something<00:04:05.389> to<00:04:05.630> worry<00:04:05.660> about<00:04:05.870> as<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.470> big

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
not something to worry about as a big

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.129 
not something to worry about as a big
deal<00:04:06.980> but<00:04:07.400> i<00:04:07.670> just<00:04:08.150> looked<00:04:08.389> at<00:04:08.569> them<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.930> saw
