00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.029
 I understand the agreement of the study nep 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.680
 braked planning in the field 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.100
 structural currently I 'm dealing with 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.230
 of an extension of a building 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.810
 complement of about 1400 meters almost from 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.970
 realize in a very short time the 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.830
 we had time available 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.040
 grants sixty and seventy days 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.650
 I'm considering the possibility of 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.190
 use mixed trusses 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.290
 self-supporting that would solve me two 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.010
 major problems that of resistance 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.739
 to the fire requested by the client 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.489
 that of the interaction of trani e 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.879
 floors at 12 meters high and not least 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.440
 also that of shipbuilding because 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.379
 the beams are in the yard 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.379
 they are already assembled immediately 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.380
 serve self - supporting beams ii and 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.120
 fire resistant 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.390
 notes hinted to me before there are gods 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.280
 handling problems therefore me 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.110
 as long as you check the geometry 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:51.150
 of the foods you have entered into 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.920
 project and then in the technical sheet but 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.460
 then I can resign the beam in 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.340
 autonomy 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.620
 yes exactly it can check for itself 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.430
 beam geometry entering the site 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.440
 and opening the sizing area nps there 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.440
 then enter the stresses 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.050
 answer we will study the solution more 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.440
 appropriate 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.930
 his case this is our job 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.090
 my one and that of my colleagues on 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.770
 designer portals in the choice of 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.410
 product best suited to their needs 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.959
 structural in the sizing and in the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.360
 modeling think that in the last 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.810
 four years we have consulted a 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.760
 over 5,000 studios listen to engineer 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.030
 I would like to propose the solution with the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.390
 our basic nps wanted the dish 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.760
 and you push them in this way she will spend 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.830
 less well known we keep much more beams 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.920
 read and solve the problem of 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.270
 movement and with the appropriate ones 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:05.160
 spacers welded to the plate e 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:12.330
 armor so the aipo studied e 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.530
 sift it to say less mature than 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
 lay the knots 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.400
 you know how important this is 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.320
 in the case of seismic actions 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.870
 besides being the metal structure 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.000
 we guarantee and guarantee it 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.400
 greater precision than the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.660
 beams and we also favor the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.340
 site safety 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.320
 I look forward to his 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.700
 approval of the sizing and then 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.720
 own or with 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.720
 production list 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.440
 with their lighter solution yes 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.780
 of spain but it is designs since it is that of 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.390
 signature from the rafters in the elaborate ps 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.560
 nps system are stamped and signed by 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.319
 me remains responsible and the management 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.209
 of works the construction management alone 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.130
 responsibility to check that the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.550
 reinforcement dimension happens as from 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.550
 drawing 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.769
 work this way I can confirm 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.260
 which is very productive because there is one 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.750
 continuous evaluation and verification of 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.819
 project is by the professional 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.819
 that the part of technostructures 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.030
 well now we await delivery times 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.130
 and mini assembly planning 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.230
 immediately put to work in separate violations 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.420
 in production and responsible notice for 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.920
 we are deliveries on site together 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.940
 managed to design to the structures 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.290
 quick to assemble lightweight self-supporting 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.470
 fire resistant 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.100
 the client was satisfied 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.100
 better than this
