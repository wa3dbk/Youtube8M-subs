do it I like the side mounted exhaust

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.520 
do it I like the side mounted exhaust
port<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.540> keeps<00:00:54.719> them<00:00:54.930> off<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.230> screws

easy to get it one of the reasons these
motors<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.579> tough<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
motors are so tough is that the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
motors are so tough is that the

was<00:01:33.690> how<00:01:33.869> stable<00:01:34.440> but<00:01:34.590> idle<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.160> right<00:01:35.459> out<00:01:35.670> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
was how stable but idle was right out of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.260 
was how stable but idle was right out of
the<00:01:35.880> box<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.509> didn't<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> adjust<00:01:37.259> nothing

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.339 
I've got a best 23 B prop you can get
the<00:01:41.550> idle<00:01:41.910> down<00:01:42.149> so<00:01:42.450> loaded<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.140> like

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
the idle down so loaded it's a lot like

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:44.600 
the idle down so loaded it's a lot like
hitting<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.679> brakes<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.429> off<00:01:44.580> the

hitting the brakes when you get off the
gas<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.830> like<00:01:46.830> flipping<00:01:47.160> my<00:01:47.399> planes<00:01:47.700> around<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
gas I like flipping my planes around and

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330 
gas I like flipping my planes around and
that<00:01:48.420> means<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> lot<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.050> wide<00:01:49.440> open<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:50.039> zero

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340

have<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.979> motor<00:01:53.310> quit<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.849> me<00:01:54.229> it's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.349> lot

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
have this motor quit on me it's a lot

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.290 
have this motor quit on me it's a lot
easier<00:01:55.709> trying<00:01:56.160> out<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> new<00:01:56.459> airplane<00:01:57.030> when

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
easier trying out a new airplane when

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.320 
easier trying out a new airplane when
you're<00:01:57.420> confident<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.259> motor

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
you're confident in a motor

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.270 
you're confident in a motor
at<00:01:59.870> one<00:02:00.110> time<00:02:00.350> or<00:02:00.530> another<00:02:00.560> all<00:02:00.920> my<00:02:01.130> other

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
at one time or another all my other

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.340 
at one time or another all my other
motors<00:02:01.730> have<00:02:01.910> quit<00:02:02.180> doing<00:02:02.570> this<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> da

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
motors have quit doing this but the da

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.670 
motors have quit doing this but the da
50<00:02:03.860> is<00:02:04.010> kept<00:02:04.340> on<00:02:04.490> running<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.030> whole<00:02:05.150> time

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
50 is kept on running the whole time

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.870 
50 is kept on running the whole time
I've<00:02:06.680> learned<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.100> hard<00:02:07.310> way<00:02:07.370> that<00:02:07.490> this

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
I've learned the hard way that this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.400 
I've learned the hard way that this
isn't<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.270> great<00:02:08.510> thing<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.840> do<00:02:08.990> with<00:02:09.170> most

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
isn't a great thing to do with most

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.510 
isn't a great thing to do with most
binding<00:02:09.860> Motors<00:02:10.280> both<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.760> da<00:02:10.940> 50<00:02:11.480> no<00:02:11.840> problem

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
binding Motors both the da 50 no problem

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.490 
binding Motors both the da 50 no problem
I'm<00:02:13.520> also<00:02:13.760> sure<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.480> gay<00:02:14.630> 50<00:02:15.050> generates

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
I'm also sure that the gay 50 generates

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.470 
I'm also sure that the gay 50 generates
enough<00:02:15.770> speed<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.400> can<00:02:16.580> do<00:02:16.700> my<00:02:16.850> snap<00:02:17.210> roll

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
enough speed that I can do my snap roll

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.000 
enough speed that I can do my snap roll
on<00:02:17.660> take<00:02:17.900> off<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.410> not<00:02:18.470> have<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.800> worry<00:02:18.950> about

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
on take off and not have to worry about

on take off and not have to worry about

many<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.670> my<00:02:22.790> videos<00:02:22.970> know<00:02:23.570> that<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.870> just<00:02:24.080> can't

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
many of my videos know that I just can't

many of my videos know that I just can't
help<00:02:24.500> myself

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
help myself

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.420

there'll<00:02:26.060> be<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.240> snap<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.750> takeoff<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.590> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
there'll be a snap on takeoff and a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.520 
there'll be a snap on takeoff and a
throttle<00:02:28.850> response<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.600> da<00:02:29.780> 50<00:02:30.200> lets<00:02:30.410> me

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
throttle response in the da 50 lets me

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.560 
throttle response in the da 50 lets me
do<00:02:30.710> things<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.280> really<00:02:31.640> can't<00:02:31.910> do<00:02:32.120> you

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
do things that I really can't do you

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.010 
do things that I really can't do you
ever<00:02:32.660> seen<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> sideways<00:02:33.470> rolling<00:02:33.920> Harrier<00:02:35.020> so

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
ever seen a sideways rolling Harrier so

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.720 
ever seen a sideways rolling Harrier so
if<00:02:36.110> you're<00:02:36.260> looking<00:02:36.500> for<00:02:36.680> new<00:02:36.860> gas<00:02:37.100> motor<00:02:37.460> you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
if you're looking for new gas motor you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.790 
if you're looking for new gas motor you
need<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.030> check<00:02:38.240> out<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.600> da<00:02:38.810> line<00:02:39.140> they're

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
need to check out the da line they're

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.350 
need to check out the da line they're
not<00:02:39.980> cheap<00:02:40.280> but<00:02:40.520> they're<00:02:40.670> not<00:02:40.820> as<00:02:40.970> expensive

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
not cheap but they're not as expensive

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.620 
not cheap but they're not as expensive
so<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.690> thought<00:02:41.960> they'd<00:02:42.200> be<00:02:42.230> either
