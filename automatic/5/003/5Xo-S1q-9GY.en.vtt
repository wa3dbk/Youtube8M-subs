much<00:02:20.070> about<00:02:20.280> shapes<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.270> about<00:02:22.050> again<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
much about shapes and about again the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.830 
much about shapes and about again the
idea<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.430> pret-a-porter<00:02:23.730> these<00:02:24.480> shoulders

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840

that<00:02:25.260> becomes<00:02:25.620> very<00:02:25.860> round<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> little

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
that becomes very round it's a little
