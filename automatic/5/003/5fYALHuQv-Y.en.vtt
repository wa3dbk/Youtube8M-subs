00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.380 

it's<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.829> little<00:01:02.039> crude<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.910> compared<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it's a little crude I think compared to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.219 
it's a little crude I think compared to
other<00:01:03.539> pac-man

other pac-man

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.690

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
oh it's important to note is that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.969 
oh it's important to note is that
there's<00:01:06.240> no<00:01:06.390> power<00:01:06.900> pellets<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
there's no power pellets because you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.410 
there's no power pellets because you
need<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> come<00:01:08.340> down<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.119> when<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> go

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
need to come down here and when you go

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
need to come down here and when you go
down<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> chute<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.470> pinball<00:01:10.860> section<00:01:11.310> comes

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
down the chute the pinball section comes

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.330 
down the chute the pinball section comes
alive<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.950> only<00:01:14.130> way<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> earn<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:16.340> power

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
alive and the only way to earn a power

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
alive and the only way to earn a power
pellet<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.270> hit<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.750> ball<00:01:19.110> back

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
pellet is if you hit that ball back

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.810 
pellet is if you hit that ball back
there<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> goes<00:01:20.130> around<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> other

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
there and it goes around to the other

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
there and it goes around to the other
side<00:01:21.259> now<00:01:22.259> after<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.680> die<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> pinball

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the shoots on the bottom are closed so I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.610 
the shoots on the bottom are closed so I
can't<00:01:30.240> go<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> pinball<00:01:31.050> section
