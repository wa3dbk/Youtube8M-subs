I x'mas I made it seven and a half

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.439 
I x'mas I made it seven and a half
because<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.190> fit<00:01:02.460> better<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> pan<00:01:03.179> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449

kind of stretches and swells when you go

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.940 
kind of stretches and swells when you go
to<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.080> first<00:01:07.439> thing<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to make it so first thing we're going to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.039 
to make it so first thing we're going to
do<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.640> find<00:01:09.000> something<00:01:09.479> seven<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> half

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
do is find something seven and a half

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
do is find something seven and a half
inches<00:01:10.520> long<00:01:11.520> behold<00:01:11.759> seven<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> half

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
inches long behold seven and a half

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.370 
inches long behold seven and a half
inches<00:01:12.829> so<00:01:14.780> this<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> fairly

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
inches so this is a fairly

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.810 
inches so this is a fairly
straightforward<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.250> simple<00:01:18.920> unfold<00:01:19.920> s<00:01:22.820> not

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
straightforward and simple unfold s not

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.550 
straightforward and simple unfold s not
worry<00:01:24.030> too<00:01:24.299> much<00:01:24.329> about<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.899> wrinkles<00:01:25.290> cuz

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
worry too much about the wrinkles cuz

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:36.350 
worry too much about the wrinkles cuz
it'll<00:01:26.310> all<00:01:26.430> come<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> wash<00:01:29.899> ok<00:01:32.000> now

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.690 

we<00:01:36.930> establish<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.890> five<00:01:38.130> inches<00:01:38.520> we

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
we establish this was five inches we

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.460 
we establish this was five inches we
want<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> pan<00:01:39.300> in<00:01:39.660> ancient<00:01:39.900> half<00:01:40.230> on<00:01:40.440> each

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
want the pan in ancient half on each

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.340 
want the pan in ancient half on each
side<00:01:40.890> four<00:01:41.190> sides<00:01:41.780> which<00:01:42.780> brings<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
side four sides which brings it up to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.810 
side four sides which brings it up to
eight<00:01:43.590> inches<00:01:43.620> but<00:01:44.160> I'm<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> make<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.760> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
eight inches but I'm going to make it a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
eight inches but I'm going to make it a
half<00:01:45.000> inch<00:01:45.240> smaller<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.110> fit

better so we're going to make it seven
and<00:01:47.760> a<00:01:47.820> half<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.300> is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.480> seven<00:01:48.870> half-inch

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
dead right while I was cutting it out so

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.830 
dead right while I was cutting it out so
here<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.480> go<00:02:34.750> again<00:02:35.760> okay<00:02:36.760> now<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.300> get<00:02:37.720> your

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
here we go again okay now you get your

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.210 
here we go again okay now you get your
desk<00:02:38.340> take<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> pan<00:02:39.700> or<00:02:39.730> anything<00:02:40.420> that's

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
desk take a pan or anything that's

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.490 
desk take a pan or anything that's
smaller<00:02:42.220> than<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.989> baking<00:02:43.989> pan<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.350> gonna

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
smaller than the baking pan you gonna

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.350 
smaller than the baking pan you gonna
use<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.550> half<00:02:45.819> an<00:02:46.030> inch<00:02:46.180> smaller

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
use this is like a half an inch smaller

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.990 
use this is like a half an inch smaller
and<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.980> works<00:02:48.190> pretty<00:02:48.400> good<00:02:48.520> because<00:02:48.880> when

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
and that works pretty good because when

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.190 
and that works pretty good because when
you<00:02:49.090> fold<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.420> all<00:02:49.540> up<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.780> everything<00:02:50.140> that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
you fold it all up and everything that

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.410 
you fold it all up and everything that
grows<00:02:50.380> some<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.010> I've<00:02:51.100> got<00:02:51.280> something<00:02:51.880> half<00:02:52.239> an

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
grows some so I've got something half an

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.150 
grows some so I've got something half an
inch<00:02:52.569> smaller<00:02:52.720> than<00:02:53.170> actual<00:02:53.500> baking<00:02:53.950> pan

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
inch smaller than actual baking pan

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.400 
inch smaller than actual baking pan

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
you're going to use putting that right

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.460 
you're going to use putting that right
down<00:02:56.590> over<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.130> centering<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.610> up<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.670> I'm

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470
