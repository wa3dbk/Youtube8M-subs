00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.670
 hi friends broke up with you and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.950
 continue passing side missions in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.200
 the game gta 5 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.849
 collect the last barrel of nuclear 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.670
 waste if you remember when we bought 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.410
 with him pier then we opened the commission 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.359
 that means now I'm on 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.269
 the last barrel is pretty long 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.449
 the mission itself will show on the guard 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.930
 where is the last barrel so here 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.309
 it is here so you'll see a 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:41.640
 we sailed ashot from here that is everywhere 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.100
 I had to sail at all I advise those who 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.539
 will pass this mission collect all 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.309
 more in one go 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.340
 that is, do not procrastinate there 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.199
 left but will also have to sail even by 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.000
 all places 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.590
 the same radar does not show the exact place 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.820
 it shows the approximate direction where 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.910
 is barrels current when you 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.040
 find yourself close to her then you 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.950
 already see the exact and finding well 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.950
 dive in and pick up the last barrel 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.540
 so here's where it's light here 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.340
 by the way swim out and not necessarily from 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.300
 submarines just get close 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.300
 to barrel 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.130
 everything 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.520
 collected last so here saving 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.520
 At once 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.510
 Well, we will have to wait for science 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.220
 the most general thing is for every barrel to us 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.370
 I was not aware of the money now 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:58.350
 will there be something else job oh processing 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:02:01.090
 waste trophy fine now see 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.520
 what we have and the score will be awarded without MSK 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.690
 or something 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.690
 See, we have to write something 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.770
 for the guys who us are lonely 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.770
 collection of this waste 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.440
 she is still sailing somewhere no shore 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.030
 submarine we can throw anywhere 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.030
 Then she sat on the pier seems 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.560
 what got ashore and see 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.150
 order antisms case with michael and sms 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.740
 it came pretty fast now something i 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.250
 I do not see him or she is watching him 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.250
 came 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.060
 it will not be very cool that very 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.010
 long this mission is where the trophy we are 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.670
 got but still would like something 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.670
 still see 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.750
 in time it takes a lot to collect 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:06.610
 these barrels because everything is very slow 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:09.150
 this is watering this so serious 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.150
 very messi 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.790
 swim san andreas 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.720
 ashore 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.870
 what about the bounty hunt so i dont 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.970
 I understand how to find me, I will try 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.640
 look something in the record then it 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.130
 the place where the offender is located 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.090
 will be if you can find something 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.090
 I will definitely write down the guys 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.019
 sometimes it annoys everyone 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.599
 there is some kind of delay that is here 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.819
 text messages do not immediately come there for example 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.239
 you bought a bunch of thing you, too, not immediately 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:08.829
 they send her to suffer foolishness 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:12.510
 while you are waiting for something here is something 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.510
 lit it 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:25.580
 part of the space ship nifiga ha 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:25.580
 ha here I sailed well 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.640
 I thought it was only Franklin 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.820
 collect him a task rather about 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.180
 spaceships end any you 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.720
 character can do 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.720
 cool 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.520
 still need to collect writing 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.439
 fragments of the letter there only Latip 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.180
 what's so we do not call nobody hurt 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.230
 I thought there would be a channel and then go 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.230
 understand wider 8 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.050
 I think you can this video will help if 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.179
 you will search for this waste though 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.489
 principle just when you get it 

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:42.619
 do start collecting them before this 

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:45.619
 be in the wrong direction 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:49.580
 shows the radar and so they will go 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:50.929
 principle one by one gradually here 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.999
 it is desirable not to interrupt but the mission 

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:56.259
 It will probably take an hour no less if it can 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:59.259
 not even more until you get comfortable there 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.259
 running 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.669
 So 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.139
 in general, as long as we do not have anything more 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.879
 alarmer except on on the hunt for 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.699
 heads no more assignments then we 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.680
 not left well race samos not 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.039
 comes mean with this mission all she 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.039
 more 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.900
 power they need in principle yes 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.920
 traveled squeaked on common friends on 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.450
 This will start to finish as soon as I need 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.610
 there will be another task necessarily this is all 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.410
 I will write down and lay out on the channel but you 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.390
 leave comments accordingly 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.770
 reinforce likes with you was once 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.770
 onizuka to new meetings
