parts of the coloring but that doesn't
matter<00:04:00.360> I'm<00:04:00.930> using<00:04:01.530> my<00:04:01.739> pencil<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.549> draw<00:04:02.700> a

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
matter I'm using my pencil to draw a

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.449 
matter I'm using my pencil to draw a
bank<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.330> snow<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:03.930> now<00:04:04.410> by<00:04:04.709> using<00:04:05.250> my

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
bank of snow and now by using my

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.180 
bank of snow and now by using my
scissors<00:04:05.730> I'm<00:04:06.180> going<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.540> cut<00:04:06.629> out<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.739> whole

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
scissors I'm going to cut out the whole

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:17.290 
scissors I'm going to cut out the whole
image

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.300 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.680 

once<00:04:18.300> the<00:04:18.840> image<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.770> cut<00:04:20.640> I<00:04:20.970> am<00:04:21.330> going<00:04:21.570> to

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
once the image is a cut I am going to

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.290 
once the image is a cut I am going to
use<00:04:21.900> some<00:04:21.930> foam<00:04:22.440> squares<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:23.250> adhere<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.120> on

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
use some foam squares to adhere it on

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.240 
use some foam squares to adhere it on
the<00:04:24.800> background

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
the background

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.090 
the background
by<00:04:26.760> doing<00:04:27.270> this<00:04:27.570> technique<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.320> allows<00:04:28.800> me<00:04:29.070> to

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
by doing this technique it allows me to

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460 
by doing this technique it allows me to
have<00:04:29.760> some<00:04:30.000> dimension<00:04:30.570> on<00:04:30.690> my<00:04:30.810> cars<00:04:31.050> would<00:04:31.290> say

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
have some dimension on my cars would say

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.130 
have some dimension on my cars would say
I<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:31.920> love<00:04:32.130> but<00:04:32.760> also<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.540> doesn't<00:04:33.720> add

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
I really love but also it doesn't add

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.460 
I really love but also it doesn't add
too<00:04:34.500> much<00:04:34.650> bulk<00:04:34.950> and<00:04:35.310> it's<00:04:35.780> very<00:04:36.780> easy<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.140> send

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
too much bulk and it's very easy to send

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.410 
too much bulk and it's very easy to send
out<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:38.100> an<00:04:38.340> envelope<00:04:40.130> I'm<00:04:41.130> going<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.820> mud<00:04:42.030> my
