00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.900
 When I was in ninth grade, I went to a high school that shared her building with another high school. 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.080
 Basically, St. Marcellinos was a newly built high school, 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.400
 At that time, we had only two years until other schools occupied these buildings. 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.440
 Novices, and sophomore students. 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.040
 Because of this half the rows were empty): 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.020
 This allowed for another school, which is six. John of Ark using the space available to build their school. 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.840
 I did not think much about it, 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.560
 So I met Joyce. 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.140
 "Dum, I do not think you make enough sense why you do not use real names in your stories." 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.080
 "What, in fact, means that people are actually looking for" Erin Kim "on Facebook?" Lol 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.020
 "Yes." 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.040
 "they". 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.660
 Anyway, my first share was French, 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.340
 It happened that the classroom was within my school 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.900
 Where was John of Ark's daughter (sorry what I know to write :) :) 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.560
 One day, I was waiting in front of the classroom for the teacher to come and open the door for us, 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.740
 I happened to look at a nice girl from another school who was also waiting for her teacher. 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.820
 "Dom, you seem to be getting into a lot of nonsense 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.000
 Nice girl notes. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.560
 Will this be one of those stories? " 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.500
 "Shush, just, 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.700
 Just sit down. Let me tell the story. " 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.440
 So this went on almost every day. 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.940
 Origin to my early class 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.300
 Just so I could get a chance to look at the nice girl before she entered her class, 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.740
 Such as the crawl on which I am. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.520
 I think I did it so often where you finally know me, because 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.220
 One day I came across her location on Asian Avenue. 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.480
 If you do not know what this exclusive exclusive site is, 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.880
 It was basically MySpace, 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.800
 But you guessed it 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.060
 For the Asians! 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.160
 So I found her page, [and] I realized from the pictures that she was the same girl. 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.740
 I am 13 years old and he said, "What the heck? I'll leave a message." 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.980
 I said "hey, you look familiar. 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.660
 Do you go to St. Joan of Arc? " 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.860
 She said, "Yes! You go to St. Marcelinus right?" 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.860
 [Lusts] 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.780
 (I have run over: o ...) 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.200
 It was the beginning of a new friendship. 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.280
 We started the meeting before the first grades, and although they were shortened, I was proud of them. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.480
 We even started with the strategic planning of the tracks we took into our next chapters, 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.520
 Just so we can run each other briefly. 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.400
 This title gave me, 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.280
 Dumz 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.540
 And she's stuck with me. Like , 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 Although it was just adding a character to my name. 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.760
 I found my art really impressive, 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.180
 My support has really made me want to do better and better my skills 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.840
 I still remember her saying, 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.300
 "Dumz, if you become a famous artist, do not forget me!" 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.040
 Eventually we found ourselves talking every day, be it at school or online. 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.640
 I did not have a phone, believe it or not, was six years old with an iPad. 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.100
 I really liked it :), 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.620
 But was it worth the risk of shedding my feelings 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.560
 Maybe make friendship embarrassing? 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.960
 "Yeah" 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.160
 I mean, I was happy where we were. 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.160
 We shared personal secrets with each other. 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.080
 She came to me whenever I encountered problems; I came to her with my problems. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.640
 Perhaps intimacy was the only thing that separated us from being a couple. 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640
 I met one of her close friends, 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.460
 And so she thought I should ask her 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.860
 But I have not done that before 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.220
 I never had a girlfriend at that point, 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.213
 And everything before that was just a series of admiration for the girls 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.820
 I will never get his chance with him 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.560
 But I thought it myself 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.420
 If I get the first time, my choices will be 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.440
 I decided to tell her how she felt. 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.420
 I think this is a good opportunity to see how we were the best friends. 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.000
 We already have this bond, that trust. 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.700
 I told myself that if she said no, 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.900
 I will respectfully accept him and remain a friend of her. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.700
 Say easier than verb ... 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.860
 And... 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.540
 That's what happened. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.840
 I was not sure if there was someone else or anything else, but no matter, 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760
 She just did not see me that way 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.060
 I felt crushed):, 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.480
 But he was surprised to take out my chest. 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.540
 You did not find him very strange 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.140
 She was an open girl. 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.400
 And yes, I am entitled "Best Friend Zone" because that's what it was. 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.400
 I was in a world of relationship that I could not move on to the next stage. 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.240
 I do not use this term as a way to reinforce the vanity of over-expressing "good men". 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.460
 She did not owe me anything. 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.820
 I do not say that just because her friends thought we would be a good husband, [mean] we must be one. 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.555
 I simply say that even though I was not exactly 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.440
 Get the girl, 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.100
 I was happy because I still kept my best friends with her, 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.360
 Although I could not break through this barrier 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.760
 You're fine with it. 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.060
 If you're one of those people who claim to have a friendship 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.520
 But complain to him as if he owed to your relationship 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.850
 This is not friendship, that is, pity. 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.729
 Accept politely rejection and go ahead. 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.100
 Anyway, obviously I did not beat them right away 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.770
 I accepted her answer, but my feelings still lingered along with questions about why I was not suitable as a friend. 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.040
 But I think this is the mistake most people make when facing rejection. 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.180
 They only invest a lot in one person getting to see the tunnel, 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.060
 When rejected by them, they can not understand the possibility of being suitable for someone else. 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.880
 I realized that, and Joyce and I soon returned to our usual friendship. 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.840
 She became interested in other men; she became interested in other girls. 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.520
 But we were there for each other. 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.600
 Somehow, it might have been better not to end up with some 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.000
 Because at the end of my second year, I came to some news. 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.620
 "My father got a job in Virginia." 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.880
 "I will complain):" 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.160
 "No no no no, Dom, you will come back, and I will continue this now." 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.420
 Well Well! Oh my God ... 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.720
 Can not appreciate the cliffhanger? 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.760
 "I'm moving):" 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.740
 This will certainly not be the last time someone has been hurt by leaving them: D. 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.140
 We were the best friends for two years and it was not easy for us to say goodbye. 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.860
 I had no idea how long I'd be in Virginia. I can not make it back, 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.880
 But I certainly visited from time to time. 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.960
 We're still online, but they wanted to keep their updates private, so I preferred writing messages. 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.800
 However, while we had all these ways to communicate, 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.960
 We were in two different worlds. In two different environments. 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.500
 I made new friends 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.540
 When her school finally moved to the new building, she also found new friends 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.320
 We started talking less than before. 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.740
 Eventually she ran apart. Not as strangers 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.460
 We will remain what we consider ... friends, 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.400
 But not as before. 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400
 This is what happens. 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.060
 We can not always find someone or something to blame. 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.210
 As long as I enjoyed the experience, it was certainly worthwhile. 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.300
 Even if they do not, 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.080
 Would at least provide a good story. 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.480
 [Feel ...] 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.480
 Sad):
