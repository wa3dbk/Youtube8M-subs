00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 a nice good day mrs movie lounge 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.170
 now there are reviews san for you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.870
 andreas and andreas is a soil plate 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.210
 reject that as soon as there something 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.710
 moved to a devastating quake in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.389
 the west coast in the united states 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.560
 will care and who the trailer already 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.779
 has seen times can think 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.130
 that's exactly what will happen 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.270
 or in the trailer you can see it 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.609
 and to one if you like the story already 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.099
 does one know okay there could be something 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.170
 happen and there we have one more 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.750
 rescue helicopter pilots played 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.030
 by ben johnson who spends as spd 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 tried los angeles to san 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.809
 francisco to get to his daughter 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.149
 but even before it arrives this is possible 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.399
 quake and this natural disaster it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.960
 get started and stay there easy 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.270
 really no stone on the other 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.590
 stand and looks so looks like 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 when the world goes down and roland 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.170
 emmerich did not manage that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170
 decide 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 out 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.159
 are you hurt you are leaving the 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.070
 People need to know that 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.380
 Earthquake is not over yet 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.189
 it will meet us again and then with 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.189
 a monster quake 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.830
 Oh my God 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.150
 the earth is in the truest sense of the word 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:05.600
 word break apart and yourself 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.600
 the east coast it sounds still be felt 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.790
 are sent 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.580
 I can not be clear enough 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.099
 you have to get out of here and I mean right now 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.940
 if they can not do that 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.940
 may be god with whom 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.129
 if johnson is now one 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.750
 absolute established actor of the 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.510
 did that really out of wrestling 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.579
 ring high in the first tier of the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.170
 to come acting actors and that's how it was 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.260
 also in the number that he will this one 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.420
 own fat blockbuster he gets 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.760
 as a superhero who tries and how the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.290
 to save the world you take her too 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.989
 due among other things to his 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.780
 muscle packages at the same time but also in the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.159
 serious now by his likiefaktor 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.709
 also quite capable of that 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.170
 his daughter and other people too 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.000
 save what catastrophes movie yes 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.150
 It's always a bit difficult 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.859
 you know what happens early or relatively early 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.940
 English before you release the card 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.889
 It would be like seeing the world 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.959
 but it always goes down 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.370
 is sick where is that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.769
 dramaturgy what can there now 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.000
 actually happen and how many 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.650
 People do not die that way 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.060
 most interesting question and that is also 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.120
 the problem so i at san andreas 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.680
 even somehow more than at 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.989
 other catastrophe movies because here 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.730
 Just break everything relatively early 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.560
 and there is not much, either 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.079
 hope because it will break everything 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.549
 And that does not happen somehow 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.739
 more really about two hours there will be 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.900
 just go north stop everything 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.949
 and that's just a few 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.040
 do not make things exciting anymore 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:12.870
 because you can see again 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.879
 digital landscapes like broken 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.590
 go and shake and crass and now 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.209
 here comes another wave and that is 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.010
 still somehow violent that is for me 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.419
 as classic 90s cinema man 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.019
 somehow could show the eggs 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.930
 escape 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.000
 we can somehow digital the balls 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.889
 what somehow animate me then 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.409
 more convinced that can also at the age 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.030
 at that time but there are here 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:35.190
 just no real dramaturgy 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.169
 it just happens when 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.669
 Jonsson tried his daughter too 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.680
 save and a few others 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.620
 people but that's it 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.419
 you look at there who totally 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.400
 stands on his digital tricks and 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.710
 I want to see how everything breaks down 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.780
 so Andreas can look at it 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.280
 otherwise the club is a bit flat 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.870
 Guess there is this again 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.120
 on-line 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.460
 I would have you 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.320
 if the strong kevin johnson with something 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.240
 better special and sound effects me 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.790
 she tried to follow suit 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.770
 but at the end of the day convinced the 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.530
 film is not really there, he is not 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.910
 is particularly exciting 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.520
 rest of the craft is solid but more 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.500
 as you just really time again 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.419
 solid 5 out of 10 points I can be 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.639
 Andreas just does not even give out 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.100
 view of I like to watch 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.150
 pasticcio effects on who else 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.490
 looks like it can in the comments to 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.590
 leave behind and what is important to you 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.060
 is in a catastrophe movie you are 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.080
 he too the people who say I want 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.270
 actually just see how everything breaks down 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.580
 is or can you imagine that 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.770
 with a bit more story the whole 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.030
 somehow take each other 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.720
 can work like to write in the 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.490
 Comments 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.490
 Or look at the jokes 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.050
 poltergeist to a horror movie I have 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.729
 here of course also made to start 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.639
 the same day as san andreas and left 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.380
 or bottom right, the latest follow outdated 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.419
 movie because it is over 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.250
 Technique in the cinema this time about 3d film 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.750
 likes to stop by and then we'll see 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.849
 We'll be back here soon with a new one 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.120
 Video in the movie lounge wants it well and 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.120
 from
