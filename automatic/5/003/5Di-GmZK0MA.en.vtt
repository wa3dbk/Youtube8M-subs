 is the order after this 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.340
 damaged 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.439
 roughly in the course they change now to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.409
 exercise the folder decreased to one 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.119
 try pack how to go best

 called against there then a hyphen 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.470
 about their keyboard a 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.119
 after the existence of the place as this 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.950
 now a dash bow paco sometimes

 there is a little trick like this 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.360
 This difficulty is very fast 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.590

 the word they can still reach 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.989
 then you use the courses 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.610
 from the links via keyboard to the 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.890
 the beginning of the name to come

 there will be the desired changes 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.329
 on the keyboard commended for example 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.920
 will then from a sample package 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.920
 the six above pack 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.030
 two walkway provide a operateur 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.980
 is somewhere on a free one 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.170
 surface of the desktop with pressed ctrl 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.920

 the following steps accordingly 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.040
 then the one shown here before 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.620
 Third way is probably the fastest 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.360
 press the key combination 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.830
 switch and command and in and already

 create folder 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.370
 how this works in detail 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.140
 was us her later video 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.120
 By the way, if you have a folder in the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.890
 Trash will all move 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.840
 therein elements such as 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.320
 example more and folders and files 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.940
 with postponed 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.440
 should follow the these actions with 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.440
 be made deliberately
