00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.060 
easy just to wire up all the idiot
lights<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.080> there<00:02:30.320> but<00:02:31.320> yeah<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.830> thought<00:02:32.040> just

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
lights on there but yeah we thought just

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.860 
lights on there but yeah we thought just
for<00:02:32.340> something<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.580> bit<00:02:32.610> different<00:02:32.880> we'll<00:02:33.780> do

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
for something a bit different we'll do

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.540 
for something a bit different we'll do
it<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.020> way<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.410> plus<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.800> speedos<00:02:35.250> without

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
it that way and plus the speedos without

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.700 
it that way and plus the speedos without
the<00:02:35.670> lights<00:02:35.880> are<00:02:36.240> about<00:02:36.540> twenty<00:02:37.080> thirty<00:02:37.350> quid

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
the lights are about twenty thirty quid

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.600 
the lights are about twenty thirty quid
cheaper<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:40.410> also<00:02:40.800> there's<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> bit<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.370> cost

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
cheaper so also there's a bit of a cost

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.920 
cheaper so also there's a bit of a cost
saving<00:02:42.000> there<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.570> going<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> look<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
saving there and it's going to look a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.260 
saving there and it's going to look a
bit<00:02:43.080> more<00:02:43.200> unusual<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.670> that's<00:02:44.940> going<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.150> be

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
bit more unusual so that's going to be

00:02:45.270 --> 00:03:26.039 
bit more unusual so that's going to be
today's<00:02:45.600> job

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:39.570 

double-checking<00:03:27.049> everything<00:03:27.379> is<00:03:27.829> gonna<00:03:28.040> fit

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.910 

okay<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:41.330> that's<00:03:41.750> all<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.050> wire<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.500> clips

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
okay so that's all the wire in the clips

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.830 
okay so that's all the wire in the clips
in<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.129> headlight<00:03:43.459> bucket<00:03:43.879> or<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.269> bit<00:03:44.510> messy

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
in the headlight bucket or a bit messy

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.880 
in the headlight bucket or a bit messy
at<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:44.989> moment<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:46.610> work<00:03:46.879> out<00:03:47.120> where<00:03:47.390> each<00:03:47.890> of

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
at the moment and work out where each of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.190 
at the moment and work out where each of
the<00:03:49.010> lights<00:03:49.220> are<00:03:49.400> gonna<00:03:49.459> go<00:03:50.110> so<00:03:51.110> I'm<00:03:51.170> just

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
the lights are gonna go so I'm just

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.990 
the lights are gonna go so I'm just
measured<00:03:52.000> measured<00:03:53.000> mid<00:03:53.300> line<00:03:54.549> dead<00:03:55.549> center

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
measured measured mid line dead center

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.170 
measured measured mid line dead center
and<00:03:56.209> then<00:03:57.140> that's<00:03:57.830> roughly<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.370> line<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.819> think

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
and then that's roughly the line I think

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.650 
and then that's roughly the line I think
the<00:03:59.299> lights<00:04:00.129> are<00:04:01.129> gonna<00:04:01.310> sit<00:04:01.640> on<00:04:01.760> or<00:04:02.269> four<00:04:02.569> of

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
the lights are gonna sit on or four of

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.420 
the lights are gonna sit on or four of
them<00:04:02.920> along<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.069> headlight<00:04:04.400> bowl<00:04:04.640> there

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
them along the headlight bowl there

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.280 
them along the headlight bowl there
that's<00:04:07.430> gonna<00:04:07.610> be<00:04:07.790> like<00:04:07.940> when<00:04:08.150> I'm<00:04:08.269> sitting<00:04:08.690> on

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
that's gonna be like when I'm sitting on

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.470 
that's gonna be like when I'm sitting on
the<00:04:09.440> bike<00:04:09.590> but<00:04:10.069> Jen's<00:04:10.819> sitting<00:04:11.150> on<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.329> bike

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
the bike but Jen's sitting on the bike

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.940 
the bike but Jen's sitting on the bike
more<00:04:11.750> importantly<00:04:12.610> that's<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.819> view<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:15.680> four

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
more importantly that's the view so four

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.379 
more importantly that's the view so four
mini<00:04:16.100> speedos<00:04:16.729> right<00:04:17.570> here<00:04:17.959> or<00:04:18.380> still<00:04:19.299> if<00:04:20.299> you

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
mini speedos right here or still if you

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.590 
mini speedos right here or still if you
ever<00:04:20.510> see<00:04:20.810> those<00:04:20.989> okay<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.970> now<00:04:23.120> it's<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.419> case

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
ever see those okay so now it's the case

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.490 
ever see those okay so now it's the case
of<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:23.990> working<00:04:24.740> out<00:04:25.010> exactly<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:26.500> exact

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
of just working out exactly the exact

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.190 
of just working out exactly the exact
measurements<00:04:27.979> so<00:04:28.070> they're<00:04:28.190> all<00:04:28.310> equidistant

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
measurements so they're all equidistant

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.750 
measurements so they're all equidistant
for<00:04:30.200> lights<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.979> then<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.160> bit<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.430> drool<00:04:31.610> egde

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
for lights and then a bit of drool egde

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.350 
for lights and then a bit of drool egde
so<00:04:32.389> there<00:04:32.539> we<00:04:32.690> go<00:04:32.720> that's<00:04:33.880> its<00:04:34.880> marked<00:04:35.210> out

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
so there we go that's its marked out

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.710 
so there we go that's its marked out
where<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:36.020> lights<00:04:36.260> are<00:04:36.440> going<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.620> go<00:04:37.479> so<00:04:38.479> it's

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
where the lights are going to go so it's

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.860 
where the lights are going to go so it's
time<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.960> get<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.229> drill<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.479> I'm<00:04:41.479> either

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
time to get the drill a and I'm either

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.450 
time to get the drill a and I'm either
going<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.139> make<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.410> look<00:04:42.530> nice<00:04:42.740> or<00:04:43.100> I'm<00:04:43.340> gonna

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
going to make it look nice or I'm gonna

00:04:43.460 --> 00:06:22.249 
going to make it look nice or I'm gonna
have<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.729> buy<00:04:43.850> Jen<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:44.380> new<00:04:45.380> headlight

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:28.920 

okay<00:06:23.259> there's<00:06:24.250> our<00:06:25.229> holes<00:06:26.229> drilled<00:06:26.590> in<00:06:26.740> and<00:06:27.930> so

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
okay there's our holes drilled in and so

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.800 
okay there's our holes drilled in and so
you<00:06:28.990> now<00:06:29.139> is<00:06:29.320> just<00:06:30.150> get<00:06:31.150> the<00:06:31.210> knife<00:06:31.449> to<00:06:31.660> that

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
just see a slight at the bottom of the

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.779 
just see a slight at the bottom of the
hole<00:06:40.780> there's<00:06:41.139> like<00:06:41.259> a<00:06:41.289> little<00:06:41.470> groove<00:06:41.860> that's

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
hole there's like a little groove that's

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.969 
hole there's like a little groove that's
just<00:06:43.060> where<00:06:43.240> the<00:06:43.419> the<00:06:43.840> cap<00:06:44.080> locates<00:06:44.560> into<00:06:45.300> so

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
just where the the cap locates into so

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.400 
just where the the cap locates into so
that's<00:06:47.979> next<00:06:48.220> and<00:06:49.120> there<00:06:49.810> we<00:06:49.900> go

finished<00:06:51.070> article<00:06:52.110> pretty<00:06:53.110> chuffed<00:06:53.380> with

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
finished article pretty chuffed with

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.659 
finished article pretty chuffed with
that<00:06:55.710> they've<00:06:56.710> turn<00:06:56.949> out<00:06:57.100> nice

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
that they've turn out nice

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.879 
that they've turn out nice
I've<00:06:58.240> left<00:06:58.780> a<00:06:58.900> bit<00:06:59.020> of<00:06:59.110> a<00:06:59.169> wider<00:06:59.410> gap<00:06:59.650> in<00:06:59.830> the

00:06:59.879 --> 00:06:59.889 
I've left a bit of a wider gap in the

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.500 
I've left a bit of a wider gap in the
middle<00:07:00.190> to<00:07:00.400> allow<00:07:00.639> for<00:07:01.030> a<00:07:01.289> speedo<00:07:02.460> see<00:07:03.460> it's<00:07:04.449> a

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
middle to allow for a speedo see it's a

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.029 
middle to allow for a speedo see it's a
bit<00:07:04.630> more<00:07:04.780> evenly<00:07:05.050> balanced<00:07:05.530> you<00:07:05.650> can<00:07:05.770> see<00:07:05.919> the

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 
bit more evenly balanced you can see the

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:10.590 
bit more evenly balanced you can see the
lights<00:07:06.270> but<00:07:08.940> yeah<00:07:09.940> they<00:07:10.180> turned<00:07:10.389> out<00:07:10.570> really
