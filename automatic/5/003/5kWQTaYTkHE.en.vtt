 trailers that immediately show the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.620
 Muscles regarding the subject matter is the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.210
 type of reindeer script is known 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 for his interest in creating plots 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.110
 engaging and spectacular like that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.059
 that accompanied the wake to the first 2 max 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 payne is also how much a break does not seem 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.589
 less the game revolves around the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.269
 character of jack jones poliza with 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.160
 New Yorker that following some 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.690
 time experiments ended badly at 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 the university research center of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.809
 river port is found with the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.489
 extraordinary ability to exploit a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.159
 its advantage is an instability that has arisen 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.540
 create in time space in terms of 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.400
 gameplay this translates into 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.290
 possibility to freeze time in one 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 particular area to launch an attack 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.310
 or to enhance the effect of an object 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.420
 moving in addition to an immunity towards 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 the effects of the accounts in the look 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.900
 in the surrounding environment 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.300
 the goal of jack is to investigate 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.650
 to remedy the catastrophe first 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.509
 that the timeline they are 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.100
 living with the aces literally on itself 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.500
 itself 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.119
 during the cologne gamescom 2014 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.740
 we witnessed the first real gameplay 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.960
 and really alive towards the game 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.729
 inevitably increased again in the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.380
 sequence presented jack faces one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.060
 shooting against some soldiers of the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.350
 monarch industries and should 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.689
 represent the main antagonist 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.180
 interaction with the environment 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.619
 in this sequence and maximum jack can 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 freely choose to stop the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.070
 time near explosive objects 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.750
 to enhance the effects can 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.609
 take advantage of the few seconds of stagnation for 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.310
 encircle enemies by moving from one 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.049
 cover to the other undisturbed i 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.969
 landscape distortion effects e 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.219
 physics particle effects are 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.810
 really crazy to the limits of chaos e 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.729
 well they represent the disaster that the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.079
 city ​​is facing we also have 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.329
 could observe some soldiers 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.920
 details with resistant shields 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.289
 allin the creditor of the time they make it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.030
 the tough enemies to beat in this case 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.920
 jack will not be able to act directly on 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.210
 them with their own power but can 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.250
 however take advantage of all the elements 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.930
 surrounding environment to create gods 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.849
 diversions 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.439
 in the second part of the video shown 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.790
 more space is dedicated to 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.010
 distortion phenomena to which the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.079
 player will assist during the campaign 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.400
 the effect is nothing short of spectacular 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.079
 protagonist can easily 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.349
 to cross these surreal scenarios 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.609
 making his way among the suspended objects 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.829
 groups will often be present 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.030
 civilians frozen in a temporal instant 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.060
 in the act of colliding with forces 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.200
 armed or fleeing from danger is not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.389
 the level of interaction is still clear 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.219
 Possible in these moments goes from that 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.569
 which we could observe jack can 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.489
 intervene by moving objects 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.829
 potentially fatal like the molotov 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.480
 view in the video 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.250
 another peculiar feature of 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.989
 as a great and the transmedia of the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.129
 content that constitutes a little 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.620
 trademark of remedy 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.359
 entertainment case has been realized 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.010
 a television series with the tower 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.079
 ideality to tell the key passages 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.849
 of the plot is not yet clear how 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.439
 these two miles will connect but 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.969
 it seems that depending on how the player 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.549
 the series will carry on the plot 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.230
 television will follow the same direction 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.639
 the latter will then have the point of 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.139
 view of the antagonist Paul 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.530
 gauguin to offering an overview 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.239
 certainly more complete and profound 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.989
 the expectations as far as a rake are 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.639
 tall 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.349
 thanks to the gameplay shown we are now 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.479
 certain of the quality of the technical sector 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.870
 of the title that can really be said next 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.430
 January 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.049
 also with regard to the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.609
 screenplay the sensations are very 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.169
 positive because we know that 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.900
 generally the story is one of the points 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.310
 strong of the remedy titles still remains 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.019
 to ascertain intelligence instead 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.250
 artificial of the enemies that will have to 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.229
 balance the unbelievable at best 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.269
 ability of the protagonist otherwise 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:50.459
 too exaggerated as a rake is 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.060
 scheduled for 2015 exclusively on 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.060
