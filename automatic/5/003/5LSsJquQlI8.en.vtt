printable from our blog and cut it out

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.050 
printable from our blog and cut it out
there<00:00:22.050> are<00:00:22.199> dotted<00:00:22.619> lines<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.130> follow<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:24.000> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
there are dotted lines to follow so you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.089 
there are dotted lines to follow so you
can<00:00:24.330> cut<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> line<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> little<00:00:25.949> bit

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
can cut on the line or a little bit

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.990 
can cut on the line or a little bit
outside<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> line<00:00:31.579> now<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> make<00:00:32.969> it

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
outside of the line now to make it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
outside of the line now to make it
easier<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.750> fold<00:00:33.989> into<00:00:34.170> place<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.860> gonna

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
easier to fold into place I'm gonna

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
easier to fold into place I'm gonna
score<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> solid<00:00:36.750> lines<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it makes it easier to bend a little bit

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.780 
it makes it easier to bend a little bit
and<00:00:53.610> shape<00:00:53.910> over<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.270> doll's<00:00:54.539> head

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
cut them out individually I'm using a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.360 
cut them out individually I'm using a
straight<00:02:31.569> edge<00:02:31.599> paper<00:02:32.049> cutter<00:02:32.379> since<00:02:33.190> there

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
straight edge paper cutter since there

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.520 
straight edge paper cutter since there
are<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:33.760> many<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.180> cut<00:02:34.390> out<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.870> faster<00:02:35.349> way

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
are so many to cut out it's a faster way

00:02:35.530 --> 00:03:01.660 
are so many to cut out it's a faster way
to<00:02:35.560> get<00:02:36.549> them<00:02:36.730> all<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.000> same<00:02:37.390> size

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.729
