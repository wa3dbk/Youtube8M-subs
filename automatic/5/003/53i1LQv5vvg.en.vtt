00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
I'm totally not a hair person but I saw

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
this in a store and I thought that it

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.320

thought it was when I purchased it but
it<00:02:06.399> didn't<00:02:06.640> turn<00:02:06.729> out<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:06.939> way<00:02:07.299> number<00:02:08.049> two
