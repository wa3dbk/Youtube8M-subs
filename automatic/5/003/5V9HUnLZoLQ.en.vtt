today we're going to be learning switch

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.140 
today we're going to be learning switch
flips<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.010> nollie<00:00:08.220> flips<00:00:08.580> they're<00:00:09.030> pretty

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
flips and nollie flips they're pretty

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.180 
flips and nollie flips they're pretty
much<00:00:09.269> same<00:00:09.719> trick<00:00:12.049> that's<00:00:13.049> nollie<00:00:13.320> flip<00:00:13.740> that

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
much same trick that's nollie flip that

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.830 
much same trick that's nollie flip that
switch<00:00:14.370> flip<00:00:15.350> before<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.680> started<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
switch flip before we get started I

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.910 
switch flip before we get started I
wanna<00:00:18.840> let<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.050> know<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> pretty

wanna let you know that this is a pretty

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.010 
wanna let you know that this is a pretty
tough<00:00:20.160> trick<00:00:20.490> nollie<00:00:21.270> flips<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> switch

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
tough trick nollie flips and switch

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.200 
tough trick nollie flips and switch
flips<00:00:22.320> even<00:00:23.250> though<00:00:23.369> they're<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.640> kick

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
flips even though they're just kick

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
flips even though they're just kick
flips<00:00:24.449> you're<00:00:25.380> popping<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.070> your<00:00:26.430> index

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
flips you're popping with your index

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.509 
flips you're popping with your index
finger<00:00:27.119> instead<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.830> finger<00:00:29.250> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
finger instead of your little finger so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.560 
finger instead of your little finger so
it's<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> lot<00:00:29.849> harder<00:00:30.029> um<00:00:31.790> first<00:00:32.790> we're<00:00:33.510> gonna

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it's a lot harder um first we're gonna

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.389 
it's a lot harder um first we're gonna
learn<00:00:33.809> nollie<00:00:34.050> flips<00:00:34.350> they're<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> little<00:00:35.250> bit

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
learn nollie flips they're a little bit

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
learn nollie flips they're a little bit
easier<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> forward

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
easier because you have that forward

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020 
easier because you have that forward
bowling<00:00:37.290> momentum<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.340> help<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.640> flip<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
bowling momentum to help you flip it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.630 
bowling momentum to help you flip it
like<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.559> where's<00:00:40.559> where<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> switch<00:00:41.340> flips

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
like that where's where I switch flips

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.270 
like that where's where I switch flips
you<00:00:41.790> climb<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.739> pop<00:00:43.980> more

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you climb at this you have to pop more

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580 
you climb at this you have to pop more
so<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.539> harder<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.530> we'll

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
so a little bit harder so first we'll

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.990 
so a little bit harder so first we'll
start<00:00:46.829> off<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.070> dolly<00:00:47.219> flips<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.879> right

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
start off with dolly flips all right

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.660 
start off with dolly flips all right
like<00:00:48.210> always<00:00:48.500> first<00:00:49.500> finger<00:00:49.980> positioning<00:00:50.610> for

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
like always first finger positioning for

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.760 
like always first finger positioning for
the<00:00:50.820> nollie<00:00:51.030> flip<00:00:51.300> make<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.289> positioning

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the nollie flip make your positioning

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.830 
the nollie flip make your positioning
for<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> nollie<00:00:53.190> flip<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> pretty<00:00:53.850> basic<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
for the nollie flip is pretty basic you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
for the nollie flip is pretty basic you
want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.469> front<00:00:56.250> finger<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:57.030> on

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
want to have your front finger right on

want to have your front finger right on
the<00:00:57.270> tip<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> nose<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the tip of the nose like that and you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369 
the tip of the nose like that and you
want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.969> middle<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.960> middle

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
ollie food first one is of course to get

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.720 
ollie food first one is of course to get
yourself<00:01:16.410> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> right<00:01:16.920> finger<00:01:17.220> positioning

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
yourself in the right finger positioning

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.610 
yourself in the right finger positioning
just<00:01:18.690> like<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.760> second<00:01:20.760> step<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> pop<00:01:21.620> the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
just like that second step is to pop the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.710 
just like that second step is to pop the
third<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> slide<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.700> fingers<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.390> course

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
this is the most technical part when you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.570 
this is the most technical part when you
slide<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.750> fingers<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> tilt<00:01:29.340> your

hand like this you want to bring your
middle<00:01:36.240> finger<00:01:36.570> closer<00:01:36.840> toward<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.950> you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
middle finger closer toward you so you

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.160 
middle finger closer toward you so you
want<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.370> slide<00:01:38.580> up<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:39.060> an<00:01:39.180> ollie<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.720> then

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
want to slide up like an ollie and then

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.330 
want to slide up like an ollie and then
you<00:01:40.290> want<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.500> tilt<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:40.979> hand<00:01:41.160> like<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
you want to tilt your hand like that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.790 
you want to tilt your hand like that
when<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> tilt<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.450> hand<00:01:42.750> it'll<00:01:43.110> slide<00:01:43.590> off

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
when you tilt your hand it'll slide off

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.100 
when you tilt your hand it'll slide off
this<00:01:43.950> corner<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.910> then<00:01:45.869> it'll

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
this corner right here and then it'll

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.180 
this corner right here and then it'll
flip<00:01:47.750> when<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.869> flips<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.470> want<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> catch<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
flip when it flips you want to catch the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.810 
flip when it flips you want to catch the
board<00:01:50.400> you<00:01:50.759> want<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> land<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> roll<00:01:51.570> away

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
board you want to land and roll away

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.340 
board you want to land and roll away
okay<00:01:53.820> we're<00:01:54.390> gonna<00:01:54.479> discuss<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.020> few<00:01:55.050> problems

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
okay we're gonna discuss a few problems

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.450 
okay we're gonna discuss a few problems
with<00:01:55.740> nollie<00:01:56.070> flips<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> switch<00:01:57.450> flips<00:01:58.460> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
with nollie flips and switch flips the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.940 
with nollie flips and switch flips the
first<00:01:59.700> problem<00:01:59.940> it<00:02:00.810> keeps<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.410> with<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
first problem it keeps going with a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.760 
first problem it keeps going with a
nollie<00:02:02.220> varial<00:02:02.369> flip<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.540> always<00:02:03.960> goes<00:02:04.140> 90

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
nollie varial flip it always goes 90

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.840 
nollie varial flip it always goes 90
like<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.869> reason<00:02:07.200> why<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.680> because<00:02:07.850> you

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
like that the reason why is because you

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.030 
like that the reason why is because you
have<00:02:08.880> your<00:02:09.509> front<00:02:09.810> finger<00:02:10.140> too<00:02:10.530> little<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
have your front finger too little on the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.640 
have your front finger too little on the
deck<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.420> either<00:02:12.570> back<00:02:12.810> here<00:02:13.260> back

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
deck like it's either back here back

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.979 
deck like it's either back here back
here<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.489> wanna<00:02:14.670> give<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.209> only<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.750> much

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
here you wanna give it only this much

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.770 
here you wanna give it only this much
space<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.760> has<00:02:17.910> just<00:02:18.209> enough<00:02:18.330> room<00:02:18.630> to

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
space so it has just enough room to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.380 
space so it has just enough room to
slide<00:02:19.019> off<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:19.860> not<00:02:19.980> too<00:02:20.220> much<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.209> does<00:02:21.360> a

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
slide off but not too much so it does a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.140 
slide off but not too much so it does a
pop<00:02:21.660> shove<00:02:22.190> all<00:02:23.190> right<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.580> second<00:02:23.970> most

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
pop shove all right the second most

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.509 
pop shove all right the second most
common<00:02:24.330> problem<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.080> under<00:02:25.350> flipping<00:02:25.769> oh<00:02:28.519> so

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
common problem is under flipping oh so

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.479 
common problem is under flipping oh so
use<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> landing<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:34.650> right<00:02:34.799> something<00:02:35.340> like

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
use the landing all right something like

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.620 
use the landing all right something like
that<00:02:35.690> okay<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.560> was<00:02:37.650> funny<00:02:37.890> all<00:02:38.370> right<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that okay that was funny all right the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.660 
that okay that was funny all right the
the<00:02:40.410> reason<00:02:40.680> why<00:02:40.769> it's<00:02:40.920> under<00:02:41.160> flipping<00:02:41.549> is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the reason why it's under flipping is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.370 
the reason why it's under flipping is
because<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.209> your<00:02:42.600> front<00:02:42.959> finger<00:02:43.200> too

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
because you have your front finger too

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.590 
because you have your front finger too
far<00:02:43.590> back<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:44.459> like<00:02:44.580> over<00:02:44.820> here<00:02:45.060> over<00:02:45.299> here

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
far back it's like over here over here

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.210 
far back it's like over here over here
you<00:02:46.080> want<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> more<00:02:46.890> toward<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
you want to have it more toward the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.440 
you want to have it more toward the
middle<00:02:47.750> perfectly<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.880> now<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:50.910> miss<00:02:51.060> it

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.990 

okay<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.629> third<00:02:54.959> problem<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:56.129> it's<00:02:56.610> over

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
okay and third problem is it's over

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.690 
okay and third problem is it's over
flipping<00:02:57.450> over<00:02:58.200> flipping<00:02:58.799> is<00:02:58.950> actually<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
flipping over flipping is actually the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.059 
flipping over flipping is actually the
least<00:02:59.819> comment<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.450> three<00:03:00.719> it's<00:03:01.650> probably

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
least comment of the three it's probably

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.410 
least comment of the three it's probably
over<00:03:02.219> flipping<00:03:02.700> because<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:02.969> put<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.239> too

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
over flipping because you put it too

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.039 
over flipping because you put it too
much<00:03:03.569> force<00:03:03.930> into<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> slide<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:06.049> you're

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
much force into the slide and you're

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.170 
much force into the slide and you're
kind<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:08.180> giving<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.299> too<00:03:09.629> much<00:03:09.659> of<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.680> turn<00:03:11.579> you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
kind of giving it too much of a turn you

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.819 
kind of giving it too much of a turn you
kind<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.510> want<00:03:12.689> to<00:03:12.750> make<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.930> gradual<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.709> it

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
kind of want to make it gradual so it

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.280 
kind of want to make it gradual so it
just<00:03:14.099> flicks<00:03:14.489> off<00:03:14.730> gently<00:03:15.209> if<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.019> do<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.260> too

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
just flicks off gently if you do it too

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.050 
just flicks off gently if you do it too
much<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.799> gonna<00:03:16.920> go<00:03:17.159> spinning<00:03:17.549> out<00:03:18.000> of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
much it's gonna go spinning out of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.599 
much it's gonna go spinning out of
control<00:03:18.709> all<00:03:19.709> right<00:03:19.859> once<00:03:20.099> you<00:03:20.159> learn<00:03:20.340> nollie

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
control all right once you learn nollie

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.290 
control all right once you learn nollie
flips<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.120> could<00:03:21.389> try<00:03:21.569> them<00:03:21.720> into<00:03:21.930> grinds
