00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.770
 in principle I'll show you how in 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.620
 a television as an example of my 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.960
 home 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.870
 I am looking calmly at a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.790
 TV show and I can move on to 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.490
 connect the cameras that I have outside 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.260
 I came to know this peculiarity 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.020
 pressing the video button 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.150
 happened to see one of the two cameras that 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:41.190
 I have for example a color camera 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:44.620
 and I'm looking at the house from an angle 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.660
 pressure the audio step remote control 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.480
 video 2 quietly there could get there 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.760
 to place against cameras or have 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.730
 connected the video player 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.850
 super video that I do not use again the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.129
 button and I start to see another camera 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.920
 placed from another point of view as 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.189
 you can see it is black and white because 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.780
 the standard that is using this camera 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.420
 It is a brave camera 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.840
 then on a common television you 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.260
 they will see it black and white 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.640
 I press again 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.140
 remote control went on to watch the channels 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.300
 press the control again the types 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.820
 to see the other camera that enters by audio 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.510
 video one that looks in color because it 's 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.510
 an ntsc camera that I will explain later 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.090
 very well this is the back of the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.630
 home television that we were watching 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.509
 in the previous video 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.340
 I'm going to show you that it's in the same 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.680
 television that has any of 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.840
 your 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.410
 and that in any home 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.470
 this is the entrance 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.810
 of the cable of say the cable that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.330
 comes outside to see the channels of 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.380
 television and these two cables that are 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 here 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.860
 these two cables that are here are the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.860
 records 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.440
 it's the rsa chips that we 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.520
 we use to connect the cameras that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.520
 they come from the outside 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.310
 this date and this date place van 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.609
 counted are connected in the entrances 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.430
 audio video of any television and or 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.859

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.680
 direct video recorder 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.180
 so the connections as you can see 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.490
 they are not difficult 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.370
 we just have to look for the 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.150
 Video audio inputs of any 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.150
