without any need for adjustment

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.870 
without any need for adjustment
traditionally<00:00:29.869> they're<00:00:30.020> very<00:00:30.170> easy<00:00:30.350> to<00:00:30.590> use

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
traditionally they're very easy to use

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.020 
traditionally they're very easy to use
special<00:00:31.880> clamps<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.360> these<00:00:32.480> even<00:00:32.750> more<00:00:33.080> so

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
special clamps and these even more so

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.979 
special clamps and these even more so
but<00:00:35.030> when<00:00:36.020> new<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:37.309> abilities<00:00:37.790> of<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.750> clamp

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
but when new the abilities of the clamp

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.900 
but when new the abilities of the clamp
is<00:00:39.170> not<00:00:39.350> tested<00:00:39.800> out<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.430> what<00:00:40.580> we're<00:00:40.730> going<00:00:40.820> to

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
is not tested out so what we're going to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.340 
is not tested out so what we're going to
do<00:00:41.030> we're<00:00:41.210> going<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.360> artificially<00:00:42.110> aged<00:00:42.320> a

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
do we're going to artificially aged a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.740 
do we're going to artificially aged a
section<00:00:42.920> I've<00:00:43.010> got<00:00:43.160> an<00:00:43.280> old<00:00:43.430> pole<00:00:44.270> section

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
section I've got an old pole section

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.830 
section I've got an old pole section
here<00:00:45.020> you<00:00:45.580> can<00:00:46.580> see<00:00:46.760> it's<00:00:46.970> got<00:00:47.360> a<00:00:47.390> non<00:00:47.600> mark

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
here you can see it's got a non mark

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.440 
here you can see it's got a non mark
surface<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.500> what<00:00:48.590> I'm<00:00:48.710> going<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:48.920> do<00:00:49.100> is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
surface and what I'm going to do is

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.330 
surface and what I'm going to do is
replicate<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:51.050> type<00:00:51.320> of<00:00:51.350> where<00:00:51.770> that<00:00:51.980> happens

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
replicate the type of where that happens

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.319 
replicate the type of where that happens
perhaps<00:00:52.550> on<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.500> year<00:00:54.500> old<00:00:54.680> pole<00:00:55.120> usually<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
perhaps on a year old pole usually the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.080 
perhaps on a year old pole usually the
section<00:00:56.780> will<00:00:56.870> wear<00:00:57.050> unevenly<00:00:57.290> in<00:00:58.070> one<00:00:58.309> spot

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
section will wear unevenly in one spot

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.819 
section will wear unevenly in one spot
it's<00:00:59.840> usually<00:01:00.050> at<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.380> top<00:01:00.590> or<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.770> bottom

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
it's usually at the top or the bottom

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.700 
it's usually at the top or the bottom
where<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.280> clamp<00:01:01.520> is<00:01:01.700> closed<00:01:01.969> most<00:01:02.239> often

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
where the clamp is closed most often

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.439 
where the clamp is closed most often
traditionally<00:01:03.710> might<00:01:04.009> wear<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.580> top<00:01:04.820> inch<00:01:05.180> or

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
traditionally might wear the top inch or

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.480 
traditionally might wear the top inch or
so<00:01:05.690> below<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.500> clamp<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.890> then<00:01:07.009> when<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.340> go

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
so below the clamp and then when you go

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.700 
so below the clamp and then when you go
to<00:01:07.520> close<00:01:07.790> your<00:01:08.090> older<00:01:08.360> pole<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.930> clamp<00:01:09.470> it

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
to close your older pole and clamp it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.609 
to close your older pole and clamp it
spins<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:11.600> let's<00:01:11.780> replicate<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.380> I'm<00:01:12.500> going

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
spins so let's replicate that I'm going

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.139 
spins so let's replicate that I'm going
to<00:01:12.680> be<00:01:12.770> very<00:01:12.860> harsh<00:01:13.160> with<00:01:13.399> this<00:01:13.520> I'm<00:01:13.910> going<00:01:14.090> to

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
to be very harsh with this I'm going to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.910 
to be very harsh with this I'm going to
use<00:01:14.300> it<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.479> little<00:01:14.780> dremel<00:01:15.200> with<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.380> sanding

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
use it a little dremel with a sanding

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.120 
use it a little dremel with a sanding
disc<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.640> take<00:01:16.940> off<00:01:17.240> maybe<00:01:18.110> up<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.350> half<00:01:18.890> a

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
disc to take off maybe up to half a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.640 
disc to take off maybe up to half a
millimeter<00:01:19.610> from<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.510> wall<00:01:20.690> thickness<00:01:20.960> let's

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
millimeter from the wall thickness let's

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:46.170 
millimeter from the wall thickness let's
see<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.040> in<00:01:22.190> action

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.540 

you<00:01:47.180> can<00:01:47.330> see<00:01:47.510> here<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:48.260> we've<00:01:48.590> reduced<00:01:49.010> the

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
you can see here that we've reduced the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.040 
you can see here that we've reduced the
diameter<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.300> section<00:01:50.750> by<00:01:51.020> a

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
diameter of the section by a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.560 
diameter of the section by a
considerable<00:01:51.979> amount<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:53.360> would<00:01:53.510> be

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
considerable amount that would be

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.380 
considerable amount that would be
typical<00:01:54.140> for<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.410> year<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.950> two<00:01:55.160> years<00:01:55.360> worth<00:01:56.360> of

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
typical for a year to two years worth of

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.160 
typical for a year to two years worth of
wear<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.380> we're<00:01:57.770> now<00:01:57.979> going<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.479> clamp<00:01:59.479> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
wear and we're now going to clamp the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.460 
wear and we're now going to clamp the
clamp<00:02:00.409> back<00:02:00.710> on<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.300> slide<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:03.229> clamp

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
clamp back on that so we slide the clamp

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.430 
clamp back on that so we slide the clamp
onto<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.979> close<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.360> sure<00:02:05.930> enough<00:02:05.960> it

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
onto it close it and sure enough it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.580 
onto it close it and sure enough it
automatically<00:02:07.190> clamps<00:02:08.110> absolutely<00:02:09.110> tight<00:02:09.350> so

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
automatically clamps absolutely tight so

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.010 
automatically clamps absolutely tight so
that<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.770> section<00:02:10.310> will<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.789> spin<00:02:11.150> but<00:02:11.900> it

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
that the section will not spin but it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.949 
that the section will not spin but it
also<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.560> as<00:02:12.770> easily<00:02:13.690> clamps<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
also just as easily clamps on the

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.340 
also just as easily clamps on the
unwarned<00:02:15.470> section<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.280> will<00:02:17.060> not<00:02:17.270> spend

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.530 

so<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:21.530> shows<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.010> real-world<00:02:22.580> advantage

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
so this shows the real-world advantage

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.380 
so this shows the real-world advantage
of<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> new<00:02:24.110> adaptive<00:02:24.680> smartphone<00:02:25.550> with<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
of the new adaptive smartphone with a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.530 
of the new adaptive smartphone with a
warm<00:02:26.690> section<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:28.280> still<00:02:28.580> clamped<00:02:28.910> with<00:02:29.090> no

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
warm section and still clamped with no
