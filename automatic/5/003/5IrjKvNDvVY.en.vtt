00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 welcome to our channel here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.099
 a recipe on youtube where we bring 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.139
 for you but very cool recipes 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.410
 simple recipes 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.540
 today we are going to make sweet and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
 rock'n'roll cinema with our side the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.900
 Flemish has a little bit and sometimes 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.010
 we have some trouble 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.320
 do at home 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.939
 Today I'll give you all the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.460
 secrets so that we can have a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 quality non -sugar popcorn 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.059
 note the ingredients in the cup 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.320
 of crystal and good sugar tea on the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.800
 colored matter or refined sugar 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.950
 cup of water tea half a cup of tea 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.879
 of corn oil a cup of tea 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.640
 corn for training popcorn and grand dye 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.500
 Emilio's chef shouted for help. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.420
 Let's start preparing 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.120
 the tape using a pan that proves 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.160
 to make popcorn popcorn that in my 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.629
 It's better that we're going to do it. 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.030
 this popcorn because we're going to have 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.070
 pretty caramel on the bottom of the pan 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.440
 and if I can not fiddle with so much 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.630
 ease this will harm our 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.760
 popcorn in the end so it's cool that I 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.500
 I'm using a nice pot that's a 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.300
 bit more expensive we can buy with 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.600
 Portuguese pme de inox are more 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.119
 45 and 50 reais reais and we have a 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.290
 good part too that I 'm going to do here 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.270
 Oh I'm going to add the video then livid 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.040
 I put the note to you that 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.890
 the premium medium because it is the only one that 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.450
 It's a better story, but it yields more 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.880
 so that's why we put the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.100
 premium 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.960
 so I put the eye I prefer oil 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.789
 because corn oil is not going to 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.130
 leave flavor I do not like to use the bow 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.750
 Ok soy oil here I am 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.119
 putting sugar 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.310
 I'm using refined sugar if 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.530
 You do not have the dye. 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.479
 you can use that sugar that 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.820
 We already buy colorful ones that the market 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.740
 today it's in the confectionery stores 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.900
 find various brands of various colors I 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.549
 I can also use the water that's what goes 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.640
 do here with the way our stay 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.739
 well balanced and then I'll go with the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.880
 dyed that here we were a 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.640
 dye which is the dye a large 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.370
 chef and then I'll put it around 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.350
 of 2 grams of this dye 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.690
 so it's a little bit because it 's good 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.420
 concentrated if indeed we do not 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.980
 You have the head of the dye and not find 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.230
 with so much ease I can use 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.430
 during Engel's preference of you 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.390
 is in the reference mark 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.400
 and there we will overcome all this and then we 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.590
 Let's take this to the fire here at 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.750
 Truth we have three steps to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.310
 begin our stance 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.650
 It takes a little while when you take 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.469
 this to the fire about 78 minutes 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.909
 It's because they know you 're going to 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.950
 So the first point I'm going to show 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.540
 you when you boil that you do not 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.239
 Thalia sometimes we get scared 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.799
 to fail not thalia second point is 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.200
 when she on drugs will realize that 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.239
 this house is going to be much more 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.980
 the third point is when the oil starts 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.989
 to return to the surface now that the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.069
 corn starts to burst so I go 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.680
 put a fire 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.049
 Let's have these three points for you and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.669
 then when the prime minister is to pray 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.980
 When I'm going to try panela and I'm going 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.969
 start taking it so she caramelize 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.769
 all the same 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.659
 so I 'll take it to the fire and back 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.579
 showing these two points to you 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.680
 we took the first fire I went 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.150
 observe that the first point of our 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.090
 stir-fry 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.769
 only this has a boil stirring for good 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.349
 in when I do not need to keep stirring 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.629
 All the good time is that we arrived at 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.819
 second point of our popcorn which is where 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.010
 you realize that you already have a 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.359
 relation to the first point where I 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.940
 I realize that my house is already a 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.709
 slightly thicker and fat is already 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.599
 more on the surface where people 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.400
 notice that there is enough foam that 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.590
 fat that came to super end the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.290
 third point is the most important point 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.209
 that our popcorn started to explore 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.340
 Then we started to pop our popcorn. 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.440
 I'll cover the pan and I'll make the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.690
 movements so she takes care of the bottom 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.690
 in it and become totally paralyzed 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.050
 Good people already know my popcorn. 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.150
 cooled we put here it's always 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.880
 Nice to put a big container to 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.639
 it is spread well by cooling down more 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.229
 When it cools down, it's time for the 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.330
 caramelized sugar 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:43.380
 then is the time that I check here and O 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.460
 begin to let her not stay those 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.349
 blocks 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.169
 a nice tip that you always see in 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.460
 internet them cakes made with popcorn 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.650
 so when I want to make a cake 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.870
 made with popcorn when i shoot popcorn 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.639
 South I've put into the form 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.590
 because that 's where the caramel is hot there 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.240
 You will press and you will be able to give 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.220
 format required 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.720
 so the fifth after it had cooled 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.020
 I can totally put us 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.669
 bags to market to and always 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.190
 remembering that the validity of his popcorn 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.930
 three days in the pot that stays 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.509
 medical closed mind

 five reais so there is no excuse for
