00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.009
 People usually go to the mountain 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.870
 and this type of mountains and others that are 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.690
 many square kilometers uses the gps 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 and everything you want is very good and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.290
 this but I'm old - fashioned to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.940
 old fashion and so on because it's that I 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.619
 I'm very old-fashioned then 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.660
 I'm doing I'm placing posters 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.449
 one 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.000
 so that where he goes then they are 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.199
 some little signs that emilio josÃ© puts 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.210
 mushrooms was here and this was the route that 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.370
 I had been marking the trees and what 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.720
 I was putting everything so that's what 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.699

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.079

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.129
 measures but of course you can come a 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.989
 sky from behind and fuck is the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.300
 little friend here the little friend did not work 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.860
 nor god because of course you can remove the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.360
 posters you can remove three but when 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.909
 you have two thousand positions who will remove 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.829
 the two thousand posters then you get to the 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.300
 final and in the end you are removing the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.980
 posters pam pam pam at the beginning because 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.699
