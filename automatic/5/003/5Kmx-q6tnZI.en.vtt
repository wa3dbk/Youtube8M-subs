00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.139
 these little ones are part of the club 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.509
 rhythmic gymnastics and at the end of the month 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.310
 April will represent Chiapas in the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.640
 national championship of said discipline 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.130
 Based in the state of Tamaulipas 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 we are trying to have a greater 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.430
 preparation in every way because 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.129
 yes it is quite responsibility I do not sleep 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.370
 but I think this is evolving 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.710
 well I hope it continues to follow us 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.740
 supporting tasks of flexibility tasks 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 of acrobatic tasks right now we're 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.579
 also watching the preparation 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.430
 psychological because it has to see is what 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.320
 more important 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.850
 because because there are children that when they are 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.860
 very good here but when it comes to 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.990
 face there with several with several 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.690
 girls stand still or simply 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.820
 it does not move, it does not move 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.880
 How should your participation in 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.920
 this competition is promising in addition 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.260
 that gives the possibility that 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.140
 these little acrobats raise their level 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.800
 professional have to have this type 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.960
 I think that because they are not 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.300
 used to face that 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
 public that is pretty big have 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.590
 that dominate more both body and 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.290
 balance like nerves like in order 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.700
 many things then then that does 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.729
 that they somehow go 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.920
 having their own maturity because they are 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.729
 very small children the smallest 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.979

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.290

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.789
