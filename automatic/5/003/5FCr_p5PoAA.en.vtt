00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.539

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.680
 and good this time I bring you a boxing 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.460
 something that bought me has opened me 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 the box because I did not realize 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.039
 I realize and now I had open 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.339
 when I realized 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.410
 Well, what I extract as you see 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:38.550
 I bought it in the pp components 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.960
 well, although the box with everything 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 I bought this 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.440
 the new refrigeration when it's going to be 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:55.240
 refrigerator of my laptop 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.240
 we have a boxing 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.649
 this cool side over here 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:09.740
 some the xtrail xx1 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.740
 and good is a good cooling 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.050
 this 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.579
 a little maybe I'll open the dandruff 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.149
 morals and I have it open and we are going to 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.420
 see let's take it out 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:33.770
 Here is my new cooling 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.909
 support now without breaking it 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.909
 to see that it does not break 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.159
 for here we see it below has here 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.040
 the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.550
 the fan 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.410
 but 200 mm large kurt 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.659
 is a reflex and of good here has if 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.380
 they look if there are those little lights 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.039
 because if I can point gas 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.740
 these little lights here are LEDs that 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:09.350
 this turns red 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.350
 and well here we have it above 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.050
 this above 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.770
 and this is the usb cable he's going 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.270
 plugged in and nothing works has followed 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.530
 they take large computers of up to 19 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.810
 inches cool well 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.760
 a truth 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.590
 I raised a lot on because it 's 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.019
 bad is wrong 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.860
 and good of this refrigeration now 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.120
 hold 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.239
 well here has a relief that 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.780
 suppose it's the strike equis 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.390
 here it is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.260
 Look it shows as the finger I can not 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.860
 happen 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.640
 strike 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.490
 look at this now on the computer so that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.050
 see how it works 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.130
 and we're done 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.680
 well I already have the computer of all and 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.530
 good this computer that was so 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.200
 open below 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.959
 because if it did not heat up, it 's just that 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.780
 very much I have to put again the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.450
 tapas but good nothing happens we're going to 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.610
 open the computer and good as you see is 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.610
 a 16 9 embroiderer 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.860
 16 9 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.670
 and of course it's a big screen 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.670
 and nothing 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.660
 let's turn on 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.020
 and already just plug it in as you see 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.020
 here 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.500
 and it's complete sharpen 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.190
 I'll need that there 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.190
 start sending cold air 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.650
 sixth 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.390
 we are away from the computer so and if not 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.819
 good 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.520
 Here you have 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:10.250
 like a very silent silent 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.250
 and sends an important chill 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.480
 You do not have to tour with my laws 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.680
 same is very silent is a like 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.880
 I liked that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.640
 and nothing 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.050
 and simply when you unplug it you already 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.070
 for either everyone 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.710
 perfect 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.980
 well this has been all for today to see if 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:40.650
 I come back with the channel makes it go up more 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.650
