00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.420
 it's a video that will show you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.460
 how to read a phase diagram 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.179
 so here is the phase diagram of 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:17.000
 the lake then seize water so if we have 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 pressure and kz2 x temperature 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.630
 take for example at 20 degrees and a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.750
 atlas make an atmosphere being the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.599
 about standard pressure of on the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.210
 earth then at 20 degrees and an atmosphere 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 we are in this context so 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.649
 we see that the water is liquid which is 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.260
 ten years while outside he's coming 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.410
 and locmane australia turns the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.840
 graphic 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.070
 so if we increase the temperature that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 what would happen then obviously 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.809
 the water starts to boil and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.930
 eventually will become steam or 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.050
 a gas the way we read the graph 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.789
 congo to the right according to the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.980
 x temperature and possibly 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.309
 how do we see in the frame a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:09.860
 here and gas that causes so much pressure to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.570
 an atmosphere is about 102 and 106 and 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.790
 the same way more cool water 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 eventually we arrive in the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.670
 quadrant of the sun and so if we 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.100
 cool the ice to zero degrees on 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.470
 will change sentences and it will become 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.049
 the ice solid but we can also 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.990
 do the same thing on the side of the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.939
 pressure then if we do not bend kedovins 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.200
 would say and fresh pineapple we decide to 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.820
 lower the pressure 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 then we lower the pressure and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.920
 eventually what will happen is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.960
 that we will not arrive from a thug gets worse 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.450
 but if we admit the pressure of a 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.070
 liquid what is happening but we 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.320
 we see that results in the quadrant 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.290
 liquids and then this something 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 which is special for one for the water the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.920
 most substances when 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.979
 increases the pressure a free liquid 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 molecules will pile up more and more 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.020
 and will train one and milo louis and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.570
 special because of the way that the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.439
 molecules come together if we increase the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.070
 liquid pressure 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.290
 he will stay liquid then 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.240
 line 6 between the liquid and the solid 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.850
 is special for the water she is trying 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.340
 to lean backwards but all 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.710
 other substances 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.720
 the line between the liquid liquid cd 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.550
 would lean forward will be lost a 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.980
 line a little exaggerated then because we 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.130
 will increase the pressure and possibly 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.200
 we should become a sun but 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.630
 it's not that for water that's the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.970
 difference between water say it in two 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.520
 phases of the water and all the others 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.600
 substances 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.880
 finally we can also start this 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.430
 side of the solids then the ice and 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.410
 increased the pressure and these 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.560
 eventually we could not get 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.540
 return to a liquid then really if we 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.000
 increases the pressure on a piece of 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.000
 ice cream we are able to melt and 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.670
 that's how skating works 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.730
 note reach the skate blade that 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.880
 exert pressure on the ice made 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.740
 melt the ice a little and make more 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.540
 this edge of water which decreases the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.830
 friction is reached and the ice 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.830
 so that helps us to slide
