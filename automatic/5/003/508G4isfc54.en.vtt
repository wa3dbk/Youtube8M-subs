00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.270
 important than winning all the lawsuits 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.330
 of the world it is a form of consecration 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.070
 which I did not dare to dream then is this 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.779

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.759
 she herself making me think I just have to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.590
 show that and I think that directly 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.450
 it will spend three words to qualify his 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.730
