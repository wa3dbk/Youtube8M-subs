00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.720
 Talk to me, everyone is good and zac eric. 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.730
 critically and in today's video let's 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.559
 talk about more achievements and activities 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.809
 which are practically impossible to 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 to get there 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.740
 despite being a video about shyness 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.720
 Impossible, I'll start by talking about 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.939
 which is not very active among but is a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.039
 conquest so fucking that it simply has 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.320
 that appears here so you can use 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.570
 ring of death metal has dark souls 2 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.150
 You need to finish a game without sitting down. 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.650
 no good fire is exactly was 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.120
 that's exactly what I said you do not 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.980
 can sit no good to do to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.040
 hold or anything can ascend 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.530
 the bad fighters bon to create can be 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.020
 credit checkpoint but does not have 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.610
 how to hold onto them so I always feel 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.539
 a good do alone ended up 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.100
 Just kidding 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.870
 Look what the fucking bastard is now 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.050
 imagine the number of bosses who have 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.629
 to face the amount of work 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.760
 who should actually give it to do 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.050
 there after you finished the game winning 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.820
 final boss and everything else 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.370
 have to wait for the credits to pass 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.989
 Then I feel like the ring of the problem is 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.270
 there are people who have jumped 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.880
 credits and do not get that slutty 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.610
 daflon software is our second 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.979
 I had it today it's a limbo called 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.560
 at the point nda in angola of this team is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.630
 finish a game without dying any time 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.220
 not taking into account that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.320
 There is no way to save in language. 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 saving automatically such that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.369
 practically anything kills you in the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.880
 This is a very complicated business . 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.549
 do 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.009
 and worst of all in xbox 360 at least only 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.509
 worth 10 points I've already had third 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.360
 service that is practically impossible to 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.140
 to get is the dead space 2 hardcore 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 it's his name 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.119
 Our next tough team is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.860
 the dead space 2 hardcore 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.540
 In there you have to play hardcore mode. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.380
 of the game where you can only save three 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.420
 times 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.540
 Until then, it's okay if you die. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.530
 died and start the game all over again only 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.530
 what a fack 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.430
 and then you lose hours and hours and hours 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.320
 It's many hours of gameplay done. 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.210
 You won the internet and the network that did not 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.850
 What is that gun that 's fucking hard? 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.799
 that the wing that shoots with since fourth 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.020
 advent of our list is the gold standard 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.239
 gran turismo 5 in it you have to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.210
 finish every race every 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.360
 tests of 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.500
 think absolutely everything with the goal 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.960
 That means there's going to be a lot of people. 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.030
 calls the cupe for finishing a 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.290
 thousandth of a second after time 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.050
 minimum to get gold 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.270
 now imagine the time you will lose 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.520
 doing all the licenses and 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.620
 absolutely everything to stay with the moon 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.530
 full of gold in absolutely everything can 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.900
 happen you have to do everything and to 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.020
 close our list we have the last one 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.470
 active that closing our list we 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.580
 we have the maicon activation trophy I went 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.920
 sondermann 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.070
 he's basically got to play with the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.710
 28 characters in the game for 24 hours 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.130
 Do No Fatality Win Without Fight Play 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.400
 24 hours again I already told you to do 150 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.500
 Ex-king moves and you only have 10 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.530
 thousand liters of blood 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.940
 now it's 24 hours in 28 character 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.810
 means that you have to keep playing the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.150
 game 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.370
 at least about three months four 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.440
 months to get shit on the team 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.350
 if you got it you have no life 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.700
 basically good people we stayed here 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.100
