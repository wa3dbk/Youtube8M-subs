because<00:01:26.969> I<00:01:27.030> actually<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.450> think<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.960> Hedgehog

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
because I actually do think the Hedgehog

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.950 
because I actually do think the Hedgehog
is<00:01:28.649> more<00:01:29.249> of<00:01:29.399> a<00:01:29.490> better<00:01:29.670> site<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.450> assault

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
rifles where when I first started

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.669 
rifles where when I first started
playing<00:01:33.240> tizen<00:01:33.749> for<00:01:33.899> was<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.289> using<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
playing tizen for was that using the

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.649 
playing tizen for was that using the
holo<00:01:34.859> sight<00:01:35.159> thinking<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.270> best<00:01:36.420> but

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
holo sight thinking up with the best but

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.149 
holo sight thinking up with the best but
the<00:01:36.719> H<00:01:36.899> cook<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.289> actually<00:01:37.530> very<00:01:37.560> very<00:01:37.829> good

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
compared to the holo sight which I

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.719 
compared to the holo sight which I
didn't<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.590> before<00:01:40.859> but<00:01:41.520> I've<00:01:41.609> been

which is always good to see it go up and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.150 
which is always good to see it go up and
time<00:02:21.450> I've<00:02:21.900> actually<00:02:22.110> played<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.620> exact<00:02:22.980> same

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160

amount of time to actually get to the
highest<00:02:24.900> 50<00:02:25.290> levels<00:02:25.440> again<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:26.040> believe<00:02:26.490> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
highest 50 levels again I believe it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.910 
highest 50 levels again I believe it
took<00:02:26.790> me<00:02:26.850> 11<00:02:27.390> hours<00:02:27.630> 15<00:02:28.020> minutes<00:02:28.050> which<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.770> to

took me 11 hours 15 minutes which is to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.520 
took me 11 hours 15 minutes which is to
basically<00:02:29.069> 11<00:02:29.730> hours<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.360> time<00:02:30.600> around<00:02:30.630> but

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
basically 11 hours this time around but

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.110 
basically 11 hours this time around but

first generation doesn't have any
challenges<00:02:45.630> but<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.260> generation<00:02:46.890> does<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.340> I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400

possible these first challenges that you
get<00:02:57.750> for<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:57.959> generation<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.950> pretty<00:02:59.250> easy

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
get for this generation is pretty easy

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.910 
get for this generation is pretty easy
it's<00:02:59.940> basically<00:03:00.600> as<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.050> can<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.350> just

it's basically as you can see just

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.009 
it's basically as you can see just
killing<00:03:02.310> enemies<00:03:02.670> with<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.000> 40<00:03:03.480> meter<00:03:03.720> milia

semi-automatic rifle for the titan as

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.490 
semi-automatic rifle for the titan as
you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.790> see<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.150> need<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.360> kill<00:03:09.510> 200<00:03:09.840> enemies

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
you can see you need to kill 200 enemies

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.490 
you can see you need to kill 200 enemies
overall<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.250> also<00:03:11.940> kill<00:03:12.239> 50<00:03:12.630> tysons<00:03:13.140> with<00:03:13.350> it

overall and also kill 50 tysons with it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.470 
overall and also kill 50 tysons with it
then<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:14.010> need<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.430> using<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.880> evo<00:03:15.209> 8

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
then you need to be using the evo 8

amount<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.640> enemies<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.150> think<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.600> may<00:03:54.810> be<00:03:54.840> 50

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
ejected from their Titan which is

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.490 
ejected from their Titan which is
definitely<00:04:00.060> hard<00:04:00.329> I<00:04:00.540> think<00:04:00.989> I've<00:04:01.079> only<00:04:01.200> killed

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
definitely hard I think I've only killed

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.970 
definitely hard I think I've only killed
like<00:04:01.709> three<00:04:02.100> or<00:04:02.220> four<00:04:02.250> overall<00:04:03.239> already<00:04:03.980> so

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
like three or four overall already so

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.830 
like three or four overall already so
that<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.130> definitely<00:04:05.579> be<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.880> bummer<00:04:06.239> but<00:04:06.720> what

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
that I definitely be a bummer but what

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.060 
that I definitely be a bummer but what
I've<00:04:06.959> also<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.440> Highland<00:04:07.799> should<00:04:07.890> show<00:04:08.010> you

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
I've also a Highland should show you

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.009 
I've also a Highland should show you
right<00:04:08.310> here<00:04:08.370> but<00:04:09.090> basically<00:04:09.299> every<00:04:09.720> time<00:04:09.900> you

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
right here but basically every time you

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.319 
right here but basically every time you
generate<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.890> actually<00:04:11.190> get<00:04:11.310> more<00:04:11.549> XP<00:04:12.030> like

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
generate you actually get more XP like

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.180 
generate you actually get more XP like
much<00:04:12.630> faster<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.320> think<00:04:13.530> edgy<00:04:13.799> tells<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.160> on

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
much faster I think edgy tells you on

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.580 
much faster I think edgy tells you on
the<00:04:14.430> regeneration<00:04:14.970> kinda<00:04:15.540> like<00:04:15.660> screen<00:04:16.049> but

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
the regeneration kinda like screen but

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.250 
the regeneration kinda like screen but
for<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:16.919> generation<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.549> get<00:04:17.970> 1.1<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:19.140> then

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
for this generation you get 1.1 and then

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.990 
for this generation you get 1.1 and then
I<00:04:19.350> presume<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.039> next<00:04:20.250> generation<00:04:20.760> will<00:04:20.789> be

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
I presume the next generation will be

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.490 
I presume the next generation will be
getting<00:04:21.209> one<00:04:21.390> point<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.840> every<00:04:22.109> game<00:04:22.320> and

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
getting one point to every game and

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.469 
getting one point to every game and
every<00:04:22.680> time<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.039> get<00:04:23.159> XP<00:04:23.550> at<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.150> end<00:04:24.270> of<00:04:24.360> the

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
every time you get XP at the end of the

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.659 
every time you get XP at the end of the
match<00:04:24.659> you<00:04:24.840> can<00:04:24.870> definitely<00:04:25.409> see<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.890> extra

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
match you can definitely see the extra

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.920 
match you can definitely see the extra
added<00:04:26.970> on<00:04:27.120> as<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.450> says<00:04:27.599> like

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
a multiplier 1.14 being gen 2 but let's

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.840 
a multiplier 1.14 being gen 2 but let's
generate<00:04:31.080> anyway<00:04:31.410> guys<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:32.009> believe<00:04:32.580> it's<00:04:32.729> got
