 once upon a time a lumberjack and his 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.480
 woman who had seven children all 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.000
 boys 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.100
 he was so poor that he had trouble 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.590
 feed them 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.840
 the last of the threads was very small they 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.760
 were not bigger than one inch and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.610
 that's why it was called the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.000
 petit poucet however he was very 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000
 malignant 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.820
 in the evening while the seven brothers 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.820
 were lying the lumberjack said his wife 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.530
 we have nothing to eat if we 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.040
 do not want to see our children die 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.070
 hungry you have to lose them in the forest 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.080
 the woman protested but in the end she 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.780
 accepted 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.970
 the little piglet who had hidden 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.480
 under the chair of his father had everything 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480
 heard 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.630
 tomorrow morning he went to the edge of the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.159
 stream and pick up at pebbles 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.390
 whites that they stuff into his pockets 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.270
 then he goes back to the parents took away 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.490
 children in a dark forest on 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.810
 woodcutter began to cut wood then 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.299
 suddenly he runs away with his wife years 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.920
 worker in only the children began to 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.380
 cry 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.659
 but the little piglet followed the pebbles 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.009
 that he had sown on the way and he 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.009
 brought his brothers home 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.890
 father and mother were very happy 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.720
 to revisit them all the more as the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.410
 lord of the village had sent them 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.360
 money but the joy will last as long as 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.140
 Rat money 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.730
 soon misery comes back and parents 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.880
 decided again to lose their 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.180
 child they talked about it slowly 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.120
 warm weather but that did not prevent 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.880
 the little one to hear them 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.730
 the next day of water he got up to go 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.030
 pick up pebbles 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.010
 the door was closed he was trying 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.420
 to think when his mother gave him a 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:43.850
 piece of bread he had an idea I'm going 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.850
 to throw on the way of the crumbs of not 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.510
 parents coach the kids in 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.920
 the darkest place in the forest 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.629
 then they fled the little puffet 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.030
 thought he could find his way 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:01.090
 like the first time but the crumbs 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.990
 had gone the birds had all 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.460
 eat 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.580
 soon soon the children were lost 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.250
 the night then came the little poucet 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.690
 climbed up a tree and he saw a 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.680
 little glow by following this light 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.040
 children arrive air in front of a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.040
 House 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.730
 he was knocking on the door and a woman is going 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.560
 open to them we are lost says the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.640

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.390
 tomorrow 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.250
 barely the brothers were they enter 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.810
 and we will not make big shots at the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.810
 door 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.880
 the order was back quickly the woman 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.230
 hid the seven brothers under the bed and 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:02.620
 open it 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.620
 [Music] 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.890
 It smells of fresh meat in ilog 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.350
 sniffing everywhere he's entitled to the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.570
 lido where he pulled the seven brothers he 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.000
 was already taking out his knife when his wife 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.690
 said what do you want to do on time 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.580

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.360
 and then you still have meat for 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.270
 supper 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.069
 the ogre nodded and the woman led 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.830
 the seven brothers in a room where there 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:34.740
 had two big beds the first was 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.129
 occupied by the seven girls of the ogre the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.560
 second was intended for them on entering 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.629
 little piglet had noticed that the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.539
 girls of the ogre all wore 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:48.560
 gold crown on the head 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.560
 that will give him an idea 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.890
 the ogre can always change his mind and 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:00.230
 decided to eat us he says to himself then he 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.690
 stood up and took the caps of his 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.810
 brothers who put it on the heads of 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.460
 girls of the ogre he laid the crown 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:15.250
 on the heads of his brothers is his 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:17.710
 at midnight the ogre woke up he entered 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.889
 in the room and approached the bed where 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.280
 were the seven brothers he was sleeping all 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.530
 except the little puffet who was scared when 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.490
 the ogre fight to the head as he had 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.490
 to his other brothers 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:40.190

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.920
 the crowns I was going to fool myself he has 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:48.290

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.680
 With one blow he cut the throats of his 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.690
 girls 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.690

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.390
 petit poucet heard the ogre snore he 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.640
 woke up to his brothers and without a sound 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.840
 they left the house and run away 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.850
 in the night the next day when 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.920

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.620
 the seven brothers were near 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:47.039
 their father when they saw the ogre 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.069
 who jumped from mountain to mountain 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:53.800
 so he hides under a hollow rock 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:58.419
 and the tired ogre lay down by chance 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.889
 against the same rock he fell asleep on 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.949
 petit poucet tells his brothers to go 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:06.460

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:10.000
 alone he approached the ogre and 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:13.270
 gently gently he took away 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.700
 his boots and the myths at his feet 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.350
