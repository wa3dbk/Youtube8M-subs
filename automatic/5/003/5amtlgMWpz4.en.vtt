00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.630
 be difficult to make the right choice 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.590
 I am happy to give you some tips to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.660
 I would like to start by pointing out the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.769
 seniorweb computer selector 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.920
 members of seniorweb can the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.400
 use computer selector on 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.660
 www.seniorweb.nl 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.660
 slash computer selector 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.550
 the computer selector helps you determine what 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.349
 the best fits you a desktop one 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.489
 laptop or tablet 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.930
 in addition, the computer selector gives 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.760
 points of attention that you can pay attention to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.380
 when purchasing, for example, some of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.460
 processor and who should sit or how 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.460
 the memory must be large 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.519
 you have to choose an advice from the computer 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.539
 or do you already know what kind of computer you have 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.829
 want to buy then you can go to the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.000
 computer store 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.870
 I will now show you where in the store 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.870
 can pay attention to when purchasing 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.210
 we start a desktop at the des tops 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.649
 consists of a computer case one 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.869
 screen and keyboard and a mouse 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.759
 to save space you can opt for 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.710
 a smaller computer case or one 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.270
 screen and computer in one 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.560
 if you have a good screen at home or 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.970
 you don't have to have a keyboard 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.340
 to be purchased separately 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.360
 that saves a lot in costs most 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.069
 des are provided with it 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.250
 operating system windows 8 or 8 mine 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.250
 toe 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.579
 Apple computers have 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.179
 hours10 is the latest version thereof 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.220
 mavericks 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.170
 determine for yourself which operating system 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.670
 you find more comfortable 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.500
 Then remember that Apple's computers are over 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.729
 generally something more expensive and that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.649
 the screen can mirror something 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.240
 But the advantage is that it 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.890
 operating system simpler and 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.119
 Safer is the benefit of it 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.369
 windows computers 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.659
 is that you do not have more choice in software 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.520
 every store has 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.990
 choice between windows and apple computers 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.270
 to compare sweeter than to 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.829
 multiple stores 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.329
 See what good connections 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.220
 the computer includes peripherals such as 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.780
 the keyboard and mouse are often used 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.190
 connected via usb 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.430
 So check if his computer is enough 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.709
 USB ports has the newest fastest 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.209
 version is usb 3 point 0 that you recognize 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.519
 the blue connection 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.130
 You can use USB type 0 and 2 point 0 through 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.780
 use each other 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.239
 new monitors are connected with 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.310
 an HDMI cable and the elderly often with one 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.510
 dvi cable 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.600
 you can also pay attention or a computer 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.489
 has a cd dvd burner and possibly or 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.660
 there are slots for the memory card 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.639
 also check which software will be 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.290
 included and whether it is in Dutch 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.970
 finally LED on what is in the price 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.239
 included as display the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.019
 keyboard and operating system 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.220
 when choosing between different 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.930
 There are also a number of laptops 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.280
 points for attention it is especially important 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.269
 it the led on the dimensions and it 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.470
 weight 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.970
 If you work a lot at home, it is a big deal 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.560
 Display pleasant when often it 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.989
 Then take a small and light one 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.310
 variant handy just add to the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.389
 laptop in the store 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.530
 Remember that the battery is often 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.940
 so it has been removed that in 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.940
 reality will be slightly heavier 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.510
 also try out the keyboard 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.440
 to feel if it feels good to you and 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.060
 watch the screen 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.650
 do you like working it is great 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.650
 enough and it doesn't mirror too much 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.620
 also something to watch out for are the 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.110
 connections because there are over it 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.060
 generally less on a desktop and this one 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.100
 laptop a cd dvd burner but that 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.870
 is often not the case 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.700
 finally you can pay attention to which 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.920
 software is included and or that 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.810
 is in Dutch 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.040
 finally you can opt for a tablet 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.140
 also when choosing to play a tablet 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.490
 in the weight of the formats roll er 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.140
 tablets in different sizes and 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.490
 depending on what you will do with it 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.490
 choose the one that suits you best 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.490
 hold the tablet for a moment to determine 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.780
 lies comfortably in the hand 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.670
 You will often use the tablets for a long time 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.930
 in your hands 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.210
 pay attention to how much power it costs 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.620
 to hold the tablet upright 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.430
 if the balance is not good it costs a lot 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.510
 power and energy are also important 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.320
 the difference between the tablets is it 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.959
 operating system 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.940
 You can choose from iOS for Apple Android 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.660
 and windows 8 the prices are running 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.660
 stronger toe 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.350
 the operating system affects 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.130
 how the tablet works use the tablet 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.130
 then also in the store 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.710

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.240

 ask in the store for more 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.000
 information or for help and then forget 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.020
 not to ask about the warranty
