different system or organs through the
different<00:00:27.539> icons<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.289> for<00:00:28.529> example<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.039> can

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
different icons so for example you can

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.279 
different icons so for example you can
click<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> heart<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:31.080> you'll<00:00:31.260> be

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
click on the heart and then you'll be

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.830 
click on the heart and then you'll be
able<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.920> select<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:32.730> valvular<00:00:33.149> disorders

now<00:01:56.369> what's<00:01:56.820> happening<00:01:57.299> when<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.600> located

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
now what's happening when it is located

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.319 
now what's happening when it is located
and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.159> he<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.729> explain<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> his

and then of course he can explain to his

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.600 
and then of course he can explain to his
client<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.520> treatment<00:02:02.520> options

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
client what are the treatment options

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.899
