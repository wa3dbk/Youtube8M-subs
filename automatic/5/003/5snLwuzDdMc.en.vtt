pause<00:00:20.250> hands<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.300> some<00:00:21.539> regard<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.990> feel<00:00:22.260> so

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
pause hands but in some regard I feel so

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
pause hands but in some regard I feel so
much<00:00:22.619> more<00:00:22.680> relaxed<00:00:23.580> maybe<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.480> just

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
much more relaxed maybe because I'm just

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.300 
much more relaxed maybe because I'm just
used<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> us<00:00:25.109> being<00:00:25.140> underdogs<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.220> that

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
used to us being underdogs and all that

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.189 
used to us being underdogs and all that
sounds<00:00:26.580> daft<00:00:26.789> when<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> Liverpool

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
sounds daft when you know the Liverpool

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.810 
sounds daft when you know the Liverpool
because<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.740> such<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> massive<00:00:29.070> club<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.699> we

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
because it's such a massive club do we

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.420 
because it's such a massive club do we
are<00:00:29.970> boy<00:00:30.320> not<00:00:31.320> leading<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.009> pack<00:00:32.219> with

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
are boy not leading the pack with

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.250 
are boy not leading the pack with
Liverpool<00:00:32.820> over<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.899> last<00:00:33.960> quarter

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
Liverpool over the over the last quarter

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.600 
Liverpool over the over the last quarter
of<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> century<00:00:34.649> we've<00:00:34.829> never<00:00:35.010> made<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.340> easier

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
of a century we've never made it easier

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850 
of a century we've never made it easier
so<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.719> we're<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
so so if we're going to do it then it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 
so so if we're going to do it then it's
going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.969> last<00:00:39.149> game<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
going to be on the last game of the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
going to be on the last game of the
season<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.460> out

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
season so I think we just get to go out

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
season so I think we just get to go out
and<00:00:41.760> play<00:00:42.510> our<00:00:42.719> play<00:00:43.050> our<00:00:43.170> game<00:00:43.410> /<00:00:43.620> football<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and play our play our game / football a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.290 
and play our play our game / football a
bit<00:00:44.219> more<00:00:44.370> pressure<00:00:44.550> free<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.120> just

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
bit more pressure free which I'm just

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.940 
bit more pressure free which I'm just
really<00:00:45.930> looking<00:00:45.960> forward<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> there's<00:00:46.770> no

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
really looking forward to there's no

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
really looking forward to there's no
chance<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.789> deep<00:00:47.910> using<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> take<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> easy

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
chance so deep using to take it easy

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.290 
chance so deep using to take it easy
either<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.500> at<00:00:49.620> all<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.550> we

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
either is there not at all we know we we

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.610

love playing home games there's a good

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170 
love playing home games there's a good
apps<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.980> itself<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:53.940> become<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
apps for itself I think it's become a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.490 
apps for itself I think it's become a
nice<00:00:54.360> places<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> lot<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.079> teams<00:00:55.289> don't

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
nice places where a lot of teams don't

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.459 
nice places where a lot of teams don't
really<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.100> come<00:00:56.280> anymore<00:00:57.320> Rodgers<00:00:58.320> make

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
said they already play like that at all

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
does a lot of Thrones I haven't seen
that<00:01:11.549> no<00:01:11.880> one's<00:01:12.030> good<00:01:12.180> enough<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that no one's good enough to do that I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
that no one's good enough to do that I
would<00:01:13.590> ever<00:01:13.680> play<00:01:13.890> long<00:01:14.070> ball<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
would ever play long ball because I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.010 
would ever play long ball because I
don't<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:15.030> any<00:01:15.299> sort<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> cloggers

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
don't really have any sort of cloggers

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
don't really have any sort of cloggers
or<00:01:16.140> any<00:01:16.259> big<00:01:16.439> lads<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.580> direct<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
or any big lads so it's more direct and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.480 
or any big lads so it's more direct and
it's<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> wings<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.799> i<00:01:19.890> think

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's more down the wings but i think

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.999 
it's more down the wings but i think
that<00:01:20.820> people<00:01:21.360> might<00:01:21.630> even<00:01:21.840> use<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.290> maybe<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that people might even use that maybe is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
that people might even use that maybe is
a<00:01:23.040> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.400> team<00:01:23.610> tool<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.119> his<00:01:24.210> lads<00:01:24.450> but

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
a kind of a team tool for his lads but

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
a kind of a team tool for his lads but
they'll<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.470> last<00:01:25.830> home<00:01:26.070> game<00:01:26.100> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
they'll be up for it last home game of

play play a bit more sort of
pragmatically<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.970> suppose<00:02:24.300> that's<00:02:24.570> when<00:02:24.870> our

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
pragmatically I suppose that's when our

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.320 
pragmatically I suppose that's when our
limitations<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.280> back<00:02:26.490> start<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.060> sort<00:02:27.270> of
