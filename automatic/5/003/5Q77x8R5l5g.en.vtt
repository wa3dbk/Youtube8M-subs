00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.450
 if I wanted to give you a lot of argument 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.910
 important that precisely represents the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 base of intimacy in fact if not 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.389
 understands this topic will then be 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.950
 difficult to understand all the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.750
 other topics as it represents 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.940
 just the base of the pyramid on which one is 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.710
 the other topics are regulated is a 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 very simple topic we see immediately 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.699
 essentially we will not talk about this 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.769
 sequence that is of matter 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.300
 of the act by the element from the wall into 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.420
 that of the compound 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.640
 let's see in detail some helium 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.469
 representing automata such as i 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 little animals to be more fun more 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.329
 easy to take without it will always be 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.190
 followed formula we have some atoms 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.960
 important like coal to oxygen 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.030
 nitrogen hydrogen 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.250
 will be what needs to be remembered before 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.460
 all but not the whole material 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.910
 disease is composed of tommy then 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.559
 the most fundamental unit is the most 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.000
 small part of the matter is 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.160
 represented by the car but for those 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.140
 reason why over practically the atom 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.870
 you ca n't go anywhere else 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.689
 the atom is indivisible therefore this 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.150
 must be clear right away that 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.930
 what the atoms do among the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.820
 atoms on virtually able precisely 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.549
 of form in the elements what it is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.549
 the element to the element in a substance 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.409
 practically made up of all atoms 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.630
 equal to each other 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.710
 so you can see for example 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 precisely hydrogen together nitrogen oxygen 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.860
 and then the carbon element coals 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.810
 really killed in the message 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.890
 of the hydrogen element what is needed 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.539
 to remember 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.689
 from this point of view it is necessary 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.689
 remember this then the element can 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.270
 appearing in various forms can be 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.119
 in fact diatonic atomic hand I pulled 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.280
 therefore only one atom is also 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.860
 however an element that can exist 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.409
 also in the form the tunic for example 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.500
 Genoa player we breathe level 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.039
 atmospheric e or two i.e. and oxygen 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.039
 biatomic note therefore this is one 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:09.149
 key feature what 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.709
 happens two foods the atoms of the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.920
 so this is the element 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.690
 hydrogen the atom of the hydrogen element 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.120
 as well as for example the album 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.890
 nice addition or auto mo 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.980
 of the element with the car 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.380
 the carbon event fuse together for 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.390
 form what to form molecules 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.519
 what are molecules to non-molecules 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.560
 I'm another who has practically 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.989
 the association of hydrogen for example 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.100
 with nitrogen which as expected reforms to 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.829
 example what 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.959
 ammonia as well as c for example 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.489
 the carbon talks so do n't let yourself 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.209
 can be there to reform the world chooses 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.160
 of karamoja 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.180
 just as they could do for example 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.250
 one out of two Russians who don't 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.760
 therefore this is precisely a characteristic 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.469
 therefore important what will happen to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.230
 jesi but mind that just the echoes 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.450
 forms give the compound how to predict 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.930
 so I tell you what is made up of so many 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.900
 molecules formed from what by cutting me 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.010
 of the bounds bound together therefore that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.099
 what is the compound 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.250
 practically the compound is given by 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.599
 union of automata for example nitrogen 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.790
 hydrogen carbon with elements carbon 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.950
 different then the hydrogen atoms 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.030
 the atoms of the area are read for 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.220
 form the compound what it is and then 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.790
 instead the molecule the molecule 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.019
 represents the smallest part precisely 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.200
 of the compound precisely which has all the 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.349
 characteristics of the same 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.829
 compound then remember this 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.079
 essential feature right away 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.540
 so what needs to be remembered 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.940
 we must remember this then the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.310
 molecule is the smallest part of the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.250
 composed therefore the smallest part of the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.720
 compound and the molecule the smallest 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.389
 part precisely the prelate element but the 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.489
 the smallest part of the matter is the car 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:10.069
 so this must be clear since 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.629
 assume now that you fix the concept 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.389
 even better we see in detail 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.400
 some backward features 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.549
 that is starting from the compost to go 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.639
 right up to the side of us all 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.069
 we have as you can see here 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.150
 water then we have the water that will see 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:31.150
 what is formed on 90 practically by 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.789
 just as many molecules as you can 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.979
 see and then we will find the compound again 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.469
 and the molecule as with its moult 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.469
 format and what from so many precisely 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:43.840
 atoms of the element sicet anti atoms 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.699
 of the hydrogen element bonded together 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.520
 then the point icon that the molecule 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:51.310
 is made up of different atoms between 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.749
 they therefore auto different elements 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.909
 we are going to see the event 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.830
 we will later find precisely 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.870
 lot but so these are the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.289
 main features he needs 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:06.250
 remember fundamental no sequence that is 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.370
 just a basic feature of the 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.080
 to one compound molecules element the most 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.729
 little part of the compost is not that 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.830
 the smallest part of the event e 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.439
 where the smallest part in fact 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.060
 therefore, these are the subject matter 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:23.710
 are the key features that 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.529
 You must also remember why all 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.180
 similar we liked it I regret the 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.800
 schemes of my channel to always be 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.139
 updated because there are other videos 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.520
 important thing 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.190
 what you have to do 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.090
 follow me on twitter subscribe to channel e 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.770
 there is no more support seen on facebook 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.659
 puts you all the description 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.020
 characteristics of a topic 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.340
 especially the link to do the tests 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.460
 I'll wait for you at the next one 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.460
 topic
