00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 you too find the art incomprehensible 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.359
 from contemporary don't worry 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.010
 because adult's thinks about it from today to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.719
 solve his problems today 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.179
 we will start to analyze a lot of work 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.950
 very famous that the guernica of picasso 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.990
 let's start by saying that the work is 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.820
 preserved in the Reina museum 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.650
 sofia of madrid and that hits 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.619
 very much for the great visual impact 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.810
 that triggers everyone who looks at her 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.140
 in fact a good three and a half meters in height 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.510
 and almost eight meters wide and you know 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.279
 what is the most surprising thing 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.880
 picasso painted it in no time 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.680
 in fact it took us to create everything 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.420
 how much the work the whole picture 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.280
 only five weeks 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.559
 if you need to support a query 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.180
 on the picasso guernica are fine ti 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.079
 also remember why 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 picasso painted it we are in 1937 a 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 very very difficult year for the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.860
 European politics in fact in that year 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.949
 for example the civil war raged 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.020
 Spanish and will remain to speak carried out 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.300
 the rearmament of the German army 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.949
 at the same time, however, in Paris, yes 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.689
 he had to inaugurate an event 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.450
 very important artistic that it was 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.130
 international arts exhibition 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.430
 and the techniques and for this 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.799
 Picasso exposure was called for 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.600
 create a large large painting 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.299
 dimensions inside the pavilion 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.759
 Spanish Picasso, however, could not find immediately 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.680
 a suitable subject for this painting 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.850
 until April 28, 1937 one 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.360
 tragedy 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.390
 happens in the Spanish territories in fact a 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.850
 bombardment by some forces 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.189
 international fascists not strongly 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 actually wanted by franc franc franc 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.909
 to the governor of the sparse spain to 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.110
 soil the Basque town of Guernica 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.690
 causing 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.610
 bad dead and picasso understands them that 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.590
 the painting he would have created for 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.900
 international exposure would be 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.820
 was the answer to this act 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.840
 truly unworthy of his 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.030
 Guernica country is a historical picture but 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.190
 be careful because a historical framework does not 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.650
 because it represents a historical fact but it is 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.970
 in considered that because in reality it is 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.130
 a historical fact 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.560
 the often generation of this work 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.300
 because it is the first attempt by 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.050
 part of an exponent of the culture who 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.190
 in this case it is precisely picasso of 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.459
 face the inter intervene 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.650
 within the political world and let's say 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.720
 that this was the starting gear 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.120
 for many other artists in the future 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 will put pressure on governments for 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.900
 defense of democracy and freedom 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.160
 of its citizens 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.770
 let's now analyze the composition 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.900
 proceeding from left to right 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.300
 the first figure we find is that of 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.730
 a desperate woman who holds her own 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.150
 arms his son a child now 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.430
 died on the look said a vigil 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.459
 bull symbol of a spain spain 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.870
 destroyed by this tragedy 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.239
 continuing in the middle under a lamp 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.370
 electric we find a horse instead 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.980
 horse neighing him too and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.230
 desperate and desperate and just for 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.360
 what had just happened in the place 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.640
 in which 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.740
 the new defense in which the horse is 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.480
 symbol of all humanity in reality of 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.100
 all humanity before tragedies 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.870
 this type is absolutely 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.090
 suffering 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.440
 continuing in the foreground at the bottom of the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.480
 first floor at the bottom we find a 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.090
 dead warrior symbol of soldiers 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.550
 Spanish Republicans fallen in the war 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.770
 next to the soldier a woman flees from 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.350
 this error while another up 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.870
 female figure holds in her hands a 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.510
 lamp a lamp that lit with the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.310
 its light wants to illuminate inside 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.290
 of silence, silence 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.240
 finally to the extreme right we have 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.760
 the most dramatic image of the whole 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.010
 painted in a burning building one 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.820
 woman despairs and extends her arms to 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.830
 sky 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.590
 last point because the guernica of 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.540
 picasso shows no color in 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.850
 Picasso actually made several attempts 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.890
 to introduce it but preferring later 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.140
 the use of little shades 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.709
 deviating from black from white and 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.690
 some shades of blue and brown 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.090
 picasso then what does purification come from 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.769
 abundant eliminates all frills 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.430
 in favor instead of a balance of one 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:16.250
 rather pure and rather clean form 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.280
 that it aimed to enhance strength e 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.769
 the essentiality of this painting is the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.900
 color doesn't really seem like there 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.970
 may it have been if you then observe pinto 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.310
 actually it seems that he is gone 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.560
 so that it has been swept away 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.350
 in the same way that this is huge 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.810
 tragedy has wiped out life and the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.490
 nature of the city â€‹â€‹of guernica 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.450
 finally we can conclude by emphasizing 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.919
 as a picasso, I didn't want to 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.040
 to paint a picture that narrates a 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.500
 historical fact but picasso wanted in 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.150
 really really strong way that 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.460
 whoever had ever been in front 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.620
 the guernica would have sensitized the 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.930
 his conscience in such a way as to 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.240
 feel responsible for whatever 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.380
 another tragic event that could have happened 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.380
 happen in your country
