 of opportunities 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.300
 even from a serious crisis can be learned 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.490
 The benefit is reported in the us series 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.179
 loud hacker attacks on large 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.460
 of the company 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.350
 led to a sharp increase in demand for 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.630
 insurance against such attacks for just 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.820
 several years of cyber risk insurance 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.340
 turned into a market which is valued 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.529
 at 2 billion dollars and as expected 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 after hacker attack on sony company 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.740
 pictures entertainment 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.149
 this figure will grow in geometric 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.920
 progression 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.899
 information leaks not only 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.239
 compromise the company well and it is worth 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.250
 big money according to some of the damage 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890
 which a major cyber attack can inflict 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.930
 companies range from 9 to 100 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.059
 million dollars especially when 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.610
 hundreds of millions of data leak 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.460
 customers so it was for example in the case of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.129
 attacks on target home depot and dj pi 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.840

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.430
 cyber risk will help lawyer them 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.690
 researchers eliminate the consequences 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.369
 such attacks and retaliate against 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.860
 Some critics argue that the authorities 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.200
 intentionally inflate the atmosphere of fear from 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.659
 hypocritical considerations they hope 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.939
 gain material gain and impose 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.009
 certain actions i think that 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.939
 cyber risk insurance thing itself 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.799
 not bad 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.259
 however it seems to me that this situation 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.150
 much unleash the media and the establishment 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.600
 to promote the ideas he needs 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.729
 especially the idea that the us corporations and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.409
 the west is generally subject to attacks from 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.880
 Chinese side 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.680
 North Korean or other hackers 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.500
 an atmosphere of fear is created which is nothing 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.270
 not different from the atmosphere of fear 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.399
 spawned by the war on terror if we 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.680
 will fear every muslim or 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 the hacker then we become controlled and we will 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 believe what tells us 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.829
 the government however is not American 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.020
 authorities are not corporations can not say 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.110
 how to prevent future hackers 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.149
 attacks probably that's why insurance 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.670
 from the consequences of already committed as well 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.860
 quickly becoming the norm 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.860
