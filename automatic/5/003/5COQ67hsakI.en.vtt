 modified in this game Characters 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.629
 psp that's why it looks like a little bad 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.489
 but the best thing about this is that 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.619
 we have the transformation of our 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.350

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.589
 can not even get in psp actors 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.860
 that no longer exists can only be achieved 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.900
 well with a modified iso that I for 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.290
 Of course, do not give it in the description 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.770
 ok since I do not support then 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.320
 let's say piracy my channel is worth not me 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.409
 like to agree 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.390
 well just as you can see, that's 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.670
 a modification of the iso file as 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.280
 You see in the main menu as well 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.880
 change what the images are 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.409
 even in addition to change then here 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.990
 visually as you can see there the goku with the 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.720
 blue hair that is beautiful the truth 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.690
 it's really cool and good, so now 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.780
 play the turn to shout, you are going to see 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:43.920
 the freezer in gold and purple 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.920
 agreement the supposedly definitive 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.729
 and transformation of agreement and good 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.290
 I just wanted to bring it so that 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.960
 I saw since it's a pretty 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.810
 curious good to make this work 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.340
 also you need the data safe 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.770
 modified good not modified but with 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.659
 everything happened in agreement so that so 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.759
 those new characters appear to us already 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.470
 that if we do not have a 6 data we do not 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.539
 the characters will appear according to 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.580
 much that you have the modified iso if 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.200
 you do not pass the whole game you will not have 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.459
 the characters and if you do not have the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.620
 characters you will not have the 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.750
 according transformations such as 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.130
 are therefore the same transformations 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.480
 but modified accordingly is 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.730
 simply by changing the image 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.160
 as you see then there now freezer is 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.440
 transform becomes golden and 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.480
 purple and the truth that is gorgeous 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.250
 Well, nothing left you with a 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.959
 bit of gameplay I hope that I have 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.819
