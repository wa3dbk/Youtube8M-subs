overview of how it works this is an

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.529 
overview of how it works this is an
old-school<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.440> Nelson<00:00:17.279> PC<00:00:17.940> 100

verse<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.960> arm<00:00:22.289> right<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:22.740> comes<00:00:23.039> down

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
verse is this arm right here comes down

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.040 
verse is this arm right here comes down
in<00:00:23.340> front<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> stream<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.390> reverse<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
in front of the stream to reverse it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.650 
in front of the stream to reverse it
back<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:25.949> instead<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
back in this way instead of going the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
back in this way instead of going the
same<00:00:27.869> speed<00:00:27.900> both<00:00:28.349> ways<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> can

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
same speed both ways and then as you can

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.710 
same speed both ways and then as you can
see<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.609> arm<00:00:29.820> right<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.269> drives<00:00:30.539> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
see this arm right here just drives it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.310 
see this arm right here just drives it
clockwise<00:00:31.170> our<00:00:31.619> forward<00:00:31.980> slowly<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.170> then<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
clockwise our forward slowly and then it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.830 
clockwise our forward slowly and then it
trips<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.860> cam<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:36.480> soon<00:00:36.690> as

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
trips on this cam right here as soon as

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.650 
trips on this cam right here as soon as
it<00:00:36.960> drops<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.380> from<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.620> stream<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:39.300> holds<00:00:39.600> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it drops it from that stream it holds it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299 
it drops it from that stream it holds it
there<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.930> comes<00:00:40.079> back<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.559> disengages<00:00:41.190> on

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
there it comes back and disengages on

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.270 
there it comes back and disengages on
that<00:00:41.430> cam<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.800> basically<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.040> old

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that cam so this is basically the old

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.130 
that cam so this is basically the old
way<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.579> doing<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.750> outdated

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
way of doing it and they it's outdated

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.299 
way of doing it and they it's outdated
and<00:00:46.710> they've<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> better<00:00:47.309> design<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
and they've got a better design now and

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.750 
and they've got a better design now and
anyway<00:00:50.660> it's<00:00:51.660> got<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.620> believe<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.370> point

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
anyway it's got a I believe it's a point

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.069 
anyway it's got a I believe it's a point
seven<00:00:54.420> inch<00:00:54.719> nozzle<00:00:55.350> which<00:00:56.340> equates<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> about

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
seven inch nozzle which equates to about

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.080 
seven inch nozzle which equates to about
150<00:00:58.079> gallons<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> minute<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:59.100> water<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.940> that's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
150 gallons a minute of water and that's

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.569 
150 gallons a minute of water and that's
at<00:01:00.210> about<00:01:00.390> 50<00:01:00.719> psi<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:02.250> got<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> little

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
at about 50 psi it's got a little

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.729 
at about 50 psi it's got a little
spreader<00:01:02.940> nozzle<00:01:03.359> down<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.840> for

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
spreader nozzle down in there for

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
spreader nozzle down in there for
covering<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.339> filling<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.240> closer

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
covering it you know filling in closer

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.460 
covering it you know filling in closer
to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> gun<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.659> guess<00:01:10.049> I'll<00:01:10.200> show<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.380> my

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
to the gun and I guess I'll show you my

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.969 
to the gun and I guess I'll show you my
little<00:01:10.650> setup<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:12.060> pacer

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
little setup here this is a little pacer

gasoline engine powered pump it came I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.310 
gasoline engine powered pump it came I
believe<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:17.040> trying<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.400> apply<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:19.229> is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
believe I'm trying to apply and this is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.649 
believe I'm trying to apply and this is
what<00:01:19.470> delivers<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.799> water<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> pond<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
what delivers the water from the pond to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.990 
what delivers the water from the pond to
the<00:01:21.750> gun<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> little<00:01:23.580> six<00:01:23.820> horse

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the gun and it's got a little six horse

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.550 
the gun and it's got a little six horse
Briggs<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:25.580> two<00:01:26.580> inch<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.180> out<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
Briggs on it two inch in and out and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.499 
Briggs on it two inch in and out and
like<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.829> say<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.850> pump<00:01:30.180> puts

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
like I say and I think this pump puts

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
like I say and I think this pump puts
out<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.350> hundred<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.340> ninety<00:01:32.640> five

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
out about a hundred and ninety five

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200 
out about a hundred and ninety five
gallons<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.689> minute<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.799> about<00:01:35.040> 55<00:01:35.430> psi<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
gallons a minute at about 55 psi this is

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
gallons a minute at about 55 psi this is
maximum<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.869> I've<00:01:37.290> got<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.710> backed

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
maximum but I've got I kind of backed

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.649 
maximum but I've got I kind of backed
off<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.030> thing<00:01:39.240> oh<00:01:40.369> well<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.659> guess

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
off for that thing oh well I guess

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.990 
off for that thing oh well I guess
without<00:01:43.409> further<00:01:43.530> ado<00:01:43.950> I'll<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.310> fire<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> up
