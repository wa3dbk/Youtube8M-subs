chemistry there just probably really

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.279 
chemistry there just probably really
well<00:06:10.470> together

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
well together

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.799 
well together
and<00:06:11.919> then<00:06:12.490> here<00:06:12.669> veo<00:06:12.819> intercepts<00:06:13.419> a<00:06:13.479> pass<00:06:13.509> this

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:13.809

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
defense bench to be like a jerk i guess

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.899 
defense bench to be like a jerk i guess
i<00:06:17.559> can<00:06:17.710> i<00:06:17.740> really<00:06:17.919> like<00:06:18.039> get<00:06:18.339> to<00:06:18.399> do<00:06:18.520> that<00:06:18.639> but

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
i can i really like get to do that but

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.879 
i can i really like get to do that but
it's<00:06:19.330> kind<00:06:19.629> of<00:06:19.659> funny<00:06:19.839> when<00:06:19.990> you<00:06:20.110> intercept

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889
