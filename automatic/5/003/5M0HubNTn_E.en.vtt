two millimeter screws the central one

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.880 
two millimeter screws the central one
which<00:00:46.000> is<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.210> kind<00:00:46.510> of<00:00:46.600> deeper<00:00:47.050> one<00:00:47.230> actually

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
which is a kind of deeper one actually

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.460 
which is a kind of deeper one actually
holds<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.850> two-speed<00:00:49.479> clutch<00:00:49.839> onto<00:00:50.320> this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
holds the two-speed clutch onto this

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.090 
holds the two-speed clutch onto this
shaft<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.629> second<00:00:53.050> one<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.409> see<00:00:53.739> here

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
shaft the second one that you see here

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.660 
shaft the second one that you see here
actually<00:00:54.790> sets<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:56.019> shifting<00:00:56.440> time<00:00:56.680> if<00:00:57.159> you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
actually sets the shifting time if you

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.599 
actually sets the shifting time if you
loosen<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.269> you<00:00:59.260> will<00:00:59.410> get<00:00:59.559> earlier<00:01:00.129> shifting

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
loosen it you will get earlier shifting

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.900 
loosen it you will get earlier shifting
and<00:01:00.789> if<00:01:01.510> you<00:01:01.629> tighten<00:01:01.870> it<00:01:02.199> you<00:01:03.070> will<00:01:03.219> get<00:01:03.429> later

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
and if you tighten it you will get later

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.889 
and if you tighten it you will get later
shifting<00:01:04.830> why<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:05.890> happens<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:07.270> very<00:01:07.539> simple

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
shifting why it happens it's very simple

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.950 
shifting why it happens it's very simple
to<00:01:08.050> understand<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.149> can<00:01:10.420> see<00:01:10.630> we<00:01:10.810> have<00:01:10.929> a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
to understand as you can see we have a

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.230 
to understand as you can see we have a
notch<00:01:11.289> here<00:01:11.619> which<00:01:11.979> actually<00:01:12.190> comes<00:01:12.729> out<00:01:12.940> and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
notch here which actually comes out and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.980 
notch here which actually comes out and
locks<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.470> second<00:01:14.950> gear<00:01:15.160> in<00:01:15.429> its<00:01:15.640> place<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.450> it

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
locks the second gear in its place if it

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.160 
locks the second gear in its place if it
is<00:01:17.110> in<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:18.100> second<00:01:18.490> gear<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.850> moving<00:01:19.240> nothing

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
is in the second gear is moving nothing

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.919 
is in the second gear is moving nothing
is<00:01:20.409> happening<00:01:20.640> only<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.789> first<00:01:22.090> gear<00:01:22.479> which

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
is happening only the first gear which

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.200 
is happening only the first gear which
has<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> one-way<00:01:23.590> bearing<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.250> actually

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
has a one-way bearing in it actually

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.919 
has a one-way bearing in it actually
moves<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:26.289> car<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.060> this<00:01:28.240> gear<00:01:28.479> ratio

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
moves the car because of this gear ratio

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.069 
moves the car because of this gear ratio
car<00:01:29.259> moves<00:01:29.530> slowly<00:01:29.890> but<00:01:30.850> when<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.270> engine<00:01:31.630> rpm

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
car moves slowly but when the engine rpm

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.490 
car moves slowly but when the engine rpm
Rises<00:01:32.759> depending<00:01:33.759> on<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.030> setting<00:01:34.420> on<00:01:34.600> the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
Rises depending on the setting on the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.300 
Rises depending on the setting on the
two-speed<00:01:36.040> gearbox<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:37.570> simple<00:01:38.259> knots<00:01:39.009> will

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
two-speed gearbox this simple knots will

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.490 
two-speed gearbox this simple knots will
actually<00:01:39.759> come<00:01:40.030> out<00:01:40.270> because<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
actually come out because of the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.090 
actually come out because of the
rotational<00:01:42.340> force<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.880> lock<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:44.619> second

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
rotational force and lock the second

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.060 
rotational force and lock the second
gear<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:45.549> its<00:01:46.000> position<00:01:46.390> thus<00:01:47.140> shifting<00:01:47.469> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
gear in its position thus shifting the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.300 
gear in its position thus shifting the
car<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.579> go<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.000> second<00:01:49.390> gear

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
car to go to the second gear

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.270 
car to go to the second gear
well<00:01:51.310> when<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.729> RPM<00:01:52.380> decreases<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:54.070> knotch

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
well when the RPM decreases the knotch

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.429 
well when the RPM decreases the knotch
goes<00:01:54.549> in<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.299> second<00:01:55.659> gears<00:01:55.869> goes<00:01:56.110> free<00:01:56.409> and

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
goes in the second gears goes free and

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.770 
goes in the second gears goes free and
car<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.070> back<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.670> first<00:01:57.850> gear<00:01:58.210> this<00:01:58.630> is

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
car is back on the first gear this is

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.779 
car is back on the first gear this is
how<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:58.960> two<00:01:59.229> speed<00:01:59.530> transmission<00:02:00.039> works<00:02:00.250> now

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
how the two speed transmission works now

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.679 
how the two speed transmission works now
how<00:02:01.060> soon<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.710> knot<00:02:03.430> should<00:02:03.789> come<00:02:04.060> out<00:02:04.270> or

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
how soon this knot should come out or

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.830 
how soon this knot should come out or
how<00:02:05.680> late<00:02:05.979> it<00:02:06.189> should<00:02:06.430> come<00:02:06.640> out<00:02:06.820> is<00:02:07.090> actually

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
how late it should come out is actually

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.710 
how late it should come out is actually
decided<00:02:08.560> by<00:02:09.000> setting<00:02:10.019> this<00:02:11.070> screw<00:02:12.570> tighten<00:02:13.570> it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
decided by setting this screw tighten it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.920 
decided by setting this screw tighten it
and<00:02:14.070> there's<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.160> spring<00:02:15.549> in<00:02:15.790> there<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.450> will<00:02:16.810> be

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and there's a spring in there it will be

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.160 
and there's a spring in there it will be
on<00:02:17.019> full<00:02:17.290> tension<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.670> will<00:02:18.880> be<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.660> it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
on full tension and it will be and it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.530 
on full tension and it will be and it
will<00:02:20.380> take<00:02:20.709> for<00:02:21.489> this<00:02:21.670> notch<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.209> come<00:02:22.390> out

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
will take for this notch to come out

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.289 
will take for this notch to come out
late<00:02:22.810> while<00:02:23.590> loosen<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.250> screw<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
late while loosen this screw and the

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.150 
late while loosen this screw and the
spring<00:02:25.570> will<00:02:25.600> be<00:02:25.780> loose<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.650> notch<00:02:26.920> will

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
spring will be loose and this notch will

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.640 
spring will be loose and this notch will
come<00:02:27.370> out<00:02:27.549> at<00:02:27.820> earlier<00:02:28.570> rpm<00:02:29.109> shifting<00:02:29.530> your

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
come out at earlier rpm shifting your

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.890 
come out at earlier rpm shifting your
car<00:02:29.890> earlier<00:02:30.280> well<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.209> pretty<00:02:31.600> simple

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
car earlier well this is pretty simple

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.640 
car earlier well this is pretty simple
so<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.760> also<00:02:34.060> actually<00:02:34.540> tells<00:02:35.109> us

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
so this also actually tells us

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.270 
so this also actually tells us
to<00:02:35.920> set<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:37.150> speed<00:02:37.480> shifting<00:02:37.930> time<00:02:38.200> earlier<00:02:39.010> or

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
to set to speed shifting time earlier or

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.440 
to set to speed shifting time earlier or
later<00:02:39.840> let's<00:02:40.840> put<00:02:41.170> these<00:02:41.319> things<00:02:41.650> back<00:02:41.980> in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
later let's put these things back in

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.600 
later let's put these things back in
just<00:02:43.450> for<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> while<00:02:46.349> right<00:02:47.349> but<00:02:48.129> this<00:02:48.280> thing<00:02:48.489> is

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
just for a while right but this thing is

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.630 
just for a while right but this thing is

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.550 
use as much force using a little force
you<00:03:25.000> will<00:03:25.090> find<00:03:25.389> it's<00:03:25.659> not<00:03:25.870> moving

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
you will find it's not moving

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.860 
you will find it's not moving
if<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.189> is<00:03:27.280> not<00:03:27.459> moving<00:03:27.849> this<00:03:28.120> means<00:03:28.389> it's<00:03:28.629> not

millimeter hex wrench and see it should

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.559 
millimeter hex wrench and see it should
move<00:03:43.480> easier<00:03:44.169> on<00:03:44.500> little<00:03:45.069> force<00:03:45.400> now<00:03:46.209> if<00:03:46.359> it<00:03:46.449> is

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
move easier on little force now if it is

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.599 
move easier on little force now if it is
moving<00:03:46.900> that's<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.440> right<00:03:47.620> strip<00:03:48.010> now<00:03:48.549> you

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
moving that's the right strip now you

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.210 
moving that's the right strip now you
can<00:03:48.819> either<00:03:48.970> tighten<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.810> or<00:03:50.319> loosen<00:03:50.379> it<00:03:50.980> in

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
can either tighten it or loosen it in

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.949 
can either tighten it or loosen it in
order<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:52.180> set<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.590> shifting<00:03:54.069> time<00:03:54.780> that's<00:03:55.780> it

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
order to set the shifting time that's it

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.799 
order to set the shifting time that's it
that's<00:03:56.440> pretty<00:03:56.680> easy
