00:00:01.093 --> 00:00:05.252
 Hi, I'm Jurek from the Euforia Driver Training Center. 

00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:09.041
 I deal with motorcycle categories. 

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:17.380
 We are starting a new series of trainings, we want to present you Yamaha YBR 125, where after changing the regulations 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:25.639
 you can move in this type with the B category for at least 3 years. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:36.936
 We want to show you whether this bill gives you the opportunity to make a person who super moves great 

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:42.442
 cat. B will be doing well with category A1. 

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:55.857
 So with the popular YAMAHA YBR 125, we will show the first hours of the student who begins and whether after the first hours will be in 

00:00:55.857 --> 00:01:05.020
 able to cope with examination tasks that were previously in force before the change of regulations. 

00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:13.913
 - Hi, my name is Rafał, I already have a driving license category B 6 years, this act has changed, the rules have changed, so 

00:01:13.913 --> 00:01:20.982
 I hope you will be able to see how it looks in practice, because the theory is something completely different. 

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:22.308
 Also keep your fingers crossed. 

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:30.017
 - This is Rafał, we sit on a motorcycle and present how a student with a B driving license 

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:38.015
 he will cope with a 125 cm single-track, I invite you for a demonstration ride. 

00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:40.590
 - I hope I will not kill myself. 

00:01:40.592 --> 00:01:46.140
 From the beginning I will present a motorcycle, first of all we have to sit on a motorcycle. 

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.040
 We put a foot. 

00:01:48.383 --> 00:01:49.530
 We turn the ignition. 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.210
 If you turn the ignition, you should light the green neutral light. 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:05.220
 On the right side is the firing of a motorcycle, the so-called start-up, if it is neutral, we start the motorcycle. 

00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:10.050
 The motorcycle is running, remember - the clutch is on the left. 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.870
 A foot brake under the right leg. 

00:02:13.754 --> 00:02:16.580
 On the right side of the steering wheel, the handbrake. 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.940
 At low speeds we use the foot brake. 

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:23.310
 This does not tilt forward. 

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:29.160
 With hard braking 80% hand brake 20% foot brake. 

00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:39.050
 When we want to start the ride, we move - we give ourselves the first left foot, change the leg to have the opportunity 

00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:44.420
 control of two brakes, i.e. legs and hand. 

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:50.450
 Before starting we make sure that we can start driving, if we do not pose a threat. 

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:58.150
 And smoothing the clutch release causes the motorcycle to start moving, remember that it must be very smooth 

00:02:58.147 --> 00:03:03.780
 moving, please, even without gas, we are able to move on a motorcycle. 

00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:12.140
 Moving causes smooth release of the clutch on 2, 3 meters, not like letting the clutch release immediately, because 

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:16.080
 sudden release of the clutch will cause the motorcycle to turn off. 

00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:24.920
 If we smoothly operate the lever on the left side, we will run smoothly without a gas and the motorcycle will not sway us. 

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:28.100
 So we try to do it. 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.110
 We sit on a motorcycle, put on a foot, start with folding the foot. 

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:39.760
 We give the clutch with the left hand, one, no, no, now the left leg is down, the only one. 

00:03:40.128 --> 00:03:43.170
 Yes, we change the leg to be able to control the brake. 

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:45.630
 And smooth release of the clutch. 

00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:48.600
 Smooth, smooth, good, slowly, yes. 

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:52.840
 As he starts to drive, you must start to withstand this clutch, let it go. 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.060
 Slowly, oh. 

00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:56.670
 Oh, that way. 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.070
 Okay, good, for a leg on the footstool. 

00:04:01.043 --> 00:04:05.600
 Oh ... and now we are just letting go and we are running around like a bicycle. 

00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:07.830
 We are traveling like a bicycle. 

00:04:19.748 --> 00:04:22.740
 Oh, smooth running. 

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:35.120
 These are the beginnings, we have to try, catch the track, try to treat the moped like riding a bicycle. 

00:04:35.592 --> 00:04:40.360
 It's no different in anything, except that it travels much faster. 

00:04:40.953 --> 00:04:49.800
 Riding a motorcycle is more pleasant than riding a bike because of the speed achieved.
