00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.339
 so hello to all of you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.799
 found before you today with 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.290
 a new video that will actually be 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.639
 the continuity of my bun series 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 banana and this time it's going to be a 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.850
 retro banana bun so I thank is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.230
 us for this new intro that I love 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.670
 so you will start by taking a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.680
 comb home to separate your 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.390
 hair you can beforehand 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 give a move to your but if you 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.340
 have a wick on the front and you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.769
 go actually created pay so at most 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.530
 on the top in fact it's really this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.170
 crepe and this hull that is really going 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.570
 give this aspect this retro aspect this 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.850
 side a little vintage to the hairstyle 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.840
 so you do not hesitate to crepe 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.550
 section by section 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.780
 and that's actually what goes 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.520
 to form a hull you will see so 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.730
 then you take in hand pick yourself up 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.730
 slightly 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.600
 then fix yourself with small tongs 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.979
 flat so as usual I 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.240
 used to say but you come across 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.250
 of and you will see that will hold 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.360
 perfectly so there the right side I the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.210
 crep also slightly 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.190
 it's just to have a small volume 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.190
 on the underside and better hold 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.030
 so you keep bringing yourself in 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.890
 does you place your hair at 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.950
 the back as we had done 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.990
 in the previous banana bun and you 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.369
 fixed with small flat pliers you 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.259
 makes them cross like that you do not 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.610
 you do not need much and 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.640
 then you take that part of 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.140
 hair that you and you hide so 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.420
 the more you will have short hair and 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.369
 more is this step will be simple in 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.539
 the more you have the more you have to 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.890
 hair to hide so more is 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.780
 complicated but nothing is impossible so 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.789
 you continue you make sure so 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.340
 than 7th although that rendered that you 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.560
 want and you take a barrette you 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.289
 see the movement bring you back in fact 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 inward then so we go 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.560
 create peace the part do not hesitate to 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.700
 put several small round tweezers at 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.310
 the back so that the banana bun 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.690
 hold yours for forgiveness and there 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.590
 so you take this section of 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.580
 hair that you texture ise slightly 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.080
 so that it is very smooth 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.230
 you can totally take some spray 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.080
 for him to have no small hair and 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.520
 then you put it so that it 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.069
 do it well whether it's more or less 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.530
 pulled symmetrically with the other side of the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.370
 hair and there you do a kind of 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.830
 small circle 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.730
 a kind of little small arms rounded 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.849
 actually to really give this little 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.190
 detail the hairstyle that changes everything and there 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.120
 you do not hesitate you put spray 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.069
 so I have small hair 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.420
 rebels on the side do not hesitate 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.280
 to take a little bit is only for 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.540
 try to tame all that sometimes it's 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.519
 very difficult so there is really a 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.170
 technique has pass underneath and 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.790
 then you put some spray and 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.319
 you do it on your finger and usually 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.760
 it fits for sure and the little ones 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.890
 rebellious hair you do not care are 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.930
 like that 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.819
 so that's the result of my bun 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.590
