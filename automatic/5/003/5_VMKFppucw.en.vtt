00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
little darker because the concealer

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.229 
little darker because the concealer
would<00:01:48.920> just<00:01:49.130> kind<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.369> go<00:01:49.550> into<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.000> little

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:50.239

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.820 
take a little of the concealer and I
just<00:02:07.879> used<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.420> using<00:02:09.140> my<00:02:09.229> finger<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.619> didn't

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
just used it using my finger I didn't

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.930 
just used it using my finger I didn't
use<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> brush<00:02:10.250> or<00:02:10.429> anything<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:12.790> hoping<00:02:13.790> this

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
use a brush or anything and hoping this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.020 
use a brush or anything and hoping this
is<00:02:14.090> not<00:02:14.270> too

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
I took about that much just a little

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.559 
I took about that much just a little
tiny<00:02:19.769> bit<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.040> my<00:02:20.250> finger<00:02:20.610> had<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.060> concealer

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569

tiny bit on my finger had the concealer
on<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:25.010> then<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.610> kind<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.000> rubbed<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.330> in

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
on and then I just kind of rubbed it in

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.650 
on and then I just kind of rubbed it in
a<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:27.780> bit<00:02:28.519> not<00:02:29.519> really<00:02:29.940> putting<00:02:30.269> too<00:02:30.510> much

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
a little bit not really putting too much

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.820 
a little bit not really putting too much
tension<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.380> skin<00:02:31.650> under<00:02:32.099> my<00:02:32.190> eye<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.680> you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
like a concealer brush but to me the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.940 
like a concealer brush but to me the
warmth<00:02:49.110> from<00:02:49.349> my<00:02:50.250> hands<00:02:51.260> really<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.680> helps

the<00:02:53.040> makeup<00:02:53.160> spread<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> lot<00:02:53.970> more<00:02:54.209> evenly<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
the makeup spread a lot more evenly and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.030 
the makeup spread a lot more evenly and
I<00:02:54.900> don't<00:02:55.049> really<00:02:55.290> need<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.620> much<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:58.040> that's

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
I don't really need as much so that's

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.370 
I don't really need as much so that's
why<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.310> eye<00:02:59.549> now<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:00.329> have<00:03:00.599> both<00:03:00.750> eyes<00:03:01.049> all

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
why the eye now we have both eyes all

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.050 
why the eye now we have both eyes all
concealed<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.220> I'm<00:03:02.280> hoping<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.880> can

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
concealed and I'm hoping that you can

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.020 
concealed and I'm hoping that you can
really<00:03:03.540> see<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.900> difference<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:05.220> now<00:03:05.760> I'm

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
really see the difference so now I'm

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.930 
really see the difference so now I'm
just<00:03:06.299> going<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:07.370> put<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> little<00:03:08.640> pressed

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
just going to put a little pressed

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.360 
just going to put a little pressed

powder and there we have me all

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.479 
powder and there we have me all
concealed<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.860> hopefully<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.069> can't<00:03:17.370> really

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489
