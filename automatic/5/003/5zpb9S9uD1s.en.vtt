i<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.250> problem<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> actually

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
i think in that the problem of actually

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
i think in that the problem of actually
did<00:00:54.629> benefit<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> DC<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.280> they've

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
did benefit the DC have is that they've

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.639 
did benefit the DC have is that they've
got<00:00:56.610> couch<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.059> people<00:00:57.360> already<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.960> like

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.689 
because everyone loves arrow so much
just<00:04:43.620> doesn't<00:04:43.860> make<00:04:43.919> any<00:04:43.979> sense<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.669> just

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
just doesn't make any sense to just

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.390 
just doesn't make any sense to just
treat<00:04:45.270> them<00:04:45.419> as<00:04:45.540> separate<00:04:45.870> entities<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:47.070> in

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
treat them as separate entities so in

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.270 
treat them as separate entities so in
the<00:04:47.760> comics<00:04:48.180> they<00:04:48.600> have<00:04:48.990> various<00:04:49.620> spins<00:04:49.949> that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
the comics they have various spins that

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.890 
the comics they have various spins that
you<00:04:50.370> know<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.550> bring<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.910> writer<00:04:51.180> who

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
you know you bring in a writer who

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.150 
you know you bring in a writer who
writes<00:04:52.110> something<00:04:52.440> out<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.680> continuity

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
writes something out of continuity

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.890 
writes something out of continuity
something<00:04:53.610> like<00:04:53.729> animals<00:04:54.300> killing<00:04:54.600> joke

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900

Asylum<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:59.010> think<00:04:59.580> DC<00:04:59.820> cuz<00:05:00.330> they're<00:05:00.539> their

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
Asylum I think DC cuz they're their

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.140 
Asylum I think DC cuz they're their
characters<00:05:01.410> more<00:05:01.560> iconic<00:05:01.979> and<00:05:02.430> more<00:05:02.729> based<00:05:02.940> on

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
characters more iconic and more based on

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.719 
characters more iconic and more based on
God's<00:05:03.479> Greek<00:05:04.229> gods<00:05:04.440> coming<00:05:04.710> through<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.160> think

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
God's Greek gods coming through I think

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.060 
God's Greek gods coming through I think
they<00:05:05.910> can<00:05:05.940> get<00:05:06.240> away<00:05:06.300> more<00:05:06.900> with<00:05:07.620> having<00:05:07.949> that

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
they can get away more with having that

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.500 
they can get away more with having that
approach<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.550> things<00:05:08.760> they<00:05:08.940> can<00:05:09.120> do<00:05:09.300> different

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
approach to things they can do different

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.270 
approach to things they can do different
interpretation<00:05:10.380> things<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.830> like<00:05:10.949> someone

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
interpretation things just like someone

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.830 
interpretation things just like someone
would<00:05:11.940> have<00:05:12.120> like<00:05:12.300> three<00:05:12.630> different

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
would have like three different

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.960 
would have like three different
