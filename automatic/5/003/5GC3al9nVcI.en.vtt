thought

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.740 

get<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:50.600> measure<00:01:50.870> of<00:01:50.990> palay<00:01:52.240> never<00:01:53.240> do<00:01:53.450> stuff

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
get the measure of palay never do stuff

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
get the measure of palay never do stuff
big<00:01:53.930> chances<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:55.970> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
big chances and this is the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
big chances and this is the
phase<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.870> game<00:01:59.020> where<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.290> need<00:01:59.440> a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
phase in the game where you need a

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.320 
phase in the game where you need a
wicked<00:01:59.830> you<00:02:00.280> need<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.670> take<00:02:00.790> that<00:02:00.850> little<00:02:01.180> bit

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
wicked you need to take that little bit

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.750 
wicked you need to take that little bit
of<00:02:01.390> risk<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.890> don't<00:02:03.190> think<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.760> was

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
of risk and I don't think but I was

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.260 
of risk and I don't think but I was
picking<00:02:07.150> sunil<00:02:07.600> shetty<00:02:07.870> I<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:10.030> sunil

over in the meantime the wrong must
quickly<00:02:15.070> complement<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.240> mumbai<00:02:16.480> failures

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
quickly complement the mumbai failures

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.320 
quickly complement the mumbai failures
for<00:02:17.020> moving<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.650> now<00:02:17.890> they're<00:02:18.730> almost<00:02:18.940> just

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
for moving in now they're almost just

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
about 15 yards away that might dry up

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.640 
about 15 yards away that might dry up
bali<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:22.900> were<00:02:22.990> talking<00:02:23.320> about<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.620> a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
bali so we were talking about this a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.470 
bali so we were talking about this a
couple<00:02:23.740> of<00:02:23.950> hours<00:02:24.280> ago<00:02:24.550> they<00:02:25.180> could<00:02:25.330> use

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
couple of hours ago they could use

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.850 
couple of hours ago they could use
another<00:02:25.630> couple<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.140> fielders<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.710> ring

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
another couple of fielders in the ring

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.530 
another couple of fielders in the ring
but<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.220> at<00:02:27.460> least<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.760> ones<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.120> are<00:02:28.300> there

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
but in at least the ones that are there

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.870 
but in at least the ones that are there
and<00:02:28.840> now<00:02:29.470> much<00:02:29.830> closer<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.459> bank<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
and now much closer to the bank so the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.240 
and now much closer to the bank so the
chance<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> poly<00:02:31.660> can<00:02:31.900> dip<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.470> run<00:02:32.620> play

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
chance of the poly can dip and run play

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.240 
chance of the poly can dip and run play
is<00:02:33.310> French<00:02:33.640> cricket<00:02:34.030> I'm<00:02:34.750> now<00:02:35.250> considerably

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
is French cricket I'm now considerably

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.150 
is French cricket I'm now considerably
reduced

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.920 

it's<00:02:39.640> good<00:02:39.820> thinking<00:02:40.180> back<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.450> home<00:02:40.570> values

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
it's good thinking back to home values

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.560 
it's good thinking back to home values
and<00:02:41.380> you're<00:02:42.220> right<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:42.940> could<00:02:43.090> get<00:02:43.330> another

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
and you're right they could get another

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.420 
and you're right they could get another
filter<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.200> make<00:02:44.380> sure<00:02:44.410> thing<00:02:44.830> they<00:02:45.220> keep

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
filter and make sure thing they keep
