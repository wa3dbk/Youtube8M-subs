it not not disturb the water at all and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.730 
it not not disturb the water at all and
I<00:00:18.510> didn't<00:00:18.660> really<00:00:18.779> know<00:00:18.869> how<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.529> I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
I didn't really know how to do this I

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.700 
I didn't really know how to do this I
thought<00:00:19.890> about<00:00:20.100> lining<00:00:20.369> up<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:20.789> buckets

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
thought about lining up some buckets

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.519 
thought about lining up some buckets
some<00:00:22.710> big<00:00:22.859> basically<00:00:23.340> Tupperware<00:00:23.699> buckets

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
some big basically Tupperware buckets

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.200 
some big basically Tupperware buckets
full<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.590> water<00:00:25.859> lined<00:00:26.310> up<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.580> five<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.029> them

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
full of water lined up like five of them

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.580 
full of water lined up like five of them
and<00:00:27.330> they<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:28.019> think<00:00:28.140> that'd<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.439> too

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and they really think that'd be too

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.439 
and they really think that'd be too
great<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.609> then<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> thought<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.060> this

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
great and then I thought about this

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.990 
great and then I thought about this
little<00:00:30.630> area<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.610> let<00:00:32.610> me<00:00:32.669> grab<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
