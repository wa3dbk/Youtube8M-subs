00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.200 
I wanted that middle line to be quite
dark<00:05:28.919> so<00:05:29.010> I<00:05:29.160> just<00:05:29.310> went<00:05:29.400> over<00:05:29.490> that<00:05:29.729> again<00:05:29.970> and

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
dark so I just went over that again and

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.180 
dark so I just went over that again and

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
then after this you're gonna want to

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.969 
then after this you're gonna want to
create<00:05:32.490> little<00:05:32.760> u-shape<00:05:33.630> on<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.560> top<00:05:34.770> of

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
create little u-shape on the top of

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.100 
create little u-shape on the top of
those<00:05:35.430> teeth<00:05:35.880> so<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.389> you<00:05:36.479> can<00:05:36.660> create<00:05:36.930> the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
those teeth so that you can create the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.379 
those teeth so that you can create the
teeth<00:05:37.350> shape<00:05:37.710> with<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.100> white<00:05:38.280> when<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.180> go

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
go on the top a little bit but you can

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.610 
go on the top a little bit but you can
just<00:05:53.639> fill<00:05:53.820> that<00:05:53.850> in<00:05:54.090> with<00:05:54.120> white<00:05:54.500> here<00:05:55.500> I'm

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
just fill that in with white here I'm

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.800

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.950 
going in with my krylon water paint
white<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.470> actually<00:05:59.280> it's<00:05:59.580> pretty<00:05:59.789> opaque<00:06:00.150> I

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
white and actually it's pretty opaque I

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.930 
white and actually it's pretty opaque I
didn't<00:06:01.680> use<00:06:01.770> a<00:06:01.800> lot<00:06:01.889> of<00:06:01.979> water<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.280> just<00:06:02.639> used

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
didn't use a lot of water I just used

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.029 
didn't use a lot of water I just used
more<00:06:03.270> paint<00:06:04.080> rather<00:06:04.349> than<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:04.620> water<00:06:04.800> and

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
more paint rather than the water and

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.040 
more paint rather than the water and
then<00:06:05.669> fill<00:06:06.030> that<00:06:06.180> all<00:06:06.360> in<00:06:06.510> don't<00:06:06.780> worry<00:06:06.840> if<00:06:06.990> you

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
then fill that all in don't worry if you

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.270 
then fill that all in don't worry if you
make<00:06:07.169> mistakes<00:06:07.560> you<00:06:07.650> can<00:06:07.800> go<00:06:07.919> back<00:06:08.070> in<00:06:08.250> with

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
make mistakes you can go back in with

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.100 
make mistakes you can go back in with
the<00:06:08.580> black<00:06:08.910> which<00:06:09.479> actually<00:06:09.840> helps<00:06:10.050> because

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
the black which actually helps because

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.050 
the black which actually helps because
you<00:06:10.349> want<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.710> kind<00:06:11.130> of<00:06:11.250> create<00:06:11.460> a<00:06:11.520> shading<00:06:11.880> too

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
you want to kind of create a shading too

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.850 
you want to kind of create a shading too
so<00:06:12.270> it<00:06:12.389> kind<00:06:12.599> of<00:06:12.630> makes<00:06:12.780> that<00:06:12.960> gray<00:06:13.260> look<00:06:13.590> there

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
so it kind of makes that gray look there

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.320 
so it kind of makes that gray look there
too

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
too

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:46.219
