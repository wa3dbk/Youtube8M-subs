00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
hey guys so it's been a while since I

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.190 
hey guys so it's been a while since I
made<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.399> video<00:01:54.579> so<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.229> little<00:01:57.060> unorganized

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
made a video so I'm a little unorganized

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.410 
made a video so I'm a little unorganized
it's<00:01:59.200> such<00:01:59.580> but<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:00.729> figure<00:02:00.970> it's<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.149> new<00:02:01.270> year

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420

it's such but I figure it's a new year
and<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.829> thought<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.369> should<00:02:03.549> upload<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.149> video<00:02:04.420> at

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
that's really big and that kind of

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.130 
that's really big and that kind of
turned<00:04:00.140> me<00:04:00.260> out<00:04:00.290> but<00:04:00.620> upon<00:04:01.130> opening<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.670> up<00:04:01.730> and

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
turned me out but upon opening it up and

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.180 
turned me out but upon opening it up and
receiving<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.200> actual<00:04:03.470> figure<00:04:03.740> is<00:04:03.770> actually

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
receiving the actual figure is actually

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.160 
receiving the actual figure is actually
not<00:04:04.280> too<00:04:04.430> bad<00:04:05.020> so<00:04:06.020> it<00:04:06.890> looks<00:04:07.040> good<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.840> zippers

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
not too bad so it looks good the zippers

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.630 
not too bad so it looks good the zippers
don't<00:04:09.319> really<00:04:09.590> articulate<00:04:10.069> they're<00:04:10.280> kind<00:04:10.610> of

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
don't really articulate they're kind of

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.550 
don't really articulate they're kind of
like<00:04:10.760> just<00:04:11.000> stuck<00:04:11.209> there<00:04:11.480> no<00:04:11.870> big<00:04:12.020> deal<00:04:12.260> just

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
like just stuck there no big deal just

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.460 
like just stuck there no big deal just
thought<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.250> point<00:04:13.550> out<00:04:13.640> in<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:15.110> base<00:04:15.260> is

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
thought I point out in the base is

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.830 
thought I point out in the base is
fairly<00:04:15.800> boring<00:04:16.100> just<00:04:16.489> has<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.820> be<00:04:16.970> extra<00:04:17.480> I

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
fairly boring just has to be extra I

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.670 
fairly boring just has to be extra I
believe<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.590> was<00:04:18.859> paid<00:04:19.579> extra<00:04:19.910> so<00:04:20.810> but<00:04:21.590> it

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
believe it was paid extra so but it

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.540 
believe it was paid extra so but it
works<00:04:22.660> she<00:04:23.660> just<00:04:23.840> stands<00:04:24.169> on<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.620> think<00:04:25.400> two

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
works she just stands on I think two

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.379 
works she just stands on I think two
picks<00:04:25.820> on<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.480> base<00:04:27.760> but<00:04:28.760> she's

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
picks on to the base but she's

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.600 
picks on to the base but she's
