00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.770
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.689
 video for the geotec hd channel and good 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.570
 as you can see we have opposite 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.060
 of our cameras one of the new 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.029
 terminals of the samsung firm is in 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.060
 this case the galaxy s3 mini the brother 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:23.169
 small one of the best terminals 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.359
 of this year 2012 the s3 of the name I have 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.429
 have to say that I do not like that much 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.429
 called s3000 and they could have given 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.980
 another name since it seems to be 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.109
 pretty bad and that is a waste of the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.820
 family but good is very good 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.800
 first of all let's do a boxing 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.870
 and here we have the box in the part 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.950
 front we would have the phone blank 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.830
 Samsung Galaxy s3 Mini 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.480
 in this side samsung galaxy of 3 mini 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.760
 samsung 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.980
 in the other we have nothing in the part 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.059
 from above to the samsung website 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.120
 but you have in the bottom part 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.150
 the bullshit that all the mobiles bring 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.310
 and also in features the box is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.800
 white but the terminal if not 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.720
 I'm wrong, it 's silver blue, it 's 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.660
 weird and we have the features 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 super amoled screen android comes with 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.330
 yelling 4.1 wifi and here your 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.960
 Features a dual core gigahertz 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.490
 cortex a9 1500 milliamperes battery 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.869
 It is very perdomo and very well 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:36.520
 the price if I'm not mistaken is about 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.500
 250 euros 300 but I recommend it 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.539
 that if they ask you for more than 100 do not 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.460
 you buy because it's not worth much 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.180
 for more than 100 euros 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.180
 well here we would have 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.720
 finish how we get them out of here 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.030
 here we will have it then we will make a 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.030
 review 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.720
 here we go here the typical plastic in 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.020
 where all the phones come from today 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.020
 in day 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.220
 here instruction manuals that do not 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 many people read them and here we would have 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.050
 a pair of headphones 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.750
 not being a brand of these cheap 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.220
 they look pretty good 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.940
 pretty good look here we would have 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.700
 samsung here the call control for 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.340
 go up volume down 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.590
 pretty good looking has these helmets 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 and together with them they bring them here 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.940
 different couplings so that we are 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.510
 be more comfortable in our ears here 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.510
 we would have a usb and microusb cable 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.260
 and here the typical samsung charger already 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.189
 here we have it 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.470
 well the box no longer contains anything 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.120
 more if I'm not wrong I brought a couple of 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.280
 more books but not 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.230
 He has not kept us, I do not have them 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.319
 terminal is not mine have left me 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.170
 borrowed and well this is all that 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.170
 it came in the box and now we will go to 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.970
 make a review of the phone we will tell you 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.870
 our 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.870
 good our opinions is a terminal 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.440
 for those people who are starting or 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.330
 already have an android phone but that 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.060
 wants to take a step to a dual core and a 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.410
 screen so it's called mini but it's not 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.950
 is mini is 4 inches the mini v has 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.390
 3 with 7 so it's not that small but 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.310
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.640
 video that says to like that you 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.190
 subscribe jce and I do not recommend this 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.400
 terminal I liked it a lot and even the 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.400
