00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:06.180
 1 the emissions generated by air and land traffic and by 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.139
 industrial activity in general 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.480
 have been altering the composition of the atmosphere are causing an increase 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.109
 of the global temperature of the earth 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.109
 left 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.000
 yes the polar caps 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.779
 you could completely 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 it would also rise to about nine meters above the current level and the coasts 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.420
 they would retreat inland about 110 kilometers 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.990
 a sudden climate change could represent the extinction of many 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.830
 species 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.740
 however, it must be taken into account that the climate is continuously changing 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.530
 even if the intervention of man 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.510
 Generally, the climatic changes that have occurred in the past have 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.550
 been attentive enough to allow the adaptation of the world 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.550
 biological 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.800
 the theory about climate change and its causes continues to divide the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 scientific community and conservation groups 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.490
 if the trend of the increase in temperatures continue three 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.440
 scientists will have more data to establish their relationship with the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.110
 greenhouse effect and with the emission of certain gases into the atmosphere 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.240
 if so 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.030
 large-scale interventions may be necessary 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.750
 to protect animal and plant species 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.970
 that are threatened by global climate change especially if this 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.970
 change occurs too quickly 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.310
 it seems that the polar ice caps are melting as the glaciers of 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 the mountains 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.359
 which will eventually cause an increase in sea level 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.919
 while it has been predicted in the disappearance under the waters of some 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.919
 islands 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.149
 It is proven that the icy platforms that line the coasts of the 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:27.979
 Antarctic Continent 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:32.109
 happened in the last decades in spite of it the scientists still 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.159
 they have not reached a consensus on what is the ultimate cause of these phenomena 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.189
 It has been observed that the increase in temperatures accelerated the fusion of 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.290
 which has favored the appearance of cracks in the platforms and the 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.379
 detachment of icebergs 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.459
 the scientists have proven a warming of two and a half degrees at 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.060
 over the past 50 years
