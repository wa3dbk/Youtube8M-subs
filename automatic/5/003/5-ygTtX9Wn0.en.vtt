00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.839
 we are almost at the other end of the line now 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.559
 flagpole 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.250
 the 125cc 200 is upgraded it comes 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.020
 also as 390 he with 440 ps so me 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.010
 think the young guys then you can 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.410
 an underestimate if that with it 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.480
 be on the road or that is one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 absolutely reputable expansion stage that is one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.960
 absolutely full-fledged sport motorcycle you 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.109
 have to introduce yourself 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.890
 we are talking about the basic concept of an 8 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.380
 liter chassis the engine is as light as a feather 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:39.480
 stable but we are talking about 140 here 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:44.219
 kilo over well over 40 to 44 ps 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.050
 an absolute statement really nimble and quick 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 live absolutely full and close 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.200
 from our point of view ideally the gap 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.600
 really between that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.030
 boarding at ktm on the street and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.670
 always very potent device again 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.410
 690 accessories are likely then 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.340
 those people there then at 18 one 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.899
 motorcycle in the new driving license class 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.129
 want to drive in Austria and also in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.110
 Germany 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.409
 Do you have it in this new one? 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.260
 apps cashier available for the 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.850
 license freshmen 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.290
 you have to see the vehicle is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 Of course, now also very interesting 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.759
 for this in new driving license regulation 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.040
 does not fall 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.259
 Mr. strict definitions this rule 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.270
 by the fact that the vehicle is in 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.630
 truth is too easy that is 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.180
 this this this 48 ps class 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.149
 we can as with the vehicle the ball 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.390
 do not play but there are of course 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.850
 give appropriate package that was that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.270
 driving in the class 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.200
 can 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.950
 but I definitely say that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.450
 want 93 jug one is extremely for us 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.210
 international product we believe that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.009
 Not only in the vehicle 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.710
 Central Europe are doing well 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.270
 the vehicle will be we are we good 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.340
 Things are good all over the planet 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.869
 because there are thinks 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.849
 Let's talk about it after there is no argument 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.190
 The scooter is fast against the bike 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.979
 good of it is extremely efficient of 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.930
 the costs are very attractive and it can 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.400
 actually really a lot of so 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.420
 what you get for your money is that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.230
 motorcycle in truth pretty much 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.930
 unbeatable 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.940
 and that's why we look at the vehicle 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.519
 longer view really than than 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.959
 huge opportunity for ktm on the globe yet 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.799
 more more asphalt ktm to place it 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.819
 technically this is one thing 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.730
 upgraded 200 and no 690 he 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.859
 So the basis was the small tube st 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.890
 technically it is a first 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.130
 completely new motorcycle where the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.769
 frame concept comes one on one from 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.500
 125 slash 200 the engine is one 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.720
 complete new development has nothing 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.019
 to do more with the 200 the hammer of 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.680
 made sure he did it again 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.519
 on 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.500
 that too keeps what we hope for 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:05.450
 375,390 cubic 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.800
 and must as you have just really almost 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.190
 go forward and out of the single cylinder 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.400
 with just under 400 cubic 45 ps rauszuholen 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.960
 the very very lively come across 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.600
 Nevertheless cheap consumption have that 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.710
 is not so easy task and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.020
 that's why we have the project pretty much 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.980
 seriously we have of course 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.350
 Also in a hoop up the subject of abs 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.910
 applied is also a great effort 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.150
 but that's easy on his 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.070
 motorcycle and that's why engine and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.170
 Chassis since I think I'm extremely good 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.840
 but you must never underestimate 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.510
 It is within our evolution 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.850
 big project but as I said we see 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.310
 also quite a big one for the motorcycle 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.390
 chance in the long run ok then look 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.180
 Maybe we still have the windows 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.310
 were a cylinder antibes he gets 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.300
 now r the winter even longer than 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.300
 this right next
