 receive gas tankers or those that 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.710

 boats that come to make their 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.250
 activities to inlet then of course 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.370
 that are putting themselves at a competitive level 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.979
 guaranteeing internationally 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.190
 the services that are granted for this 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.600
 work that are much safer and are 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.479
 with this investment much more attractive 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 for friends and of course 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.640
 have all the specifications 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.610
 current techniques so that they can be 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.619
 carry out all the maneuvers in one 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.619
 of the bodies that have that floor 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.020
 the general director of merchant marine 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.700
 Alejandro Chacón Dominguez in interview 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.650
 stated that the investment in 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.080
 Port infrastructure in general is 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.820
 of 5 billion pesos of investment 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.580
 public while the initiative 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.120
 private contributes in this concept 2 thousand 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.320
 million pesos the total investment of 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.250
 this year in ports has been 5 thousand 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.780
 million pesos of public resources and 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.610
 another 2,000 resource infringement 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.620
 private but it is investment in ports in 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.290
 infrastructure in general for example 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.610
 in the investment of these vessels 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.650
 these tugs was from 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.650
 approximately 80 million dollars 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.489
 specifically these four do not do not 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.650
 I have a number of more that is going to 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.030
 invest because that will depend on the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.940
 investment of each of the companies and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.010
 especially the object of these 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.880
 craft how is it aimed at 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.610
 natural gas terminal at Blue Coast 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.310
 that will allow is a security 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.530
 maximum that is has been one of the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.730
 general transport policies that 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.060
 instructed us the president of the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.430
 republic to follow it to be the operation 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.930
 with the maximum possible security and is 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.120
 also a guideline of the organization 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.650
 international maritime both the part of 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.170
 protection to the environment that I was doing 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.720
 reference is a little bit like the part 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.260
 of safe operation then with these 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.900
 boats, gas boats can 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.030
 arrive 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.349
 and I repeat the word in a way 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.540
 sure dock do the gas discharge 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.959
 that they will leave and again leave the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.959
 port 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.410
 nothing is sure is the response of 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.300
 General Director of ports to the clamor of 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.850
 the shipping lines to lower costs 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.010
 of fare in this port is nothing 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.480
 sure was the same frank response from 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.680
 own general director of ports and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.710
 merchant marine alejandro chacón 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.510
 domingue to demand the demand of 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.490
 shipping line managers to go down 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.350
 the high rates that are being 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.200
 charging in the harbor of cove that 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.090
 for today it is one of the most expensive of the 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.489
 ports 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.400
 It would be premature to make any comment 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.680
 about 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.389
 we are reviewing in general the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.650
 cost structure and about that but not 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.650
 advance eve 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.590
 despite the threat of the withdrawal of 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.259
 shipping lines the official declared 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.630
 that this reduction request is reviewed 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.000
 of fees although nothing is assured to the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.639
 respect announcing that not all are 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.520
 costs highlighting that the services 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:48.120
 local tourists must improve their 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.210
 offer for visitors clear yes 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.900
 no doubt as you said there is concern 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.110
 the shipping company that plays here in inlet and 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.680
 that is why I say taking up the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.229
 question that I made of his partner 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.050
 we are doing a review to see 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.720
 if in something we are expensive against others 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.850
 ports that compete with the senate that 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.380
 could compete with the senate so that 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.960
 if that were the case and there was a 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.240
 possibility is considered a reduction 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.949
 I do not go ahead, I 'll say again that 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:25.820
 is going to be on the other hand also in this 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:27.889
 same tenor as I have been having 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.699
 talks with various actors in the sector 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.470
 tourist who tell me that you have to 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.410
 renew also the offer is nothing more 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.110
 a portion of costs of services 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.960
 port but also of the offer 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.130
 tourist who have the passenger that 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:50.270
 come to that nothing they want to see 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:53.030
 probably new new routes or 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.160
 excursions because already those that have 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.160
 Well, they have been repeated
