00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.050
 hi friends how are you this time 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:07.490
 I bring you an update of my 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.870
 comparison between the masks that 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.570
 exist in the vendetta v market 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.879
 as I had already told you there are models 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.340
 originals that is this one can more 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.460
 find and replicas that do not have brand 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.910
 none are made this in china 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.130
 is not but has an acceptable quality 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.810
 but this time I also extract another one 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.160
 mask another model that is also 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 original is produced by ruby 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.390
 what is the brand that has the license 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.140
 official to manufacture the samples of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.760
 warner bros and vice comics then this 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.800
 it's a brand, only the models are 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330
 different this is luxury that is the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.300
 normal 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.280
 [Music] 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.520
 ok let's start with this which is the 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.579
 normal the original as I told you in 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.649
 another video this mask is very special 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.230
 for the details this mask can be 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.000
 note that it is original by the candidate 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.190
 is that we have their holes well 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.960
 open noses and mouth 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.229
 we have shadows on the eyebrows are more 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.270
 workshop around the mouth painting 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.520
 It is very well made 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.520
 of course they have their decals 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.850
 clear have as original as ruby 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.009
 like the warner studio as it says comics 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.810
 and you have this little thing that you do not know 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.299
 worry you're tear-away you only have 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.799
 to be present for back and going to 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.409
 yield to the best if you want to 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.390
 let's stay that strong a little bit 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.680
 the implant back and removed is 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.860
 easy peasy 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.600
 as we discussed last time the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.180
 only thing that some people do not 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.810
 convinces of this original masters 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.460
 is that the material is a bit flexible 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.220
 [Music] 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.360
 so if you say you're going to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.369
 give a lot of weight or sit on it 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.390
 it may be that if the clothes are not easy to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.659
 simply break 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.370
 but as we said a stomp or someone 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.459
 that you feel if it could be that it harms you 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.250
 it is their disadvantage finally they 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.319
 I commented that the straps this week 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.819
 I mean with a Velcro right now like I was 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.310
 using a hand to record the video 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.630
 it will not be difficult for me to do it but the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.630
 way that work more run is 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.879
 now we have 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.319
 the replica of this replica first thing 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.710
 that we are going to notice the difference 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.960
 this one is white 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.330
 in the original I comment on the 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.370
 movie is yellow sometimes some 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.790
 scenes by alhucemas looks for them but 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.740
 yellowish but the replica is white 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.220
 as we can see they have many less 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.620
 details do not have the shadows to see from 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.830
 the mouth in the eyebrows the nose is 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.780
 covered although the mouth is still open 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.850
 It has some manufacturing details 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.390
 as we see this little allowance here 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.250
 the strap is simple obviously not 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.790
 have a sticker that treats her as 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.940
 original but it has an advantage there 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.940
 say it is rather more rigid 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.700
 harder to flex is I think 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.090
 that someone does know if he sits on 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.530
 she or pizza is not going to happen 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.730
 then I recommend it for 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.000
 you are going to participate in a 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.250
 manifestation in some massive event or 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.550
 if they want to buy suddenly several 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.990
 As it is more economical I recommend them 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.480
 even though 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.200
 well, we can even see that the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.750
 shape is different from this because the 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.910
 original attention is manufactured with the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.360
 same mold exactly is the same lee 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.850
 with which they made the movie 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.580
 so he had forgotten about wild 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.470
 I recommend if we go to have a party 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.280
 to record a video or just the 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.320
 fifth hanging is the ideal mask 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.120
 because with some there was such a light use 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.580
 medium, nothing will happen to her 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.370
 keep forever and it's good this 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.200
 it is expected much more rude 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.090
 [Music] 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.670
 we have the third mask that is the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.790
 new edition 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:25.260
 comes in your box as you can see is the 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.730
 models of looks that are called luxury 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.620
 the first difference of course as 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.620
 come is that he comes in his own house 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.819
 these two masks we are going to do this 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.449
 these two masks are of the same brand 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:44.039
 exactly the two areas are red 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.880
 They are made with a mold of the 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.430
 movie 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.810
 but it 's good this is another level in 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.610
 As for quality and durability I know if 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.730
 you have as more shining you can see 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.320
 that shines is a little bit darker is 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.400
 super attached to the movie 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.240
 basically it is now if the same as 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:11.250
 they have to use the actor is very rigid 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.590
 is very rigid of the three this is the most 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.720
 rigid I think maybe you have here not 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.419
 notice but the thickness is I think more 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.720
 of half a centimeter is like that 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.780
 mister this one 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.150
 really try very hard to damage it 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.060
 it's a very good quality mask 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.129
 very difficult to flex quality have 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.390
 the same details 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:39.150
 I wanted to detail the shadows the finishes 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.480
 it also has its logical ones 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.390
 customer stickers have as original 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.160
 as an officer as produced by the 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.660
 Warner or good studies for rob is for 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.240
 the brand the straps are also from 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.120
 velcro although this time they are more 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.710
 thick that this model and is the most expensive 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.980
 that I recommend for the true ones 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.720
 fans for collectors to 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.430
 those who want to have the mask 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.129
 a mask for as long as they can 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.879
 put in your requirements 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.879
 a mask 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.159
 this nothing more but I recommend 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.889
 I want to dismiss this video of this one 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.060
 we just made him angry because 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.530
 many times there are people who 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.590
 they market this mask 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.629
 but with a picture of this how 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.419
 recognize them if it's a mask that will be 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:28.800
 very cheap honestly it is impossible that 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.610
 be of this unless it is a 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.990
 benefactor this person because they are the 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.750
 of how they are original and are 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.759
 made in the same mold and with 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.120
 license of the film and the 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:45.300
 warner and dc comics studies for the same 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.310
 They have a quality that it 's worth me 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.650
 dismissal with this I hope that it will be of 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.219
 utility of this comparison that I'm going 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.219
 to make your decision 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.630
 and well I hope we see you soon 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:08.260
