00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.520
 Good evening to everyone there, you have to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.340
 to present today is another version of 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.250
 a canon sharpening is salad form 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.170
 good ingredients that I use is can be 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.080
 that you do not find where you live 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.400
 because they are oriental ingredients and not 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 It is everywhere in Brazil that people 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.390
 can buy these products but it is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.029
 important to place all the products that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.670
 I will use because any product that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 You do not use the change today. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.369
 no taste 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.210
 so you have to try to use everyone I 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.070
 I will use in the recipe for the recipe 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.170
 written you will find in my blog 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.960
 just go to the link in the description of the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.480
 video that will go right there in the recipe and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 there you can print well so let's go 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.789
 today 's revenue is the first step 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.570
 to make the recipe is still the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.820
 spaghetti 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 I've already dealt with it, I've already let it go. 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.309
 There you have to let it go. 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.440
 I love you so much and now I'll take it and cut it 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.440
 because it comes this way nor fulfilled 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.530
 Look, they only convince you everything, this is okay. 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.510
 fulfilled then you have to cut in the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.530
 meal time looks better too 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 So let's do it here. 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 right size I'm going I'm going to pull 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.560
 so or cut way that does not get 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 so fulfilled already made a video of itself 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.570
 noodles so you do not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.590
 Do not know how to do 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.450
 ss l'aquila teaching how do I here already 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.579
 I cut all the pasta now I'm leaving 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.009
 reserved a cannon now the second 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.659
 step is to cut the cucumber here I am 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.159
 using Japanese cucumber 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.659
 I did great because I can not 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.240
 eat but you can find 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.950
 continent next to this sport is like this. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.899
 very thin now add the salt 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.479
 I'm going to mix it up with the complaint 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.350
 a mixed one and now I'm going to book the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.979
 cucumber 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.259
 for a few minutes good I'll go 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.049
 Akami treat him to bed for those who do not 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.000
 You know it 's sea kelp and then he 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.580
 come to be 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.580
 This is fine linen so I go 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.110
 hydrate it in the water and put a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.110
 little water 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.470
 I'll leave him in this water and even him 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.630
 it's already 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.120
 and this water has to be filtered because 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.920
 I'll use this water to make the sauce 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.660
 can not play outside 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.970
 so now I'll let him give you a 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.670
 a little after I left some 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.860
 I'll tell you later. 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.410
 to stay there has he wins well 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.480
 very big sometimes not everything comes the same 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.090
 look smart only 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.010
 So now I'm going to get you running or 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.250
 will spend the water was a little bit 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.920
 and I'll cut and look at the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.100
 size is it here I already cut the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.110
 akami cortez in strips can be more or 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.690
 less than the size and I will use this 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.209
 quantity and here is the water that I will use 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.540
 now to make water sauce from the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.030
 He turned green and did not look good. 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.280
 pt after I left the time with 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.940
 salt and released all this amount of 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.610
 Water 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.709
 Look, the touch has come out of the small now. 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.989
 You have to pick up and push to leave. 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.590
 all that is left over from water in the 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:34.799
 small just cutting like this is also strong 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:36.540
 So until you leave, neither is it too long. 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.820
 wet then you are squeezing until 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.190
 get out all that amount of water 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.340
 It's now only in Santiago. 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.600
 so I 'll do it, I'll do everything 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.920
 the rest so the mayor tighten nothing 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.739
 I already took all the excess water 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.980
 and now I'm going to make an eye 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.600
 to put in the pasta 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.390
 Good, now I'll make the sauce for my water. 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.010
 which is already boiling and now adds 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.880
 that water that leaves quiet of the pipe 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.880
 wait was to see again 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:20.079
 when it starts to boil I 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:26.860
 I add the Shoyu Shooting the ajinomoto o 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:29.199
 serve for sugar cooking and now 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.699
 I'll mix it up here and I'll wait. 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.000
 movie a little more 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.150
 well diluted ingredients mainly 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.729
 shooting 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.960
 so now you try on this point 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.430
 Good of salt 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.160
 I 'm not only in my recipe 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.780
 because I think the show already salted 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.370
 It's okay, but you can add the 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.430
 salt if you want 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.570
 now I'll see a little more and then I 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.699
 will shut down good here I hung up and 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.090

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.229
 I just saw the mandachuva and 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.229
 now you have to wait to cool down to 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.419
 to put on the pasta 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.229
 good now the sauce has cooled I'm going to put 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.229
 this on the channel 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.740

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.479
 then dot com like this and now I add 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.050

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:23.130
 here you can put German also if 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:32.130

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.630
 as they are thus mixing the 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.270
 sauce is absorbing a canon and goes 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.180
 getting the ceremony look only then 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.690
 now I'm going to take the refrigerator was 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.970
 chilled before serving 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.740
 Well here I had it in the fridge and now 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.260
 it can serve and then it's ready 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.270
 stay that way and now you can put 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.260
 It also looks really tasty 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.550
 today in black so it gives a good taste 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.630
 special too 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.280
 I love it, I got it and you put it on. 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.680
 black because that other cosme knot 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.510
 appears and he's not that hot either 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.290
 that no blacks here to put 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.290

 After you're done, I'll leave it to you. 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.100
 a little bit of broth to not stay 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:03.210
 so dry a canon 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.790
 I left a little here and I hope 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.560
 that you can do at home is a 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.520
 A little tricky to do well 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:16.310
 Tiring but it got a divine flavor 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.310
 I hope you like it and see you later.
