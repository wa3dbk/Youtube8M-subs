and then push them down to meet the
other<00:02:22.790> ones<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.240> make<00:02:23.690> no<00:02:24.110> attempt<00:02:24.920> with<00:02:25.160> this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
other ones I make no attempt with this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.000 
other ones I make no attempt with this
since<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:26.810> will<00:02:26.990> try<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.260> go<00:02:27.350> for<00:02:27.530> Patterson

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
since we will try and go for Patterson

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.480 
since we will try and go for Patterson
because<00:02:29.260> there<00:02:30.260> are<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.040> many<00:02:31.070> different

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
because there are so many different

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.580 
because there are so many different
colors<00:02:31.610> you'd<00:02:32.180> end<00:02:32.390> up<00:02:32.510> with<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:33.110> loader<00:02:33.380> one

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
colors you'd end up with a loader one

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.440 
colors you'd end up with a loader one
and<00:02:33.770> nothing<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.190> other<00:02:34.310> one<00:02:34.460> then<00:02:35.000> go

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
and nothing of the other one then go

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.070 
and nothing of the other one then go
back<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:37.270> put<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:39.130> two<00:02:40.750> threads<00:02:41.750> through

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
back now and put the two threads through

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.000 
back now and put the two threads through
one<00:02:42.670> if<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.880> just<00:02:44.180> remember<00:02:44.510> two<00:02:45.140> one

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
one if you just remember two one

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:59.890 
one if you just remember two one
one<00:02:47.380> you'll<00:02:48.380> be<00:02:48.590> able<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:51.490> do<00:02:52.490> them<00:02:52.700> all<00:02:53.710> one<00:02:58.900> so

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
one you'll be able to do them all one so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.400 
one you'll be able to do them all one so
fiddly<00:03:02.830> did<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:03.950> really<00:03:04.250> say<00:03:04.430> that

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
fiddly did I really say that

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:14.520 
fiddly did I really say that
-<00:03:06.410> one<00:03:06.830> one

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:24.000 

and<00:03:15.130> again<00:03:16.230> two<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:22.000> then<00:03:22.630> one<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.140> no<00:03:23.530> okay

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
and again two and then one one no okay

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.640 
and again two and then one one no okay
so<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.340> keep<00:03:24.640> on<00:03:24.850> going<00:03:25.920> until<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:29.170> get<00:03:29.380> as

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
so you keep on going until you get as

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.470 
so you keep on going until you get as
many<00:03:29.890> beads<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.700> want<00:03:33.970> okay<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.970> keep<00:03:37.330> on

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
many beads as you want okay you keep on

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.090 
many beads as you want okay you keep on
going<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.930> then<00:03:38.290> we're<00:03:38.470> going<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.709> end<00:03:38.950> up

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
going and then we're going to end up

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
going and then we're going to end up
with<00:03:39.490> three<00:03:40.680> layers<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.890> these<00:03:42.430> beads<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.970> can

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
with three layers of these beads and can

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.110 
with three layers of these beads and can
you<00:03:43.209> see<00:03:43.360> how<00:03:43.510> little<00:03:44.170> pocket<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.860> beads<00:03:45.130> which

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
you see how little pocket of beads which

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.780 
you see how little pocket of beads which
didn't<00:03:46.480> seem<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.989> say<00:03:47.410> much<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.250> once<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.610> do

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
didn't seem to say much and once you do

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.600 
didn't seem to say much and once you do
it<00:03:48.940> like<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.920> becomes<00:03:51.010> really<00:03:51.489> really

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
it like this it becomes really really

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.060 
it like this it becomes really really

finished it how to finish on the other

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.469 
finished it how to finish on the other
side<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:28.060> lay<00:04:28.419> your<00:04:28.570> beads<00:04:28.840> out<00:04:29.140> on<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.590> table

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
side so lay your beads out on the table

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.050

if<00:04:31.479> I<00:04:31.660> move<00:04:31.840> those<00:04:32.080> over<00:04:32.260> you'll<00:04:32.710> notice<00:04:33.280> that

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
if I move those over you'll notice that

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.550 
if I move those over you'll notice that
I<00:04:34.330> have<00:04:34.680> three<00:04:35.680> different<00:04:36.570> lengths<00:04:37.570> this<00:04:38.380> is

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
I have three different lengths this is

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.500 
I have three different lengths this is
because<00:04:38.950> when<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.460> put<00:04:39.640> it<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:39.880> your<00:04:40.060> neck<00:04:40.240> you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
because when you put it on your neck you

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.909 
because when you put it on your neck you
don't<00:04:40.540> want<00:04:40.840> them<00:04:40.960> all<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.140> same<00:04:41.380> then<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:41.830> you

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
don't want them all the same then so you

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.909 
don't want them all the same then so you
want<00:04:42.100> them<00:04:42.340> layered<00:04:43.330> in<00:04:43.960> three<00:04:44.350> lengths<00:04:44.740> and

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
want them layered in three lengths and

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.920 
want them layered in three lengths and
so<00:04:45.550> I've<00:04:45.700> made<00:04:45.850> sure<00:04:45.910> I<00:04:46.150> get<00:04:46.450> them<00:04:46.570> in<00:04:46.720> three

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
so I've made sure I get them in three

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.870 
so I've made sure I get them in three
different<00:04:47.169> lengths<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.650> start<00:04:47.919> off<00:04:48.100> I'll<00:04:48.700> show

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
different lengths to start off I'll show

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.090 
different lengths to start off I'll show
you<00:04:49.000> what<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.270> do<00:04:49.390> right<00:04:50.050> now<00:04:50.290> we're<00:04:50.590> at<00:04:50.890> the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
end and we need to attach the clasps and

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.909 
end and we need to attach the clasps and
what<00:04:55.030> I've<00:04:55.180> done<00:04:55.450> here<00:04:55.510> is<00:04:55.810> I've<00:04:56.350> got<00:04:56.620> some

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
what I've done here is I've got some

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.730 
what I've done here is I've got some
quite<00:04:57.160> small<00:04:57.520> jump<00:04:57.790> rings<00:04:58.229> because<00:04:59.229> if<00:04:59.620> you

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
quite small jump rings because if you

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.180 
quite small jump rings because if you
have<00:04:59.950> them<00:05:00.100> too<00:05:00.340> big<00:05:01.260> in<00:05:02.260> relation<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:02.950> the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
have them too big in relation to the
