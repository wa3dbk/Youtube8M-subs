today<00:00:12.360> with<00:00:12.980> kumihimo<00:00:14.240> weaving<00:00:15.240> or<00:00:15.660> braids

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
today with kumihimo weaving or braids

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.470 
today with kumihimo weaving or braids
it's<00:00:16.230> called<00:00:16.470> Japanese<00:00:17.010> braiding<00:00:17.609> which<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
it's called Japanese braiding which is

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.510 
it's called Japanese braiding which is
probably<00:00:18.869> easier<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.380> remember<00:00:19.650> we're<00:00:20.460> gonna

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
probably easier to remember we're gonna

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.590 
probably easier to remember we're gonna
start<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.060> an<00:00:21.150> octagon<00:00:21.830> eight<00:00:22.830> sides<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.640> we

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
start with an octagon eight sides and we

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.710 
start with an octagon eight sides and we
I've<00:00:24.840> put<00:00:25.230> slits<00:00:26.029> right<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> middle<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
I've put slits right in the middle of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.589 
I've put slits right in the middle of
each<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.830> sides<00:00:29.330> punch<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.420> hole<00:00:30.539> in

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
each one of the sides punch a hole in

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
each one of the sides punch a hole in
the<00:00:30.750> center<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.529> using<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.070> fun<00:00:32.279> foam

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the center and I like using the fun foam

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.450 
the center and I like using the fun foam
you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.880> use<00:00:33.030> cardboard<00:00:33.620> but<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:35.309> we're

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you can use cardboard but when we're

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
you can use cardboard but when we're
working<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.820> kids<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.350> really

kids so we're going to start with
threading<00:00:42.780> seven<00:00:43.649> brightly<00:00:44.129> colored<00:00:44.460> yarns

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
threading seven brightly colored yarns

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
threading seven brightly colored yarns
through<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.780> hole<00:00:45.989> tie<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> knot<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.860> not

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
through that hole tie a knot so it's not

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.650 
through that hole tie a knot so it's not
going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> come<00:00:47.370> through<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.879> I've<00:00:48.329> used

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
going to come through and I've used

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.750 
going to come through and I've used
sport<00:00:49.260> weight<00:00:49.410> yarn<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.489> any

weight<00:00:51.059> yarn<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> want<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.170> make

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
weight yarn you want to and you can make

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
weight yarn you want to and you can make
this<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> little<00:00:52.890> bit<00:00:53.010> larger<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.789> have

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this a little bit larger so just have

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.709 
this a little bit larger so just have
some<00:00:54.120> fun<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
some fun with it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
some fun with it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
colors one by one and place them in a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
colors one by one and place them in a
slit<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.850> said

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
slit right there now you see like I said

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.750 
slit right there now you see like I said
there<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.450> eight<00:01:06.740> sides<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.430> seven

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
there are eight sides but we have seven

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.840 
there are eight sides but we have seven
yarns<00:01:09.119> hold<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> empty<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.799> toward<00:01:11.549> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
yarns hold that empty one toward you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.230 
yarns hold that empty one toward you
facing<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.979> from<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.340> count<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.909> three

the empty one toward you one two three

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.560 
the empty one toward you one two three
counting<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.439> from<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> right<00:01:26.299> place<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
counting up from the right place that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.280 
counting up from the right place that
there<00:01:27.840> turn<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
there turn this is all there is to the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.310 
there turn this is all there is to the
Japanese<00:01:31.890> braiding<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.720> keep<00:01:33.990> working

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
Japanese braiding you keep working

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.910 
Japanese braiding you keep working
around<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.079> it's<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> its

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
around like this and it's going to its

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
around like this and it's going to its
its<00:01:38.220> braiding<00:01:38.670> these<00:01:38.790> pieces<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
its braiding these pieces as we go and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.690 
its braiding these pieces as we go and
as<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.259> continue<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.400> start

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
as you continue on you just start

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.050 
as you continue on you just start
pulling<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.150> through<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:43.430> have<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> piece<00:01:44.729> over

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
pulling it through I have a piece over

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.760 
pulling it through I have a piece over
here<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.570> I've<00:01:45.689> already<00:01:45.869> been<00:01:46.200> working<00:01:46.470> on

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
here that I've already been working on

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.840 
here that I've already been working on
and<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.689> coming<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.850> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and you can see as it's coming out and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.100 
and you can see as it's coming out and
you<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.000> kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> pull<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:51.750> bit

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
you just kind of pull it a little bit

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.719 
you just kind of pull it a little bit
don't<00:01:52.380> pull<00:01:52.590> too<00:01:52.619> hard<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.159> you're<00:01:53.280> using<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
don't pull too hard if you're using the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
don't pull too hard if you're using the
foam<00:01:53.939> while<00:01:54.240> you're<00:01:54.420> working<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.380> be

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
foam while you're working on this so be

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
foam while you're working on this so be
very<00:01:55.619> careful<00:01:56.100> while<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.369> doing<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> but

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
this is really a great project to work

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.459
