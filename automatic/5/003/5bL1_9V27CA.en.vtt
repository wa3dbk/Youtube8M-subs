ad carry in my opinion he plays like a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.650 
ad carry in my opinion he plays like a
bruiser<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.520> he<00:00:41.700> deals<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.239> much<00:00:42.420> damage

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
bruiser because he deals so much damage

bruiser because he deals so much damage
but<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> ability<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.489> taking<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
but with the ability of not taking that

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.440 
but with the ability of not taking that
much<00:00:45.450> damage<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> cc<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.300> his<00:00:48.300> ability

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
much damage with a cc and his ability

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.389 
much damage with a cc and his ability
just<00:00:48.840> diversity<00:00:49.379> down<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.739> fast<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.219> very

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
just diversity down so fast with very

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.490 
just diversity down so fast with very
little<00:00:50.550> items<00:00:50.940> he's<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.840> very<00:00:51.989> aggressive

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
little items he's just very aggressive

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.990 
little items he's just very aggressive
inline<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.039> he's<00:00:53.219> very<00:00:53.280> difficult<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> beat

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
inline and he's very difficult to beat

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.729 
inline and he's very difficult to beat
out<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.629> they're<00:00:54.780> very<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.649> out

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
out and they're very will not get out

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.150 
out and they're very will not get out
trade<00:00:56.010> him<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.219> lane<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.480> uh<00:00:57.510> he's<00:00:58.500> dominant<00:00:58.920> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
trade him in lane so uh he's dominant I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.740 
trade him in lane so uh he's dominant I
think<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.699> his<00:00:59.820> numbers<00:01:00.149> need<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.510> tweet

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
think that his numbers need to be tweet

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.939 
think that his numbers need to be tweet
just<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> make<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
just like a little bit to make them a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
just like a little bit to make them a
little<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:02.219> more<00:01:02.340> fair<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.539> understand

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
little bit more fair but I understand

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.810 
little bit more fair but I understand
that<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.439> high-risk<00:01:05.040> high-reward<00:01:05.460> hero

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that it's a high-risk high-reward hero

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.609 
that it's a high-risk high-reward hero
because<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.540> skill<00:01:06.840> cap<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.290> people

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
