00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
change in varying ways but what's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.000 
change in varying ways but what's
important<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.030> me<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:00.480> present<00:01:00.809> works<00:01:01.620> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
important to me is to present works of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.299 
important to me is to present works of
the<00:01:02.399> moment<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.259> like<00:01:04.799> prevalent

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the moment of now that is like prevalent

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.190 
the moment of now that is like prevalent
to<00:01:05.579> today's<00:01:07.130> place<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.670> dance<00:01:08.969> and<00:01:09.360> other

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
to today's place and dance and other

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.440 
to today's place and dance and other
Street<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.740> think<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.219> the<00:01:11.250> brink<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
Street I think it's on the brink of of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.200 
Street I think it's on the brink of of
that<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.079> is<00:01:13.469> able<00:01:13.649> them<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.189> present<00:01:14.610> yet

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
that and is able them to present yet

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.279 
that and is able them to present yet
what<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.020> next<00:01:16.200> step<00:01:16.469> in<00:01:16.829> dance<00:01:17.130> and

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
what is the next step in dance and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.559 
what is the next step in dance and
consequently<00:01:19.759> contemporary<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.329> term

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
consequently contemporary is the term

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.529 
consequently contemporary is the term
that<00:01:21.899> we<00:01:22.049> use<00:01:22.079> for<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.709> company<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.090> think

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
that we use for the company but I think

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.539 
that we use for the company but I think
also<00:01:24.840> too<00:01:25.079> I<00:01:25.109> don't<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.740> categorize<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
also too I don't like to categorize the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.760 
also too I don't like to categorize the
company<00:01:26.969> because<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.869> moment<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.229> come<00:01:28.499> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
company because the moment you come to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.739 
company because the moment you come to
the<00:01:28.859> point<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.189> categorizing<00:01:29.789> it<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
the point of categorizing it then it

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:33.289 
the point of categorizing it then it
ends<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.200> being<00:01:31.819> something<00:01:32.819> that's<00:01:33.119> already

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
ends up being something that's already

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.870 
ends up being something that's already
past<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.799> always<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.279> to<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
past and I always want to see the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.910 
past and I always want to see the
company<00:01:36.060> progressing<00:01:36.959> into<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.289> future<00:01:37.649> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
company progressing into the future and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.940

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
forever changing and to the point that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
forever changing and to the point that
you<00:01:41.130> can't<00:01:41.700> figure<00:01:41.999> out<00:01:42.119> where<00:01:42.689> we're<00:01:42.959> going

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.690 
you can't figure out where we're going
and<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.499> we're<00:01:43.619> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.950> doing<00:01:44.130> next
