aircraft<00:00:47.579> model<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:50.160> box<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.820> quite<00:00:51.750> one

aircraft model so the box is quite one
down<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.730> but<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.940> guess<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
down here but I guess because I got it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.080 
down here but I guess because I got it
um<00:00:56.420> used<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> single<00:00:59.730> button

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
um used that is so it's a single button

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.479 
um used that is so it's a single button
so<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:01.020> open<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.570> here<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> go

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
so I just open this up and here you go

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.670 
so I just open this up and here you go
um<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.549> guess<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> model<00:01:06.900> wasn't<00:01:07.049> put<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.409> place

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
um I guess the model wasn't put in place

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
um I guess the model wasn't put in place

i'm<00:01:52.290> sorry<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.680> probably<00:01:52.950> can't<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
i'm sorry you probably can't see the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
i'm sorry you probably can't see the
reason<00:01:54.600> why<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.560> light<00:01:55.799> hits<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
reason why is because the light hits the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.580 
reason why is because the light hits the
sofa<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.630> makes<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.259> details

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
sofa and it makes it so that the details

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590 
sofa and it makes it so that the details
don't<00:01:59.009> show<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.490> too<00:01:59.700> well<00:01:59.880> whenever<00:02:00.270> your

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
don't show up too well whenever your

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.590 
don't show up too well whenever your
phone<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.159> unfortunately<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:03.060> can't<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.420> too

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
phone so unfortunately you can't get too

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.840 
phone so unfortunately you can't get too
close<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.899> too<00:02:04.890> good<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> details<00:02:05.700> on

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
close with too good with the details on

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.320 
close with too good with the details on
this<00:02:05.969> model<00:02:06.290> for<00:02:07.290> zooming<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.910> but<00:02:08.910> here's<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
this model for zooming in but here's the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.220 
this model for zooming in but here's the
here's<00:02:09.869> an<00:02:10.080> example

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
here's an example

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.660 
here's an example
sorry<00:02:12.230> let<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.500> focus<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.310> there's<00:02:13.520> an

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
sorry let it focus but there's an

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.690 
sorry let it focus but there's an
example<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.510> door<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.220> when<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.520> is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
example of the door and when this is

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.090 
example of the door and when this is
good<00:02:16.910> because<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.510> can<00:02:17.740> zoom<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.950> whole

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
good because now I can zoom the whole

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.060 
good because now I can zoom the whole
thing<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:20.450> anyway<00:02:20.840> going<00:02:21.080> back<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.740> this

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
thing but anyway going back so this

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.040 
thing but anyway going back so this
would<00:02:22.250> typically<00:02:23.030> be<00:02:23.180> your<00:02:23.510> first<00:02:23.780> class

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
would typically be your first class

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.500 
would typically be your first class
you've<00:02:24.770> got<00:02:24.950> delta<00:02:25.430> sky<00:02:26.150> team<00:02:26.450> um<00:02:28.300> then<00:02:29.300> you've

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
you've got delta sky team um then you've

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.530 
you've got delta sky team um then you've
got<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:31.490> would<00:02:31.670> most<00:02:32.000> likely<00:02:32.210> be

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
got the this would most likely be

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.920 
got the this would most likely be
business<00:02:32.990> from<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.470> here<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.830> there<00:02:34.600> no<00:02:35.600> wait

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
business from like here to there no wait

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.980 
business from like here to there no wait
no<00:02:36.200> from<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.680> right<00:02:37.640> there<00:02:37.940> from<00:02:38.600> like<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
no from like right there from like the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.440 
no from like right there from like the
beginning<00:02:39.380> probably<00:02:40.370> halfway<00:02:40.610> through<00:02:41.150> and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
beginning probably halfway through and

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.110 
beginning probably halfway through and
then<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.870> have<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.080> cut<00:02:42.350> off<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.770> rest

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
then you have a cut off and the rest

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.570 
then you have a cut off and the rest
from<00:02:44.120> here<00:02:44.420> most<00:02:44.840> likely<00:02:45.050> is<00:02:45.350> economy<00:02:45.890> but<00:02:46.460> I'm

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
from here most likely is economy but I'm

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.970 
from here most likely is economy but I'm
not<00:02:46.760> sure<00:02:46.850> because<00:02:47.240> different<00:02:47.680> 757<00:02:48.680> s<00:02:48.800> have

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
not sure because different 757 s have

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.240 
not sure because different 757 s have
different<00:02:49.370> layouts<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:51.170> anyway<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:51.620> keep<00:02:52.040> on

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
different layouts so anyway you keep on

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.780 
different layouts so anyway you keep on
going<00:02:52.640> back<00:02:52.850> you've<00:02:53.420> got<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.050> win<00:02:54.380> lots<00:02:54.790> and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
going back you've got the win lots and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.260 
going back you've got the win lots and
then<00:02:56.660> you've<00:02:56.840> got<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.230> registration

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
then you've got the registration

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:10.360 
then you've got the registration

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
really really nice um the landing gear

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.600 
really really nice um the landing gear
does<00:03:53.000> pivot<00:03:53.800> unlike<00:03:54.800> my<00:03:55.660> crj900<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.460> i'm<00:03:58.460> not

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
does pivot unlike my crj900 and i'm not

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.460 
does pivot unlike my crj900 and i'm not
really<00:03:58.730> sure<00:03:58.850> why<00:03:59.210> different<00:03:59.510> planes<00:03:59.930> pivot

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
really sure why different planes pivot

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.810 
really sure why different planes pivot
for<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.430> landing<00:04:01.760> gear<00:04:01.910> in<00:04:02.030> some<00:04:02.270> not<00:04:02.510> don't

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
for the landing gear in some not don't

for the landing gear in some not don't
but<00:04:04.820> um<00:04:05.680> here's<00:04:06.680> some<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.130> antennas

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
but um here's some of the antennas

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.580 
but um here's some of the antennas
there's<00:04:08.120> only<00:04:08.300> really<00:04:08.540> one<00:04:08.690> on<00:04:08.960> the<00:04:09.050> top<00:04:09.290> you

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590
