valleys the best place to put that is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.139 
valleys the best place to put that is
actually<00:00:51.870> underneath<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> ballot<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:54.059> will

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
actually underneath the ballot it will

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
actually underneath the ballot it will
heat<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.660> valley<00:00:54.870> metal<00:00:55.440> it'll<00:00:55.920> keep<00:00:56.399> ice

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
heat up the valley metal it'll keep ice

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.830 
heat up the valley metal it'll keep ice
snow<00:00:57.270> from<00:00:57.510> forming<00:00:57.989> also<00:00:59.539> you<00:01:00.539> don't<00:01:00.690> have

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
snow from forming also you don't have

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.889 
snow from forming also you don't have
any<00:01:01.230> issues<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:01.800> snow<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.489> ice<00:01:02.699> trying<00:01:03.690> to
