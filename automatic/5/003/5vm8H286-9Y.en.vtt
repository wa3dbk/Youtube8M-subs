dog with the XML LED in it this is about

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.090 
dog with the XML LED in it this is about
720<00:00:41.160> lumens<00:00:42.079> we're<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.500> comparing

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
720 lumens we're going to be comparing

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.180 
720 lumens we're going to be comparing
that<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:47.390> several<00:00:48.390> flashlights<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.800> first

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that to several flashlights but first

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.270 
that to several flashlights but first
again<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> hound<00:00:51.899> dog<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:53.160> the

the XML LED pointed up in the sky making
about<00:01:01.430> 720<00:01:02.430> lumens<00:01:02.850> hopefully<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.899> see

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
about 720 lumens hopefully you can see

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.030 
about 720 lumens hopefully you can see
the<00:01:05.129> center<00:01:05.850> beam<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.780> outer<00:01:07.140> cone<00:01:07.619> of

it in this configuration one time to be

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.289 
it in this configuration one time to be
about<00:01:26.840> 390<00:01:27.840> lumens<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:29.640> we're<00:01:30.180> looking

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
about 390 lumens out but we're looking

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
about 390 lumens out but we're looking
at<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> beam<00:01:30.990> spread<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:32.729> can't<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.009> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
at the beam spread you can't see the the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.039 
at the beam spread you can't see the the
outer<00:01:36.320> portion<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> beam<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:39.049> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
outer portion of the beam right now so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.230 
outer portion of the beam right now so
much<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.280> yellow<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.909> doesn't

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
much because it's yellow and it doesn't

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.010 
much because it's yellow and it doesn't
reflect<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.350> water<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> light<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:45.020> much

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
reflect the water and the light as much

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.550 
reflect the water and the light as much
so<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> water<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> air<00:01:48.140> from<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> cool

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so the water in the air from the cool

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160 
so the water in the air from the cool
white<00:01:49.799> LED<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.490> being<00:01:50.820> reflected<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.990> can

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
white LED is being reflected and you can

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.069 
white LED is being reflected and you can
see<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> outer<00:01:52.710> cone<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.369> light<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.600> LED

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
see the outer cone of light of the LED

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.249 
see the outer cone of light of the LED
from<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.790> Malkoff<00:01:57.240> hound-dog<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.110> it's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
from the the Malkoff hound-dog but it's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.520 
from the the Malkoff hound-dog but it's
harder<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:02:00.060> Surefire<00:02:00.540> p<00:02:00.899> 91

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
harder to see it in the Surefire p 91

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.459 
harder to see it in the Surefire p 91
the<00:02:01.950> center<00:02:02.280> beam<00:02:02.600> lights<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> sky

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.130 

it<00:02:08.039> doesn't<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.519> cut<00:02:08.910> through<00:02:09.080> all<00:02:10.080> that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
it doesn't really cut through all that

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.930 
it doesn't really cut through all that
well<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.930> two<00:02:13.140> different<00:02:13.170> beams

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
well so you have the two different beams

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.559 
well so you have the two different beams
there<00:02:15.500> you'll<00:02:16.500> see<00:02:16.799> how<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.220> looks<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
there you'll see how this looks in the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.390 
there you'll see how this looks in the
video<00:02:19.760> next<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:22.530> original<00:02:23.129> hound

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
video next we have the original hound

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.720 
video next we have the original hound
dog<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.209> xpg<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:26.489> has<00:02:26.700> a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
dog with the xpg in it and it has a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.220 
dog with the xpg in it and it has a
tighter<00:02:27.180> beam<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:29.580> xpg<00:02:30.269> with<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.660> reflector

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
tighter beam the xpg with this reflector

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.680 
tighter beam the xpg with this reflector
had<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> slightly<00:02:31.950> tighter<00:02:32.400> beam<00:02:34.099> than<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.690> one

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
had a slightly tighter beam than the one

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.160 
had a slightly tighter beam than the one
with<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.019> XML<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.580> XML<00:02:39.090> puts<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.599> more<00:02:39.870> light

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
with the XML the XML puts out more light

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.809 
with the XML the XML puts out more light
I<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:41.220> see<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:44.780> off<00:02:45.780> axis<00:02:46.440> light<00:02:47.040> but

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
I can see it in the off axis light but

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.839 
I can see it in the off axis light but
not<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.480> center<00:02:48.810> beam<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.670> don't<00:02:50.670> know<00:02:50.760> if

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
not in the center beam I don't know if

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.869 
not in the center beam I don't know if
it'll<00:02:51.030> show<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.660> well<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.200> video<00:02:52.879> but

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
it'll show up as well in the video but

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.030 
it'll show up as well in the video but
this<00:02:54.090> beam<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.720> thick<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.470> looks<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:55.860> I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
this beam is so thick it looks like I

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.009 
this beam is so thick it looks like I
could<00:02:56.099> walk<00:02:56.459> up<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.940> thing<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.420> mean<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.810> is

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
could walk up this thing I mean this is

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.229 
could walk up this thing I mean this is
really<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.379> strong<00:02:58.769> beam<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.400> my<00:02:59.549> eye<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.760> can<00:03:00.209> see

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
really a strong beam to my eye I can see

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.930 
really a strong beam to my eye I can see
so<00:03:00.660> much<00:03:00.870> moisture<00:03:01.140> in<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.680> beam<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.790> is

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
so much moisture in this beam so this is

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.289 
so much moisture in this beam so this is

an old favorite of mine the original

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.699 
an old favorite of mine the original
Wildcat<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.510> had<00:03:21.720> four<00:03:24.019> LEDs<00:03:25.019> in<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.410> these

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
Wildcat that had four LEDs in it these

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.680 
Wildcat that had four LEDs in it these
were<00:03:25.919> the<00:03:26.099> same<00:03:26.340> LEDs<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:26.910> were<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.569> the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
were the same LEDs that were in the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.020 
were the same LEDs that were in the
original<00:03:28.220> Malkoff<00:03:29.220> m60<00:03:30.150> drop-in<00:03:30.840> unit<00:03:32.030> this

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
original Malkoff m60 drop-in unit this

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.069 
original Malkoff m60 drop-in unit this
thing<00:03:33.269> has<00:03:33.450> quad<00:03:33.840> optics<00:03:34.349> this<00:03:35.340> put<00:03:35.579> out<00:03:35.730> about

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
thing has quad optics this put out about

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.920 
thing has quad optics this put out about
550<00:03:37.079> lumens<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.030> beam<00:03:39.209> was<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.480> little<00:03:39.810> bit

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
550 lumens so the beam was a little bit

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.750 
550 lumens so the beam was a little bit
wider<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:40.680> here<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.099> have<00:03:41.510> four<00:03:42.510> LEDs<00:03:43.109> and

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
wider so here you have four LEDs and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.610 
wider so here you have four LEDs and
here<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.880> have<00:03:45.120> one<00:03:45.989> XML<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:48.450> XML<00:03:48.959> is<00:03:49.560> a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
here you have one XML the XML is a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.849 
here you have one XML the XML is a
brighter<00:03:50.099> beam<00:03:50.459> has<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.480> better<00:03:51.870> hotspot<00:03:52.500> and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
brighter beam has a better hotspot and

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.449 
brighter beam has a better hotspot and
more<00:03:53.819> in<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.389> outer<00:03:54.569> perimeter<00:03:55.160> than<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
more in the outer perimeter than the

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.960 
more in the outer perimeter than the
Wildcat<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.389> is<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.660> Wildcat<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:02.459> this

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
Wildcat so this is the Wildcat and this

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.610 
Wildcat so this is the Wildcat and this
is<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.269> hound<00:04:03.510> dog<00:04:03.810> XML<00:04:05.810> we're<00:04:06.810> gonna<00:04:07.049> try<00:04:07.410> and

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
is the hound dog XML we're gonna try and

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.170 
is the hound dog XML we're gonna try and
do<00:04:07.739> one<00:04:08.010> other<00:04:08.220> thing

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.860 

so<00:04:13.219> instead<00:04:14.219> of<00:04:14.340> seeing<00:04:15.030> my<00:04:15.269> neighbor's<00:04:15.510> house

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
so instead of seeing my neighbor's house

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.259 
so instead of seeing my neighbor's house
all<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.650> see<00:04:16.889> is<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.220> light<00:04:17.370> being<00:04:17.970> reflected

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
all you see is the light being reflected

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.150 
all you see is the light being reflected
off<00:04:18.829> of<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.949> water<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.940> air<00:04:21.919> can't<00:04:22.919> really

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
off of the water in the air can't really

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.529 
off of the water in the air can't really
see<00:04:25.039> you<00:04:26.039> can<00:04:26.190> see<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.520> beam<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:27.030> can't

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
see you can see the beam you can't

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.180 
see you can see the beam you can't
really<00:04:27.750> see<00:04:28.050> what<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.350> want<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.650> see<00:04:28.800> from<00:04:28.979> the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
really see what you want to see from the

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.010 
really see what you want to see from the
beam<00:04:29.400> because<00:04:29.880> it's<00:04:30.150> lighting<00:04:30.570> up<00:04:30.660> all<00:04:30.870> the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
beam because it's lighting up all the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.140 
beam because it's lighting up all the
water<00:04:31.259> vapor<00:04:31.560> but<00:04:32.160> tonight<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:32.820> is<00:04:33.000> all

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
water vapor but tonight this is all

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.200 
water vapor but tonight this is all
about<00:04:33.449> seeing<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.229> beam<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.789> concludes

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
about seeing the beam and that concludes

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.680 
about seeing the beam and that concludes
this<00:04:36.449> portion<00:04:36.720> of<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.229> testing
