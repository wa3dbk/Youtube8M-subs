00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello everyone today i want to talk about 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.870
 This Chinese dynamo flashlights 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.630
 the principle is very simple inside is 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.090
 generator that when rotating 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 generates electricity in theory 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 since this copy is from some 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.000
 ok lantern here inside should 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 there will be batteries that will be 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.859
 charge from here this small 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.880
 generator because there is no 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.719
 battery to ordinary batteries 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.690
 tablets 3 or 2 things in my 3 that 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.020
 there are pills it does not charge and it works 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.300
 until the place they sit down but 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:55.379
 generator working principle we see 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 that it works while rotating but the diodes 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.390
 which three diodes converge they have brightness 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.850
 them constantly changing depending on 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.309
 rotational forces, that is not comfortable at all 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.659
 use it even in this case 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.549
 let's imagine that we are 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.590
 away from civilization somewhere there 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.900
 lost or lost and don't know and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.600
 how much more time we spend there not 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.740
 known somewhere or in the forest or in 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.720
 the mountains or on the island and we have a pocket 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.290
 turned out to be quite by accident 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.240
 here is a flashlight 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.720
 the batteries have gone absolutely nowhere 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.780
 good 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.190
 what can be done well the first thing that comes 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.490
 to the head it's a windmill with the help of this 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.260
 a small generator can be made 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.060
 normal windmill how to make a windmill i 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.470
 I think it is necessary to explain to no one, and that is, 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 since here we already have 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.910
 big gear 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.850
 connects to it with a knife 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:57.220
 tree a little time and fantasy 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 this windmill is being built to connect it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.600
 to this pin or this gear 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.400
 and it should rotate freely and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.119
 produce energy repeat of course 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.700
 it will be very difficult to do this 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.950
 such conditions but if time is full 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:21.840
 there is nothing to do 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.600
 can this be done people make windmills and 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:35.650
 without being roughly prepared 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:37.239
 the most important part here is what it looks like 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.190
 flashlight unassembled 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.989
 to this gear she is big but 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.470
 here can be removed 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.560
 blades but again I repeat that here 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.930
 the main perseverance can be done in 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.700
 Basically anything would be time 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.900
 chewing well and some sort of small 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.700
 tool on this all subscribe to 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.700
 channel of all good bye
