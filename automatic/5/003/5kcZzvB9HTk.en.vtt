00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
going to use has a little more flash to

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.290 
going to use has a little more flash to
it<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:14.050> don't<00:02:14.200> need<00:02:14.290> lots<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.910> dubbing

up to the hook shank wrap for just

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.720 
up to the hook shank wrap for just
building<00:02:39.909> a<00:02:40.030> little<00:02:40.060> bit<00:02:40.480> as<00:02:40.689> we<00:02:40.810> go<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:42.430> ok

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
building a little bit as we go it's ok

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.470
