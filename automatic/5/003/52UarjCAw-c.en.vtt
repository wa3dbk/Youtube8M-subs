00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.139
 Hi there, with you driver we review 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.410
 with you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.230
 the game deck heroes today I will talk about 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.060
 so complicated enough but interesting 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.660
 topic as an evolution from merge they 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 there are no improvements in our building 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.910
 are needed to make your being evil 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.980
 learn yourself 4 skill that you need to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:42.059
 to make evolution you need to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.610
 the creature has already been improved to 4 to 10 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:51.289
 level 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:55.440
 only these creatures are allowed to evolve 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.600
 so you need to be available enough 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.539
 amount of materials but spelled out here 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.199
 for each race for each quantity 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.479
 stars and the amount of money available 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.500
 are needed 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.500
 let's improve our oracle so 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:22.720
 she got us some skill skill 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:27.070
 first-stage ignition at all 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.000
 Creatures skill most often given the most 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.090
 bad the smallest so just 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.950
 so improve for the sake of improvement itself 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.520
 to add 150 lives there and become 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.970
 I do not see the point because 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.100
 improving first you have a card 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.580
 becomes more expensive by 3 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.220
 that is, you can tritely don't 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.080
 accommodate all your best cards in hand 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.500
 deck a second 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.950
 the value of the card from the village rises 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.410
 and in such duels you will 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.380
 just come stronger rivals 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:15.790
 because of this and so after you 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:20.070
 improved you can get a coupon if 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.489
 click to share on facebook buttons 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:28.480
 so get him a coupon for this 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.630
 a small bonus and probably about 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.730
 improvements all because it's enough 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.220
 simply 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.540
 merge everything 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.190
 a lot more a little more confusing 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.440
 much more interesting for then for 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.780
 mergers you need already 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.730
 it is improved maps 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:00.260
 and let's for example with a manticore 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:03.250
 try to do something other than this 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.290
 improved maps you definitely need 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.140
 duplicate this card so i have it 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.830
 unlocking and put this duplicate 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.830
 as a result of the merger destroyed here 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.760
 so 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.190
 the merger is quite so expensive 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.730
 expensive thing 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.100
 and I recommend doing it 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.580
 these merge only on special 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.489
 special promotions that will be me 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.760
 just now just show you so i 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:42.940
 I will only wait for the reaction too 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:46.370
 hold all your mergers and so we 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.340
 chose the creature we want 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.930
 make 4 skill chose his duplicate 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:59.900
 Now choose a creature with 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.329
 whom we want to put our skill i 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.540
 I will put the skill here with this creature 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:09.769
 not androv with a sentinel storm of battle eight 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.799
 fifty percent chance 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:18.450
 increase base damage ie manticore 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:21.690
 will not beat 400 as she is now her 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:27.710
 attack and maybe hit all a thousand 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:33.240
 and so look what we get 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.600
 here we have chosen this skill let's still 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.600
 time 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.300
 see here it is here 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.130
 is written 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:50.440
 can learn beings 3 you 5 class 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:54.520
 that is , different skills can be different 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.320
 such descriptions be this skill 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.800
 stone skin for example just for 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:06.070
 fourth or fifth grade here we are 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.060
 selected and now see what we have 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.480
 it turns out we have to merge ours 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:18.070
 we will pay 920 thousand gold that is 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:21.550
 almost 1 million and this million we 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.930
 pay for only 15 percent 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:29.320
 chance of success that we have our 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.170
 merge thats that's what cola progress 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:37.900
 it shows how much you already 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:41.530
 conducted mergers and how close you are to 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:45.700
 the final to the already successful appearance 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:48.310
 skill that is guaranteed you 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.600
 get for this skill only when you have 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:55.270
 scale this will fill one hundred percent 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:00.280
 may be lucky now may be unlucky 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:03.390
 but I actually expected this skill 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:10.090
 Will be cheaper, see the blog 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:13.600
 he cost him 400,000 and a chance of success 20 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.670
 percent here we have it more expensive 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.960
 skill but naturally because he 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.980
 much better probably so i won't 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.050
 still hold 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:29.080
 when will the event I still show you 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:32.630
 clearly this action of discounts for mergers 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.910
 so i'm telling so now 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.210
 when 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:41.300
 if we clicked this button here 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.540
 scale probably filled to 15 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:51.020
 percent here is this being with us 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:53.360
 this has disappeared and this remains to 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.850
 continue merging further we need 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.980
 choose the next manticore again 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.730
 merge scale is still full 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.530
 Little 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:07.400
 and so on until it reaches 100 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:11.390
 percent can of course before but more often 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:16.280
 just need to finish until the end and then 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:19.000
 This is ours. 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.700
 merger successful 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.180
 with a successful merger this creature 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:30.050
 donor she also disappears with us and remains 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:33.320
 only this is the final manticore 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:37.450
 there will be 4 skill but so that it opens up 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:40.210
 you need to pump up to level 15, which is also 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:43.240
 takes a lot of resources 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:48.710
 so do the merge 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:52.790
 deliberately understand what you do not 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:58.940
 waste your gold improve 

00:07:52.790 --> 00:08:03.110
 only what really matters to you 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:06.290
 next video i will tell you what 

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:12.290
 what creatures and what skills are most often 

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:15.680
 hang put on this we our review 

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:18.729
 finish all thanks bye bye 

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.729
 until next meetings
