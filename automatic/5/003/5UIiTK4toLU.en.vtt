00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.890 
this is looking amazing so far I am not
noticing<00:02:28.989> any<00:02:29.380> sort<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.099> clumps<00:02:30.970> or<00:02:31.150> anything

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
noticing any sort of clumps or anything

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:47.199 
noticing any sort of clumps or anything
it's<00:02:32.819> very<00:02:33.819> smooth<00:02:34.810> going<00:02:35.470> on<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.250> lashes

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.160 

oh<00:02:47.379> yeah<00:02:48.379> I<00:02:49.129> can<00:02:49.400> feel<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:49.640> coding<00:02:50.239> every

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
oh yeah I can feel it coding every

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.390 
oh yeah I can feel it coding every
single<00:02:51.769> lash<00:02:52.069> that<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:52.549> apply<00:02:53.060> those<00:02:53.390> two

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.479 

it's<00:02:59.150> not<00:02:59.269> heavy<00:02:59.690> at<00:02:59.870> all<00:02:59.900> it's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.650> very<00:03:00.680> thin

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
it's not heavy at all it's a very thin

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:14.970 
it's not heavy at all it's a very thin
and<00:03:01.810> flowing<00:03:02.810> almost<00:03:03.050> like<00:03:03.379> Airy<00:03:04.269> consistency

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.790 

very<00:03:15.980> lengthening<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:17.090> really<00:03:17.990> see<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.440> trying

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
very lengthening I really see it trying

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.300 
very lengthening I really see it trying
to<00:03:18.890> pull<00:03:19.370> my<00:03:19.610> lashes<00:03:19.880> up<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.840> not<00:03:21.380> strain<00:03:21.950> them

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
to pull my lashes up and not strain them

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.250 
to pull my lashes up and not strain them
I<00:03:22.610> definitely<00:03:23.420> definitely<00:03:23.600> see<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.200> difference

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
I definitely definitely see a difference

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.160 
I definitely definitely see a difference
between<00:03:24.770> high-end<00:03:25.550> mascaras<00:03:26.420> rather<00:03:26.810> than

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
between high-end mascaras rather than

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.130 
between high-end mascaras rather than
drugstore<00:03:27.980> mascaras<00:03:28.610> separates<00:03:29.180> amazingly<00:03:29.780> I

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
drugstore mascaras separates amazingly I

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.930 
drugstore mascaras separates amazingly I
don't<00:03:30.380> see<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.680> thickening<00:03:31.190> too<00:03:31.460> much<00:03:31.640> it's

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
don't see it thickening too much it's

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.240 
don't see it thickening too much it's
really<00:03:32.300> just<00:03:32.480> lengthening<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.470> far<00:03:33.740> that's

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
really just lengthening so far that's

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.590 
really just lengthening so far that's
why<00:03:34.400> I'm<00:03:34.520> giving<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.940> just<00:03:35.150> like<00:03:35.330> about<00:03:35.540> a

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
why I'm giving it just like about a

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.560 
why I'm giving it just like about a
minute<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.320> dry<00:03:36.650> or<00:03:36.950> get<00:03:37.130> tacky<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.360> been

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
minute to dry or get tacky and it's been

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.600 
minute to dry or get tacky and it's been
about<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.710> will<00:03:39.950> apply<00:03:40.220> again

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
about that and I will apply again

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.240 
about that and I will apply again
because<00:03:40.880> that's<00:03:41.030> what<00:03:41.360> usually<00:03:41.900> will<00:03:42.560> allow

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
because that's what usually will allow

00:03:43.250 --> 00:04:00.949 
because that's what usually will allow
thickness<00:03:44.180> or<00:03:45.400> spidery<00:03:46.400> or<00:03:46.610> clumpy<00:03:47.420> lashes

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.800 

and<00:04:01.829> it's<00:04:02.040> almost<00:04:02.250> like<00:04:02.489> effortless<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:03.659> I'm

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
and it's almost like effortless like I'm

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.599 
and it's almost like effortless like I'm
applying<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.469> and<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:05.040> don't<00:04:05.099> have<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.430> do<00:04:05.579> too

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
applying it and I don't have to do too

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.640 
applying it and I don't have to do too
many<00:04:05.909> techniques<00:04:06.450> sometimes<00:04:07.140> I'll<00:04:07.260> tilt<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
many techniques sometimes I'll tilt the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.459 
many techniques sometimes I'll tilt the
brush<00:04:07.859> and<00:04:08.280> go<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.969> in<00:04:09.299> certain<00:04:09.540> motions<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.379> I

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
brush and go in in certain motions and I

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.110 
brush and go in in certain motions and I
don't<00:04:10.680> have<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:11.040> do<00:04:11.219> that<00:04:11.430> with<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.030> I

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
don't have to do that with this and I

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.789 
don't have to do that with this and I
guess<00:04:12.299> that's<00:04:12.810> what<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.170> really<00:04:13.409> pay<00:04:13.620> the

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
guess that's what you really pay the

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.640 
guess that's what you really pay the
money<00:04:14.040> for<00:04:14.129> is<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:15.180> better<00:04:15.420> consistency<00:04:15.989> in

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
money for is the better consistency in

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.099 
money for is the better consistency in
the<00:04:16.829> better<00:04:17.039> wand<00:04:17.489> action<00:04:18.329> here<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
the better wand action here is the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.979 
the better wand action here is the
before<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.680> after<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:21.030> lashes<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.840> there

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
before and after of the lashes so there

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.790 
before and after of the lashes so there
is<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.259> difference<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:26.210> don't<00:04:27.210> know<00:04:27.449> I<00:04:27.479> was<00:04:28.080> I'm

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
is a difference I don't know I was I'm

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.260 
is a difference I don't know I was I'm
kind<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.190> on<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.430> fence<00:04:29.610> like<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.000> didn't

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
kind of on the fence like it didn't

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.900 
kind of on the fence like it didn't
completely<00:04:30.720> blow<00:04:31.259> me<00:04:31.530> away<00:04:31.560> but<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.370> wasn't

completely blow me away but I wasn't

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.110 
completely blow me away but I wasn't
disappointed<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.199> I<00:04:34.410> do<00:04:34.560> feel<00:04:35.099> I<00:04:35.400> can<00:04:35.820> get

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
disappointed in it I do feel I can get

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.350 
disappointed in it I do feel I can get
similar<00:04:36.509> results<00:04:37.039> with<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.580> manga<00:04:39.180> mascara

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.010 
similar results with the manga mascara
or<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.560> rocket<00:04:41.220> mascara<00:04:41.750> similar<00:04:42.750> not<00:04:42.960> the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
same but very similar but this one does

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.270 
same but very similar but this one does
hold<00:04:46.650> my<00:04:46.889> lashes<00:04:47.460> up<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:48.389> overall<00:04:49.020> I<00:04:49.080> think<00:04:49.259> yes
