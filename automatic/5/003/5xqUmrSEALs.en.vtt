I'm<00:01:39.670> over<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.150> hood<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.540> makes<00:01:40.660> it<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.110> little

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
I'm over the hood that makes it a little

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.520 
I'm over the hood that makes it a little
more<00:01:41.560> difficult<00:01:42.250> but<00:01:43.000> artistically<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.320> made

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
more difficult but artistically it made

00:01:44.530 --> 00:02:11.140 
more difficult but artistically it made
it<00:01:44.650> more<00:01:44.860> difficult<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.880> technically

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.110 

she<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.840> very<00:02:12.080> strong<00:02:12.489> athletically<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:14.000> I

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
she is very strong athletically and I

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.030 
she is very strong athletically and I
think<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.450> will<00:02:14.599> stand<00:02:14.870> her<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.349> good<00:02:15.620> stead

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
think that will stand her in good stead

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.870 
think that will stand her in good stead
over<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.819> next<00:02:17.030> few<00:02:17.299> years

over the next few years

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.000 
over the next few years
I<00:02:18.940> think<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.900> interesting<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.770> all

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
I think it's so interesting to see all

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.650 
I think it's so interesting to see all
the<00:02:21.280> different<00:02:21.820> levels<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.450> sophistication

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the different levels of sophistication

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.320 
the different levels of sophistication
and<00:02:23.530> all<00:02:23.680> these<00:02:23.920> top<00:02:24.250> ladies<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.060> there's

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
and all these top ladies and there's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:41.630 
and all these top ladies and there's
such<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> wide<00:02:26.380> range<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:27.660> Ages

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.120 

that's<00:02:42.150> been<00:02:42.450> far<00:02:43.050> better<00:02:43.080> than<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.740> she<00:02:43.770> did

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
that's been far better than what she did

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.720 
that's been far better than what she did

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
lutz and I guess I just held back a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.920 
lutz and I guess I just held back a
little<00:03:49.980> bit<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.460> I<00:03:50.970> waited<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.660> little<00:03:51.780> too

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
little bit and I waited a little too

little bit and I waited a little too
long<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.770> my<00:03:53.750> tack<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.990> get<00:03:55.140> in<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:56.460> just<00:03:56.640> I

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
long for my tack to get in and it just I

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.360 
long for my tack to get in and it just I
over<00:03:57.660> rotated<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.560> couldn't<00:03:59.100> get<00:03:59.190> out<00:03:59.340> of

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
over rotated it and couldn't get out of

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.250 
over rotated it and couldn't get out of
it<00:03:59.610> quick<00:03:59.670> enough<00:04:00.030> once<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:00.750> got<00:04:00.870> past<00:04:01.140> that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
it quick enough once we got past that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.690 
it quick enough once we got past that
though<00:04:01.530> didn't<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:01.770> feel<00:04:01.980> pretty<00:04:02.250> confident

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
though didn't you feel pretty confident

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.360 
though didn't you feel pretty confident
particularly<00:04:03.180> with<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.390> triple<00:04:03.720> loop<00:04:04.370> well

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
particularly with the triple loop well

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.180 
particularly with the triple loop well
up<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.180> debacle<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:07.050> mean<00:04:07.320> I<00:04:07.560> had<00:04:07.980> double

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
up to the debacle I mean I had double

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.100 
up to the debacle I mean I had double
axel<00:04:08.610> necks<00:04:08.790> right<00:04:09.000> away<00:04:09.210> and<00:04:09.480> then<00:04:09.990> my

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
axel necks right away and then my

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.110 
axel necks right away and then my
trouble<00:04:10.410> toe<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:10.980> was<00:04:11.460> pretty<00:04:11.670> confident

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
trouble toe so I was pretty confident

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.950 
trouble toe so I was pretty confident
but<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:13.560> triple<00:04:14.100> lutz<00:04:14.250> just<00:04:14.660> drove<00:04:15.660> me<00:04:15.750> crazy

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
but that triple lutz just drove me crazy

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.560 
but that triple lutz just drove me crazy
