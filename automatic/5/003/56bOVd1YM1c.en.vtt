than<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.600> CTSV<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.740> couple<00:01:29.130> inches

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
than the CTSV it is it's a couple inches

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
than the CTSV it is it's a couple inches
longer<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:31.290> most<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
longer and I think most of that

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.069 
longer and I think most of that
translates<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.549> rear<00:01:33.119> legroom<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.869> there's<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
translates to rear legroom so there's a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.420 
translates to rear legroom so there's a
little<00:01:34.259> bit<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.950> crunched<00:01:35.340> in

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
little bit which was kind of crunched in

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.020 
little bit which was kind of crunched in
the<00:01:35.490> CTSV

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the CTSV

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.520 
the CTSV
yeah<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> don't<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> mean<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.320> more

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
yeah so I don't know I mean it's it more

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.910 
yeah so I don't know I mean it's it more
like<00:01:37.799> eClass<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.180> five<00:01:39.720> series<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
like eClass and five series or is it

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
like eClass and five series or is it
more<00:01:41.100> three<00:01:41.549> series<00:01:41.880> I'm<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.150> sure<00:01:42.270> word<00:01:42.479> fits

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
more three series I'm not sure word fits

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780 
more three series I'm not sure word fits
and<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.990> think<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> large<00:01:44.460> side

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and I think it's more for the large side

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.389 
and I think it's more for the large side
right<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> little<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:46.049> true<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.350> almost<00:01:46.799> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
right it is a little bit true I almost I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.700 
right it is a little bit true I almost I
mean<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.000> body<00:01:48.509> cells<00:01:48.780> Cadillac<00:01:49.320> now<00:01:49.500> is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
mean the body cells Cadillac now is

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.380 
mean the body cells Cadillac now is
smaller<00:01:50.040> yeah<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> feel<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:50.939> that's<00:01:51.090> more

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
smaller yeah and I feel like that's more

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.080 
smaller yeah and I feel like that's more
of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.540> 3-series<00:01:52.140> competitor<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.909> got

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
of the 3-series competitor but it's got

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.020 
of the 3-series competitor but it's got
that<00:01:54.240> magnetic<00:01:54.750> ride<00:01:55.040> shocks<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.549> were

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that magnetic ride shocks that you were

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.670 
that magnetic ride shocks that you were
on<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> previous<00:01:57.450> Cadillac<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
on the previous Cadillac and the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.700 
on the previous Cadillac and the
Corvette<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.420> V<00:02:00.600> Sport<00:02:00.960> has<00:02:01.140> basically<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
Corvette the V Sport has basically the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.920 
Corvette the V Sport has basically the
same<00:02:02.009> differential<00:02:02.790> that's<00:02:03.540> in

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
same differential that's in

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.140 
same differential that's in
the<00:02:04.860> limited-slip<00:02:05.250> that's<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.730> Corvette

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
the limited-slip that's in the Corvette

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.210 
the limited-slip that's in the Corvette
one<00:02:06.690> thing<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.050> like<00:02:07.200> around<00:02:07.500> turns<00:02:07.800> about

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
one thing I was like around turns about

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.300 
one thing I was like around turns about
Cadillacs<00:02:09.000> was<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:10.020> sort<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.350> avionics

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
Cadillacs was the the sort of avionics

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.820 
Cadillacs was the the sort of avionics
of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> whole<00:02:11.670> thing<00:02:11.910> inside<00:02:12.840> yes<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.710> think

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
of the whole thing inside yes I think

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.560 
of the whole thing inside yes I think
the<00:02:13.980> same<00:02:14.190> kind<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.580> intuitive<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.450> are

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
the same kind of intuitive they are

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.940 
the same kind of intuitive they are
they're<00:02:15.720> getting<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.020> right<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.380> love<00:02:16.740> that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
they're getting it right I love that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.620 
they're getting it right I love that
wheel<00:02:17.130> by<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.430> way<00:02:17.580> yeah<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.270> love<00:02:18.600> that

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
wheel by the way yeah I love that

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.630 
wheel by the way yeah I love that
performance<00:02:19.230> wheel<00:02:21.320> twin<00:02:22.320> turbo<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.550> know

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
performance wheel twin turbo you know

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.480 
performance wheel twin turbo you know
the<00:02:24.540> competitor<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.140> course<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:26.100> probably

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
the competitor of course is is probably

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.960 
the competitor of course is is probably
the<00:02:26.910> German<00:02:27.270> cars<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.070> they<00:02:29.070> used<00:02:29.370> aluminum

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
the German cars and they used aluminum

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.700 
the German cars and they used aluminum
hood<00:02:30.150> aluminum<00:02:30.690> doors<00:02:30.960> they<00:02:31.320> have<00:02:31.470> like

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
hood aluminum doors they have like

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.610 
hood aluminum doors they have like
magnesium<00:02:32.300> engine<00:02:33.300> mounts<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:34.020> really<00:02:34.410> did

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
magnesium engine mounts they really did

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.750 
magnesium engine mounts they really did
what<00:02:34.770> they<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.190> cut<00:02:35.370> weight<00:02:35.550> off<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
what they can to cut weight off and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.340 
what they can to cut weight off and
where<00:02:36.060> its<00:02:36.180> competitors<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:36.810> around<00:02:37.020> forty

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
where its competitors are around forty

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.290 
where its competitors are around forty
four<00:02:37.530> hundred<00:02:37.560> pounds<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.490> just<00:02:39.000> under

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
four hundred pounds this is just under

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.320 
four hundred pounds this is just under
4,000<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.490> moving<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
4,000 and because of that and moving the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.630 
4,000 and because of that and moving the
battery<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.959> back<00:02:43.110> it's<00:02:43.470> got<00:02:43.620> 50<00:02:44.040> 50<00:02:44.370> front

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
battery to the back it's got 50 50 front

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640 
battery to the back it's got 50 50 front
to<00:02:44.700> rear<00:02:44.880> weight<00:02:45.240> ratio<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> balance<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
to rear weight ratio so the balance of

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.380 
to rear weight ratio so the balance of
this<00:02:46.860> car<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.280> way<00:02:47.640> better<00:02:47.850> than<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.209> think

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this car is way better than you think

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.090 
this car is way better than you think
and<00:02:48.600> although<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.020> still<00:02:49.110> 4,000<00:02:49.800> pounds

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
and although it's still 4,000 pounds

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.190 
and although it's still 4,000 pounds
just<00:02:50.280> under<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.700> feels<00:02:51.300> lighter<00:02:51.690> than<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.050> is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
just under it feels lighter than it is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.370 
just under it feels lighter than it is
is<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.100> fact<00:02:53.459> true<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.360> CTSV<00:02:54.780> had<00:02:55.230> one

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
is that fact true that the CTSV had one

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.840 
is that fact true that the CTSV had one
of<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.530> fastest<00:02:55.950> times<00:02:56.160> around<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
of the fastest times around the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.150 
of the fastest times around the
Nurburgring<00:02:57.270> for<00:02:57.840> today<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.230> first<00:02:58.590> Dan<00:02:58.830> yeah

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
Nurburgring for today on first Dan yeah

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.800 
Nurburgring for today on first Dan yeah
so<00:02:59.550> I'm<00:02:59.670> sure<00:02:59.850> they<00:02:59.970> translated<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.540> lot<00:03:00.690> of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
so I'm sure they translated a lot of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.600 
so I'm sure they translated a lot of
what<00:03:00.930> they<00:03:01.110> had<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.320> mat<00:03:01.560> into<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:01.950> car<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
what they had a mat into this car the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.400 
what they had a mat into this car the
suspension<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.240> imagine<00:03:03.630> yes<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.170> car<00:03:04.380> is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
suspension I imagine yes but this car is

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.470 
suspension I imagine yes but this car is
it's<00:03:04.950> beautiful<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.640> drive<00:03:05.880> around<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
it's beautiful to drive around on the
