a bracket that holds the cooler for a
cobra<00:02:14.810> Mustang<00:02:15.500> car<00:02:16.070> built<00:02:16.730> by<00:02:16.910> Ford<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.720> we

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
cobra Mustang car built by Ford so we

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.130 
cobra Mustang car built by Ford so we
put<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.310> clinch<00:02:20.080> nuts<00:02:21.310> clinch<00:02:22.310> studs<00:02:23.140> into

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
put the clinch nuts clinch studs into

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.890 
put the clinch nuts clinch studs into
this<00:02:24.260> part<00:02:24.650> we<00:02:24.920> welded<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.550> together<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:26.690> also

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
this part we welded it together we also

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
this part we welded it together we also
sent<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.770> out<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.430> its<00:02:28.730> zinc<00:02:29.540> phosphate<00:02:30.530> under

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
sent it out for its zinc phosphate under

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.270 
sent it out for its zinc phosphate under
coating<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.550> black<00:02:32.390> epoxy<00:02:32.900> top<00:02:33.620> coat

coating and black epoxy top coat
we've<00:02:34.850> provided<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.540> customer<00:02:36.410> with<00:02:36.950> a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
we've provided that customer with a

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.210 
we've provided that customer with a
finished<00:02:37.460> part<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.330> their<00:02:38.480> specification<00:02:39.470> we

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
finished part to their specification we

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.400 
finished part to their specification we
did<00:02:40.430> one<00:02:40.640> other<00:02:40.820> thing<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:41.450> project<00:02:41.750> when

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
did one other thing in this project when

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.400 
did one other thing in this project when
we<00:02:42.440> made<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.240> prototype<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:44.660> was<00:02:44.960> two<00:02:45.200> parts

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
we made the prototype this was two parts

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.100 
we made the prototype this was two parts
so<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.040> had<00:02:46.400> two<00:02:46.640> parts<00:02:46.970> here<00:02:47.210> two<00:02:47.510> parts<00:02:47.840> here

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
so you had two parts here two parts here

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.380 
so you had two parts here two parts here
they<00:02:48.530> were<00:02:48.590> welded<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.790> center<00:02:50.150> together

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
they were welded in the center together

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.530 
they were welded in the center together
and<00:02:50.900> my<00:02:51.260> partner<00:02:51.820> redesigned<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:53.060> for<00:02:53.330> one

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
and my partner redesigned it for one

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.690 
and my partner redesigned it for one
part<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.020> we<00:02:54.350> submitted<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.070> Honeywell

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
part and we submitted that to Honeywell

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.930 
part and we submitted that to Honeywell
which<00:02:56.270> then<00:02:56.690> took<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.110> Ford<00:02:57.470> they<00:02:58.400> approved

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
which then took it to Ford they approved

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.320 
which then took it to Ford they approved
it<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.990> because<00:03:00.680> we<00:03:01.070> took<00:03:01.340> out<00:03:01.550> 12<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.270> half

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
it so because we took out 12 and a half

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.380 
it so because we took out 12 and a half
inches<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.140> welding<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.860> we<00:03:04.250> saved<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:05.000> the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
inches of welding and we saved on the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.170 
inches of welding and we saved on the
design<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.230> tooling<00:03:06.740> we<00:03:07.340> eliminated<00:03:07.970> two

design and the tooling we eliminated two
tools<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:09.080> took<00:03:09.350> we<00:03:09.890> reduce<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.520> by<00:03:10.820> four

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
tools we took we reduce this by four

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.260 
tools we took we reduce this by four
