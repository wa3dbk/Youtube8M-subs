00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.450

 hello to all guys and welcome back on 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.340
 codes that there is something after today 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.710
 record v 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.960
 now it definitely looks better as they seem 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.640
 much more normal than professional like 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.420
 that annoyance can at least you are the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 right off the roads that must be 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.690
 the father fuck off today, very few boys 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.030
 minutes we propose a short video on 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.160
 an optimization because it is not about 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.750
 just like a product like it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.059
 wait it is more of a product 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.250
 for an exact optimization guys me 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.070
 I know I'm sick, but a second 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.649
 since I have 10,000 pair of headphones for 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.660
 whatever the fuck they are manic stand 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.180
 they are looking for headphone stands 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.309
 of which support our 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 wonderful wonderful hences to do 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.940
 see everyone and as usual the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 our dear friend luca of enermax 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.600
 renault ze to our rescue and vi 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.979
 we will propose besides the elmec solution 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.930
 they hear other solutions that are 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.760
 available on the market and are not for 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.650
 not bad since it's a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.470
 pretty generalist video guys there 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.659
 we leave in description all types of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.700
 stand that we are going to propose to you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.770
 during the exact video but let's start with it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.480
 speak we talk about a normal one for example 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.630
 how can this be very normal 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.480
 handset stand that just support it 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.760
 above and it is normal however it is cool and 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.530
 showcases point elevating ours 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.380
 headphones without messing up to the point 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.690
 comfort in that offered by enermax 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.170
 in the model offered by enermax it is really 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:46.360
 the presence of five very powerful super 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:53.080
 magnetic crack and local screw magnets 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:55.030
 that the bit is a black these 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.840
 fantastic 5 magnets that allow us 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.150
 to handle it on iron surfaces speaks 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.250
 metal part cites boys is 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.710
 phenomenal enough to apply it also in 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.440
 back of the case po next to the kate and if 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.210
 of course there is the plasticized satta Network 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.520
 which you can put on your headphones 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.680
 looks like a shit never really cool e 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.200
 there is a clumsy person leaning on it 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.290
 the headphones are made of rubber so you can too 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.990
 if you can order it and it's cool 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.330
 you can place it anywhere and canvasses 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.510
 on your headphones is currently the most 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.520
 cool and minimal that is around and then yes 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 closes a photo point or a 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.420
 you can even put it in your pocket 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.330
 small flaw is that there are many 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.610
 many headset headphones that have that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.920
 sort of headband above the headphones that 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.020
 if you tend in this way it is not 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.550
 indeed very well supported is the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.870
 headphone connection while instead 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.300
 a stand like the one we did 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.250
 see before it rests on the whole 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.160
 structure and does not go to pull too much 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.170
 the bow there are a thousand others lying down 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.420
 7 psychopaths ie the one with a head 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.790
 of glass that you can put on or 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.540
 of wood and aluminum with different prices 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.190
 so you can put design let's say 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.410
 of your room is area move from 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.739
 gaming as you please because 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.660
 however as we all think it is 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.980
 important for many this thing 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:23.150
 we could do a design gaming column 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.709
 if July for fucking improvements 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.409
 in short, guys, this is a bit of a video 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.299
 useless, however, we already anticipate you 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.519
 that there is a lot of water boiling in 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.360
 pot because we have heat sinks 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.519
 4k screens for aircraft missiles 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.980
 we say that this spring has not been 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.690
 at the beginning of summer it will be 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.690
 really cool for a lot of 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.129
 previews a lot of new stuff 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.670
 heatsink new stuff to review that 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.129
 will really make you god come on 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.290
 screen then as usual for 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.730
 end if you have a headset you don't have 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.690
 a stander take this standard 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.690
 because really cool 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.230
 leave us online if you liked the 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.090
 video is obviously we link your children 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.140
 of God 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.120
 obviously we link our video 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.129
 on the audio especially on the headphones that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.200
 recommend so as to be able to put the 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.959
 most ideal headphones on this set like 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.919
 are the plantronics I've reviewed or the 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.989
 our very dear super lux that I am 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.530
