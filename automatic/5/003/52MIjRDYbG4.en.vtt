 peripheral quality session 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.189
 mainly from mastitis the intermediate one that affects the quality the most

 eliminate any possibility of confusion other treatment 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:49.809
 plant 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:51.410
 has a scale 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.399
 where the corresponding weighings of the milk are made 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.649
 to calculate the exact yield of processed cheeses 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:06.210
 The production capacity of the plant is 3 thousand 200 liters per way 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.969
 nowadays 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.039
 Latina that will have a capacity of 500 liters per shift 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:16.930
 and that one thousand liters can easily be produced in two shifts per day 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.070
 equivalent to 1 120 monks pop kilos of cheese daily

 packed 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.789
 they are done in base 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.899
 of polypropylene that allow to guarantee the life of the product for a period 

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:51.169
