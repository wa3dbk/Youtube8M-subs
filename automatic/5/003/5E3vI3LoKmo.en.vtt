overlays<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> things<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.410> notice

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
down now I can see the area that's going

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.330 
down now I can see the area that's going
to<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.960> cropped<00:01:13.260> off<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> area

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to be cropped off and it's the area

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340 
to be cropped off and it's the area
that's<00:01:14.549> gray<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.210> I'll<00:01:15.360> reposition<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that's gray there I'll reposition the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
that's gray there I'll reposition the
image<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.280> looks<00:01:17.310> pretty<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.210> double

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

click<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.960> apply<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.439> crop<00:01:19.799> okay<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> think

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
click to apply that crop okay I think

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.710 
click to apply that crop okay I think
that's<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.119> bit<00:01:21.330> more<00:01:21.450> interesting

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that's a little bit more interesting

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
that's a little bit more interesting
it's<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.100> person

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it's a little bit more about the person

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
it's a little bit more about the person
a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:24.180> bit<00:01:24.299> less<00:01:24.540> about<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.990> environment

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
a little bit less about the environment

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.890 
a little bit less about the environment
I<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.130> ok<00:01:26.909> well<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.630> color

add a little bit of fill light and I
like<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.430> fill<00:01:38.729> light<00:01:38.939> as

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
like to think of fill light as

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
like to think of fill light as
reflective<00:01:39.960> light<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.320> almost<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
reflective light it's almost like you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.170 
reflective light it's almost like you
have<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> reflector<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.670> bounce<00:01:41.880> some

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
have a reflector you can bounce some

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
have a reflector you can bounce some
light<00:01:42.360> into<00:01:42.509> those<00:01:42.659> shadow<00:01:42.899> areas<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
light into those shadow areas like the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
light into those shadow areas like the
shadow<00:01:44.130> areas<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> eyes<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
shadow areas in the eyes so I'm going to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230 
shadow areas in the eyes so I'm going to
go<00:01:45.689> ahead<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.899> increase<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:47.100> fill<00:01:48.030> or

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
go ahead and increase the fill or

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.550 
go ahead and increase the fill or
reflective<00:01:48.810> light<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:49.229> okay<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
reflective light in there okay that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.880 
reflective light in there okay that
looks<00:01:49.710> quite<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> bit<00:01:50.579> better<00:01:51.680> add<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> little

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
looks quite a bit better add a little

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.789 
looks quite a bit better add a little
bit<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> contrast<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:55.140> save<00:01:55.470> some

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
bit of contrast here and then save some

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.350 
bit of contrast here and then save some
of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> highlights<00:01:56.340> there<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.820> recovery

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
of the highlights there with recovery

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
of the highlights there with recovery
let's<00:01:57.930> look<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.170> our<00:01:58.229> before<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> after<00:01:58.979> we'll

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
let's look at our before and after we'll

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.459 
let's look at our before and after we'll
do<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> by<00:01:59.909> pressing<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.390> backslash<00:02:00.780> key<00:02:00.840> so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
do that by pressing the backslash key so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.620 
do that by pressing the backslash key so
here's<00:02:01.649> before<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.340> here's<00:02:02.820> after<00:02:03.270> okay<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
here's before and here's after okay the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.670 
here's before and here's after okay the
image<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> good<00:02:04.530> direction

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
image is going to a good direction

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.069 
image is going to a good direction
except<00:02:05.310> there's<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.240> there's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.780> little<00:02:06.930> bit

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
except there's just there's a little bit

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
except there's just there's a little bit
too<00:02:07.350> much<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.710> shadow<00:02:08.039> around<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.520> eyes<00:02:08.670> so

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
too much of a shadow around the eyes so

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.040 
too much of a shadow around the eyes so
in<00:02:09.690> order<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.020> fix<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.619> I'm<00:02:10.830> going

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
in order to fix that I'm going

that's<00:02:35.980> much<00:02:36.220> too<00:02:36.490> big<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.300> I'm<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.450> to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
that's much too big so I'm going to

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.000 
that's much too big so I'm going to
decrease<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> couple<00:02:38.590> different<00:02:38.680> ways<00:02:38.950> to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
decrease it a couple different ways to

decrease it a couple different ways to
decrease<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.730> easiest<00:02:40.330> way<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.780> use<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
decrease it easiest way is to use the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.990 
decrease it easiest way is to use the
bracket<00:02:41.890> key<00:02:42.010> i'll<00:02:42.100> press<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.460> left<00:02:42.760> bracket

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
key now I have a much smaller brush

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.040 
key now I have a much smaller brush
there<00:02:45.070> all<00:02:45.670> right<00:02:45.940> auto<00:02:46.240> mask<00:02:46.600> I'm<00:02:46.810> going<00:02:46.990> to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
there all right auto mask I'm going to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.950 
there all right auto mask I'm going to
turn<00:02:47.230> off<00:02:47.880> feather<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:49.000> want<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.420> pretty<00:02:49.750> high

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
turn off feather I want a pretty high

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.140 
turn off feather I want a pretty high
feather<00:02:50.200> amount<00:02:50.700> not<00:02:51.700> quite<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.090> high

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
feather amount not quite that high

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.060 
feather amount not quite that high
though<00:02:52.510> go<00:02:52.690> down<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.990> 50s<00:02:53.410> my<00:02:53.560> flowing<00:02:53.890> to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
though go down the 50s my flowing to

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.430 
though go down the 50s my flowing to
take<00:02:54.250> way<00:02:54.430> down<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:55.510> can<00:02:55.690> think<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.170> flow

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
take way down you can think of the flow

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.680 
take way down you can think of the flow
as<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> intensity<00:02:57.490> of<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.610> effect<00:02:58.030> with<00:02:58.660> a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
as the intensity of the effect with a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.840 
as the intensity of the effect with a
low<00:02:59.020> flow<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.350> can<00:02:59.470> paint<00:02:59.890> some<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.670> just

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
low flow you can paint some and it just

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.280 
low flow you can paint some and it just
a<00:03:00.970> little<00:03:01.000> bit<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.510> effect<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:01.900> painted<00:03:02.200> in

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
a little bit of effect is painted in

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.110 
a little bit of effect is painted in
then<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.740> slowly<00:03:03.010> build<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.550> up<00:03:03.640> more<00:03:03.910> and

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
then you can slowly build it up more and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.880 
then you can slowly build it up more and
more<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.360> more<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.290> want<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.470> pretty<00:03:05.710> nice

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
more and more so I want a pretty nice
