 Kharkov Tractor Plant 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.010
 my area of ​​expertise is development 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.390
 new technology introduction to production 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.800
 Well, how would technology support 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.109
 fine then let's talk about 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.379
 technique that you represent here and 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.629
 In general, the plant produces for farmers 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 for which farmers for small 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.989
 for large and so on traditionally 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.190
 Kharkov tractor plant produces 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:10.550
 tractor segments power is small 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:13.939
 again 35 horsepower and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:22.079
 large tractor power range and 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:23.810
 80 to 250 vani all presented on this. 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.850
 exhibition 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.520
 over the last year Kharkov tractor 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.920
 the plant made a very strong breakthrough 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.439
 design improvement from 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.950
 The three Timakovs represented here are all 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.950
 are 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.730
 partly with new tractors and out 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.300
 in yourself very seriously 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.920
 novelty cops 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.760
 although it is in the same range 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.360
 power from 180 degrees and wheels 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.750
 horse 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.600
 something not intended to use and in 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.120
 not large farms let's say 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.000
 so well 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:13.570
 optimal use of large tractors 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.210
 probably begins with 150 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.210
 hectares for crop production 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.480
 well yes 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.760
 as if to large holdings there already 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.850
 flew no ie 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.940
 households are building technical with you 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.250
 Here is a small tractor Danish 35 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.000
 Horse power 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.390
 Ixion to use 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.260
 vegetable farm household is not tuki
