00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 fps began to expand in a way 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.710
 gigantic in the 90's a company 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.920
 which contributed much to this explosion 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.609
 of the genre was a software company 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.100
 who created the popular Sun and Wed. 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.820
 besides volks time which is considered the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.570
 first game of the genre here in Brazil 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.880
 a fps that has become quite popular 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.059
 was the counter strike that was only one 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.460
 modification of other fps as well 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.129
 known hoffe life 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.680
 we still did not have a fps 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.460
 a game that represented the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.149
 parents 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.030
 then in the year 1998 a company 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.550
 Brazilian called perseptom broke 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.539
 barriers creating the first fps 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.340
 Brazilian 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.340
 the incident in varginha 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.149
 I want my India 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.759
 since throughout the dispute to reach 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:17.140
 to brazil only 350 degrees 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:20.490
 15min - quickly both voice 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.250
 confirm dying change of attitude and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.890
 accelerating too much 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.700
 like the regional you read practically 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.710
 it's gone 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.710
 we lost eye contact and radar 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.159
 this clear game was actually based on the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.439
 incident that occurred in a small 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.259
 which is located in minas gerais where 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.259
 occurred appearances of UFO etc. 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:00.060
 the company realizes one was established in 1995 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.119
 by two people and is active until today 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.030
 although I have created the first fps here 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.649
 In Brazil she is not such a company. 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.830
 known to us 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.959
 In this game you are an ordinary citizen who 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.370
 come some aliens fleeing to the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.799
 downtown 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.540
 so you're the first human to do 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.540
 contact with these aliens 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.400
 soon after that you need to do 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.870
 contact with an alien who survived 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.300
 to this capture 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.300
 then it will pass some goals 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.739
 who thinks about buying 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.690
 one of them is to break a system of 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.540
 safety of a hospital to find 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.750
 more eliene jazz kill soldiers and so on 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.750
 go 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.560
 look like game of an ambiance 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.980
 cool pedestrians cars talk and also 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.000
 has its own maset music is not so 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.000
 cool so right 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.890
 good 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.950
 and as you have already noticed the lines in 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.550
 Portuguese 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.670
 my India already leaked something eye contact 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.070
 fast approaching this dubbing 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.340
 entirely in Portuguese makes you 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.120
 much more connected to the history of 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.850
 game 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.840
 The little that I remember is that I played 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.590
 this game 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.280
 long ago I was afraid of this 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.950
 game 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.950
 the noise the music was bizarre 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.120
 ah 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.120
 ae 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.730
 Finally, I congratulate you for the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.880
 company perceives so much that it broke 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.020
 barriers creating a fully fps 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.630
 Brazilian 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.130
 so here is a short video 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.680
 showing you 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.580
 the first fps created by a company 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.590
 Brazilian and if you liked the video, do not 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.460
 so go and click on the taste and I do not know 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.280
 down 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.650
 this helps a lot even if you channel 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.690

 classic virus clothing and it goes on there 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.320
 I 'm always exchanging ideas.
