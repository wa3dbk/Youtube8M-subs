JENNIFER MCGEE: I arrived and
saw the before space.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.310
The first thing that came to
mind was I wanted it to be

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.210
architectural.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.910
I wanted to use it for
multifunctional seating area,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.106
and to bring light
into the space.

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:25.660
I put in mirrors that went
straight across one wall, and

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.480
balanced it by the symmetry of
the two highboys next to them.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.570
It created the focal
point that the room

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.750
really didn't have.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.140
It was lacking something
that we walked in,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.710
and that wow moment.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.020
When we first saw the room, I
really felt that for the scale

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.340
of the room, that the casings
and the moldings didn't really

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.350
give it that grandeur.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.770
What we did was we built up the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.980
baseboards, made those higher.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.780
The ceiling heights were high,
they were nine feet.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.800
And I built all the casings
up and built the dog ears.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.120
So that was all customized, as
well as putting a picture rail

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.500
so that our artwork could
be hung there.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.910
The one main point that I really
felt was so important

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.570
was this focal point and view.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.070
A lot of dining rooms have
fireplaces or a focal point.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.130
This room did not.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.500
The mirrors added the light and
the elegance and glamour

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.260
that I thought the
room needed.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.110
So instead of just doing the
typical one mirror over a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.020
console, I made it as if it were
an art object and did a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.280
collage of four separate
mirrors.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.550
And of course, having art be
such a big part of the room, I

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.730
wanted to install that gorgeous
oil over the mirrors

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.980
themselves.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.270
I think that people, when they
think of a dining space, they

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.030
talk about what's the dining
room table look like?

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.000
What's my seating?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.460
But what I wanted to have people
envision is that we can

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.900
have two different spaces.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.030
You can create conversational
areas within it.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.890
Here at the front is where you'd
display your art and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.800
your finer things.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.400
The corner reflects where
you sit and you dine.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.200
There's many purposes
and functions

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.060
for this dining room.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.340
It's not just about the formal
dining room, because that's

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.160
not really how people
are living today.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.230
