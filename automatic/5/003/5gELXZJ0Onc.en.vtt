runs<00:01:30.869> off<00:01:31.049> basically<00:01:31.619> resetting<00:01:32.430> his

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
runs off basically resetting his

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
runs off basically resetting his
position<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> map<00:01:33.450> somewhere<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> alien

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
position on the map somewhere the alien

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
position on the map somewhere the alien
is<00:01:34.680> really<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.369> tall<00:01:35.579> he<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.820> fact<00:01:35.970> he's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
is really really tall he in fact he's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
is really really tall he in fact he's
like<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:36.930> feet<00:01:37.229> taller<00:01:37.500> than<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.890> original

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
like two feet taller than the original

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
like two feet taller than the original
alien<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.450> said<00:01:39.659> he's<00:01:39.780> literally

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
alien I think they said he's literally

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
alien I think they said he's literally
like<00:01:40.350> nine<00:01:40.590> feet<00:01:40.890> tall<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.430> game<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
like nine feet tall in this game and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
like nine feet tall in this game and
yeah<00:01:42.000> he's<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.420> imposing<00:01:42.810> what's<00:01:43.560> really

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
yeah he's pretty imposing what's really

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.800 
yeah he's pretty imposing what's really
great<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.340> game<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.540> is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
great about the game and I think this is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.420 
great about the game and I think this is
even<00:01:45.869> better<00:01:46.590> than<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> nice

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
even better than some of the nice

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.920 
even better than some of the nice
visuals<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> sound<00:01:48.390> design<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:48.810> we're

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
visuals is the sound design now we're

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.139 
visuals is the sound design now we're
playing<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.649> e3<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.130> these<00:01:50.250> big-ass<00:01:50.490> noise

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
playing at e3 with these big-ass noise

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
playing at e3 with these big-ass noise
cancelling<00:01:51.659> headphones<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.530> everything<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
cancelling headphones and everything in

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
cancelling headphones and everything in
the<00:01:53.040> game<00:01:53.130> had<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> very<00:01:53.700> precise<00:01:54.299> sound<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the game had a very precise sound to it

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.870 
the game had a very precise sound to it
if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.380> were<00:01:55.470> moving<00:01:55.649> things<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.369> things<00:01:56.579> fell

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
if you were moving things if things fell

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.060 
if you were moving things if things fell
off<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> counter<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.290> alien<00:01:58.710> walking

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
off for the counter the alien walking

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.440 
off for the counter the alien walking
around<00:01:59.280> had<00:01:59.430> his<00:01:59.579> own<00:01:59.670> distinct<00:02:00.119> sound

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
around had his own distinct sound

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.359 
around had his own distinct sound
everything<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.350> great<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:02.070> everything

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
everything was great because everything

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160 
everything was great because everything
sounded<00:02:02.820> unique<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.540> course<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> sound

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
sounded unique and of course the sound

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.660 
sounded unique and of course the sound
just<00:02:04.290> adds<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> scare<00:02:05.100> factor<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
just adds to the scare factor in the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.880 
just adds to the scare factor in the
game<00:02:05.820> as<00:02:06.000> well<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.020> might<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.619> hear

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
game as well so you might like hear

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.229 
game as well so you might like hear
something<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> might<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.670> nothing<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.149> you'll

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
something it might be nothing and you'll

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:09.790 
something it might be nothing and you'll
just<00:02:09.390> run

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
just run

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.350 
just run
corner<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.220> huddle<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.610> wait<00:02:10.790> there<00:02:11.030> what

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
corner and huddle and wait there what

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.760 
corner and huddle and wait there what
might<00:02:11.480> make<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.690> sound<00:02:11.930> like<00:02:12.050> total<00:02:12.320> scrubs<00:02:12.590> is

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
might make a sound like total scrubs is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.680 
might make a sound like total scrubs is
the<00:02:12.860> fact<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.220> neither<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.970> nor<00:02:14.030> Matt<00:02:14.450> except

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
the fact that neither I nor Matt except

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.450 
the fact that neither I nor Matt except
for<00:02:14.840> multiple<00:02:15.230> tribes<00:02:15.470> could<00:02:15.620> actually<00:02:15.920> beat

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
for multiple tribes could actually beat

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.700 
for multiple tribes could actually beat
the<00:02:16.670> demo<00:02:16.910> sadly<00:02:17.570> as<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.840> turns<00:02:18.050> out<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.440> seems

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
the demo sadly as it turns out it seems

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.830 
the demo sadly as it turns out it seems
only<00:02:19.010> 23<00:02:19.670> people<00:02:19.910> at<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.330> show<00:02:20.540> because<00:02:20.720> we

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
only 23 people at the show because we

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.910 
only 23 people at the show because we
were<00:02:20.900> playing<00:02:21.020> on<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.260> last<00:02:21.470> day<00:02:21.680> had

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
were playing on the last day had

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.830 
were playing on the last day had
actually<00:02:22.370> completed<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.150> challenge<00:02:23.210> room

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
actually completed this challenge room

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.660 
actually completed this challenge room
so<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.470> game<00:02:24.650> was<00:02:24.890> actually<00:02:25.040> pretty<00:02:25.430> hard

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
so the game was actually pretty hard

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.070 
so the game was actually pretty hard
maybe<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.120> was<00:02:26.270> boosted<00:02:26.690> up<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> higher

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
maybe it was boosted up to a higher

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.960 
maybe it was boosted up to a higher
difficulty<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.280> could<00:02:28.490> brag<00:02:28.760> about

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
difficulty just so you could brag about

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.060 
difficulty just so you could brag about
it<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.360> don't<00:02:29.540> really<00:02:29.690> know<00:02:29.900> what<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.230> do<00:02:30.350> know<00:02:30.710> is

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
it I don't really know what I do know is

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.280 
it I don't really know what I do know is
though<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.730> trying<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.450> sneak<00:02:32.780> around<00:02:32.960> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
though that trying to sneak around the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.800 
though that trying to sneak around the
alien<00:02:33.680> was<00:02:33.920> really<00:02:34.430> hard<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.820> he<00:02:34.970> was<00:02:35.120> near<00:02:35.510> you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
alien was really hard if he was near you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.540 
alien was really hard if he was near you
it<00:02:36.170> was<00:02:36.320> almost<00:02:36.500> impossible<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:37.310> get<00:02:37.460> away

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
it was almost impossible to get away

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.890 
it was almost impossible to get away
from<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.030> one<00:02:38.330> thing<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.630> makes<00:02:38.750> it

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
from it one thing that makes it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.990 
from it one thing that makes it
different<00:02:39.140> than<00:02:39.320> say<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.770> standard<00:02:40.340> zombie<00:02:40.820> or

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
different than say a standard zombie or

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.040 
different than say a standard zombie or
other<00:02:41.180> thing<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.630> alien<00:02:41.960> is

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
other thing is that the alien is

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.560 
other thing is that the alien is
actively<00:02:42.770> hunting<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:44.090> looking<00:02:44.510> for

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
actively hunting you it is looking for

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.450 
actively hunting you it is looking for
you<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:44.960> waiting<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.560> hear<00:02:45.800> anything<00:02:46.100> it's

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
you it's waiting to hear anything it's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.150 
you it's waiting to hear anything it's
it<00:02:46.820> actually<00:02:47.030> sniffs<00:02:47.660> out<00:02:47.900> areas<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.650> patrols

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
it actually sniffs out areas it patrols

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.430 
it actually sniffs out areas it patrols
it<00:02:49.520> is<00:02:49.640> it's<00:02:49.880> not<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:50.390> like<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> generic<00:02:51.110> hey<00:02:51.410> I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
it is it's not just like a generic hey I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.110 
it is it's not just like a generic hey I
bought<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:52.100> kind<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.520> just<00:02:52.670> goes<00:02:52.850> down<00:02:53.090> a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
bought that kind of just goes down a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.570 
bought that kind of just goes down a
path<00:02:53.690> looks<00:02:54.110> around<00:02:54.410> goes<00:02:54.920> down<00:02:55.130> another<00:02:55.340> path

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580

waiting<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.010> hear<00:02:58.280> something<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:59.000> if<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.660> does

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
waiting to hear something and if it does

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.480 
waiting to hear something and if it does
anything<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.320> immediately<00:03:00.710> investigates

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
anything it immediately investigates

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.610 
anything it immediately investigates
like<00:03:01.850> yeah<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.570> sounds<00:03:02.930> very<00:03:03.080> Stan<00:03:03.440> or

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
like yeah that sounds very Stan or

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.650 
like yeah that sounds very Stan or
typical<00:03:03.950> for<00:03:04.070> AI<00:03:04.220> stuff<00:03:04.640> but<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.180> alien<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:05.630> a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
typical for AI stuff but the alien is a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.990 
typical for AI stuff but the alien is a
lot<00:03:05.900> more<00:03:06.080> thorough<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:07.070> its<00:03:07.310> approach<00:03:07.670> here

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
lot more thorough in its approach here

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.460 
lot more thorough in its approach here
so<00:03:08.180> that's<00:03:08.360> what<00:03:08.510> makes<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.810> scary<00:03:08.960> too<00:03:09.320> of

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
so that's what makes it scary too of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.840 
so that's what makes it scary too of
course<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.830> fact<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:10.250> an<00:03:10.340> alien<00:03:10.700> and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
course the fact that it's an alien and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.100 
course the fact that it's an alien and
it's<00:03:10.940> gonna<00:03:11.060> kill<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.570> instantly

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
it's gonna kill you instantly

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.199 
it's gonna kill you instantly
I<00:03:12.230> think<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.650> game's<00:03:12.860> gonna<00:03:13.010> be<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.250> real<00:03:13.550> big

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
I think this game's gonna be a real big

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.570 
I think this game's gonna be a real big
treat<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:15.290> sad<00:03:15.590> thing<00:03:15.830> is<00:03:15.860> we<00:03:16.250> were<00:03:16.340> playing

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
treat the sad thing is we were playing

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.790 
treat the sad thing is we were playing
on<00:03:16.760> on<00:03:17.030> Xbox<00:03:17.510> one<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.930> was<00:03:18.050> running<00:03:18.320> at<00:03:18.440> 30

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
on on Xbox one and it was running at 30

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.620 
on on Xbox one and it was running at 30
frames<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.280> second<00:03:19.730> now<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:19.940> wasn't<00:03:20.239> like<00:03:20.360> fray

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
frames a second now it wasn't like fray

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.330 
frames a second now it wasn't like fray
or<00:03:20.660> anything<00:03:21.110> but<00:03:21.410> at<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.590> same<00:03:21.739> time<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.190> think

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
or anything but at the same time I think

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.710 
or anything but at the same time I think
this<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.730> probably<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:23.030> game<00:03:23.209> we're<00:03:23.360> gonna<00:03:23.480> want

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
this is probably a game we're gonna want

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.900 
this is probably a game we're gonna want
to<00:03:23.810> check<00:03:23.959> out<00:03:24.140> on<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.290> PC<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:25.670> know<00:03:25.790> the
