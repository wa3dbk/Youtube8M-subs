00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920 
become a wrestler and I think that it
could<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.579> done<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.240> way<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.780> can

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
could be done in the right way and I can

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.780 
could be done in the right way and I can
I<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.170> back<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> years<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.979> Hulk<00:01:32.250> first<00:01:32.610> came

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I go back the years when Hulk first came

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
I go back the years when Hulk first came
in<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> said<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.570> vitamins<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.290> do

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
in and said take your vitamins and do

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.130 
in and said take your vitamins and do
your<00:01:34.560> homework<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.329> school<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
your homework and be good in school and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.899 
your homework and be good in school and
I<00:01:37.259> think<00:01:37.470> we've<00:01:37.619> gone<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> long<00:01:38.070> ways<00:01:38.369> far<00:01:38.700> from

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I think we've gone a long ways far from

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.850 
I think we've gone a long ways far from
that<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.420> need<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:40.290> back<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that and we need to get back to that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859
