00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.600
 hello friends of valley community the afternoon 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.760
 we are going to give you another my advice that what 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.180
 happens today today we have left the 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.770
 very soft suspension 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.110
 how do we select this in a 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.970
 air suspension simply because 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.490
 giving air here we have my operator 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 First good place is a 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.060
 air reserve 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.230
 of 100 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.520
 10 millimeters of travel 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.520
 and then for nothing as you see 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.710
 let's use a pump 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.570
 Special for the air fork 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.160
 and well, let's explain it a little 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.840
 operating a very thing 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.180
 important if you ever carry the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.989
 never too hard to make 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.989
 what to do 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.290
 this yes we do this thinking about 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.640
 take a little air because we 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.310
 we see that we can not go back to 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.770
 house to the lake while this has happened 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.650
 is that you can not ever never can 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.330
 empty the valve by hand for that 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.650
 we have to use our pump well 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.450
 the pump checks law 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.730
 we put it where the valve is 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.730
 it takes a whistle we turn it 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.500
 and once we get to the end we lower the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.370
 tab that we can save but has 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.470
 zero psi 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.870
 and good for the weight of the cyclist in 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:52.850
 question in the eyes of those 70 we will give 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:57.710
 about 110 psi that puts it around here 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.770
 the weight measurement if it puts 500 days 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.540
 between 70 and 90 good is to say that the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.850
 pump does not cost any work to give air 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.340
 but at the same time good 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.569
 is the online has lost is here and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.980
 say the best 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.409
 the strength I am making strength only from 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.689
 110 116 and let's do the following I'm going 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.689
 to give air and mtr 120 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.750
 I feel sad to give you the 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.750
 substitutes 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.330
 let's see a piece of advice I want to give to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.750
 the people 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.070
 besides the weight of the tables there are people 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.270
 who likes to wear the fork a little 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.350
 softer and a little harder I 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.270
 I recommend that we try 5 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.850
 in 5 until you find the pressure that we 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.950
 like each one of us as you have 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.720
 seen we have 120 now and now 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.400
 to remove air instead of doing it 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.000
 hand and have the people that we have had 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.990
 before 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.850
 the pump has a little button here 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.850
 in which we will give you 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.520
 lose fast and with a little bit of 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.920
 watch out 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.959
 we will leave the 110 as you are seeing one 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.530
 time that we have time to 110 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.770
 the first thing before unscrewing is loosening 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.510
 spirit click the click click as little as 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.400
 that way when to fish when 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.790
 let's loosen the thread as they have fixed 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.790
 xaloc to the reposition does not lose there 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.580
 because because Felix clicks that he pressed 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.820
 the valve has been released from pressure 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.820
 now 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.290
 now there were some fats 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.550
 with respect to this table they have 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.400
 here on the right side 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.490
 we have two tables one for 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.730
 100 mm fork of 100 and 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.070
 80 this rubber that we have here serves to 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.290
 delimit the let's say the top every 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.940
 that reaches the fork there is a test 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.660
 who sits down with the weight of 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.660
 cyclist and must go down if the 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.480
 weight should be approximately between 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.390
 on the 15th and the 20th 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.390
 that would mean that it does its function 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.689
 more strength than I would 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.689
 what is done 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.850
 I 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:34.980
 how is that I have 35 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.460
 77 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.820
 this last part of the video starts is 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.990
 where we started doing this I do not want 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.940
 be because it is the king of data that has 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.070
 said it feels that true is good 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.570
 listening is important once 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.570
 let's have a look 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.820
 from Felix to Amia 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.790
 It is manufactured in 1950 when not 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.830
 there were pumps 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.830
 this leads to putting air safe 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.840
 and if not also 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.100
 then the crohn 7 as the 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.100
 shit 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.500
 they also carry 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.500
 the rabbit 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.880
 as you can see 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.300
 here here leading to life as you can 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.770
 note that also a rose 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.320
 we just stopped looking where to get 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.510
 after doing the descent 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.340
 we would say that we are using the 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.340
 physical part 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:11.320
 hopefully I could serve salute 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.660
 community 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.780
 is the ranchito so you forget 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.780
 today
