00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi to all and the room in this 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.950
 video we continue the tea series a 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.259
 true gta player 5 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 if you know before that, be sure to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.840
 watch my channel every day if 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.580
 you do not want to miss anything because 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.610
 I applaud videos or more per day 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.650
 on gt5 online then you are a real 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.600
 gta 5 player if you know the bigfoot 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.100
 remember if you saw my videos 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.390
 previous is the character to whom I 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.039
 kick is spartan 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.539
 if you do not remember the mission 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.710
 where we track the bigfoot I put you 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.660
 the link in the description of this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.010
 video then the bigfoot froze find a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 new place on the map 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.930
 he's here we see him standing 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.000
 standing upright on the mountain that's 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.710
 maybe you're saying nothing like that so if 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.809
 it tells you nothing I put you the link of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 the original bigfoot video in the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.680
 real life in the description of this 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 video it was shot there is very 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.920
 a long time so it's not very clear 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.629
 but it's okay 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.340
 you will recognize the same mountain 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.170
 with the big foot standing at 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.760
 same place except that unfortunately 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.199
 when we look at where they 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.170
 should be on the map 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.030
 we do not see it of course I speak of course 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.530
 the map of los santos a step in the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.059
 real life which means he is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.060
 so logically not in the mode in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.799
 line in gta 5 we see the bigfoot a 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.990
 everywhere we see him in a mission 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.000
 in helicopter with night vision 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.470
 we see it in a mission where we have to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.970
 the jitters and so that's the link I got you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.439
 put in the description of the video one 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.479
 see it on the logo of the police de los 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.369
 santos and we see it now on seven 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 plans because so rockstar really has a 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.659
 close connection with this creature they have 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.280
 Air kif and us is the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.939
 kiffe but we would have liked to see him in 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.290
 online mode 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.000
 I think it's still a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.049
 pretending on the part of rockstar ya 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.790
 no reason that they not cast 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.340
 line in any case I hope to see him more 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.509
 often in gta 5 on ps4 and a real 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.280
 gta 5 player 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.900
 if you know when the wind at roye laugh in 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.579
 motorcycle you 're going faster than if you 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.810
 lean forward but are you 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.610
 know how much time you earn 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.500
 by doing that I did the test for 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.270
 you and we'll see that now when 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.979
 bend your bike forward 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.460
 that's where you're supposed to go on the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.409
 faster 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.030
 you have some air intake and in 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.530
 normal time this air intake she does 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.420
 so that your race becomes more 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.649
 fluid and that's how you win 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.210
 in speed 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.979
 the race that I have here she does a 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.750
 kilometer I thought it would be 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.729
 simpler to judge on this distance 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.610
 like that if you want calculated for 5 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.030
 km or multiplied by five for 8 km by 8 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.020
 etc. 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.480
 finally, it's easy to do 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.150
 so for this first try I lean 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.100
 forward I did exactly 22 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.230
 seconds and 918 thousandths 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.300
 which is about 23 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.280
 seconds of the coup we will redo the same 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.390
 race except that this time I'm going 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 raise hooves before all along or 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.990
 almost all along to have 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.430
 an idea of ​​what we gain at the level of 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.560
 time then the disadvantage with these 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.120
 techniques is that we can not turn 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.100
 when you lift the wheel is good it's 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.730
 pity but it was necessary that a 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.620
 restriction 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.600
 otherwise would roll all the time on the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.460
 rear wheel and more when we're in 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.110
 this position is meant that the noise of the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.120
 motor it is much more acute is 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.130
 much stronger so we feel we 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.960
 really wins in power and we 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.990
 so ends on a time of 21 a 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.730
 second and 74 thousandths so much to say 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.770
 twenty-one seconds we win almost 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.370
 two seconds on a kilometer that's 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.960
 huge 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.700
 to give you an idea of ​​what we 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.380
 win we take about 100 meters 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.540
 to advance on others at each 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.760
 kilometer in bulk with this technique 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.880
 after a few kilometers 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.040
 see more your friends in the retro 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.840
 in terms of the time you win you 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.560
 are a real gta 5 player if you know 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.420
 thelma and louise 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.400
 you remember that I necessarily 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.060
 did this easter egg in a video 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.140
 former 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.820
 besides I put you the link of the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.800
 video in the description of this video 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.330
 I told you that you had to 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.190
 go to this place on the map for 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.990
 see the scene of suicide but that you 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.340
 could prevent suicide and recover 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.410
 the car with the two guitars to 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.980
 the back and even put the car in 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.080
 your garage 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.940
 so suddenly could even the custom and 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.160
 seraphim you can do that 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.209
 you want short if you are real 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.920
 gta 5 players 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.360
 you know this scene is happening 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.550
 not only in the story mode but she 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.010
 also happens in the online mode there 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.330
 just come here at 7pm and kill the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.830
 driver to prevent him from 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.570
 to commit suicide if you have never heard 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.680
 talk about this story was really going 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.450
 see the link I put you in the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.560
 description of the video I tell you 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.300
 in the history in detail 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.910
 if there are things you did not know 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.410
 in this video ten plants comment 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.550
