also comes with just you know what
you're<00:01:40.409> getting<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.860> IR<00:01:41.579> receiver<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.119> we

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you're getting a IR receiver is we

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.429 
you're getting a IR receiver is we
trying<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> plug<00:01:42.600> into<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.960> back<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.200> your

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
trying to plug into the back of your

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469 
trying to plug into the back of your
computer<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:44.070> also<00:01:44.250> has<00:01:44.490> our<00:01:44.670> blast<00:01:45.090> reports

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
computer it also has our blast reports

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.760 
computer it also has our blast reports
here<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.810> case<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.110> gonna<00:01:46.170> use<00:01:46.380> multiple

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
here in case you're gonna use multiple

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
here in case you're gonna use multiple
remote<00:01:46.979> controls<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> combine

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
remote controls and you want to combine

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.700 
remote controls and you want to combine
them<00:01:48.509> into<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:49.110> gonna<00:01:49.200> use<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> IR

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
them into one you're gonna use the IR

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.620 
them into one you're gonna use the IR
blasters<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.820> very<00:01:51.119> convenient<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.570> well

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
blasters that's very convenient as well

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
blasters that's very convenient as well
it's<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> kind<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> consolidate

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's going to kind of consolidate

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.039 
it's going to kind of consolidate
everything<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:54.149> also<00:01:54.360> important<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> note

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
everything it's also important to note

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.600 
everything it's also important to note
that<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.380> these<00:01:55.560> tuners<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.369> support

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that on these tuners they do support

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.249 
that on these tuners they do support
clear<00:01:57.000> qualm<00:01:57.299> clear<00:01:57.689> qualm<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
clear qualm clear qualm is the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.770 
clear qualm clear qualm is the
unencrypted<00:01:58.950> digital<00:01:59.399> cable<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.479> comes<00:02:00.630> out

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
unencrypted digital cable that comes out

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.330 
unencrypted digital cable that comes out
of<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:01.020> wall<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.439> basically<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.100> don't

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
of your wall so basically if you don't

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.889 
of your wall so basically if you don't
pay<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> cable<00:02:03.060> box<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.810> the

pay for a cable box you just have the
regular<00:02:04.229> channels<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.040> plug<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.460> cable

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
regular channels you can plug that cable

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.340 
regular channels you can plug that cable
directly<00:02:06.420> into<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> back<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
directly into the back of this and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
directly into the back of this and
you're<00:02:07.799> gonna<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.250> those<00:02:08.520> channels<00:02:08.819> on

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you're gonna get all those channels on

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.809 
you're gonna get all those channels on
your<00:02:09.390> computer<00:02:09.619> with<00:02:10.619> no<00:02:10.950> problems<00:02:11.370> now<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
guys also to note see this right here

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.480 
guys also to note see this right here
it's<00:02:42.840> PCI<00:02:43.200> Express<00:02:43.470> x1<00:02:44.130> that's<00:02:44.340> how<00:02:44.400> it's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
it's PCI Express x1 that's how it's

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.160 
it's PCI Express x1 that's how it's
going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> connect<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.880> your<00:02:44.970> computer<00:02:45.360> now<00:02:45.510> if

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
going to connect to your computer now if

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.840 
going to connect to your computer now if
you<00:02:46.290> don't<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> PCI<00:02:46.980> Express<00:02:47.130> x1<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.760> will

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
you don't have a PCI Express x1 it will

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.850 
you don't have a PCI Express x1 it will
also<00:02:48.030> work<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.570> about<00:02:48.750> any<00:02:48.959> PCI<00:02:49.470> Express

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
also work in just about any PCI Express

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.520 
also work in just about any PCI Express
slot<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.459> long<00:02:50.640> as<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:50.880> PCI<00:02:51.239> Express<00:02:51.900> or<00:02:52.170> PCIe

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
slot as long as it's PCI Express or PCIe

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.850 
slot as long as it's PCI Express or PCIe
so<00:02:53.280> basically<00:02:53.610> if<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.820> have<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.020> 16<00:02:55.020> x16<00:02:55.380> slot

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
so basically if you have a 16 x16 slot

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.530 
so basically if you have a 16 x16 slot
it<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.220> fit<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.910> first<00:02:57.150> part<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.420> it

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
it can fit just in that first part of it

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.240 
it can fit just in that first part of it
and<00:02:57.600> it'll<00:02:57.780> work<00:02:57.930> or<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.440> will<00:02:58.530> fit<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.770> an<00:02:58.890> x8

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and it'll work or it will fit in an x8

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.850 
and it'll work or it will fit in an x8
slot<00:02:59.520> an<00:02:59.700> X<00:02:59.910> 4<00:03:00.120> slot<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:00.620> finally<00:03:01.620> where<00:03:01.739> it's

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
slot an X 4 slot or finally where it's

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.520 
slot an X 4 slot or finally where it's
meant<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.100> fit<00:03:02.250> which<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.700> x1<00:03:03.060> slot<00:03:03.690> so

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
meant to fit which is the x1 slot so
