00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
lot more with me when he first took the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.640 
lot more with me when he first took the
project<00:03:10.459> on<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.690> don't<00:03:11.750> think<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.440> he<00:03:12.620> did

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
project on and I don't think that he did

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.420 
project on and I don't think that he did
it<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.640> he<00:03:14.290> transformed<00:03:15.290> himself<00:03:15.560> into<00:03:16.160> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
it that he transformed himself into the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.009 
it that he transformed himself into the
character<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.060> moment<00:03:17.360> he<00:03:17.450> stepped<00:03:17.780> out<00:03:17.989> of

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
character the moment he stepped out of

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.770 
character the moment he stepped out of
the<00:03:18.290> car<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.830> think<00:03:19.580> he<00:03:19.790> woke<00:03:20.120> up<00:03:20.390> that

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780
