so it kind of it's really

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.869 
so it kind of it's really
straightforward<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> kind<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.610> think

it through that the fighting is going to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.720 
it through that the fighting is going to
help<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.980> dark<00:00:53.190> weakness<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
everything else is going to kind of come
through<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.649> balance<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.730> hopping<00:00:57.090> into

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
through and balance out so hopping into

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360 
through and balance out so hopping into
Pokemon<00:00:57.899> showdown<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:59.010> thinking<00:00:59.280> like

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
Pokemon showdown I was thinking like

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.680 
Pokemon showdown I was thinking like
this<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.789> been<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> excellent

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
this would have been the excellent

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
this would have been the excellent
chance<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.260> maybe<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.920> super<00:01:02.399> lock<00:01:02.579> or

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
chance to maybe go with super lock or

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.280 
chance to maybe go with super lock or
give<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.300> kind<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.510> new<00:01:03.629> ability<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.080> adds

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
give it some kind of new ability it adds

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.770 
give it some kind of new ability it adds
a<00:01:04.470> +2<00:01:04.949> maybe<00:01:05.430> maybe<00:01:06.090> give<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
a +2 maybe maybe give it it like a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.539 
a +2 maybe maybe give it it like a
different<00:01:07.200> lower<00:01:07.650> amount<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> attack<00:01:08.340> maybe

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
different lower amount of attack maybe

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
different lower amount of attack maybe
like<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> 145<00:01:09.450> attack<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.080> make<00:01:10.500> sure

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
like a 145 attack and then make sure

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
like a 145 attack and then make sure
every<00:01:10.950> hit<00:01:11.100> crits<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.520> something<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
every hit crits or something and that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.580 
every hit crits or something and that

Togekiss that would be a really nice

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.289 
Togekiss that would be a really nice
things<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.490> well<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> believe

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
things to have as well because I believe

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.429 
things to have as well because I believe
with<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.540> special<00:01:30.960> Finch<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.350> actually

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
with that special Finch you can actually

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
with that special Finch you can actually
survive<00:01:31.799> an<00:01:31.950> air<00:01:32.070> slash<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.790> dish<00:01:33.000> back<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
survive an air slash then dish back a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.899 
survive an air slash then dish back a
pretty<00:01:33.900> solid<00:01:34.140> hit<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.040> looking<00:01:35.490> at<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> rest

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
pretty solid hit so looking at the rest

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
pretty solid hit so looking at the rest
of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> stats<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> mega<00:01:36.810> galley<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> has<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
of the stats the mega galley it has this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.899 
of the stats the mega galley it has this
is<00:01:37.799> where<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.009> start<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
is where we start to see you know you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.100 
is where we start to see you know you
have<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.420> jolly<00:01:39.659> nature<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
have to go with that jolly nature you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
have to go with that jolly nature you
have<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.710> speed<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.100> possible

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
have to get as much speed as possible

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 
have to get as much speed as possible
and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.329> thinking<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.960> move<00:01:43.170> set<00:01:43.409> go

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and I was thinking with this move set go

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.219 
and I was thinking with this move set go
with<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> focus<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.970> go<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> baton<00:01:45.960> pass

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
with the focus or go with the baton pass

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
with the focus or go with the baton pass
focus<00:01:46.680> energy<00:01:47.070> drifblim<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:48.030> actually<00:01:48.299> do

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
focus energy drifblim can actually do

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
focus energy drifblim can actually do
that<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:49.079> some<00:01:49.259> defensive<00:01:49.680> stats

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that so you can get some defensive stats

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.710 
that so you can get some defensive stats
a<00:01:50.130> focus<00:01:50.700> energy<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.299> everything<00:01:51.689> is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
a focus energy and now everything is

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.060 
a focus energy and now everything is
going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> create<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.560> an<00:01:52.649> awesome<00:01:52.799> amount

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
going to create and do an awesome amount

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130 
going to create and do an awesome amount
of<00:01:53.189> damage<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.240> into<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:54.750> standard

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
of damage but going into a more standard

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.539 
of damage but going into a more standard
set<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.649> pretty<00:01:55.860> much<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> same<00:01:56.219> idea<00:01:56.399> is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
set it's pretty much the same idea is

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.740 
set it's pretty much the same idea is
that<00:01:56.670> you're<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> go<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.600> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that you're going to go with a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.480 
that you're going to go with a
ridiculous<00:01:58.469> amount<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.890> coverage<00:01:59.159> because

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
ridiculous amount of coverage because

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.910 
ridiculous amount of coverage because
mega<00:01:59.969> gala<00:02:00.210> does<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.409> excellent

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
mega gala does have very excellent

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.319 
mega gala does have very excellent
coverage<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.520> seems<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> ultimate

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
coverage so this seems like the ultimate

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.209 
coverage so this seems like the ultimate
baton<00:02:03.600> past<00:02:03.840> pokemon<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:04.950> any

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
baton past pokemon now if you get any

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.980 
baton past pokemon now if you get any
amounts<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.670> stats<00:02:05.909> into<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> it'll<00:02:06.600> run<00:02:06.810> away

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
amounts of stats into it it'll run away

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
amounts of stats into it it'll run away
with<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> little<00:02:07.680> extra<00:02:08.039> speed<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.819> extra

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
with it little extra speed little extra

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.150 
with it little extra speed little extra
offenses<00:02:09.629> little<00:02:09.959> extra<00:02:10.200> defenses<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.830> then

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
offenses little extra defenses and then

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.589 
offenses little extra defenses and then
Meg<00:02:11.340> gallant<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.879> go<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.120> sweep<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> team

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
Meg gallant can go and sweep the team

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.300 
Meg gallant can go and sweep the team
because<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.110> just

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
because it's just

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.400 
because it's just
has<00:02:13.459> excellent<00:02:14.420> coverage<00:02:14.870> from<00:02:15.020> there<00:02:15.260> that

has excellent coverage from there that

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.870 
has excellent coverage from there that
this<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.770> kind<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:15.950> shows<00:02:16.130> some<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.819> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
this just kind of shows some of the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.130 
this just kind of shows some of the
moves<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.180> don't<00:02:17.300> have<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.510> run<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.780> exact

rest of your coverage hit dragon types
and<00:02:43.310> all<00:02:43.489> sorts<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.819> things<00:02:43.940> like<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.300> you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
and all sorts of things like that you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.090 
and all sorts of things like that you
can<00:02:44.569> work<00:02:44.660> out<00:02:44.840> very<00:02:44.870> well<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.010> ice

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
can work out very well that the ice

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.620 
can work out very well that the ice
punch<00:02:46.340> does<00:02:46.519> make<00:02:46.730> up<00:02:46.880> for<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.239> fighting

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
punch does make up for that fighting

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.110 
punch does make up for that fighting
pretty<00:02:47.810> really<00:02:48.440> good<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.549> can<00:02:49.700> all<00:02:49.790> balance

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
pretty really good so it can all balance

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.460 
pretty really good so it can all balance
out<00:02:50.239> we<00:02:50.420> also<00:02:50.540> have<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> lot<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:50.989> other<00:02:51.200> moves

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
out we also have a lot of other moves

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.650 
out we also have a lot of other moves
that<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.650> can<00:02:51.769> bring<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.239> Swords<00:02:53.239> Dance<00:02:53.299> set

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
that you can bring like Swords Dance set

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.050 
that you can bring like Swords Dance set
up<00:02:53.780> into<00:02:54.500> all<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.010> other<00:02:55.040> stab<00:02:55.489> moves<00:02:55.760> and

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
up into all the other stab moves and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.850 
up into all the other stab moves and
whatnot<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.600> wobble<00:02:57.140> syncing<00:02:57.380> Swords<00:02:57.769> Dance

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
whatnot that wobble syncing Swords Dance

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.410 
whatnot that wobble syncing Swords Dance
is<00:02:58.099> very<00:02:58.310> good<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.549> instead<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.060> investing

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
is very good that instead of investing

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.150 
is very good that instead of investing
the<00:02:59.450> attack<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.349> can<00:03:00.500> invest<00:03:00.739> into<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.010> hit

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
the attack you can invest into the hit

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.339 
the attack you can invest into the hit
points<00:03:01.519> survive<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> hit<00:03:02.420> use<00:03:02.780> as<00:03:02.959> much<00:03:03.110> speed

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
points survive a hit use as much speed

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.170 
points survive a hit use as much speed
as<00:03:03.380> possible<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.099> now<00:03:04.370> your<00:03:04.580> drain<00:03:04.819> punch<00:03:05.030> is

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
as possible and now your drain punch is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.910 
as possible and now your drain punch is
going<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.420> heal<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.599> back<00:03:05.900> up<00:03:06.080> to<00:03:06.110> fold<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.830> a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
going to heal you back up to fold in a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.800 
going to heal you back up to fold in a
matter<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.730> couple<00:03:07.760> hits<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.390> then<00:03:08.720> you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
matter of a couple hits and then you

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.940 
matter of a couple hits and then you
still<00:03:09.110> have<00:03:09.140> good<00:03:09.319> coverage<00:03:09.530> from<00:03:09.739> there

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
still have good coverage from there

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.890 
still have good coverage from there
psycho<00:03:10.220> cut<00:03:10.519> leaf<00:03:10.730> blade<00:03:11.000> or<00:03:11.420> any<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.780> these

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
psycho cut leaf blade or any of these

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.630 
psycho cut leaf blade or any of these
other<00:03:12.110> moves<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.650> you're<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.250> be<00:03:13.400> very

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
other moves and you're going to be very

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.809 
other moves and you're going to be very
solid<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.299> mega<00:03:14.959> Gallade<00:03:15.140> runs<00:03:15.590> very<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:16.640> as

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
solid so mega Gallade runs very just as

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.630 
solid so mega Gallade runs very just as
an<00:03:17.120> unpredictable<00:03:17.780> wide<00:03:18.410> coverage<00:03:19.100> fast

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
an unpredictable wide coverage fast

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.520 
an unpredictable wide coverage fast
Pokemon<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.630> can<00:03:20.780> work<00:03:20.989> out<00:03:21.140> really<00:03:21.350> well

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
Pokemon and it can work out really well

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.979 
Pokemon and it can work out really well
if<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:21.739> just<00:03:22.070> support<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.549> little<00:03:23.180> extra<00:03:23.420> it

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
if you just support it a little extra it

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.539 
if you just support it a little extra it
can<00:03:24.200> take<00:03:24.410> your<00:03:24.590> team<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.799> that<00:03:25.040> extra<00:03:25.370> mile

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
can take your team to that extra mile

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.490 
can take your team to that extra mile
and<00:03:25.579> then<00:03:26.299> we<00:03:26.420> just<00:03:26.570> kind<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:27.019> another

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
and then we just kind of have another

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.080 
and then we just kind of have another
idea<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.829> was<00:03:27.950> thinking<00:03:28.190> about<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:28.790> with

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
idea I was thinking about is that with

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.090 
idea I was thinking about is that with
its<00:03:29.299> ha<00:03:29.420> special<00:03:29.660> defense<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:30.350> its<00:03:30.620> access<00:03:30.950> to

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
its ha special defense and its access to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.949 
its ha special defense and its access to
boku<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.970> can<00:03:32.120> go<00:03:32.209> with<00:03:32.329> a<00:03:32.359> bulk<00:03:32.600> of<00:03:32.720> drain

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
boku you can go with a bulk of drain

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.599 
boku you can go with a bulk of drain
punch<00:03:33.140> set<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.650> don't<00:03:33.799> care<00:03:34.280> about<00:03:34.400> the

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
punch set that you don't care about the

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.340 
punch set that you don't care about the
speed<00:03:34.819> anymore<00:03:35.090> just<00:03:35.720> kind<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:35.900> going<00:03:36.079> well

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
speed anymore just kind of going well

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.430 
speed anymore just kind of going well
I'm<00:03:36.590> at<00:03:36.829> 343<00:03:37.640> 61<00:03:38.150> on<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.780> hip<00:03:39.049> points<00:03:39.200> and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440

coverage that you want from there and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.150 
coverage that you want from there and
that's<00:03:48.230> pretty<00:03:48.530> much<00:03:48.620> how<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.769> see<00:03:48.950> mega

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
that's pretty much how I see mega

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.620 
that's pretty much how I see mega
Gallade<00:03:49.310> running<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.060> can<00:03:50.239> run<00:03:50.480> this

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
Gallade running is that you can run this

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.509 
Gallade running is that you can run this
bulk<00:03:50.810> up<00:03:50.959> set<00:03:51.139> that<00:03:51.290> they<00:03:51.440> don't<00:03:51.620> catch<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.400> at

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
bulk up set that they don't catch it at

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:53.949 
bulk up set that they don't catch it at
the<00:03:52.579> right<00:03:52.760> time<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.420> can<00:03:53.450> wall<00:03:53.750> them<00:03:53.900> out

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
the right time you can wall them out

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.599 
the right time you can wall them out
special<00:03:54.319> defensively<00:03:54.709> really<00:03:55.010> well<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.489> have

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
special defensively really well you have

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:56.890 
special defensively really well you have
a<00:03:55.670> really<00:03:55.910> good<00:03:56.000> amount<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.269> gaining

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
a really good amount of gaining

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.330 
a really good amount of gaining
defensive<00:03:57.319> bulk<00:03:57.500> that'll<00:03:57.799> eventually<00:03:58.160> take

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
defensive bulk that'll eventually take

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.860 
defensive bulk that'll eventually take
them<00:03:58.489> over<00:03:58.609> then<00:03:59.150> you'll<00:03:59.299> have<00:03:59.389> a<00:03:59.450> high<00:03:59.660> amount

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
them over then you'll have a high amount

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.599 
them over then you'll have a high amount
of<00:03:59.989> offenses<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.889> good<00:04:01.010> amount<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.280> sustain

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
of offenses and a good amount of sustain

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.300
