00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.220
 August 3 on Monday it will not hold 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.690
 next home match to visit us 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.190
 Tula Arsenal will arrive 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.960
 with this team so long ago to me 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.610
 met so we decided me 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.379
 today remember the history of tomsk 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.270
 Tula football standoff a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 I also ask you to wait about what is 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.710
 represents the current arsenal and in this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.539
 we as always help expert npf 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.539
 historian of fine football Sergey Simonov 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:36.300
 before the story of the meeting he is not too long 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.780
 just 10 match we spent since 1998 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.290
 of the year 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.420
 but enough interesting matches and even 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.170
 some were fateful if 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.239
 remember 1998 when we debuted 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.430
 by the way together with the arsenal debuted in 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.469
 first league but we had different 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 perfectly team and task arsenal and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.850
 there was a trainer teaching cutting which along with not 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.559
 He won the gold medals he had 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.570
 nine Eurasians composed then this 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 general bu bu for the first league and in 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.619
 led by androgyne who became the best 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 The first division scorer was 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.640
 excellent base to train men all 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.159
 conditions were the team fought for the ticket 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 in the premier league by and large but she 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.760
 we would need then without a sponsor 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.790
 stayed and we had to save 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.250
 registration in the first division and therefore 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.210
 the task was different in Tomsk we lost 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.299
 but whether our team was able to win 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.420
 with a fabulous what a score of 3 2 and this 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.680
 victory a few rounds to go 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.340
 actually allowed to keep registration 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.049
 in the first league because then in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.150
 the remaining matches we took there is pom 1 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.729
 point and otherwise it already had 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.490
 then the arsenal got into the same situation 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.799
 when times have changed the arsenal already 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.770
 there were other tasks especially turnover 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.509
 fought for the exit but not yet pink 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.299
 premier league but was on the rise she already 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.369
 beat arsenal in the standings 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.020
 Here Tula played the last round of them 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.729
 necessarily needed a victory to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.280
 save residence in the premier league this 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.200
 was the 2001 coach they already had 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.990
 was Vladimir oglovich 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.330
 Fedotov famous means and who with 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.020
 Moscow Spartak then worked the match 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.020
 was very stubborn fighting and 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.410
 in the end 11 is a draw she did not eat 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.140
 Tomsk but Arsenal eventually flew but 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.180
 it was our Siberian team saved 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.430
 locomotive cheat 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.710
 saved thanks to the fact that we are Siberians 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.170
 helped you do it but I remember how 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.510
 raged by the way Vladimir Fedotov in 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.430
 press conference room there and at the judge on 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.600
 all he was very pleased because 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.450
 apparently they were sure that all the same 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.040
 wins after this round on the news 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.320
 on the newspaper sports express in 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.790
 The Internet has published an article as if the main 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.490
 Russian specialist in the first 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.080
 divisional andrew anfen agent in 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.870
 which literally writes the following if 1 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.360
 November, Arsene will not win against Tommy I 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.800
 promise to eat fresh room 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.120
 sports express while drinking a newspaper 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.250
 different liquids 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.280
 from kefir production Voronezh 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.200
 dairy to Georgian wine 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.330
 irrigation is clearly hinting that our team 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.010
 which supposedly has no motivation 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.780
 ready for all sorts of compromise 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.370
 I want to believe that their honest and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.830
 uncompromisingly game our guys 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.170
 force you to eat anfen agent to him 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.730
 similar price tags all that normal 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:26.920
 people do not eat 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.870
 and the funny thing is for me personally was 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.019
 the fact that the correspondent of sports express 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.900
 anfen agents before the match promised that 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.030
 Of course, Tomsk will lose signals 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.420
 there are no problems, but in the end he 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.069
 I had to publicly have the number of this newspaper 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.610
 because he said if I eat a newspaper 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.970
 Well, I had and there was such 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.790
 funny episode 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.340
 our happy year 2004 was not there 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.430
 direct match arsenal and this is the world by the way 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.920
 it is curious that in Tomsk then we played 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.780
 in a tie we lost important points and our buzz 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.609
 the gate was clogged filing Valery 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.519
 Klimov who then played for the arsenal 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:08.980
 But in the penultimate round we played 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:11.410
 won at home and played the same day 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.530
 arsenal 40 falcon our main 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.090
 competitor in the fight for exit prime 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.789
 league and arsenal 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.010
 Boris struck you a coach won in 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.979
 Saratov it was a certain sensation 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.570
 sort of at least a strong team was home 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.240
 Tula was always pretty good 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.550
 football team so they won 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.410
 this match in Saratov and Saratov fell 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.060
 On land I understand that they were left without 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.430
 trips to the premier league because 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.919
 last round we beat anji not 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.190
 gave a chance to the falcon to catch up with us and this 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.080
 here arsenal arsenal helped us get out 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.280
 premier league by and large on albeit 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.320
 we deserve it 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.320
 I think but the arsenal has become for us 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.349
 blood discharge in that sense and that 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.599
 I wonder what then our team when 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.520
 she went to the premier league heightened trader 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.169
 Head coach Boris A. Stukalov 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.229
 and two players 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.450
 who were veterans and the backbone of sweat 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.320
 Tomi this two Valery Valery Klimov his 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.039
 lyrics tanks 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.050
 I generally think that here is the arsenal 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.479
 a striking example of the coaching team that is 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.699
 that's how was the coaching team sense 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.440
 in times without whom Spartak was there or 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.240
 romance in all the same so to speak 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.889
 defined the concept of the coach that is how 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.020
 he sees football as he picked up 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.539
 players under your model so let's say a 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.550
 many they are repelled by the possibility 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.289
 there are financial from their best qualities 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.280
 players in other clubs I have yes it 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.370
 another system 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.840
 so here a 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.630
 she's just coaching his team 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.960
 Dmitri Alenichev he introduced this 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.510
 this coaching style and it is from 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.400
 the team played it to him and searched right 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.310
 in Spartak football that is and he even 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.050
 one time I remember he tried to invite 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.440
 all their friends veteran spartak 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.380
 Yegor Titov There Khryvovu Parfenov 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.690
 played for the amateur league team 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.160
 we did not achieve much success then he 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.050
 scored already talented youth 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.790
 Alenicheva and with her already passed this way 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.340
 with the second league 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.560
 in one year won the center zone in one 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.720
 year won the final ticket to the second 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.130
 place u nevertheless a voucher and this one 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.840
 x how brilliant such a breakthrough 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.639
 the only bit and I managed 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.169
 catch the premiership though they too 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.030
 they produced quite a good one 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.680
 impression when somewhat accustomed to 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.250
 have they had no stars on they played 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.400
 good team football to the last 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.260
 tour fought for registration in the Premier League 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.789
 but now here they flew out and before 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.860
 the team is the challenge return here 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.419
 Viktor Bulatov he, too, Spartacus you 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.010
 three-time national champion in the composition 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.639
 Spartacus he too 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.320
 also preaches friction coaching 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.180
 coaching teams coaching style then 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.479
 there is when a team plays that football 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.389
 which she no matter what there 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.919
 stars have so let's say they play in 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.470
 Spartak football match true 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:57.050
 Now they say that they are a little more often 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.970
 use that is there that was purely here 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.889
 these short pass and so on that they 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.539
 alternated with long passes in 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.490
 a little bit of style has changed a little 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:06.139
 but no less than that the combinational 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.940
 game and inspected from a match in 100 sleep 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:09.560
 for example at the last round and they 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.349
 really here and play exactly here in 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.820
 he selects such a style and players 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.039
 here he took his style now conti bere 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.260
 bere which is a good player 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:20.090
 technically with a blow and the main thing is he 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.729
 can play combinational football 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.470
 I took vitali Fedotov and smith I caught 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:26.419
 Donetsk, that is, it is a selection of just such 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.210
 stuff like your time drives on my 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:31.430
 memory was chosen Spartak so I 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:35.900
 I think that it will be so interesting 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:37.340
 football and plus what else can be poorer 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.090
 still it is a minus i mean they all should 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.949
 to play 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.500
 it also seems to me that the arsenal will pick up everything 

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:44.090
 a move but a steam signal i predict so 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.190
 they now have a rise, that is, they will win 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.890
 Wasps on one of their main competitors 

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.110
 Now they play with Tommy, that is, they have 

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.900
 mood will be fighting I do not think that they 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:57.000
 will go on the defensive and will play worth 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.310
 sticking a bus is not their style at all 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.680
 so there will be open football and here 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.710
 here then me now to me too now stimulus 

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.330
 after a defeat, the period of zenith 2 is necessary 

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.710
 to rehabilitate in front of the viewer 

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.170
 more that principle command us too 

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.850
 good combination interesting me 

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.910
 I think that should have turned out just 

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.730
 spectacular football in which our guys 

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:20.330
 It will not be easy because 

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.330
 arsenal is a good team
