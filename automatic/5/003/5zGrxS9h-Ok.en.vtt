and beyond the trailer I think this is
Matthew<00:00:36.780> McConaughey's<00:00:37.260> first<00:00:37.590> genuine<00:00:38.100> real

year I'm very excited for him and I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.139 
year I'm very excited for him and I
think<00:00:42.870> he<00:00:42.930> did<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> fantastic<00:00:43.350> job

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
think he did a fantastic job

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.220 
think he did a fantastic job
transforming<00:00:45.149> himself<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> role<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
transforming himself for the role it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.590 
transforming himself for the role it
shows<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> real<00:00:46.710> commitment<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.340> acting<00:00:48.210> into

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
shows a real commitment to acting into

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240 
shows a real commitment to acting into
the<00:00:48.750> stop<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.680> only<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.039> movie

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the stop that so not only to this movie

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.350 
the stop that so not only to this movie

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
but to acting in general and I think

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360 
but to acting in general and I think

expecting Jared Leto to do so to do so
well<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.810> he<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.140> seems<00:01:19.320> there's<00:01:19.680> something

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
well but he just seems there's something

about<00:01:20.159> his<00:01:20.310> performance<00:01:20.689> not<00:01:21.689> only<00:01:21.930> has<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
about his performance not only has it

been transformational for him as well
but<00:01:24.180> there's<00:01:24.360> something<00:01:24.600> there's<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> realness

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
but there's something there's a realness

to it at least that I can see from the
trailer<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.570> disarming<00:01:28.170> uh<00:01:28.560> he

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
character they camp it up but there's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
character they camp it up but there's
like<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> realism<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:41.009> like

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
like a realism and like it's not like

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.380 
like a realism and like it's not like
he's<00:01:41.280> wearing<00:01:41.430> someone<00:01:41.729> else's<00:01:41.759> skin<00:01:42.210> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
he's wearing someone else's skin it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.660 
he's wearing someone else's skin it's
like<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.659> Leto<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.409> character<00:01:44.009> but

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
like here Leto is that character but

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.130 
like here Leto is that character but
however<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.390> Matthew<00:01:45.659> McConaughey

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
however when I see Matthew McConaughey

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.740 
however when I see Matthew McConaughey
in<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.439> trailer<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.189> seems<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.119> little<00:01:48.329> put<00:01:48.540> on

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
in this trailer it seems a little put on

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.480 
in this trailer it seems a little put on
it<00:01:48.960> doesn't<00:01:49.140> seem<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.649> genuine<00:01:50.040> which<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it doesn't seem as genuine which is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.160 
it doesn't seem as genuine which is
surprising<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> me<00:01:51.119> because<00:01:51.270> McConaughey<00:01:52.079> is

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
surprising to me because McConaughey is

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.780 
surprising to me because McConaughey is
becoming<00:01:52.530> such<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> genuine<00:01:53.100> actor<00:01:53.490> for

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
becoming such a genuine actor for

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.620 
becoming such a genuine actor for
instance<00:01:54.090> his<00:01:54.479> portrayal<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.110> mud<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.280> other

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
instance his portrayal in mud and other

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.910 
instance his portrayal in mud and other
Magic<00:01:57.630> Mike<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.020> thought<00:01:58.140> his<00:01:58.320> Maggie's<00:01:58.560> Magic

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
Magic Mike I thought his Maggie's Magic

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.469 
Magic Mike I thought his Maggie's Magic
Mike<00:01:59.040> performance<00:01:59.549> was<00:01:59.700> very<00:01:59.939> raw

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
Mike performance was very raw

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.789 
Mike performance was very raw
I<00:02:00.509> thought<00:02:00.869> he<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.290> deserved<00:02:01.590> an<00:02:01.710> Oscar

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
I thought he actually deserved an Oscar

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.550 
I thought he actually deserved an Oscar
nomination<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.729> for<00:02:02.939> Best<00:02:03.090> Supporting

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
nomination for that for Best Supporting

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
nomination for that for Best Supporting
so<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.219> blown<00:02:05.430> away<00:02:05.700> by<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.329> twist

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so I was really blown away by this twist

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.410 
so I was really blown away by this twist
and<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.580> kind<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:08.789> am<00:02:09.030> worried<00:02:09.270> for

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
and I kind of actually am worried for

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.320 
and I kind of actually am worried for
Matthew<00:02:09.629> McConaughey

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
Matthew McConaughey

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.180 
Matthew McConaughey
then<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.810> feel<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.170> your<00:02:11.320> Lido<00:02:11.530> could<00:02:11.860> kind<00:02:12.130> of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
then I feel that your Lido could kind of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.310 
then I feel that your Lido could kind of
take<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.550> heat<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.750> know<00:02:13.810> maybe<00:02:13.990> not<00:02:14.170> all<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
take the heat you know maybe not all the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.870 
take the heat you know maybe not all the
nominations<00:02:14.950> but<00:02:15.070> if<00:02:15.190> there's<00:02:15.340> gonna<00:02:15.460> be<00:02:15.520> wins

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
nominations but if there's gonna be wins

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.880 
nominations but if there's gonna be wins
for<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.270> movie<00:02:16.540> they<00:02:17.020> could<00:02:17.350> go<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.590> Jared

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
for this movie they could go to Jared

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.340 
for this movie they could go to Jared
Leto<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:19.480> know<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.780> hate<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.990> say<00:02:20.230> it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
Leto you know and I hate to say it

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.690 
Leto you know and I hate to say it
because<00:02:20.440> that's<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> way<00:02:20.920> Oscars<00:02:21.310> work<00:02:21.490> but

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
because that's the way Oscars work but

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.400 
because that's the way Oscars work but
especially<00:02:22.180> if<00:02:22.270> his<00:02:22.330> character<00:02:22.540> dies<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:22.960> mean

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
especially if his character dies I mean

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.940 
especially if his character dies I mean
then<00:02:23.590> just<00:02:24.130> slam<00:02:24.580> dunk<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.260> with<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.740> film

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
then just slam dunk but so with the film

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.510 
then just slam dunk but so with the film
itself

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
itself

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.250 
itself
I<00:02:27.550> was<00:02:27.730> also<00:02:27.940> disappointed<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.140> this

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
I was also disappointed and that this

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.230 
I was also disappointed and that this
looks<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.560> little<00:02:29.830> bit<00:02:30.100> like<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> Lifetime<00:02:30.880> movie

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
looks a little bit like a Lifetime movie

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.370 
looks a little bit like a Lifetime movie
you<00:02:31.390> know<00:02:31.480> I'm<00:02:31.600> always<00:02:31.750> talking<00:02:31.990> about<00:02:32.200> how

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
you know I'm always talking about how

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.130 
you know I'm always talking about how
teen<00:02:32.950> shows<00:02:33.250> look<00:02:33.520> like<00:02:33.700> CW<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:35.050> know

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
teen shows look like CW you know

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.380 
teen shows look like CW you know
television<00:02:35.980> movies<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.850> kind<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.210> looks

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
television movies this kind of looks

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.910 
television movies this kind of looks
like<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.570> Lifetime<00:02:38.020> television<00:02:38.530> movie<00:02:38.770> when<00:02:38.890> I

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
like a Lifetime television movie when I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.050 
like a Lifetime television movie when I
think<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.280> needed<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
think it needed to have more of a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.800 
think it needed to have more of a
Midnight<00:02:40.780> Cowboy<00:02:41.050> vibe<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.810> I'm

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
Midnight Cowboy vibe and so I'm

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.180 
Midnight Cowboy vibe and so I'm
surprised<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.410> movie<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.710> had<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.040> much

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
surprised that movie that had so much

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.760 
surprised that movie that had so much
heat<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:46.300> guess<00:02:46.900> largely<00:02:47.170> cuz<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.560> Matthew

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
heat I guess largely cuz of Matthew

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.220 
heat I guess largely cuz of Matthew
McConaughey's<00:02:48.190> dramatic<00:02:48.580> weight<00:02:48.730> loss

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
McConaughey's dramatic weight loss

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.690 
McConaughey's dramatic weight loss
didn't<00:02:50.230> really<00:02:50.560> trip<00:02:50.860> didn't<00:02:51.310> really<00:02:51.520> seem

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
didn't really trip didn't really seem

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.310 
didn't really trip didn't really seem
like<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.910> Oscar<00:02:52.209> bait<00:02:52.360> flick<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.810> had

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
like the Oscar bait flick that I had

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.990 
like the Oscar bait flick that I had
thought<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.709> would<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.890> mean<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.310> could<00:02:54.880> be

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
thought it would I mean I could be

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.430 
thought it would I mean I could be
pleasantly<00:02:55.420> surprised<00:02:55.780> when<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.050> comes<00:02:56.260> out

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
pleasantly surprised when it comes out

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.250 
pleasantly surprised when it comes out
right<00:02:56.860> now<00:02:57.130> I'm<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> little<00:02:58.330> underwhelmed<00:02:58.630> so

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
right now I'm a little underwhelmed so

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.440 
right now I'm a little underwhelmed so
I'd<00:02:59.380> like<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.560> know<00:02:59.709> what<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.950> guys<00:03:00.100> think<00:03:00.450> you
