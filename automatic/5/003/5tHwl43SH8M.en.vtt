00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.090 

okay<00:00:00.240> so<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:00.810> idea<00:00:01.199> of<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.469> drill<00:00:01.800> which<00:00:01.949> is

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
okay so the idea of this drill which is

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.220 
okay so the idea of this drill which is
called<00:00:02.340> leapfrog<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:03.270> we<00:00:03.480> have<00:00:03.659> two<00:00:04.529> coins

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
called leapfrog is we have two coins

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.799 
called leapfrog is we have two coins
three<00:00:07.230> three<00:00:07.859> meters<00:00:08.220> three<00:00:08.460> yards<00:00:08.760> apart<00:00:08.880> we

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
three three meters three yards apart we

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.910 
three three meters three yards apart we
stopped<00:00:10.110> five<00:00:10.679> yards<00:00:12.080> five<00:00:13.080> meters<00:00:13.500> there

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
stopped five yards five meters there

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.770 
stopped five yards five meters there
about<00:00:14.130> five<00:00:14.400> paces<00:00:14.730> they<00:00:15.120> will<00:00:15.240> call<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> five

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
about five paces they will call it five

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.340 
about five paces they will call it five
paces<00:00:16.080> from<00:00:16.470> first<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.369> all<00:00:17.720> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.960> purely

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
paces from first of all this is purely

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.040 
paces from first of all this is purely
to<00:00:19.529> developed<00:00:20.310> speed<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.359> idea<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.900> this

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
to developed speed so the idea of this

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.800 
to developed speed so the idea of this
drill<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:25.949> ball<00:00:26.279> suppose<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.420> has

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
drill is the first ball suppose it has

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.839 
drill is the first ball suppose it has
to<00:00:27.990> pass<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> coin<00:00:28.710> will<00:00:29.039> top<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> world

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
to pass the coin will top of the world

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.650 
to pass the coin will top of the world
to<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.210> okay<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.920> second<00:00:32.399> ball<00:00:35.480> has<00:00:36.480> to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
to know that okay the second ball has to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.520 
to know that okay the second ball has to
pass<00:00:36.920> first<00:00:37.920> ball<00:00:43.610> it<00:00:44.610> too<00:00:44.850> far<00:00:45.230> third<00:00:46.230> ball

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
pass first ball it too far third ball

00:00:46.530 --> 00:01:01.369 
pass first ball it too far third ball
has<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.739> pass<00:00:59.449> and<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.480> has<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> pass<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
has to pass and that has to pass the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.820 
has to pass and that has to pass the
last<00:01:01.590> ball<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.879> go<00:01:03.030> back<00:01:03.799> go<00:01:04.799> back

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
last ball and then we go back go back

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.480 
last ball and then we go back go back
one<00:01:05.189> yet<00:01:06.439> then<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.590> back<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:07.920> yard<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> go

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
one yet then we go back one yard and go

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.270 
one yet then we go back one yard and go
back<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.630> every<00:01:10.140> practice<00:01:10.320> session<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:11.070> do

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
back and every practice session you do

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.890 
back and every practice session you do
maybe<00:01:11.939> 50%<00:01:12.570> uphill<00:01:13.970> 50%<00:01:14.970> downhill<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.189> then

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
maybe 50% uphill 50% downhill and then

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.359 
maybe 50% uphill 50% downhill and then
then<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> other<00:01:19.200> days<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.920> left<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
then on the other days you do left the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.300 
then on the other days you do left the
right<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.659> hook<00:01:21.990> possible<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
right and then hook possible right to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.080 
right and then hook possible right to
left<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.350> drill<00:01:25.650> teaches<00:01:26.220> us<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.670> hit

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
left so this drill teaches us to hit

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.160 
left so this drill teaches us to hit
every<00:01:27.420> putt<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:28.189> beyond<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.939> target<00:01:30.180> just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
every putt just beyond the target just

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.100 
every putt just beyond the target just
beyond<00:01:31.909> because<00:01:32.909> we're<00:01:33.479> putting<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.869> their

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
beyond because we're putting out their

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.800 
beyond because we're putting out their
pocket<00:01:35.070> we'll<00:01:35.250> pull<00:01:35.460> without<00:01:35.729> John<00:01:36.150> she<00:01:36.630> never

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
pocket we'll pull without John she never

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.620 
pocket we'll pull without John she never
