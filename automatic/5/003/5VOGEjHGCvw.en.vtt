looks like this it's very thick material

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.010 
looks like this it's very thick material
because<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.270> neoprene<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
because it is neoprene and then it

nice because yeah and then the clasp it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.420 
nice because yeah and then the clasp it
is<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.810> adjustable<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:53.189> goes<00:01:53.280> like

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430

a little funny but I'm guessing that'll

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.359 
a little funny but I'm guessing that'll
go<00:01:57.509> away<00:01:57.990> after<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.469> wash<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:58.860> after<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> swim

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
bobbins look like this they're really

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.450 
bobbins look like this they're really
thick<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.930> inside<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.830> orange<00:02:24.190> but

thick on the inside of it is orange but

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.280 
thick on the inside of it is orange but
that<00:02:24.640> won't<00:02:24.790> really<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:25.030> showing<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.750> then

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
that won't really be showing and then

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.100 
that won't really be showing and then
the<00:02:26.890> bottom<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.910> or<00:02:28.390> not<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.690> bottom<00:02:28.959> they

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
the bottom of it or not the bottom they

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.930 
the bottom of it or not the bottom they
are<00:02:29.290> all<00:02:29.590> around<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.890> outside<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.820> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
are all around the outside is that the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.870 
are all around the outside is that the
same<00:02:31.120> color<00:02:31.390> as<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.900> bag<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.830> really<00:02:33.340> sturdy

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
same color as the bag it's really sturdy

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.780 
same color as the bag it's really sturdy
like<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:36.040> more<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.370> stretchy<00:02:36.610> material

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
like if it's more of a stretchy material

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.090 
like if it's more of a stretchy material
which<00:02:37.240> I<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.780> baby<00:02:38.020> design<00:02:38.380> just<00:02:38.860> is

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
which I think the baby design just is

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.460 
which I think the baby design just is
naturally<00:02:39.550> made<00:02:39.700> more<00:02:39.850> stretchy<00:02:40.090> but<00:02:40.870> it's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
naturally made more stretchy but it's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.250 
naturally made more stretchy but it's
stretchy<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.489> then<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.209> heard<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.080> full

stretchy and then I heard that it's full

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.350 
stretchy and then I heard that it's full

because I thought that my boat was kind

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.840 
because I thought that my boat was kind
