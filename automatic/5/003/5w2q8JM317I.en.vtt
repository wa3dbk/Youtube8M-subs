00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
you I'm actually shooting now in using

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.249 
you I'm actually shooting now in using
the<00:00:28.240> 600<00:00:28.690> D<00:00:28.870> and<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.770> 50<00:00:30.370> millimeter<00:00:30.520> lens<00:00:30.760> just

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
the 600 D and a 50 millimeter lens just

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.630 
the 600 D and a 50 millimeter lens just
using<00:00:32.259> natural<00:00:32.589> light<00:00:32.800> well<00:00:33.039> the<00:00:33.309> light<00:00:33.489> in

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
using natural light well the light in

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.340 
using natural light well the light in
the<00:00:33.760> environment<00:00:34.300> not<00:00:34.390> using<00:00:34.629> any<00:00:34.749> LED<00:00:35.170> light

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
the environment not using any LED light

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.529 
the environment not using any LED light
so<00:00:36.280> we'll<00:00:36.579> have<00:00:36.670> a<00:00:36.699> look<00:00:36.850> now<00:00:36.999> as<00:00:37.149> well<00:00:37.329> how<00:00:37.510> you

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
so we'll have a look now as well how you

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.360 
so we'll have a look now as well how you
can<00:00:37.899> set<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.320> aperture<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.070> difference

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
can set the aperture and the difference

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.279 
can set the aperture and the difference
in<00:00:39.429> the<00:00:39.460> different<00:00:39.730> lens<00:00:39.879> types<00:00:40.149> when<00:00:41.140> you're

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
in the different lens types when you're

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:41.750 
in the different lens types when you're
shooting

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760

so<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.489> trick<00:00:57.700> Munir<00:00:58.030> recording<00:00:58.690> at

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
so that the trick Munir recording at

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
the maximum aperture you can just see

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.109 
the maximum aperture you can just see
there<00:01:06.280> possibly<00:01:06.820> on<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:06.970> screen<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:09.119> the

I<00:01:11.680> say<00:01:12.340> all<00:01:12.640> I'm<00:01:12.820> using<00:01:12.940> here<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.119> natural

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
I say all I'm using here is natural

light I've got a kind of a flash just on
the<00:01:15.040> camera<00:01:15.369> but<00:01:15.490> it's<00:01:15.610> not<00:01:15.729> it's<00:01:16.000> not<00:01:16.030> liking

the camera but it's not it's not liking

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.700 
the camera but it's not it's not liking
the<00:01:16.450> subject<00:01:16.780> that's<00:01:16.869> all<00:01:17.020> it's<00:01:17.170> sideways<00:01:17.350> on

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
the subject that's all it's sideways on

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.370 
the subject that's all it's sideways on
and<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.520> subject<00:01:18.940> joy<00:01:19.509> is<00:01:19.720> lit<00:01:19.900> their<00:01:20.080> display

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
and the subject joy is lit their display

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.490 
and the subject joy is lit their display
a<00:01:20.410> single<00:01:21.009> candle<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.899> see<00:01:23.410> the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
a single candle and you see the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.840 
a single candle and you see the
background<00:01:23.680> lights<00:01:24.070> there<00:01:24.340> there's<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.670> nice

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
background lights there there's a nice

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.790 
background lights there there's a nice
out-of-focus<00:01:25.479> area<00:01:26.020> behind<00:01:26.140> because<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
out-of-focus area behind because the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.380 
out-of-focus area behind because the
maximum<00:01:27.250> aperture<00:01:27.369> allows<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.060> do<00:01:28.180> that

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
maximum aperture allows you to do that

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.940 
maximum aperture allows you to do that
when<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.630> set<00:01:28.840> up<00:01:28.869> were<00:01:29.050> one<00:01:29.259> point<00:01:29.410> I<00:01:29.530> even<00:01:29.590> -

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
when I set up were one point I even -

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.570 
when I set up were one point I even -
you<00:01:30.130> get<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> nice<00:01:30.780> bouquet<00:01:31.780> effect<00:01:32.259> showing

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
you get a nice bouquet effect showing

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.889 
you get a nice bouquet effect showing
any<00:01:33.580> lights<00:01:33.970> or<00:01:34.119> anything<00:01:34.330> in<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.539> background

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
any lights or anything in the background

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.530 
any lights or anything in the background
is<00:01:34.990> very<00:01:35.020> blurred<00:01:35.440> so<00:01:36.280> that's<00:01:36.850> right<00:01:37.030> clearly

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
is very blurred so that's right clearly

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.190 
is very blurred so that's right clearly
so<00:01:39.170> now<00:01:39.890> because<00:01:40.370> it<00:01:40.460> is<00:01:40.550> done<00:01:40.760> I<00:01:40.970> put<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:41.450> just

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
so now because it is done I put it just

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.440 
so now because it is done I put it just
to<00:01:42.260> get<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.470> first<00:01:42.740> show<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:42.920> there<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
to get the first show you there the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.940 
to get the first show you there the
setting<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.720> exposure<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.620> is<00:01:45.740> just

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
setting for the exposure it is just

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.920 
setting for the exposure it is just
about<00:01:46.130> right<00:01:46.370> in<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.610> middle<00:01:46.790> there<00:01:46.970> expose

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
about right in the middle there expose

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.080 
about right in the middle there expose
it<00:01:48.080> for<00:01:48.110> Joyce<00:01:48.680> face<00:01:48.950> there<00:01:49.250> I've<00:01:49.910> got<00:01:50.060> a

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
it for Joyce face there I've got a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.880 
it for Joyce face there I've got a
candle<00:01:50.450> it's<00:01:50.540> hidden<00:01:50.660> behind<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:51.140> light<00:01:51.560> on<00:01:51.770> the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
candle it's hidden behind a light on the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.940 
candle it's hidden behind a light on the
table<00:01:52.490> here<00:01:52.670> just<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.510> just<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.560> mask<00:01:54.800> because

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
table here just to just a mask because

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.610 
table here just to just a mask because
if<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.250> flame<00:01:55.460> was<00:01:55.640> in<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.820> middle<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.060> the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
if the flame was in the middle of the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.740 
if the flame was in the middle of the
exposure<00:01:57.620> there<00:01:57.830> would<00:01:57.920> actually<00:01:58.190> spoil<00:01:58.460> it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
exposure there would actually spoil it

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.820 
exposure there would actually spoil it
back<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.840> one<00:01:59.960> move<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.140> side<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.620> us<00:02:00.650> I'll

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
back to one move that side to us I'll

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.920 
back to one move that side to us I'll
just<00:02:00.920> show<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.190> equipment<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.450> move<00:02:02.780> this

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
just show you that equipment I move this

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.399 
just show you that equipment I move this
sideways<00:02:03.440> you'll<00:02:03.650> see<00:02:03.830> the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.529 

B&amp;C<00:02:07.249> actually<00:02:07.670> hitting<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.939> labor<00:02:08.149> for<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
B&amp;C actually hitting the labor for the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.199 
B&amp;C actually hitting the labor for the
flowering<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.769> foreground<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.879> table

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
flowering in the foreground the table

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.190 
flowering in the foreground the table
flower<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.720> actually<00:02:11.810> show<00:02:12.050> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
flower just to actually show the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.780 
flower just to actually show the
out-of-focus<00:02:12.590> areas<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.160> foreground<00:02:13.459> -

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
out-of-focus areas in the foreground -

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.220 
out-of-focus areas in the foreground -
and<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.410> purely<00:02:16.250> by<00:02:16.400> now<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.750> candle<00:02:18.080> light

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
and so purely by now the candle light

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.400 
and so purely by now the candle light
plus<00:02:18.470> there's<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.739> very<00:02:18.920> weak<00:02:19.459> light<00:02:19.640> above<00:02:19.940> us

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
plus there's a very weak light above us

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.229 
plus there's a very weak light above us
get<00:02:21.410> get<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.739> lighting<00:02:21.920> pick<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.370> everything

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
get get the lighting pick so everything

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.089 
get get the lighting pick so everything
is<00:02:23.360> basically<00:02:23.900> ambient<00:02:24.440> light<00:02:24.620> I'm<00:02:24.830> not<00:02:24.950> using

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
is basically ambient light I'm not using

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.800 
is basically ambient light I'm not using
any<00:02:25.280> artificial<00:02:25.970> light<00:02:26.150> here<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.540> light<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
any artificial light here to light the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.009 
any artificial light here to light the
scene<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.650> again<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.340> ISO<00:02:28.670> sets<00:02:28.910> are<00:02:29.060> 1600<00:02:29.810> if

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
scene so again the ISO sets are 1600 if

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.350 
scene so again the ISO sets are 1600 if
I<00:02:30.260> am<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.769> know<00:02:30.890> that's<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.430> good<00:02:31.760> ISO<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> have

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
I am you know that's a good ISO to have

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.670 
I am you know that's a good ISO to have
any<00:02:32.629> higher<00:02:32.840> than<00:02:32.989> that<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.230> start<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.530> get<00:02:33.620> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
any higher than that you start to get a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.309 
any higher than that you start to get a
bit<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:33.890> bit<00:02:34.250> too<00:02:34.370> much<00:02:34.489> grain<00:02:34.819> in<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> photo<00:02:36.019> in

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
bit a bit too much grain in the photo in

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.960 
bit a bit too much grain in the photo in
the<00:02:36.440> film<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:38.410> really<00:02:39.410> if<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.590> reduce<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.610> ISO

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
the film and really if I reduce the ISO

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.300 
the film and really if I reduce the ISO
to<00:02:42.099> switch<00:02:43.099> that<00:02:43.280> recording<00:02:43.700> off<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.879> moment

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
to switch that recording off the moment

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.449 
to switch that recording off the moment
if<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.910> reduce<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.720> ISO<00:02:47.020> down<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.410> see<00:02:47.590> goes<00:02:48.280> it

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
if I reduce the ISO down you see goes it

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.890 
if I reduce the ISO down you see goes it
goes<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> little<00:02:48.790> bit<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> underexpose<00:02:49.420> there

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
goes a little bit to underexpose there

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.860 
goes a little bit to underexpose there
800<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.620> although<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:51.760> can<00:02:51.940> go<00:02:52.060> up<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:54.870> 3200

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
800 and although you can go up to 3200

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.180 
800 and although you can go up to 3200
there's<00:02:56.050> make<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.380> running<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.709> very<00:02:56.890> bright<00:02:57.160> a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
there's make it running on very bright a

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.420 
there's make it running on very bright a
little<00:02:57.520> bit<00:02:57.640> even<00:02:58.480> overexposed<00:02:59.110> there

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
little bit even overexposed there

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
little bit even overexposed there
there's<00:03:00.430> no<00:03:00.550> point<00:03:00.819> you<00:03:00.910> get<00:03:00.970> too<00:03:01.090> much<00:03:01.209> grain

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
there's no point you get too much grain

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.990 
there's no point you get too much grain
at<00:03:01.599> 1600<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.290> see<00:03:02.440> there<00:03:02.620> with<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.769> wide

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
at 1600 you see there with a wide

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.270 
at 1600 you see there with a wide
aperture<00:03:04.000> lens<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.660> allows<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.110> get<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.290> you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
aperture lens it allows you to get a you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.759 
aperture lens it allows you to get a you
know<00:03:06.310> very<00:03:06.400> nice<00:03:06.730> exposure<00:03:07.569> there<00:03:07.900> pretty

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
know very nice exposure there pretty

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.949 
know very nice exposure there pretty
well<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.220> using<00:03:09.400> natural<00:03:09.849> natural<00:03:10.599> lighting

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
well just using natural natural lighting

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.360 
well just using natural natural lighting
on<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.230> scene<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.709> don't<00:03:11.890> need<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.069> big

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
on the scene so you don't need a big

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.990 
on the scene so you don't need a big
video<00:03:12.519> light<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.660> light<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> scene<00:03:14.380> for<00:03:14.650> you

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
video light to light the scene for you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.210 
video light to light the scene for you
so<00:03:16.000> that's<00:03:16.599> using<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.959> 50<00:03:17.319> millimeter

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
so that's using the 50 millimeter

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.259 
so that's using the 50 millimeter
one-point<00:03:18.700> aliens<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.060> there's<00:03:19.180> one

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
one-point aliens and there's one

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.880 
one-point aliens and there's one
advantage<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.600> having<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:20.019> lens<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.530> think<00:03:20.799> is

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
advantage of having that lens I think is

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.740 
advantage of having that lens I think is
to<00:03:21.010> get<00:03:21.100> allow<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:22.060> shoot<00:03:22.239> scenes<00:03:22.480> like

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
to get allow you to to shoot scenes like

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.190 
to get allow you to to shoot scenes like
this<00:03:22.959> without<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:24.040> use<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.540> basically<00:03:25.540> LED<00:03:26.080> or

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
this without the use of basically LED or

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.730 
this without the use of basically LED or
video<00:03:26.410> guys

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.030 

you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.170 

okay<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.099> just<00:03:33.129> wanted<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.610> show<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.900> same

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
okay I just wanted to show you the same

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.330 
okay I just wanted to show you the same
effect<00:03:37.180> here<00:03:37.659> on<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.930> change<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.860> lens<00:03:39.069> from

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
effect here on the change the lens from

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.800 
effect here on the change the lens from
the<00:03:39.519> 1.8<00:03:39.939> just<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.209> get<00:03:40.329> show<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.569> why<00:03:40.750> the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
the 1.8 just to get show you why the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.380 
the 1.8 just to get show you why the
this<00:03:41.680> maximum<00:03:42.159> aperture<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:42.879> so<00:03:42.970> important

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
this maximum aperture is so important

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.360 
this maximum aperture is so important
then<00:03:43.540> when<00:03:44.110> you're<00:03:44.200> shooting<00:03:44.290> at<00:03:44.500> night<00:03:44.620> I've

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
then when you're shooting at night I've

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.830 
then when you're shooting at night I've
just<00:03:45.549> put<00:03:45.700> on<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.879> kits<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.329> a<00:03:46.450> kit<00:03:46.659> lens

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
just put on the kits and a kit lens

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.649 
just put on the kits and a kit lens
which<00:03:47.079> is<00:03:47.110> an<00:03:47.319> 18<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.829> 55<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.670> I've<00:03:49.299> tried<00:03:49.510> to

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
which is an 18 to 55 and I've tried to

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.149 
which is an 18 to 55 and I've tried to
mimic<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:50.470> know<00:03:50.560> I've<00:03:50.650> got<00:03:50.769> pretty<00:03:50.890> well<00:03:51.069> of

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
mimic you know I've got pretty well of

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.729 
mimic you know I've got pretty well of
15<00:03:51.489> millimeter<00:03:52.049> focal<00:03:53.049> length<00:03:53.379> on<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.560> lens

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
15 millimeter focal length on the lens

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.960 
15 millimeter focal length on the lens
so<00:03:53.829> I'll<00:03:53.950> try<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.159> mimic<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.519> 15<00:03:54.819> millimeter

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
so I'll try to mimic the 15 millimeter

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.660 
so I'll try to mimic the 15 millimeter
names<00:03:55.390> pretty<00:03:55.629> well<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:56.769> how<00:03:56.980> my<00:03:57.129> father<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.489> in

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
names pretty well in how my father is in

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.729 
names pretty well in how my father is in
zoomed<00:03:57.940> now<00:03:58.569> in<00:03:58.810> me<00:03:58.900> should<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.079> put<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.319> on<00:03:59.440> you

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
zoomed now in me should I put it on you

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.740 
zoomed now in me should I put it on you
can<00:03:59.859> see<00:04:00.010> there<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.340> actual<00:04:00.750> maximum

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
can see there the actual maximum

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.210 
can see there the actual maximum
aperture<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:02.049> can<00:04:02.230> get<00:04:02.349> on<00:04:02.439> this<00:04:02.590> lens<00:04:02.769> at<00:04:03.010> 50

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
aperture I can get on this lens at 50

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.110 
aperture I can get on this lens at 50
minute<00:04:03.549> is<00:04:03.670> actually<00:04:03.940> 5.6<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.680> at<00:04:05.799> 5.6<00:04:06.400> I've

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
minute is actually 5.6 and at 5.6 I've

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.119 
minute is actually 5.6 and at 5.6 I've
even<00:04:07.480> put<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.690> ice<00:04:07.810> all<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.170> way<00:04:08.260> up<00:04:08.349> to<00:04:08.470> 6400

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
even put the ice all the way up to 6400

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.099 
even put the ice all the way up to 6400
which<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.609> far<00:04:09.909> too<00:04:10.150> grainy<00:04:10.569> you<00:04:10.810> it'll<00:04:11.079> be

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
which is far too grainy you it'll be

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.289 
which is far too grainy you it'll be
very<00:04:11.440> great<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.859> even<00:04:12.549> with<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.909> you<00:04:13.180> can

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
very great and even with that you can

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.469 
very great and even with that you can
see<00:04:13.510> there<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.920> shot<00:04:15.159> is<00:04:15.310> way<00:04:15.879> under<00:04:16.060> expose

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
see there the shot is way under expose

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.939 
see there the shot is way under expose
there<00:04:16.780> with<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:17.410> so<00:04:17.560> it's<00:04:17.680> almost

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
there with that so it's almost

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.800 
there with that so it's almost
impossible<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.459> shoot<00:04:18.639> in<00:04:18.789> one<00:04:18.910> of<00:04:19.000> these<00:04:19.120> at

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
impossible to shoot in one of these at

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.560 
impossible to shoot in one of these at
nighttime<00:04:20.079> if<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.709> decrease<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.789> ISO<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
nighttime if I decrease the ISO to the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.100 
nighttime if I decrease the ISO to the
what<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:24.729> 1.8<00:04:25.120> millimeter<00:04:25.510> lens<00:04:25.720> had<00:04:25.960> on

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
what the the 1.8 millimeter lens had on

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.260 
what the the 1.8 millimeter lens had on
it<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.380> 50<00:04:26.650> millimeter<00:04:26.910> used<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.060> shot

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
it the 50 millimeter used to shot

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.930 
it the 50 millimeter used to shot
completely<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:29.320> that's<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.010> reason<00:04:30.310> if<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.460> put

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
completely so that's the reason if I put

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.500 
completely so that's the reason if I put
it<00:04:31.030> up<00:04:31.120> again

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
it up again

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.650 
it up again
yeah<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:32.990> did<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.620> I'll<00:04:33.740> show<00:04:33.890> you

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.960 

back<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.500> again<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:38.920> it's<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.460> go<00:04:39.610> so

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
back to that again so it's to go so

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.950 
back to that again so it's to go so
that's<00:04:40.090> why<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.330> need<00:04:40.540> something<00:04:40.840> like<00:04:40.870> a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
that's why you need something like a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.450 
that's why you need something like a
very<00:04:41.200> wide<00:04:41.380> aperture<00:04:41.590> lens<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.130> shoot<00:04:42.310> at

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
very wide aperture lens to shoot at

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.030 
very wide aperture lens to shoot at
night<00:04:42.490> in<00:04:42.910> natural<00:04:43.780> lighting<00:04:43.960> additions<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.620> a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
night in natural lighting additions in a

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.440 
night in natural lighting additions in a
restaurant<00:04:45.340> or<00:04:45.610> wherever<00:04:45.790> it<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.000> indoors

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
restaurant or wherever it is indoors

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.780 
restaurant or wherever it is indoors
whatever<00:04:46.780> even<00:04:46.990> outdoors<00:04:47.190> where<00:04:48.190> it's<00:04:48.310> where

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
whatever even outdoors where it's where

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.010 
whatever even outdoors where it's where
it's<00:04:48.880> nighttime<00:04:49.060> where<00:04:49.630> there<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.810> sunlight

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
it's nighttime where there is sunlight

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.290 
it's nighttime where there is sunlight
without<00:04:50.980> relying<00:04:51.400> on<00:04:51.490> video<00:04:51.730> if<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:51.970> put<00:04:52.240> the

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
without relying on video if I put the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.030 
without relying on video if I put the
video<00:04:52.510> light<00:04:52.720> on<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.080> joy<00:04:53.350> heat<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:53.710> see<00:04:53.890> it's

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
video light on the joy heat you see it's

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.980 
video light on the joy heat you see it's
kind<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.340> a<00:04:54.430> different<00:04:55.270> effect<00:04:55.390> altogether

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
kind of a different effect altogether

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.360 
kind of a different effect altogether
and<00:04:56.110> it<00:04:56.170> gets<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.470> exposure<00:04:56.770> if<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.010> move<00:04:57.220> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
and it gets the exposure if I move the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.680 
and it gets the exposure if I move the
exposure<00:04:57.670> I'll<00:04:57.850> move<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.090> light<00:04:58.240> back<00:04:58.420> a<00:04:58.450> bit

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
exposure I'll move the light back a bit

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.950 
exposure I'll move the light back a bit
you<00:04:58.900> can<00:04:59.530> see<00:04:59.560> there<00:04:59.920> but<00:05:00.340> obviously<00:05:00.400> that's

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
you can see there but obviously that's

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.749 
you can see there but obviously that's
as<00:05:02.259> adding<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.680> huge<00:05:03.039> amount<00:05:03.250> of<00:05:03.310> new<00:05:03.430> life<00:05:03.639> to

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
as adding a huge amount of new life to

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.279 
as adding a huge amount of new life to
the<00:05:03.850> scene<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.780> it's<00:05:04.930> gonna<00:05:05.050> be<00:05:05.169> very

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
the scene and it's gonna be very

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.800 
the scene and it's gonna be very
conspicuous<00:05:06.009> when<00:05:06.490> you're<00:05:06.580> doing<00:05:06.820> it<00:05:06.970> that

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
conspicuous when you're doing it that

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.850 
conspicuous when you're doing it that
it's<00:05:07.930> an<00:05:07.990> extra<00:05:08.289> thing<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.560> actually<00:05:08.680> be

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
it's an extra thing to actually be

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.379 
it's an extra thing to actually be
carrying<00:05:09.070> around<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.430> another<00:05:09.580> video<00:05:09.910> like<00:05:10.090> I

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
carrying around you another video like I

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.379 
carrying around you another video like I
saw<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.810> way<00:05:10.960> doing<00:05:11.289> the<00:05:11.380> lighting<00:05:11.740> but<00:05:11.860> erm

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
saw the way doing the lighting but erm

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.270 
saw the way doing the lighting but erm
as<00:05:13.389> I<00:05:13.539> said<00:05:13.690> not<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.080> nice<00:05:14.229> you<00:05:14.470> also<00:05:14.500> lose<00:05:14.979> as

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
as I said not so nice you also lose as

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.129 
as I said not so nice you also lose as
you<00:05:15.310> can<00:05:15.490> see<00:05:15.699> there<00:05:15.940> on<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.389> lens<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:16.960> also

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
you can see there on the lens you also

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.960 
you can see there on the lens you also
lose<00:05:17.470> at<00:05:18.100> that<00:05:18.340> sort<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.550> aperture<00:05:18.850> in<00:05:18.940> the

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
lose at that sort of aperture in the

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.240 
lose at that sort of aperture in the
background<00:05:19.449> there's<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.139> lot<00:05:20.350> less<00:05:20.560> blur<00:05:20.979> I

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
background there's a lot less blur I

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.950 
background there's a lot less blur I
mean<00:05:21.430> you<00:05:21.850> can't<00:05:22.090> really<00:05:22.240> get<00:05:22.419> so<00:05:22.780> much

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
mean you can't really get so much

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.540 
mean you can't really get so much
bouquet<00:05:23.380> or<00:05:23.530> blur<00:05:23.740> effect<00:05:24.070> as<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.280> did<00:05:24.400> on<00:05:24.460> the

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
bouquet or blur effect as you did on the

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.010 
bouquet or blur effect as you did on the
1.8<00:05:25.030> at<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:25.840> same<00:05:26.020> setting<00:05:26.410> so<00:05:27.750> that's<00:05:28.750> again

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
1.8 at the same setting so that's again

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.749 
1.8 at the same setting so that's again
one<00:05:29.169> reason<00:05:29.470> folk<00:05:29.710> a<00:05:30.009> good<00:05:30.310> reason<00:05:30.610> why<00:05:30.699> you

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
one reason folk a good reason why you

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.900 
one reason folk a good reason why you
would<00:05:30.910> use<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.979> 50<00:05:32.979> millimetre<00:05:33.310> 1.8<00:05:33.729> or<00:05:33.850> a

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:50.279 
times the price of the 1.8 it's a minute

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.879 
times the price of the 1.8 it's a minute
at<00:06:50.399> one<00:06:50.490> point

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
at one point

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.749 
at one point
canon<00:06:51.129> lens<00:06:51.310> so<00:06:52.499> probably<00:06:53.499> you<00:06:53.860> know<00:06:53.979> you<00:06:54.610> can

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 
canon lens so probably you know you can

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.640 
canon lens so probably you know you can
get<00:06:54.879> you<00:06:55.419> can<00:06:55.539> get<00:06:55.840> extremely<00:06:56.259> good<00:06:56.379> picture

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650

get you can get extremely good picture
there<00:06:56.800> with<00:06:56.889> a<00:06:56.949> 1.8<00:06:57.370> it's<00:06:57.669> going<00:06:57.849> to<00:06:57.909> be<00:06:57.969> in<00:06:58.030> 1.8

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
there with a 1.8 it's going to be in 1.8

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.640 
there with a 1.8 it's going to be in 1.8
as<00:06:58.569> well<00:07:00.990> but<00:07:01.990> so<00:07:02.169> anyway<00:07:02.379> that's<00:07:02.499> the

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
as well but so anyway that's the

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.239 
as well but so anyway that's the
difference<00:07:02.979> in<00:07:03.099> the<00:07:03.129> effect<00:07:04.830> getting<00:07:05.830> okay

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:06.249 
difference in the effect getting okay

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:08.519 
difference in the effect getting okay
that's<00:07:06.520> it<00:07:06.669> use<00:07:06.849> me<00:07:07.060> in<00:07:07.360> how<00:07:07.599> to<00:07:07.659> issue<00:07:07.840> in

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:08.529 
that's it use me in how to issue in

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:12.149 
that's it use me in how to issue in
low-light<00:07:09.310> conditions<00:07:09.840> using<00:07:10.840> as<00:07:11.770> you<00:07:11.919> see

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:12.159 
low-light conditions using as you see

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.480 
low-light conditions using as you see
here<00:07:12.400> very<00:07:12.669> wide<00:07:13.479> aperture<00:07:14.099> the<00:07:15.099> maximum

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490
