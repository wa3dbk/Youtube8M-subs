00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
bit easier to grab grab the you know

bit easier to grab grab the you know
grab<00:00:48.750> passes<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.350> things<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.070> you

grab passes and things like that but you
know<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.210> tell<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.780> how<00:00:51.989> slick<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
know you can just tell like how slick it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.270 
know you can just tell like how slick it
is<00:00:52.469> right<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.219> even

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
is right now it's going to get even

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
is right now it's going to get even
worse<00:00:54.030> when<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.570> wet<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.289> now<00:00:55.440> we

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
worse when they get wet all right now we

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
worse when they get wet all right now we
have<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.949> ball<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> little

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
have this ball and it's a little

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.119 
have this ball and it's a little
deflated<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.350> tell<00:00:58.680> me<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.949> feels

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
deflated so tell me how it feels

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.830 
deflated so tell me how it feels
compared<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> them<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.910> yeah<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> hold

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
compared to them so yeah and if you hold

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.959 
compared to them so yeah and if you hold
this<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.289> almost<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.550> guess

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
this one you can almost see it I guess

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.600 
this one you can almost see it I guess
you<00:01:03.719> squeezed<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you squeezed into it and you know it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.219 
you squeezed into it and you know it
gives<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> didn't

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
gives a little bit that one that didn't

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.260 
gives a little bit that one that didn't
do<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> difference<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.030> it's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
do that at all so the difference is it's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760 
do that at all so the difference is it's
going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.540> easier<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.960> catch<00:01:10.170> some<00:01:10.439> easier

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
going to be easier to catch some easier

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.109 
going to be easier to catch some easier
to<00:01:10.890> hold<00:01:11.040> might<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> little<00:01:11.820> bit<00:01:11.970> more

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
to hold might be a little bit more

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.460 
to hold might be a little bit more
difficult<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.479> throw<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.380> if

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
difficult to throw actually because if

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.109 
difficult to throw actually because if
you<00:01:13.560> grip<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.070> too<00:01:14.250> tight<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.580> might<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.030> know

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you grip it too tight you might you know

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
you grip it too tight you might you know
throw<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.570> downward<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> little<00:01:16.259> bit<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
throw it downward a little bit but in a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.039 
throw it downward a little bit but in a
game<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.340> last<00:01:17.520> night<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.030> might<00:01:18.420> help<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
game like last night it might help I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
game like last night it might help I
guess<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> put<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
guess you know if you put if you get a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.310 
guess you know if you put if you get a
hammer<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> better<00:01:21.990> chance<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
hammer you got a better chance of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
hammer you got a better chance of
hauling<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
hauling there and then with it on the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
hauling there and then with it on the

Colts deflated balls do they really make

a difference at all I mean I think you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.999 
a difference at all I mean I think you
know<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.170> Patriots<00:01:34.530> could<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.710> gone<00:01:34.829> out

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
know the Patriots could have gone out

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.289 
know the Patriots could have gone out
there<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> watermelon<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.060> probably

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
there with a watermelon and probably

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.940
