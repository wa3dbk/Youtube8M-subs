you<00:00:24.630> know<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.840> always<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.380> work<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
you know it's always about the work and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.029 
you know it's always about the work and
the<00:00:26.279> story<00:00:26.970> that's<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.630> about<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the story that's all it's about and you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.890 
the story that's all it's about and you
can<00:00:29.220> throw<00:00:29.730> lots<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> money<00:00:30.300> at<00:00:30.480> things<00:00:30.660> but

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
can throw lots of money at things but

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.240 
can throw lots of money at things but
unless<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> story<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.679> right<00:00:31.890> unless<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
unless the story is right unless the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
unless the story is right unless the
direction<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.989> won't<00:00:34.230> mean

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
direction is right it won't mean

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.250 
direction is right it won't mean
anything<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.790> they<00:00:35.940> strive<00:00:36.660> for

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
anything and I think they strive for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.850 
anything and I think they strive for
excellence

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
excellence

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.880 
excellence
always

she is quite dark which is of course

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.910
