and the camera that we have is right
there<00:01:09.340> that<00:01:10.320> monitors<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.799> here<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:14.170> far<00:01:14.470> I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
there that monitors in here so far I

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.240 
there that monitors in here so far I
want<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.220> set<00:01:15.520> something<00:01:15.820> up<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:17.130> camera<00:01:18.130> to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
want to set something up that camera to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:49.410 
want to set something up that camera to

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
come on this one

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.520 
come on this one
five<00:01:49.720> pounds<00:01:50.400> weight<00:01:52.020> counter<00:01:53.020> weight

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
five pounds weight counter weight

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.620 
five pounds weight counter weight
it<00:01:54.490> would<00:01:55.210> be<00:01:55.330> four<00:01:55.720> pounds<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:56.410> I<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:57.630> one-pound

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
it would be four pounds so I a one-pound

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.570 
it would be four pounds so I a one-pound
weight<00:01:59.020> down<00:01:59.380> there<00:02:02.430> old<00:02:03.430> drill<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:05.230> few

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
weight down there old drill and a few

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.960 
weight down there old drill and a few
circuitry<00:02:06.580> behind<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.270> board<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.700> was

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
circuitry behind that board and this was

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.580 
circuitry behind that board and this was
from<00:02:10.269> an<00:02:10.629> old<00:02:10.780> foot<00:02:11.739> massager<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:13.560> made<00:02:14.560> a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
from an old foot massager and made a

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.880 
from an old foot massager and made a
good<00:02:14.980> worm<00:02:15.250> gear<00:02:16.050> very<00:02:17.050> sturdy

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.760 

that<00:02:23.890> might<00:02:24.099> be<00:02:24.250> going<00:02:24.550> bad
