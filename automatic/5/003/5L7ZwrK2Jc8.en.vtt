00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.450
 Y 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.670
 hello welcome to my channel today 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.119
 I have a tutorial using the new palette 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 of parrots and it's a smoky eye color 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.290
 plum so if you want to learn 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.680
 how to grab this makeup just follow 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.680
 seeing 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.590
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.440
 grab a base for eyes and this is going 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.809
 to help the shadow last longer and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.239
 also the colors are more vibrant and 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.680
 I'm applying it with my fingers then 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.870
 I'm going to grab the first shadow that 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.420
 called nectar and I'm going to blur it in 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.040
 eye crease and this will help us 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.690
 that when we apply the other shadows 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.690
 do not look so severe 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.710
 the next shadow that we're going to start 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.990
 to apply is called light coffee and this 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.320
 let's concentrate on the crease of the eye 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.080
 and then we will blur with the same 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.570
 brush that we use to apply nectar what 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.610
 let's blur with this 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.760
 the next shadow that we are going to grab 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.250
 it's what it's for and we're going to start 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.320
 apply this on the eyelid of the eye and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.600
 notice that I'm using soft little touches 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.240
 so that all of us will not fall 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.040
 probe around the eye and this we are going to 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.770
 arrive applying it until you reach 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.930
 fold of the eye and if for some reason 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.700
 they have work applying the shadow what 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.460
 The only thing they have to do is to turn the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.110
 brush down and with this you are going 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 help with the application of the shadow 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.130
 when they have finished applying the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 shadow the only thing they have to do is 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.450
 blur the shadow 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.759
 and obviously if they lose a little bit of the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.090
 intensity of the shadow can only 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.460
 re apply and then let's see the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.159
 shadow that is called rubbing and this we're going 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.690
 to apply to the lacrimal area of ​​the eye and 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.490
 after it's finished 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.330
 apply again , you're starting to 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.330
 blur what 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.040
 let's see again the shadow that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.750
 called light brown and let's start 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.750

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.560
 False eyelashes I swear to you soon 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.400
 I'm going to have it in Spanish but for 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.920
 while in English 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.829
 grabbing a black lidiador we are going to 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.750
 apply this on the eye contour and already 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.540
 then we're going to move to our face 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.129
 I'm going to apply this primer so that we 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.959
 give the appearance that our pores 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.200
 are closed and so that the surface 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.870
 look good smooth 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.590
 and for my base I will be using this 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.569
 base that is called x 1 and is in color f 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.340
 300 and obviously I will be 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.720
 applying with my favorite brush that 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.580
 is sigma this is the brush f 80 and what 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.280
 What I love about this base is that I 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.380
 covers all imperfections and looks 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.200
 my face very healthy as if it were 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.019

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.879
 from my eyes nose and my forehead 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.310
 then I'm going to replicate the color again
