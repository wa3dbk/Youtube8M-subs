00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.680
 so hello here shows me once the monty 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.410
 how to fill with filters with water 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.410
 the water cleans out of this 5 her 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:55.280
 estimated water in the bag rainer 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:58.449
 automatically handy to the cloth 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.449
 has filled only once grossly 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.510
 that doing that I'm mad at the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.970
 Try the master third with six 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.160
 That's the right one, but it's one 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.500
 running waters that have already tested 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.170
 It always comes back on all occasions 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.860
 new water behind 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.860
 but not a little bit 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.650
 semak therefore one should try group 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.940
 dirt first torture full 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.360
 also did not take place until then sat 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.360
 once met 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:58.030
 the spread of new ones 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.600
 just had it on 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:14.620
 who really knows bottle on 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:36.580
 but in the Kruger both were shootings 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:37.300
 I try out shame group days 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.580
 get pressed 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.830
 there is only this water through what 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.130
 Everything that is per ton is everything 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.130
 under 0.1 micronas stays in it 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.769
 It could not be easier to leave 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.769
 got to 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.450
 the fabrics are coming 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.960
 it pays for example in cottbus at 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.590
 summer where human civilization its 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.560
 So, for example, water must not stetten 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.360
 a knowledgeable work but set a 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.140
 example at the factory we know this 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:49.080
 account of mountain tourists civilizations 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.080
 it will definitely be people 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.500
 and on it goes a lot 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:14.230
 as they are clearly for it 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.550
 the water was supposed to be is 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.610
 then of course now the filter still 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:23.110
 better than you shape two 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.390
 Here is the case for the creek run hardly too 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.500
 recognize such a small child there 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.870
 we are here and a little bit free 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.870
 scratched and already have something to drink 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.710
 thanks to michael that mainz with the part of 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.900
 especially to buy 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.220
 how come where they are missing because we have one 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.140
 quite consciously most change cartridges 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.050
 knew big extra money cost 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.210
 does any pump systems have to be what you are 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.640
 Do and hate like the stream only 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:27.040
 Pump and anything else deliberately easy 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:28.660
 set it here eg you are and you are 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.930
 the kicker maybe so serious that 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.510
 a practice water cooker off and on 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.420
 be that over 50 is a big drawback 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:48.460
 can also be killed 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:50.740
 despite the dna unconditioned was the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.570
 possibility additional water of 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.250
 many and take with because is 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.250
 Of course that includes looking into one 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.140
 restrict backpack 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.880
 important is now only with the filter itself 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.860
 when should 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.300
 there is of course at all service now 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.770
 bisserl what in there and if now 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.240
 the just so the backpack he fooled 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.930
 then he will give me a backpack 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.170
 make up 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.430
 either your opponent in a blog today 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.440
 to develop purely 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.290
 or there is for example one 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.550
 possibility told us on the matter 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.060
 for example, you cut from a pet 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.730
 bottles 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.860
 That's the benefit of a pet bottle 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.700
 from a normal 1.5 liter pet 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.200
 bottles cuts to win 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.320
 Stoffel on it and then you do that there 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.940
 in that case it is the other one as well 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:44.380
 possibility is quite normal 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:44.380
 conventional yield and 4
