00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.629 

so<00:04:31.780> altogether<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.470> little<00:04:33.190> piece<00:04:33.400> sounds

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
so altogether that little piece sounds

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:41.159 
so altogether that little piece sounds
like<00:04:33.850> this

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.569 

and<00:04:42.169> there's<00:04:42.589> only<00:04:42.709> one<00:04:42.829> note<00:04:43.129> after<00:04:43.309> that

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:43.579 
and there's only one note after that

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:50.409

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
which is the 5th string 2nd fret so all

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.119 
which is the 5th string 2nd fret so all
together<00:04:50.589> should<00:04:51.589> sound<00:04:51.829> a<00:04:51.889> little<00:04:51.979> something

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
together should sound a little something

00:04:52.129 --> 00:05:07.200 
together should sound a little something
like<00:04:52.339> this

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.300 

and<00:05:08.210> in<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.930> song<00:05:09.170> you<00:05:09.410> play<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.800> riff<00:05:09.980> twice

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
and in the song you play that riff twice

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.620 
and in the song you play that riff twice
