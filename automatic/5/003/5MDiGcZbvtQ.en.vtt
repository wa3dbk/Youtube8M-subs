00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
fifth early I would be very very worried
if<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.049> fun<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:40.740> he<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.250> him<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:42.060> true

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
if I fun when he was on him that's true

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.450 
if I fun when he was on him that's true
and<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.590> Rebel<00:01:43.890> Stakes<00:01:44.040> he<00:01:44.250> didn't

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and in in the Rebel Stakes he didn't

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.770 
and in in the Rebel Stakes he didn't
stop<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> Casey<00:01:44.970> said<00:01:45.210> about<00:01:45.390> three<00:01:45.600> legs

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
stop the Casey said about three legs

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
stop the Casey said about three legs
back<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.140> he<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.409> missed<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.369> he's

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
back but he just missed but I think he's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.800 
back but he just missed but I think he's
best<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.909> think<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.299> they<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.479> let<00:01:48.750> her

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
best to think it just they just let her

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
best to think it just they just let her
run<00:01:48.899> he's<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> free<00:01:49.350> running<00:01:49.530> more<00:01:49.740> suck<00:01:50.100> he

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
run he's a free running more suck he

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 
run he's a free running more suck he
wants<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.390> he<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.630> get<00:01:51.750> into<00:01:52.079> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
wants to go and if he can get into that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.590 
wants to go and if he can get into that
kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> rhythm<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.909> reason<00:01:54.240> based<00:01:54.450> on

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
kind of rhythm the reason based on

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.910 
kind of rhythm the reason based on
pedigree<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.290> get<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> distance

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
pedigree that he can get the distance

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.450 
pedigree that he can get the distance
and<00:01:56.100> he

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and he

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280 
and he
the<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:56.700> connections<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> he<00:01:58.110> showed

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the right connections and he showed

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.620 
the right connections and he showed
enough<00:01:58.560> ability<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.520> he<00:02:00.180> could<00:02:00.390> surprise

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
enough ability that he could surprise

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.840 
enough ability that he could surprise
and<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.200> much<00:02:01.320> ability<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:02.100> oxbow<00:02:02.520> shown

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and for as much ability as oxbow shown

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 
and for as much ability as oxbow shown
I'm<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.810> sure<00:02:03.840> we've<00:02:04.200> seen<00:02:04.409> his<00:02:04.500> best<00:02:04.710> ray

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I'm not so sure we've seen his best ray

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.520 
I'm not so sure we've seen his best ray
 he's<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.900> said<00:02:07.020> he's<00:02:07.170> like

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
 he's one I think I said he's like

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.380 
 he's one I think I said he's like
one<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:07.860> bubble<00:02:08.039> contenders<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.670> he<00:02:09.179> does

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
one of my bubble contenders but he does

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.820 
one of my bubble contenders but he does
scare<00:02:09.630> me<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:09.959> bit<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.350> think<00:02:10.470> that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
scare me a little bit here I think that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.400 
scare me a little bit here I think that
if<00:02:11.520> he<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.880> he<00:02:12.030> runs<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.360> race<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.959> he<00:02:13.050> runs<00:02:13.230> his

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
if he if he runs the race if he runs his

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.110 
if he if he runs the race if he runs his
race<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.860> me<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.130> he's<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> race

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
race to me that that he's up on the race

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.420 
race to me that that he's up on the race
it's<00:02:15.450> within<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.840> realm<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.260> possibility<00:02:17.130> it

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
it's within the realm of possibility it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.400 
it's within the realm of possibility it
is<00:02:17.819> absolutely<00:02:18.480> now<00:02:18.870> we're<00:02:18.989> going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> kind<00:02:19.350> of
