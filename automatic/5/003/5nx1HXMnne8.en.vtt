00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.840
 capital here of young people look at minecraft 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.830
 in a minecraft server tutorial 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.750
 and they bring the citizen plugin and what 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.500
 that does not want is that they flow as you see is 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.300
 create characters characters without 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.450
 identity to follow certain characters 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.910
 that do not really exist here appears 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.550
 a gentleman who calls himself of the young mc all 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.060
 reality is it is a character but not 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.890
 it's real is an image only and good 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.719
 because this term will allow to create 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.170
 many characters all we want 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.809
 with his skins and everything and by the way 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.320
 bought already told me here I'm going to 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.030
 remove this to write well 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 I possibly changed my skin, I did not know 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.989
 he threw some and fast to approve it 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.220
 and well my heart here because I 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.360
 has given to create a 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.140
 with a pc always for every command that 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.080
 let's make this efe this 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.229
 then create we put a man that 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.960
 we want to put for example 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:26.509
 m 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.509
 here sometimes sometimes so that we put them 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.570
 and now he looks at us when we come out of a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.100
 range does not look at us anymore because we 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.100
 we manage but we can approach 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.509
 and now we right click on rivers and 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.700
 you have a presence in your hand so 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.490
 we are going to put something to default because the same 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.310
 let's put a game before 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.549
 in the right 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.200
 type we propose if we want to remove 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.450
 all by right clicking with the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.950
 hand and we take it off we can nfc peace 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.010
 that there are times to give it now yes that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.530
 leave then we left click as if 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.060
 we were to break a block and goods of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.140
 here if we want that also 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.780
 and here and if we want this bridge to 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.120
 here we want that goes here 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.890
 here and good that we had written 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.830
 again in the father pc 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.050
 and I am 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.310
 and good here goes directly here 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.990
 because when we explain and not explained 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.200
 well but good we can do that 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.850
 basically I associated as and then it is 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.200
 pretty sure we can create all of them 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.380
 you make us want to create 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.380
 d 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.380
 behind
