00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.180 
on the right so here I'm coming a little
bit<00:04:50.100> draw<00:04:51.100> a<00:04:51.130> big<00:04:51.490> curve<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.170> you<00:04:53.950> come

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
bit draw a big curve like this you come

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.360 
bit draw a big curve like this you come
in<00:04:54.450> okay<00:04:55.450> let's<00:04:56.290> go<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.530> bottom<00:04:56.890> side<00:04:57.070> here

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370

and do the exact same thing come around
almost<00:05:01.360> like<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.540> sideways<00:05:02.290> heart<00:05:02.860> shape<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.310> I

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
almost like a sideways heart shape and I

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.330 
almost like a sideways heart shape and I
don't<00:05:03.400> overlap<00:05:03.910> it<00:05:04.150> just<00:05:04.990> like<00:05:05.140> that<00:05:05.170> okay

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
don't overlap it just like that okay

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.820 
don't overlap it just like that okay
in<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:07.090> middle<00:05:07.480> of<00:05:07.600> this<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:08.050> draw<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> little

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
in the middle of this I draw a little

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.390 
in the middle of this I draw a little
curve<00:05:09.360> comes<00:05:10.360> in<00:05:10.540> like<00:05:11.170> that<00:05:11.380> let's<00:05:12.280> do

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
curve comes in like that let's do

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.890 
curve comes in like that let's do
something<00:05:12.760> similar<00:05:12.970> on<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.270> other<00:05:13.390> side<00:05:13.600> so

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
something similar on the other side so

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.860 
something similar on the other side so
you<00:05:14.170> start<00:05:15.100> right<00:05:15.310> about<00:05:15.460> here<00:05:16.320> come<00:05:17.320> up<00:05:17.560> and

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
I'm going to come down okay and instead

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.870 
I'm going to come down okay and instead
of<00:05:22.840> having<00:05:23.140> this<00:05:23.440> bottom<00:05:23.950> one<00:05:23.980> overlap<00:05:24.490> on<00:05:24.700> top

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
of having this bottom one overlap on top

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.520 
of having this bottom one overlap on top
this<00:05:25.240> one's<00:05:25.540> going<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:25.780> overlap<00:05:26.050> on<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.320> top

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
this one's going to overlap on the top

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.770 
this one's going to overlap on the top
of<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.710> bottom<00:05:26.950> one<00:05:27.040> so<00:05:27.390> let's<00:05:28.390> go<00:05:28.510> up<00:05:28.690> a

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
of the bottom one so let's go up a

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.560 
of the bottom one so let's go up a
little<00:05:28.900> bit<00:05:29.080> here<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:29.410> do<00:05:29.560> it<00:05:29.590> overlap<00:05:30.570> come

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
little bit here and do it overlap come

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.670 
little bit here and do it overlap come
in<00:05:31.870> into<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:32.830> oval<00:05:33.160> and<00:05:33.550> I'll<00:05:34.450> draw<00:05:34.720> a<00:05:34.840> curve

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
in into that oval and I'll draw a curve

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.700 
in into that oval and I'll draw a curve
just<00:05:35.980> like<00:05:36.100> I<00:05:36.190> did<00:05:36.370> here<00:05:36.750> okay<00:05:37.750> now<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:38.620> we

almost<00:05:59.919> last<00:06:00.100> thing<00:06:00.310> let's<00:06:01.000> put<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.180> point<00:06:01.479> in

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
almost last thing let's put a point in

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.990 
almost last thing let's put a point in
between<00:06:01.930> our<00:06:02.229> eyes<00:06:02.320> just<00:06:02.710> above<00:06:03.010> like<00:06:03.640> that<00:06:03.820> in

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
between our eyes just above like that in

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.520 
between our eyes just above like that in
the<00:06:04.060> middle<00:06:04.180> and<00:06:05.050> draw<00:06:05.860> two<00:06:06.729> curves<00:06:07.530> that

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
the middle and draw two curves that

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.230 
the middle and draw two curves that
flare<00:06:08.919> out<00:06:09.160> okay

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
flare out okay

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.890 
flare out okay
the<00:06:11.140> final<00:06:11.650> thing<00:06:11.800> are<00:06:12.640> the<00:06:12.820> two<00:06:13.030> big<00:06:13.270> ears<00:06:13.570> so

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
the final thing are the two big ears so

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.110 
the final thing are the two big ears so
she's<00:06:14.080> got<00:06:14.229> big<00:06:14.530> round<00:06:14.830> circles<00:06:15.340> on<00:06:15.550> other

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
she's got big round circles on other

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.380 
she's got big round circles on other
side<00:06:16.360> so<00:06:16.510> I'm<00:06:16.600> imagine<00:06:17.229> a<00:06:17.520> round<00:06:18.520> circle<00:06:18.910> in

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
side so I'm imagine a round circle in

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.690 
side so I'm imagine a round circle in
here<00:06:20.020> so<00:06:20.979> that's<00:06:21.280> going<00:06:23.520> continue<00:06:24.520> this

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
here so that's going continue this

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.629 
here so that's going continue this
behind<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.270> ribbon

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
behind the ribbon

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.029 
behind the ribbon
and<00:06:26.909> come<00:06:27.150> down<00:06:27.479> like<00:06:27.659> that<00:06:27.720> and<00:06:28.139> the<00:06:29.009> other

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
and come down like that and the other

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.860 
and come down like that and the other
one<00:06:29.370> would<00:06:29.490> be<00:06:29.699> somewhere<00:06:30.120> around<00:06:30.180> here<00:06:30.449> so

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
one would be somewhere around here so

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.830 
one would be somewhere around here so
let's<00:06:31.379> imagine<00:06:31.500> a<00:06:32.009> big<00:06:32.250> year<00:06:32.599> it<00:06:33.599> kind<00:06:33.810> of

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
let's imagine a big year it kind of

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.790 
let's imagine a big year it kind of
comes<00:06:34.080> around

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.520 

we'll<00:06:40.800> color<00:06:41.040> those<00:06:41.280> in<00:06:41.490> black<00:06:41.730> and<00:06:42.090> I<00:06:42.930> think

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
we'll color those in black and I think

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.480 
we'll color those in black and I think
that's<00:06:43.680> pretty<00:06:43.890> much<00:06:44.010> it

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
that's pretty much it

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.580 
that's pretty much it
there<00:06:44.760> we<00:06:44.880> go<00:06:45.210> there's<00:06:45.420> Minnie<00:06:45.870> Mouse<00:06:46.080> thanks
