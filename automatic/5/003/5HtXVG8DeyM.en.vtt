00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.580
 supported by family banners 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.690
 Inmates of the Villahermosa prison 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.910
 they protested in front of the facilities 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.890
 of the penitentiary center to demand a 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.990
 dignified treatment of prisoners of place 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.090
 Villahermosa prison has a 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.680
 capacity for 1,350 inmates and in 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.800
 this moment has almost six thousand 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.050
 two that translates into health problems 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.670
 infectious diseases that 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.279
 really the inpec the national institute 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.840
 penitentiary and prison does not account 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.030
 of that according to rights advocates 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.530
 human beings there are no conditions for 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.510
 care and rehabilitation of 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.820
 inmates and neither a good deal towards 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.920
 relatives during visits have 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.079
 made mistakes and for that there is a 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.600
 justice system but they are not 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.730
 sentenced to death as is now the case 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.280
 Case of Jenny Leather or Luis Alejandro 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.320
 that die on the street after the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.840
 inpec has been negligent with the service 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.700
 of health was we say have committed 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.640
 mistakes but they are still human beings 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.200
 they have the right to health to work 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.969
 resocialize but in reality the 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.360
 penitentiary system in colombia 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.250
 collapse and the failure does not re - socializes 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.959
 relatives denounced with this sit-down 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.900
 serious situations that occur within 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:13.490
 the jail 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.620
 and one of the main ones 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.500
 southwestern Colombia sleep in the 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.380
 floor piled up because a hallway okay 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.259
 expensive a very expensive cell 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 we do not have money to pay for service 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.200
 now to bring here the intern that we 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.299
 they charge a world of silver we find 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.310
 with a worrying situation both for 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.100
 them and for us family 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.890
 since the capacity of the establishment 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.990
 it is not conditioned for so many people 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.299
 because apart from that they do not have a doctor 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.860
 they have medication they are not treated 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.569
 only that they just say is that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.759
 caprecom is in dorbey bankruptcy 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.470
 collazos one of those who one day lived 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.390
 this intramural drama in villahermosa 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.369
 with all its relative wrote the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.399
 situation that is lived in the place in 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.039
 As for food there are problems 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.390
 with food because in many 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.240
 Sometimes we live 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 worms we saw cockroaches inside the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.980
 food or I am a witness of that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.040
 that sleeps on top of each other that in 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.080
 the corridors in a little piece of metro and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.150
 half sleep four people there are about 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.950
 courtyards that for the mere entry nothing more 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.870
 It's worth a million and a half pesos 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.520
 municipal personality and its presence in 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.230
 the protest to take the complaint of 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.090
 family delegates of the ministry 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.709
 public had already visited the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.930
 prison facilities for 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.120
 verify the relationship situation 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.430
 is one of the biggest factors that 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.170
 I had here gathered because they say how 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.270
 they were saying it's a graveyard of 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.070
 living men municipal personality 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.410
 is here to guarantee the rights 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.510
 both the inmates and the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.070
 users in sit-down occurs in the middle of 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.050
 a strong controversy for the conditions 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.380
 that occur in several prisons of the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.380
 country
