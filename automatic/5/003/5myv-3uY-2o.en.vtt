charging users extra to use FaceTime and

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.889 
charging users extra to use FaceTime and
then<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:55.789> know<00:00:55.910> they<00:00:56.090> can<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.420> can<00:00:56.570> come<00:00:56.750> right

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
then you know they can it can come right

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.450 
then you know they can it can come right
out<00:00:56.930> of<00:00:57.079> there<00:00:57.260> are<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.350> lot<00:00:57.500> of<00:00:57.530> data<00:00:57.829> which<00:00:58.219> if

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
out of there are a lot of data which if

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.520 
out of there are a lot of data which if
you<00:00:58.609> don't<00:00:58.820> know<00:00:59.120> could<00:01:00.079> be<00:01:00.260> unlimited

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
you don't know could be unlimited

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.049 
you don't know could be unlimited
because<00:01:00.920> sprint<00:01:01.280> is<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.489> only<00:01:01.579> carrier<00:01:01.879> in

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
because sprint is the only carrier in

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.700 
because sprint is the only carrier in
the<00:01:02.120> US<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:02.449> offers<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.079> iphone<00:01:03.440> with<00:01:03.590> an

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
the US that offers the iphone with an

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.710 
the US that offers the iphone with an
unlimited<00:01:03.980> plan<00:01:04.399> so<00:01:04.940> that's<00:01:05.119> good<00:01:05.330> news<00:01:05.360> but

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
unlimited plan so that's good news but

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.499 
unlimited plan so that's good news but
honestly<00:01:06.640> facetime<00:01:07.640> over<00:01:07.729> 3g<00:01:07.880> is<00:01:08.210> probably

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
honestly facetime over 3g is probably

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:09.850 
honestly facetime over 3g is probably
going<00:01:08.660> to<00:01:08.720> be<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.840> pretty<00:01:08.959> spotty<00:01:09.349> anyway

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
going to be a pretty spotty anyway

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.219 
going to be a pretty spotty anyway
whatever<00:01:10.220> carrier<00:01:10.670> you're<00:01:11.000> on<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:11.509> bound<00:01:12.020> to

whatever carrier you're on it's bound to

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.889 
whatever carrier you're on it's bound to
not<00:01:12.500> be<00:01:12.709> as<00:01:12.860> fast<00:01:13.190> or<00:01:13.580> as<00:01:13.670> smooth<00:01:14.300> as<00:01:14.539> it<00:01:14.569> is<00:01:14.810> on

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899

not be as fast or as smooth as it is on
Wi-Fi<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:15.770> especially<00:01:16.520> if<00:01:16.819> Sprint<00:01:17.179> is<00:01:17.390> you

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
Wi-Fi and especially if Sprint is you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.199 
Wi-Fi and especially if Sprint is you
know<00:01:17.869> just<00:01:18.170> kind<00:01:19.009> of<00:01:19.099> allowing<00:01:19.550> users<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.910> do

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209 
know just kind of allowing users to do

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:21.880 
know just kind of allowing users to do
it<00:01:20.330> without<00:01:20.479> charging<00:01:21.110> extra<00:01:21.410> even<00:01:21.709> though

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
it without charging extra even though

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.410 
it without charging extra even though
that's<00:01:22.099> nice<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.340> them<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:22.789> could<00:01:23.030> lead<00:01:23.390> to

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
that's nice of them it could lead to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.889 
that's nice of them it could lead to
even<00:01:23.959> worse<00:01:24.670> status<00:01:25.670> speeds<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.270> FaceTime

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
even worse status speeds and FaceTime

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.570 
even worse status speeds and FaceTime
experiences<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:27.679> all<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:27.890> stuff<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:28.369> it's

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
experiences and all that stuff so it's
