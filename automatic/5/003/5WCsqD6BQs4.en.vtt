notepad<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.660> it<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.260> half<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.800> weight

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
notepad and it is about half the weight

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.820 
notepad and it is about half the weight
of<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.460> typical<00:01:32.700> ipad<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> we're<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.620> giving

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
of a typical ipad so we're just giving

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.350 
of a typical ipad so we're just giving
you<00:01:35.010> as<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> closer<00:01:35.400> look<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.850> definitely<00:01:36.060> have

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you as a closer look I definitely have

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300 
you as a closer look I definitely have
to<00:01:36.480> say<00:01:36.630> i<00:01:36.660> love<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.200> 8<00:01:37.350> inch<00:01:37.530> size<00:01:37.830> in<00:01:38.100> my

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to say i love the 8 inch size in my

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.860 
to say i love the 8 inch size in my
opinion<00:01:38.580> it's<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> size<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.450> i<00:01:39.510> would<00:01:39.750> like

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
opinion it's the size that i would like

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.180 
opinion it's the size that i would like
a<00:01:39.900> tablet<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.440> why<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.620> never<00:01:40.830> went<00:01:41.040> ahead

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
a tablet that's why I never went ahead

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.610 
a tablet that's why I never went ahead
and<00:01:41.520> bought<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:41.790> bigger<00:01:42.120> iPad<00:01:42.660> just<00:01:43.290> give<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
and bought a bigger iPad just give you

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.110 
and bought a bigger iPad just give you
guys<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> closer<00:01:44.070> look<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> sides<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
guys a closer look at the sides it

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.190 
guys a closer look at the sides it
definitely<00:01:45.480> feels<00:01:45.600> great<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> hand

a benchmark called geekbench just gives

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.810 
a benchmark called geekbench just gives

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
internals of the device perform so let's

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.150 
internals of the device perform so let's
just<00:02:20.400> see<00:02:20.550> what<00:02:20.700> score<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.180> receive<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
just see what score we receive so the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.000 
just see what score we receive so the
ipad<00:02:23.430> mini<00:02:23.460> came<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.030> with<00:02:24.210> 748<00:02:25.020> which<00:02:25.530> for

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
ipad mini came in with 748 which for

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.710 
ipad mini came in with 748 which for
reference<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.640> about<00:02:26.850> half<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.360> what<00:02:27.600> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
reference is about half of what the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.420 
reference is about half of what the
google<00:02:28.110> nexus<00:02:28.230> 7<00:02:28.680> got<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.220> real<00:02:29.400> life

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
google nexus 7 got but in real life

testing<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.150> ipad<00:02:30.570> mini<00:02:30.600> was<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> little<00:02:31.320> bit

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
testing the ipad mini was a little bit

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.110 
testing the ipad mini was a little bit
faster<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.370> you're<00:02:32.550> much<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:32.820> tells<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
faster so if you're much just tells you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.940 
faster so if you're much just tells you
that<00:02:33.240> this<00:02:33.450> score<00:02:33.750> may<00:02:33.930> not<00:02:34.080> mean<00:02:34.410> everything

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
that this score may not mean everything

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.710 
that this score may not mean everything
but<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.400> give<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.610> guys<00:02:35.730> an<00:02:35.910> idea<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
but just give you guys an idea of the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.800 
but just give you guys an idea of the
specs<00:02:37.080> on<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> ipad<00:02:37.740> mini<00:02:38.390> moving<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.540> i'm

gonna<00:02:39.960> go<00:02:40.110> ahead<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.320> test<00:02:40.620> out<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> website

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
gonna go ahead and test out a website

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.430 
gonna go ahead and test out a website
here<00:02:41.400> let's<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:41.790> type<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.120> apple<00:02:42.450> com<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.200> if

here let's just type in apple com and if
you<00:02:43.530> want<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.770> see<00:02:43.890> how<00:02:44.040> fast<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.460> was<00:02:44.610> compared

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
you want to see how fast it was compared

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.550 
you want to see how fast it was compared
to<00:02:45.060> other<00:02:45.270> devices<00:02:45.480> go<00:02:45.900> ahead<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.290> check<00:02:46.410> out

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
to other devices go ahead and check out

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.770 
to other devices go ahead and check out
my<00:02:46.590> comparisons<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:48.510> let<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.660> guys

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
my comparisons but just let you guys

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.120 
my comparisons but just let you guys
take<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:48.990> look<00:02:49.140> here<00:02:49.350> it's<00:02:49.530> definitely<00:02:49.920> very

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
take a look here it's definitely very

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.130 
take a look here it's definitely very
very<00:02:50.430> fast<00:02:50.640> an<00:02:50.910> improvement<00:02:51.330> from<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> a4

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
very fast an improvement from the a4

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.110 
very fast an improvement from the a4
processor<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:53.220> overall<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.910> very

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
processor so overall you have a very

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090 
processor so overall you have a very
nice<00:02:54.360> web<00:02:54.630> browsing<00:02:54.870> experience<00:02:55.140> when<00:02:56.070> I

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
nice web browsing experience when I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.860 
nice web browsing experience when I
compared<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.580> with<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> a6<00:02:57.240> processor<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
compared it with the a6 processor on the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.200 
compared it with the a6 processor on the
iphone<00:02:58.350> 5<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.890> iphone<00:02:59.190> 5<00:02:59.400> was<00:02:59.700> faster

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
iphone 5 the iphone 5 was faster

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.660 
iphone 5 the iphone 5 was faster
obviously<00:03:00.840> because<00:03:01.110> as<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.320> six<00:03:01.800> processor<00:03:02.340> but

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
obviously because as a six processor but

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.760 
obviously because as a six processor but
the<00:03:03.270> overall<00:03:03.480> difference<00:03:03.870> isn't<00:03:04.050> too<00:03:04.350> big<00:03:04.560> and

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
the overall difference isn't too big and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.050 
the overall difference isn't too big and
you<00:03:04.890> could<00:03:05.040> see<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.640> web<00:03:05.820> browsing

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
you could see that the web browsing

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.820 
you could see that the web browsing
everything<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.720> still<00:03:06.900> very<00:03:07.110> smooth<00:03:07.560> very

snappy and the experience on the 8 inch

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.050 
snappy and the experience on the 8 inch
display<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:11.010> definitely<00:03:11.490> great<00:03:11.790> much<00:03:12.030> better

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
so we're going to boot up the verge here

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.910

websites i decide to use for testing and

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.830 
websites i decide to use for testing and
the<00:03:22.800> verge<00:03:23.760> does<00:03:24.030> take<00:03:24.210> a<00:03:24.240> little<00:03:24.480> bit<00:03:24.600> longer

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
the verge does take a little bit longer

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.630 
the verge does take a little bit longer
there's<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.320> lot<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.470> photos<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.370> everything

everything did perform better on the

everything did perform better on the
iPad<00:05:38.110> Mini<00:05:38.380> despite<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.130> fact<00:05:39.310> that<00:05:39.460> only

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
iPad Mini despite the fact that only

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.730 
iPad Mini despite the fact that only
scored<00:05:40.120> half<00:05:40.360> of<00:05:40.540> what<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.780> nexus<00:05:41.110> 7<00:05:41.380> did<00:05:41.530> in

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
scored half of what the nexus 7 did in

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.150 
scored half of what the nexus 7 did in
geekbench<00:05:42.450> so<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:44.590> really<00:05:44.650> doesn't<00:05:45.010> matter

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
geekbench so it really doesn't matter

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.490 
geekbench so it really doesn't matter
what<00:05:45.790> specs<00:05:46.210> these<00:05:46.450> two<00:05:46.660> devices<00:05:46.840> came<00:05:47.200> out<00:05:47.350> in

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
what specs these two devices came out in

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.500 
what specs these two devices came out in
but<00:05:47.890> i<00:05:47.919> think<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:48.250> iPad<00:05:48.669> Mini<00:05:48.910> is<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.150> better

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
but i think the iPad Mini is a better

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.330 
but i think the iPad Mini is a better
tablet<00:05:49.780> not<00:05:50.140> trying<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:50.470> be<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.590> fanboy<00:05:51.010> here

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
tablet not trying to be a fanboy here

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.100 
tablet not trying to be a fanboy here
but<00:05:51.729> in<00:05:51.850> all<00:05:52.030> honesty<00:05:52.570> pretty<00:05:52.810> much<00:05:52.960> the

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
but in all honesty pretty much the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.780 
but in all honesty pretty much the
biggest<00:05:53.260> reason<00:05:53.740> why<00:05:53.830> I<00:05:53.860> went<00:05:54.040> for<00:05:54.160> an<00:05:54.250> iPad<00:05:54.640> is

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
biggest reason why I went for an iPad is

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.940 
biggest reason why I went for an iPad is
due<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.120> fact<00:05:55.180> that<00:05:55.510> it<00:05:55.690> has

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
due to the fact that it has

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.840 
due to the fact that it has
tablet-optimized<00:05:56.950> apps<00:05:57.190> which<00:05:57.490> is<00:05:57.640> something

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
tablet-optimized apps which is something

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.180 
tablet-optimized apps which is something
that<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.240> google<00:05:58.510> nexus<00:05:58.660> 7<00:05:59.080> doesn't<00:05:59.470> have<00:05:59.680> it

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
that the google nexus 7 doesn't have it

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.800 
that the google nexus 7 doesn't have it
pretty<00:06:00.550> much<00:06:00.669> just<00:06:00.790> run<00:06:01.030> some<00:06:01.210> skilled<00:06:01.600> up

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
pretty much just run some skilled up

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.180 
pretty much just run some skilled up
mobile<00:06:02.169> apps<00:06:02.320> like<00:06:02.530> you<00:06:02.710> have<00:06:02.890> on<00:06:03.100> your

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
mobile apps like you have on your

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.590 
mobile apps like you have on your
android<00:06:03.580> phone<00:06:03.610> just<00:06:03.940> put<00:06:04.150> up<00:06:04.270> to<00:06:04.390> about<00:06:04.540> a

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
android phone just put up to about a

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.719 
android phone just put up to about a
seven<00:06:04.960> inch<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.470> some<00:06:06.010> of<00:06:06.100> you<00:06:06.190> may<00:06:06.310> like<00:06:06.520> that

seven inch and some of you may like that

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.540 
seven inch and some of you may like that
but<00:06:07.090> in<00:06:07.390> terms<00:06:07.720> of<00:06:07.900> my<00:06:08.320> opinion<00:06:08.770> the<00:06:08.919> iPad<00:06:09.310> Mini

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
but in terms of my opinion the iPad Mini

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.219 
but in terms of my opinion the iPad Mini
has<00:06:09.610> great<00:06:10.090> apps<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.720> overall

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
has great apps the overall

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.020 
has great apps the overall
tablet-optimized<00:06:12.010> app<00:06:12.250> look<00:06:12.550> much<00:06:12.820> more

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
tablet-optimized app look much more

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.909 
tablet-optimized app look much more
developed<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.600> the<00:06:13.990> user<00:06:14.229> interface<00:06:14.470> is

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
developed and the user interface is

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.640 
developed and the user interface is
great<00:06:15.250> on<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.700> iPad<00:06:16.180> Mini<00:06:16.479> the<00:06:17.260> web<00:06:17.410> browsing

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
great on the iPad Mini the web browsing

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.469 
great on the iPad Mini the web browsing
is<00:06:17.890> also<00:06:18.130> really<00:06:18.310> nice<00:06:18.550> and<00:06:18.850> the<00:06:18.910> extra<00:06:19.270> inch

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
is also really nice and the extra inch

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.150 
is also really nice and the extra inch
of<00:06:19.750> real<00:06:19.930> estate<00:06:20.110> in<00:06:20.500> terms<00:06:20.650> of<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.860> screen

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
of real estate in terms of the screen

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.550 
of real estate in terms of the screen
may<00:06:21.370> not<00:06:21.520> seem<00:06:21.820> big<00:06:22.090> to<00:06:22.120> most<00:06:22.450> people<00:06:22.840> but<00:06:23.380> I<00:06:23.440> do

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
may not seem big to most people but I do

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.409 
may not seem big to most people but I do
notice<00:06:23.950> a<00:06:24.160> difference<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.729> I<00:06:24.789> do<00:06:24.849> think<00:06:25.360> that

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
notice a difference and I do think that

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.420 
notice a difference and I do think that
the<00:06:25.690> extra<00:06:26.050> 1<00:06:26.410> inch<00:06:26.620> of<00:06:26.770> screen<00:06:27.070> gives<00:06:27.310> you

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
the extra 1 inch of screen gives you

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.040 
the extra 1 inch of screen gives you
much<00:06:27.640> larger

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
much larger

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.300 
much larger
