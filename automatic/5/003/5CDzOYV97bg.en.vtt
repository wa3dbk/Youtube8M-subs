00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
like people are coming to the world and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.110 
like people are coming to the world and
they're<00:01:41.620> you<00:01:42.370> know<00:01:42.460> gonna<00:01:42.610> have<00:01:42.760> to<00:01:42.850> look<00:01:43.000> this

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
they're you know gonna have to look this

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.730 
they're you know gonna have to look this
way<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.450> have<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.659> just<00:01:43.840> this<00:01:43.990> way<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.350> it's

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
way and have to just this way and it's

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.950 
way and have to just this way and it's
the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.950 
the
intense<00:01:45.320> like<00:01:45.610> caught<00:01:46.610> up<00:01:46.790> social<00:01:47.360> constructs

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
intense like caught up social constructs

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.690 
intense like caught up social constructs
but<00:01:48.229> it's<00:01:48.350> not<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.680> lot<00:01:48.890> it's<00:01:49.070> not<00:01:49.130> genuine<00:01:49.670> and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
but it's not a lot it's not genuine and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.160 
but it's not a lot it's not genuine and
I<00:01:49.790> think<00:01:49.940> one<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.210> most<00:01:50.330> pure<00:01:50.630> like<00:01:50.869> easy

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
I think one of the most pure like easy

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.950 
I think one of the most pure like easy
ways<00:01:52.130> that<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.490> can<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:53.390> can<00:01:53.420> like<00:01:53.690> break

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
ways that you can you can like break

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.480 
ways that you can you can like break
into<00:01:54.229> people's<00:01:54.380> operating<00:01:54.920> systems<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.400> like

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
into people's operating systems and like

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.100 
into people's operating systems and like
mess<00:01:55.820> with<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.090> hardware<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.450> try<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:56.990> like

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
mess with the hardware and try and like

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.890 
mess with the hardware and try and like
get<00:01:57.530> them<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.800> see<00:01:57.979> things<00:01:58.220> more<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:58.900> humanly

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
get them to see things more like humanly

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.420 
get them to see things more like humanly
this<00:02:00.259> is<00:02:00.380> showing<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.710> it's<00:02:00.860> okay<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.220> like

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
this is showing that it's okay to like

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.399 
this is showing that it's okay to like
be<00:02:02.030> pretty<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.479> it's<00:02:02.659> okay<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.930> do<00:02:03.170> have<00:02:03.320> you

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
think as far as like doing what you

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.180 
think as far as like doing what you
think<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.540> cool<00:02:11.810> no<00:02:12.500> matter<00:02:12.620> what<00:02:12.860> anyone<00:02:13.069> says

think is cool no matter what anyone says

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.400 
think is cool no matter what anyone says
and<00:02:13.880> like<00:02:14.390> even<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.900> gets<00:02:15.020> really<00:02:15.260> weird

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
and like even if it gets really weird

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.570 
and like even if it gets really weird
it's<00:02:15.680> really<00:02:15.709> out<00:02:16.100> there<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.370> really

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
it's really out there and really

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.250 
it's really out there and really
different<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.180> if<00:02:17.330> you're<00:02:17.450> into<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.050> be

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
moms don't really know how to give gifts

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.290 
moms don't really know how to give gifts

it just feels like a certain kind of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.360 
it just feels like a certain kind of
energy<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.080> power<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.860> just<00:02:34.040> love<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
fact that Nature has the capacity to

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.009 
fact that Nature has the capacity to
like<00:02:36.380> create<00:02:37.220> such<00:02:37.550> depth<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.120> intricacy<00:02:38.720> I

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019
