these things are trying to destroy the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.580 
these things are trying to destroy the
whole<00:01:21.939> multiverse<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.869> that<00:01:23.110> includes<00:01:23.440> this

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
whole multiverse and that includes this

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.770 
whole multiverse and that includes this
universe<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.369> we<00:01:24.729> need<00:01:24.909> you<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.210> help<00:01:25.330> us<00:01:25.570> fight

them

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.090 
them
and<00:01:28.110> what's<00:01:29.110> in<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.409> for<00:01:29.470> us

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
and what's in it for us

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.100 
and what's in it for us
I<00:01:31.110> figure<00:01:32.110> not<00:01:32.320> dying<00:01:32.649> is<00:01:32.950> pretty<00:01:33.190> good<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.930> um

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
I figure not dying is pretty good but um

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.450 
I figure not dying is pretty good but um
if<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.250> really<00:01:36.549> want<00:01:36.729> another<00:01:37.000> reason<00:01:38.460> these

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
if you really want another reason these

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.190 
if you really want another reason these
things<00:01:39.759> kind<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.210> look<00:01:40.360> like<00:01:40.390> humans

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
things kind of look like humans

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.410 
things kind of look like humans
so<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.470> guess<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.460> could<00:01:42.670> add<00:01:42.970> them<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.390> your

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
so I guess you could add them to your

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.880 
so I guess you could add them to your
kill<00:01:43.869> counts

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.370 

rookie<00:01:51.890> any<00:01:52.130> luck

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.130 

-<00:01:57.350> hey<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.860> still<00:01:59.189> spiked<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
- hey it still spiked right you think it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.999 
- hey it still spiked right you think it
could<00:02:01.259> fly<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.500> ahead<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:03.079> get<00:02:04.079> shot<00:02:04.380> down<00:02:04.649> by

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
could fly on ahead and get shot down by

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.330 
could fly on ahead and get shot down by
one<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.340> your<00:02:05.520> patrols<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:07.590> may<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
one of your patrols we may be on the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.400 
one of your patrols we may be on the
same<00:02:08.550> side<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> rest<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.750> your<00:02:09.959> forces

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
same side but the rest of your forces

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.270 
same side but the rest of your forces
still<00:02:10.890> believe<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.489> am<00:02:11.640> their<00:02:11.880> enemy

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
still believe I am their enemy

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.710 
still believe I am their enemy
maybe<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.519> stallion<00:02:15.000> would<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.300> had<00:02:15.450> enough

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
maybe the stallion would have had enough

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.770 
maybe the stallion would have had enough
power<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.349> back<00:02:16.970> if<00:02:17.970> someone<00:02:18.480> hadn't

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
power to get back if someone hadn't

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.630 
power to get back if someone hadn't
decided<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.349> use<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.739> charge<00:02:20.130> all<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.519> our

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
decided to use it to charge all of our

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.410 
decided to use it to charge all of our
weapons<00:02:20.819> at<00:02:21.180> once<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.670> only<00:02:23.819> vehicle

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
weapons at once this is the only vehicle

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.150 
weapons at once this is the only vehicle
we<00:02:24.599> have<00:02:24.810> left<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.440> other<00:02:25.590> predators

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
we have left and the other predators

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.660 
we have left and the other predators
could<00:02:26.370> still<00:02:26.670> attack<00:02:27.000> at<00:02:27.150> any<00:02:27.239> time<00:02:28.670> robots

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
could still attack at any time robots

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.339 
could still attack at any time robots
from<00:02:29.819> another<00:02:30.060> dimension<00:02:30.269> could<00:02:30.720> also<00:02:31.019> attack

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
from another dimension could also attack

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.960 
from another dimension could also attack
at<00:02:31.500> any<00:02:31.560> time<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.370> something<00:02:32.700> tells<00:02:32.880> me

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
at any time but something tells me

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.640 
at any time but something tells me
that's<00:02:33.150> not<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.599> happen<00:02:33.989> today

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.690
