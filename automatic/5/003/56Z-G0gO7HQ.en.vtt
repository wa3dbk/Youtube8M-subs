00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
case is really really durable I think

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.280 
case is really really durable I think
it's<00:01:54.329> probably<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.810> favorite<00:01:55.170> cases

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it's probably one of my favorite cases

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's probably one of my favorite cases
so<00:01:55.590> far<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:56.460> only<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> look<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
so far not only for the look that it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.830 
so far not only for the look that it
gives<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:59.130> has<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.729> crazy<00:02:00.270> amount<00:02:00.719> of
