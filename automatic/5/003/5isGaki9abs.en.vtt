00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.160 
builds on how likes you lived yeah like
for<00:00:39.899> me<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> base<00:00:40.680> press<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.780> 225

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
for me on the base press right 225

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.880 
for me on the base press right 225
I<00:00:44.210> could<00:00:45.210> probably<00:00:45.360> wrap<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:46.020> anywhere

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I could probably wrap that out anywhere

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.299 
I could probably wrap that out anywhere
from<00:00:47.039> 20<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> 24<00:00:48.149> reps<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:48.989> set<00:00:52.309> that's

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
from 20 to 24 reps the first set that's

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.760 
from 20 to 24 reps the first set that's
considered<00:00:54.030> lightweight<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:55.050> me<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.590> my

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
considered lightweight to me in my

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.170 
considered lightweight to me in my
opinion<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.250> nice<00:00:56.460> controlled<00:00:56.940> fashion

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
opinion that's nice controlled fashion

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.450

yeah 24 reps yeah

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420 
yeah 24 reps yeah
that's<00:00:59.730> lightweight<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.280> do
