this in there nothing else in there so
in<00:00:32.090> this<00:00:32.180> game<00:00:32.530> here's<00:00:33.530> what<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.739> back<00:00:33.920> looks

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
in this game here's what the back looks

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.259 
in this game here's what the back looks
like<00:00:35.350> says<00:00:36.350> particulars<00:00:36.920> back<00:00:37.070> again<00:00:37.430> can<00:00:38.150> you

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
like says particulars back again can you

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.439 
like says particulars back again can you
solve<00:00:38.540> this<00:00:38.720> before<00:00:38.870> you<00:00:39.230> lose<00:00:39.350> your<00:00:39.410> mind<00:00:43.449> so

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
solve this before you lose your mind so

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.369 
solve this before you lose your mind so
yeah<00:00:45.129> so<00:00:46.129> it's<00:00:46.340> basically<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:47.210> platypus<00:00:47.629> cute<00:00:48.110> I

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
yeah so it's basically a platypus cute I

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.170 
yeah so it's basically a platypus cute I
guess<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:53.120> top<00:00:53.360> stern<00:00:53.690> really<00:00:53.960> good<00:00:55.180> there's

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
guess the top stern really good there's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.049 
guess the top stern really good there's
ball<00:00:56.360> bearings<00:00:56.809> in<00:00:56.960> it<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.909> ball

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
ball bearings in it see the ball

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.080 
ball bearings in it see the ball
bearings<00:01:06.100> these<00:01:07.100> terms<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.580> smooth<00:01:07.909> right

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
bearings these terms of smooth right

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.760 
bearings these terms of smooth right
here

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.889 

it's<00:01:13.310> really<00:01:13.579> cool<00:01:13.759> mechanism<00:01:15.100> sorry<00:01:16.100> I

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
it's really cool mechanism sorry I

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.419 
it's really cool mechanism sorry I
already<00:01:17.899> open<00:01:18.200> it<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.439> I<00:01:18.530> solve<00:01:18.859> this<00:01:19.070> quite<00:01:19.399> a

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
already open it and I solve this quite a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.770 
already open it and I solve this quite a
few<00:01:19.490> times<00:01:19.609> a<00:01:21.520> little<00:01:22.520> quite<00:01:22.789> a<00:01:22.820> few<00:01:23.060> I<00:01:23.329> mean<00:01:23.570> I

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
few times a little quite a few I mean I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.319 
few times a little quite a few I mean I
solved<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.170> ones<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:25.009> got<00:01:25.729> scared<00:01:26.000> though<00:01:26.179> cuz

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
solved the ones I got scared though cuz

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.279 
solved the ones I got scared though cuz
I<00:01:26.390> thought<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.539> couldn't<00:01:26.780> do<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:26.929> but<00:01:27.170> it's

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
I thought I couldn't do it but it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.749 
I thought I couldn't do it but it's
pretty<00:01:27.619> easy<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:28.189> might<00:01:28.490> do<00:01:28.609> a<00:01:28.640> time<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.560> after<00:01:30.560> I

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.910 

learn<00:01:34.759> how<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:34.969> actually<00:01:35.509> like<00:01:36.319> have<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.530> method

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
learn how to actually like have a method

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.389 
learn how to actually like have a method
to<00:01:37.009> actually<00:01:37.310> solve<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:37.929> but<00:01:39.640> yeah<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:42.860> clicked

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
to actually solve it but yeah it clicked

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.440 
to actually solve it but yeah it clicked
something<00:01:43.729> as<00:01:44.000> for<00:01:44.329> ball<00:01:44.509> bearings<00:01:45.159> 12<00:01:46.450> you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
something as for ball bearings 12 you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.219 
something as for ball bearings 12 you
know<00:01:47.539> three<00:01:47.869> ball<00:01:48.020> bearings<00:01:48.489> 12<00:01:49.720> yeah<00:01:50.720> 3<00:01:51.049> ball

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
know three ball bearings 12 yeah 3 ball

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.319 
know three ball bearings 12 yeah 3 ball
bearings<00:01:51.530> each<00:01:52.459> that's<00:01:52.789> 36<00:01:54.670> 36<00:01:55.670> there's<00:01:56.000> 12

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
bearings each that's 36 36 there's 12

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.260 
bearings each that's 36 36 there's 12
ball<00:01:56.539> bearings<00:01:57.610> so<00:01:58.610> I'll<00:01:58.759> mix<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.030> up<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.239> little
