00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.719
 for me is going to be going to launch a tutorial on how to recover the files 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.200
 of laziness 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.579
 percent are salt by 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.070
 by concept that files of apathy are the archives of laziness 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.960
 they are the same lazy applications 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.230
 but in a file with weak point extension 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 can be the same stadium be haifa itself and luis cited winterboard themselves 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 and viano 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.900
 the prison files for that important because it is very important to 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.270
 those people who are not 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.030
 they require a connection 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.569
 this to a judge failed 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:38.350
 or the 3g or the time you are allowing an internet network 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.390
 then that makes it easier for you 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.400
 the manual installation without any additional connection no 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.230
 then this can also be useful to store your own files of 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.630
 that 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.620
 i 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.370
 later save them manually not 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 that is done through a scha connection 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.930
 which are programs that allow you to see the goal system of devices with 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.239
 yuri 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 it was with you you can be wines to prevent and ska and then 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.860
 you and verdú see 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.280
 the semen remains of preference 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.970
 because they use normally 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.220
 well let's continue the cool 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 Ramos assured cease in Syria 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.710
 we do not open syria 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.710
 logically we are going to look for the application that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.860
 that we want to recover 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.660
 you will know 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.990
 consulted 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.640
 Very fine 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.740
 was founded 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.500
 Father Elijah 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.510
 wise funk 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.900
 we install 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.930
 and what I'm going to show you next is very important 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040
 an importance 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.430
 very relevant 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.530
 at this point when the installation in Syria is exterminated 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.000
 when is the load 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.530
 this load will serve dyn data 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.979
 highlights the message is going to fuck back to Syria for example this year 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.049
 return to Syria wen some cases a rebound 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.519
 you leave it at this point and based connections sh search a route 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.099
 privatize score 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.239
 percent cache 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.799
 to pepe 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.399
 records 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.099
 at this point is where is the file point of 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.319
 if anyone can appreciate 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.259
 between the file data 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.519
 then this file has to be saved because before going out of laziness 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.089
 many times that file 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:46.029
 is lost after opening they said some applications when they give it when they give 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.009
 devoted to the device 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.139
 just get out of the same silvia 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.009
 the file is lost that's why it's good that recovering it at this point is very 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.619
 important this point 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.079
 then you 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.809
 a copy 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:04.199
 to your desk they save it where they can preferably find it 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.619
 later 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.549
 as you can see the file days has saved 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.679
 in this case siemens andrea laziness 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.780
 Guaria a bounce oudín simple prints 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.169
 the application and that will have lost 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.469
 in this case not but that has still been lost 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.879
 but good is very important because there are many applications that ask for a new 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.139
 try 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.519
 previously that function can be performed on Mays 3 with a comma and 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.479
 facilitated on the same device unnecessarily but now has problems 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.459
 so you have to do it with us on the way 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.349
 despite being the recovery of a weak point file 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.099
 we can not store then install without a three meter room 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:54.039
 in this case the best known there are some that there are programs in which 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.779
 allow to save files from 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.929
 how can it be 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:02.309
 if of robberies or some of these programs but in this case the most popular 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.089
 they wanted 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.409
 the installation as haifa he 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.729
 or the same mobile finished 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.489
 it was the absence of syria 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.569
 the uccl that looks for its suter until installing these files of 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.569
 this is the utility that you have to this kind of 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.189
 of weak point files 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.729
 the one that can be very useful some even some that have 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.199
 thought to share some applications 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:34.819
 I'm going to make a video 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.120
 apart from this 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.469
 about concepts 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.039
 i 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.189
 her new show explained a lot about the applications to run out of it 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.689
 then he is very attentive and in that very attentive to the next biennium 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.490
 since there was already to give some advice and 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.360
 and explain what silver applications are 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.199
 I'm going to give you advice on web pages, your sites do not really need 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.199
 many things for those to do all that 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.860
 indicated they do not even need to have installed a 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.069
 also its use as there are many people repos the photos the sun 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.400
 there will be other 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.560
 i are basically that and also 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.750
 in the next video, greeting them is also their friend they are white of century verón 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.089
 without offering the lancet in the near 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.830
 good friends, you know those 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.580
 that's how chelsea files will eat it 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.599
 I hope you have understood me any doubt 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.270
 comment and be alert to the next life
