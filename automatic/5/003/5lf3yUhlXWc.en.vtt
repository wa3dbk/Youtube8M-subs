00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.590
 I'm going to use mica as a mold 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.070
 Anatomical to explain the system 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.110
 digestive of guinea pigs we also have 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.029
 here a poster that will help us a lot 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.570
 to see if you're a little quiet 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.300
 that we can explain it to everyone 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.800
 we start with the stomach the stomach the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 bag the first bag to which the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.290
 food here you have it is a great 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.600
 dilatation in the cranial part in the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.730
 highest part of the abdomen and if we 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.440
 we take to me here you see that just where 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.650
 is the stomach she has a small 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.570
 white spot of the stomach we went to 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.280
 all the small intestine in the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.610
 Small intestine found 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.150
 mainly in the right area of 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.780
 abdomen 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.259
 you have this little coiled hose 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.300
 where the enzymatic digestion of the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.180
 pancreas the small intestine of the 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.259
 Guinea Pig mainly occupies the area 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.420
 middle and right middle abdomen and 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.369
 passed to the small intestine we have the 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.940
 large intestine that maybe the intestine 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.399
 thick is the main part and the part 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.460
 that makes guinea pigs can digest 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.110
 all the fiber that they eat here we're going to 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.229
 change position to explain yourself in 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.210
 this other picture that we have to the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.100
 guinea pig side 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.820
 this is what we have already 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.220
 talked about the stomach this first part and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.290
 if you notice here we have the ribs 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.020
 and if you see in this part in this first 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.360
 part the ribs do not get to join 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.759
 down to the bottom this allows when 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.070
 do the digestion and stuff food and 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.380
 ferment in the form of gases 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.200
 the entire abdomen can dilate without 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.850
 the ribs pressure him well 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.460
 after the small intestine as I have 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.869
 explained the large intestine the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.140
 Large intestine is composed of blind is 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.660
 this big sack that occupies 70% of the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.570
 abdomen volume 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.580
 where fermentation occurs and the 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.580
 fermentation of the fiber and so 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.640
 guinea pigs can take nutrients from 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.970
 a raw material as poor as is the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.980
 fiber after the blind we have this 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.930
 tube that is colon there is a part 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.520
 ascending and a descending colon 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.860
 where the stool starts to form 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.530
 and where the food is also dehydrated 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.380
 and we went to the last section, which is the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.140
 rectum and where they are going to remove 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.140
 in its last portion for the year
