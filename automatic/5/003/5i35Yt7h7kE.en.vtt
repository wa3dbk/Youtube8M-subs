how<00:01:29.679> he'll<00:01:29.920> doing<00:01:30.250> this<00:01:30.340> wait<00:01:30.780> Jessie<00:01:31.780> Vargas

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
how he'll doing this wait Jessie Vargas

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.300 
how he'll doing this wait Jessie Vargas
doesn't<00:01:32.350> really<00:01:32.469> have<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.649> much<00:01:32.859> power<00:01:32.920> so

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
doesn't really have that much power so

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.279 
doesn't really have that much power so
that<00:01:33.579> shouldn't<00:01:34.149> really<00:01:34.270> concerned<00:01:34.750> should

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
that shouldn't really concerned should

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.599 
that shouldn't really concerned should
concern<00:01:35.679> him<00:01:35.829> that<00:01:35.950> much<00:01:36.130> but<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.770> when<00:01:39.219> when

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
concern him that much but but when when

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.370 
concern him that much but but when when
it<00:01:39.729> comes<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.509> fight<00:01:40.780> I<00:01:40.810> think<00:01:41.140> would<00:01:41.259> be

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
it comes to this fight I think would be

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.230 
it comes to this fight I think would be
a<00:01:41.409> competitive<00:01:41.950> fight<00:01:42.189> I<00:01:42.429> think<00:01:43.119> the

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
a competitive fight I think the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.819 
a competitive fight I think the
toughness<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.749> Antonio<00:01:44.170> DeMarco<00:01:44.469> will

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
toughness of Antonio DeMarco will

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.849

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
Jessie Vargas is definitely the better

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.580 
Jessie Vargas is definitely the better
technically<00:01:49.600> skilled<00:01:49.659> fighter<00:01:50.229> but<00:01:52.590> was
