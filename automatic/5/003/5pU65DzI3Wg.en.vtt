00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.629
 a round trip desired and therefore 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.820
 I thought I was once today tor 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.890
 and yes it looks like that now if you 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.539
 always a room goes in first 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.539

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.939
 where i hold all my school books and 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.340
 Try blocks and have something in there and 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.710
 on top of it is a learning dvd player and 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.660

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.770
 desk would be so normal 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.629

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.910

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.059

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.989
 Although it is actually a normal one 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.670
