00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.770
 speaks that the mpm bringing another video 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.230
 for you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.810
 Good people today with more than being 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.900
 happy to be a volume to be very 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.550
 here but I do not think it should 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.500
 be taller than my voice 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.960
 well I had to switch to new map 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.420
 obviously you realize map of ak 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.649
 manchester died for money but not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.790
 end is when he dies the eye closes 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.850
 on debut 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.309
 Anyway, I already have this whole place here. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.730
 I thought that the eighth island 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.960
 I 'm just here for fuck I'm going to want 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.000
 To leave and now to show you a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.020
 Interesting thing about the spindle buffaloes 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.510
 that I did not mention in another video 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.149
 update and get involved if you have more 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.979
 a passage that next to the island 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.810
 I know there's another island because my God. 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.470
 I have enough here and that's it. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.470
 over there 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.250
 Another thing that I'm going to do then 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.770
 guys too and everything is taking these 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.930
 things I find because it's very useful 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 I think the buffalo not then angry 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.430
 now but is the next when they are 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 angry and you can not get close 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.670
 them turned to you 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.369
 It was starting new basically and then you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.000
 comes close to immediately assuming 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.310
 to attack what is not cool Sunday 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.190
 We have to cross from here. 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.560
 I 'm just going straight here because there 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.890
 then we get there and still for us 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.890
 simply 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.710
 guys just look that interesting what 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.720
 here on the edge of this island does not have 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.480
 water as if we were in the middle 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.820
 I do not know if it's just the hulk . 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.700
 game or if they simply 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.890
 they just have not dealt with it yet 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.510
 but then I suppose it will not have 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.090
 no other way 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.040
 from that island, something else that I 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.770
 I wanted to put it to you if you liked it. 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.390
 from the beginning of the series d manifeste 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.830
 I know many of you that you like 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.920
 more of the order you liked the most 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.200
 that minecraft who like me and not 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.760
 like the other but it's both games 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.880
 that I like the most 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.180
 they are not the ones who have played the most 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.220
 They're still the ones I like the most. 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.590
 survival type games are 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.170
 epic in any way that already 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.270
 we have the beginning of water and not like me 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.640
 said he does not have a change of impropriety 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.960
 no more disappointing island than shame 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.700
 and it's not really 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.060
 So people, I'm going to start doing that now. 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.080
 something here that is not cool but 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.730
 how to do it, I'll just start 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.200
 I 'm going to go home now obviously 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.510
 and come back later that she 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.910
 here on the map where you have several 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.980
 rabbits because I 'm going to do I'll start 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.880
 to kill rabbit if you kill animals until 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.500
 campus and if he shows up I 'll go 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.260
 I'll show you 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.060
 the campus he has only 200 he does not 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.459
 eat lunch than many think 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.260
 he is just an ordinary animal that appears 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.950
 When you kill a lot of animals 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.380
 defenseless many animals never animals 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.470
 many animals many animals is this me 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.670
 I think people talk about the owner of animals. 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.110
 neutrals, for example rabbits and 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.190
 It is what I'll be doing after going 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.190
 keep killing them 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.930
 I will take to teach you here in 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.180
 blog of the infinite torch had another 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.690
 guide but I did not show him I think he 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:21.150
 very very blatant let's say so 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.300
 almost 33 are going to make a 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.710
 cage for peace a cheese bar 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.160
 a path that can be put 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.100
 she here but did not put queiroz 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:38.040
 Even I'm going to trap you. 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.780
 I have the game here and yours. 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.710
 basic lock every time he goes 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.360
 add up got into this I could not do 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.510
 whatever I want to appear obviously 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.210
 because I only managed to kill ten years with 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:05:00.630
 they what I think is very little I 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:05:03.000
 I think I do not even know how beautiful you are. 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.980
 tatoo awards beauty does not even use one 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.870
 armor of the type happened at the beginning 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.980
 You'll already be able to kill them from the game. 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.490
 so good maybe you take one 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.620
 only network maybe not a hit you have to 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.540
 keep loosing space for him to stay 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.520
 beating him without stopping and will not 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.650
 give him a chance to attack 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.080
 he had 50 of political life, which he did not 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:30.240
 It is really cool but obviously neither 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.200
 so great damage so you still 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:39.180
 gets two two meats and meat is 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:43.530
 very good of this type of meat gives you lots of 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.720
 had greatly increased the hunger of cure was 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.740
 almost everything to the maximum and gives you a 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.480
 little life also keep these 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.390
 here I am going to put this here 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:00.600
 It's not like it looks like it's full. 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:02.430
 of an old leak in lacquer I did not 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.530
 I can even know why it's my colleague's 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.190
 So to stay with one less Bible. 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.750
 It will be worse for me 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:13.570
 She does it, I want to get my partner. 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.780
 and ciro I do not know if it's print 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:20.650
 My, but I think in games they will 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.660
 react in the game in the games in the far 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.090
 usually when you are going to capture some 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.580
 partners come with crÃ´ comes and if this 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.420
 black here does not come the red one more 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.790
 cute the left are working 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.910
 this world if they are not repaired in 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.590
 sell opel 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.960
 this is one has a small chance of 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.670
 You can catch birds as soon as 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.340
 they will see live on seed and 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.220
 when they on a seed they a 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.560
 wine seed you attack they you have 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.780
 be very fast but it is a good way 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.890
 easy to get better than you 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.470
 is doing this 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.670
 without killing birds doing 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.640
 that's clear 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.680
 Anyway, I'll try to kill more. 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.010
 more in the damn 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.980
 I'm going to try and get more animals. 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.870
 that have nothing to do with my life 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.320
 to make the campus appear 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:18.700
 if he shows up and maybe I can 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:20.560
 record it without recording my voice because it is 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.990
 much easier because the hours that will go 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.530
 record on the day are delimited album 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.270
 damn they are very limited so it's okay 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.070
 easier if by chance it appeared 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.480
 record my voice and then it's just 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.280
 comment on 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.740
 just to clarify I think I already said 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.450
 That's but he's been told rosman now 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.870
 amateur 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:45.570
 I think I already said that but he has 200 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:50.050
 200 and 201 I remember 200 205 he has 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:54.820
 200 of life and normal Maria has 151 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:56.800
 face with 314 like I did not say 

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.590
 three or four hits on it with that 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.870
 spirit in the hand you already killed him anyway 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.370
 People, I'm going to stay here, I hope. 

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.830
 that you liked the episode 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.200
 very basic I 'm here waiting for you 

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:12.490
 Chester had been born in the 

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.990
 worry if he dies of guaÃ­ba in 10 

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.680
 What else can I do? 

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:20.160
 and this is it because it existed spoke and 

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.160
 went
