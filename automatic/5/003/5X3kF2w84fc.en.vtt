00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
whatever you want to call it and that is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.780 
whatever you want to call it and that is
it<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:08.489> connected<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.360> playing<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:11.250> 920

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
it is now connected and playing the 920

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.250 
it is now connected and playing the 920
through<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:14.150> if<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.239> increase<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.780> volume

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
through there if I increase this volume

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.710 
through there if I increase this volume
on<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> phone<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.010> does<00:03:17.190> increase<00:03:17.519> there

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
on the phone it does increase there

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.260 
on the phone it does increase there
of<00:03:20.620> course<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:20.980> can<00:03:21.100> also<00:03:21.220> increase<00:03:21.580> it<00:03:21.820> here

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
of course you can also increase it here

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:45.590 
of course you can also increase it here
which<00:03:22.770> obviously<00:03:23.770> goes<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.040> lot<00:03:24.280> louder

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.940 

so<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.960> may<00:03:47.050> be<00:03:47.080> hard<00:03:47.320> for<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.530> guys<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.770> judge

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
so it may be hard for you guys to judge

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.560 
so it may be hard for you guys to judge
the<00:03:48.100> audio<00:03:48.370> quality<00:03:48.520> obviously<00:03:49.090> over<00:03:49.180> video

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
the audio quality obviously over video

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.890 
the audio quality obviously over video
even<00:03:50.020> though<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.320> is<00:03:50.470> recording<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:50.950> 5.1<00:03:51.130> but

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
even though this is recording in 5.1 but

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.080 
even though this is recording in 5.1 but
it<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.170> really<00:03:53.410> nice<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.950> extremely<00:03:54.670> rich

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
it is really nice it's extremely rich

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.310 
it is really nice it's extremely rich
sounding<00:03:55.720> it's<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:55.960> only<00:03:56.110> way<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:56.200> can

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
sounding it's the only way I can

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.040 
sounding it's the only way I can
describe<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.610> just<00:03:57.820> sounds<00:03:58.030> fantastic

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
describe it it just sounds fantastic

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.300 
describe it it just sounds fantastic
of<00:03:59.230> course<00:03:59.530> which<00:03:59.800> some<00:04:00.070> of<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.250> guys

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
of course which some of you guys

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.560 
of course which some of you guys
probably<00:04:00.460> wondering<00:04:00.910> is<00:04:01.000> what<00:04:01.180> else<00:04:01.300> can<00:04:01.540> you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
probably wondering is what else can you

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.440 
probably wondering is what else can you
stream<00:04:01.960> here<00:04:02.200> do<00:04:02.830> phone<00:04:03.040> calls<00:04:03.070> work<00:04:03.670> no<00:04:04.270> not

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
stream here do phone calls work no not

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.770 
stream here do phone calls work no not
really

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
really

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.660 
really
it<00:04:05.170> does<00:04:05.350> make<00:04:05.530> system<00:04:06.010> sounds<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.550> go

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
it does make system sounds that go

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.280 
it does make system sounds that go
through<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.030> speaker<00:04:07.360> but<00:04:07.840> when<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.020> actual

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
through the speaker but when the actual

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.660 
through the speaker but when the actual
call<00:04:08.440> connects<00:04:08.830> it<00:04:08.920> switches<00:04:09.250> back<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.430> the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
call connects it switches back to the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.110 
call connects it switches back to the
speaker<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.210> can't<00:04:10.480> do<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.960> however

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
speaker so you can't do that however

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.850 
speaker so you can't do that however
everything<00:04:13.120> else<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.690> fair<00:04:14.320> game

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
everything else is fair game

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.490 
everything else is fair game
if<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.220> want<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.640> really<00:04:16.299> annoy<00:04:16.780> yourself<00:04:17.320> or

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
if you want to really annoy yourself or

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.320 
if you want to really annoy yourself or
your<00:04:17.620> neighbors<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.220> can<00:04:18.280> play<00:04:18.549> Angry<00:04:18.850> Birds

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.460 

I'm<00:04:25.330> gonna<00:04:25.480> turn<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.840> down<00:04:25.990> because<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:26.260> is

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
I'm gonna turn it down because that is

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.980 
I'm gonna turn it down because that is
probably<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.010> most<00:04:27.130> annoying<00:04:27.370> music<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.660> hear

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
probably the most annoying music to hear

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.280 
probably the most annoying music to hear
