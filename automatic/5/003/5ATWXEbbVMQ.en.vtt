00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.759
 then in throwing all the mods to the lava 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.220
 Kripper 20 skeletons the combi 2050 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.320
 current to get 500 points and 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.980
 make sure they die only you have 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.880
 ten shots 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.060
 oh my god that here 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.380
 equal number 2 is to kill your 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.549
 against 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.399
 it's two players is sand pvp 20 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:01.579
 minigame 3 has lump x of two to 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.039
 four players ok and minigame career 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.520
 of two player boats or well this 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.610
 server this map you can use it as a 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.640
 time to be with friends if it were like that 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.140
 very simple and dynamic also 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.550
 like to play alone but I think that 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.100
 only the number one minigame you 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.330
 It allows 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.330
 it says here I think it 's the boat 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.670
 is a boat race that 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.160
 is very good on this map I'm just going to 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.340
 pass to a subscriber because it is very 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.340
 all right 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.950
 hollis it 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.740
 then it is also very good 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.570
 As you know, the mini-game map is 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.480
 very simple to understand what you are going to give 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.670
 a checadita and it is very simple and therefore 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.480
 nothing like what I told you can put it 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.880
 with a master partner like a friend who 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.750
 they put it in some server and they can already 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.950
 play among several well we are 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.870
 unfortunately as I tell you if it occupies 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.110
 Two players play in the same network 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.840
 wifi or with a server and put it as a map 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.630
 to troll a little play like this happen to him 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.400
 a good time and then nothing guys down 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.770
 I leave you link to the map the video of how 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.150
 install it you know that this step 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.770
 simply to dilute them well happened the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.120
 link since I do not play them because 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.850
 when who am I going to play with my name 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.860
 imaginary then not so it's nothing a 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.980
 He is happy because he liked the 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.660
 video more than everything and do not forget that a 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.850
 follow me in arroba saints creaf in me 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.739
 twitter since I'm going to post some 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.709
 little things if you want 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.900
 the build number 2 is already going to come out so that 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.730
 we approve this close to going out 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.910
 so nothing uses the guys and even 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.910
 then
