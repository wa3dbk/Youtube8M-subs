00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
satellite a couple times when I did it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.580 
satellite a couple times when I did it
uneasy<00:02:09.160> but<00:02:10.060> when<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.569> went<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.869> through<00:02:11.050> hard<00:02:11.319> I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
uneasy but when I went it through hard I

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.880 
uneasy but when I went it through hard I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200

been nice

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.920 
been nice
similar<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.640> vehicle<00:03:13.910> damage<00:03:14.480> indicator

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
but just know that it can only withstand

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.190 
but just know that it can only withstand
some<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.430> RPG<00:03:19.880> hits<00:03:21.370> before<00:03:22.690> it's<00:03:23.690> useless

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
some of the RPG hits before it's useless

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
really efficient shooting down this

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.160 
really efficient shooting down this
chopper<00:03:37.940> here<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.450> couple<00:03:38.840> times<00:03:38.990> we've<00:03:39.140> been

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170

up again and you're going to need to do
this<00:06:29.110> at<00:06:29.320> every<00:06:29.440> pretty<00:06:29.830> much<00:06:30.010> every<00:06:30.280> building

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
this at every pretty much every building

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.300 
this at every pretty much every building
you<00:06:31.150> go<00:06:31.360> through<00:06:31.600> you<00:06:31.810> go<00:06:31.930> past<00:06:32.200> like<00:06:32.830> if<00:06:32.950> I<00:06:33.070> ran

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
you go through you go past like if I ran

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.300 
you go through you go past like if I ran
right<00:06:33.340> past<00:06:33.580> this<00:06:33.970> building<00:06:34.420> to<00:06:34.570> the<00:06:34.660> next<00:06:34.930> one

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
right past this building to the next one

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.560 
right past this building to the next one
yeah<00:06:36.310> I<00:06:36.550> wouldn't<00:06:36.910> make<00:06:37.090> it<00:06:37.120> because<00:06:37.450> I'd

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
yeah I wouldn't make it because I'd

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.600 
yeah I wouldn't make it because I'd
probably<00:06:37.780> freeze<00:06:38.110> to<00:06:38.320> death<00:06:38.350> I<00:06:38.740> never

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
probably freeze to death I never

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.000 
probably freeze to death I never
actually<00:06:39.850> tested<00:06:40.810> that<00:06:40.930> theory<00:06:41.230> but<00:06:41.920> I'm

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
actually tested that theory but I'm

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.070 
actually tested that theory but I'm
pretty<00:06:42.250> sure<00:06:42.340> that<00:06:42.730> would<00:06:42.850> be<00:06:43.000> the<00:06:43.120> case<00:06:46.080> good

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
pretty sure that would be the case good

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.340 
pretty sure that would be the case good
thing<00:06:47.290> all<00:06:47.470> these<00:06:47.730> desolate<00:06:49.350> isolated

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
thing all these desolate isolated

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.650 
thing all these desolate isolated
buildings<00:06:50.710> have<00:06:50.980> fireplaces<00:06:51.610> in<00:06:52.000> them<00:06:52.120> so

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
buildings have fireplaces in them so

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.780 
buildings have fireplaces in them so
that's<00:06:52.780> it<00:06:53.050> for<00:06:53.290> part<00:06:53.350> 1<00:06:53.950> we'll<00:06:54.220> continue<00:06:54.430> with

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
that's it for part 1 we'll continue with

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.170 
that's it for part 1 we'll continue with
