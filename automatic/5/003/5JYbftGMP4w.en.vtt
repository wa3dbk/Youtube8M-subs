effectively<00:00:05.730> what<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:05.940> call<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.569> good<00:00:06.750> stuff

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
effectively what I call the good stuff

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.110 
effectively what I call the good stuff
it's<00:00:07.890> great<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.309> do<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> console<00:00:08.970> application

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
it's great to do a console application

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360 
it's great to do a console application
but<00:00:09.690> sometimes<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.440> need<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> little<00:00:10.920> bit<00:00:11.130> more

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
but sometimes you need a little bit more

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.330 
but sometimes you need a little bit more
like<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> Windows<00:00:12.660> application<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> that's

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
like a Windows application so that's

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.950 
like a Windows application so that's
what<00:00:14.490> we're<00:00:14.610> going<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.790> dive<00:00:14.969> into<00:00:15.210> today<00:00:15.630> and

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
what we're going to dive into today and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.290 
what we're going to dive into today and
we're<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.440> spend<00:00:16.859> quite<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.150> time

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
we're going to spend quite a bit of time

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.970 
we're going to spend quite a bit of time
on<00:00:18.330> Windows<00:00:18.750> apps<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.410> then<00:00:19.740> we're

rule of thumb don't modify this and then
there's<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.750> R<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.200> X<00:01:28.500> now<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
there's this R as X now what is that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.280 
there's this R as X now what is that
well<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.119> resource<00:01:30.570> file<00:01:30.900> something

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
well this is a resource file something

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.340 
well this is a resource file something
you<00:01:31.500> may<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.650> covered<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.159> other<00:01:32.369> languages

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
you may have covered in other languages

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.569 
you may have covered in other languages
basically<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> resource<00:01:34.740> file<00:01:34.920> allows<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
basically a resource file allows you to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.890 
basically a resource file allows you to
put<00:01:36.590> resources<00:01:37.880> images<00:01:38.880> strings<00:01:39.420> things<00:01:39.810> of

put resources images strings things of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.109 
put resources images strings things of
that<00:01:39.990> nature<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.650> file<00:01:42.140> let's<00:01:43.140> close<00:01:43.350> that

that nature in a file let's close that

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.660 
that nature in a file let's close that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and let's go tools over here and let's

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
well you have these positional x' so you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.160 
well you have these positional x' so you
can<00:02:23.540> say<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:23.989> want<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:25.360> let's<00:02:26.360> see<00:02:26.599> here

do something I realize this is a very
simple<00:02:55.459> tutorial<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:56.180> GUI<00:02:56.900> programming<00:02:57.319> may

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
simple tutorial but GUI programming may

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.410 
simple tutorial but GUI programming may
be<00:02:57.620> new<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.040> some<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.370> out<00:02:58.400> there<00:02:58.519> if<00:02:59.180> it's

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
not bear with me we're going to ramp up

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.099 
not bear with me we're going to ramp up
these<00:03:01.040> tutorials<00:03:01.489> fairly<00:03:01.879> quickly

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
tell it's selected because you've got

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.500 
tell it's selected because you've got
these<00:03:06.799> little<00:03:06.950> handles<00:03:07.400> around<00:03:07.579> it<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.329> just

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.900 
double-click it you notice how it dumps
you<00:03:10.849> directly<00:03:11.329> into<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.599> code<00:03:11.780> view<00:03:12.019> let's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
you directly into the code view let's

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.150 
you directly into the code view let's
expand<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:13.940> so<00:03:14.840> we're<00:03:14.989> in<00:03:15.109> button<00:03:15.530> one<00:03:15.769> click

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
expand that so we're in button one click

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.479 
expand that so we're in button one click
this<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.700> an<00:03:16.819> event<00:03:17.620> windows<00:03:18.620> form

this is an event windows form
programming<00:03:20.000> is<00:03:20.120> event-driven<00:03:20.799> meaning<00:03:21.799> this

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
programming is event-driven meaning this

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.009 
programming is event-driven meaning this
is<00:03:22.340> called<00:03:22.849> when<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.389> button<00:03:23.419> is<00:03:23.720> click

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
is called when the button is click

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.740 
is called when the button is click
that's<00:03:24.799> an<00:03:25.010> event<00:03:25.280> handler<00:03:25.660> notice<00:03:26.660> how

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
that's an event handler notice how

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.449 
that's an event handler notice how
there's<00:03:26.930> an<00:03:27.049> object<00:03:27.500> sender<00:03:28.040> everything

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
there's an object sender everything

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.789 
there's an object sender everything
a.net<00:03:28.669> says<00:03:28.970> object<00:03:29.510> so<00:03:30.260> we're<00:03:30.410> just<00:03:30.680> saying

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
a.net says object so we're just saying

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.339 
a.net says object so we're just saying

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.400 
actually do that quite a bit my own
programming<00:03:46.540> but<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:48.049> said<00:03:48.109> this<00:03:48.290> is<00:03:48.380> a

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
programming but like I said this is a

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.599 
programming but like I said this is a
beginners<00:03:48.739> tutorial<00:03:48.889> so<00:03:49.310> we're<00:03:49.400> going<00:03:49.519> to

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
beginners tutorial so we're going to

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.860 
beginners tutorial so we're going to
keep<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.849> very<00:03:49.880> simple<00:03:50.299> all<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.630> need<00:03:50.690> to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
keep it very simple all you need to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.930 
keep it very simple all you need to
understand<00:03:51.260> at<00:03:51.349> this<00:03:51.470> point<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.950> when<00:03:52.849> the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940

user clicks that button this event is

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.839 
user clicks that button this event is
called<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:57.410> we<00:03:57.500> can<00:03:57.650> even<00:03:57.769> say<00:03:59.319> this<00:04:00.319> is<00:04:00.849> call

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849
