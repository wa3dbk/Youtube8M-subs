00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.700
 How was everyone? 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.700
 This time it became a really long play video that spans all 20 parts. 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.700
 Finally, I was able to get to the end safely. 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.700
 I think this is all because of the kind and warm encouragement from everyone's comments. 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.700
 I'm really thankful to you! 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.700
 # 4 Just nine months after the start of "Actreizer" ... 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.700
 I had troubles in various ways, such as the difficulty of recording and commentary and the existence meaning of the play video, and I was almost lost. 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.500
 However, at such time, I always helped with your support ... 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.500
 Here you will find important information. 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:51.500
 It is next time's play video # 5 of [ぇ], but unfortunately, there are no plans to post it now. 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.500
 Maybe it will be saying goodbye with you ... 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.500
 I am really indebted to everyone! 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.500
 Also, I would like to thank everyone involved in this game. 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.500
 I'm really thankful to you! 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.400
 Then someday ... 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.400
 Until the day you can see ... 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.700
