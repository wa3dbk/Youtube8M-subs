 we list 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:15.509
 however it is important to remember that internists are very 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.429

 edit history of internal medicine 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.310
 At the end of the 19th century, testicular medicine began to develop 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.439
 attached to university clinics 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.430
 and a new orientation emerged in general medicine 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.209
 more linked to basic biomedical sciences and experimentation 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.719
 the name of internal medicine was received 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.769
 the internist has been considered 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:39.859
 since then 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.239
 the clinician par excellence the example of the doctor in any era 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.289
 historical 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:48.579
 Within this field, surgical diseases were excluded. 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.529
 obstetricians and lost them 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.939
 What also constituted other specialties 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.769
 These, together with internal medicine, have been considered since that time as 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.759
 basic specialties 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:04.819
 the name of internal medicine seems to have originated in Germany 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.579
 in 1880 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.599
 in that year this prevented it wrote the first treaty of internal diseases 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.680
 and two years later henry leave the medical congress was held 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.739
 internal 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.840
 It was meant to indicate a field of medical practice in which 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.260
 concepts were based on the new knowledge that emerged in physiology 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.459
 bacteriology and pathology as well as the exclusion of surgical methods 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.759
 in the therapeutic used 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.439
 this new field also carried the placement of an academic education 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.819
 and a training 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.569
 as well as these doctors could act as consultants to other specialists 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 that is, internal medicine would be like medicine that treat diseases 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.809
 from within from the inside of the body usually with medications 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.449
 as opposed to surgery that treat diseases from outside 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.789
 with surgical interventions 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:56.489
 from the second half of the twentieth century, specialties 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.239
 medical branches of internal medicine 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.199
 you can fall into the error that seriously harms the patient that the 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.369
 specialists do not take responsibility for patients who fall outside the area of ​​their 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.799
 particular competition and it has been more frequent than ever 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.119
 sick are being attended by multiple specialists with the most diverse and 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.699
 times 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.900
 contradictory approaches 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.139
 currently in Spain the internist medical staff are the largest 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.449
 of the entire health system however a lot of them work in 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:27.819
 emergency services 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:28.430
 guards 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.159
 and interim jobs 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.439
 Within ten years a generational change is foreseen after the 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.639
 retirement of 15% of these specialists 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.629
 neither the different autonomous societies, the Spanish society nor the 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.639
 The vast majority of internists have been able to transmit both to patients and 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.120
 the administrations interference the angular role of this specialty 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.020
 being from its birth a specialty in crisis whose 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.580
 professionals represent the ideal of universal humanistic doctor and 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.120
 scientist that society so badly needs 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.639
 other more practical countries with their multiple defects on the other hand have 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.550
 known to recognize the fundamental role of internal medicine to be a 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.360
 quality professional in particular in the United States all specialists 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.639
 have to spend two years in an internal medicine service and subsequently 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:15.810
 they excel 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.970
 remaining however that seed is the pursuit of perfection based on 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.960
 the study that is so inculcated in internal medicine services in all 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.539
 the professionals 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.170
 edit what is and is not internal medicine 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.050
 an internist doctor is one who takes care of the problems in the organs 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.720
 internal 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.530
 based almost entirely on non-surgical treatments is not a specialty 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.000
 exclusively hospital, since its field of action can be extended to 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.500
 outpatient care in outpatient or outpatient clinics 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.810
 specific consultations of this specialty in health centers 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.770
 a specialist in internal medicine or internist doctor is not a doctor 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.539
 internal 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.039
 the resident internal doctors neither 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:56.900
 in Spain 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.560
 are the doctors who once passed a general theoretical career of six 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.060
 years 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.790
 must be trained for three to five years to get a specialty 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.669
 medical or surgical 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.559
 do not confuse internal doctor with internist 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:13.779
 in mexico the internal doctor also known as an internal doctor of 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.629
 Undergraduate is one who is in the 5th or 6th year of the career of surgeon 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.160
 that depending on the university it lasts six or seven years and a 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.770
 Resident doctor is one who after finishing the medical degree 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.560
 surgeon 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.349
 he is taking a medical specialty 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.469
 after having approved the respective national examination of applicants to the residences 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:33.469
 medical 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.369
 in the case of internal medicine currently has a duration of 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:41.150
 four years in the last year the social service with a 

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:44.770
 duration of three to four months in some rural community or city of 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:46.199
 inside the country 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.719
 At the end of his specialty he is given the corresponding diploma to the 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.620
 specialty of internal medicine 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.620
 in popular speech he is known as an internist 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.610
 due to the loss of prestige of the specialty in internal medicine of 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.240
 multiple origins among them ignorance on the part of society 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.850
 the advocation to welfare tasks rejected by other specialties 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:10.400
 part of the managements and the demotivation and the indolence of many 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.440
 internists the internist is seen in many hospitals as the doctor of the 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.389
 patients discarded by other specialties 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:18.389
 but nevertheless 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.469
 an internal medicine service used to its full capacity can handle 90% 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:26.900
 of the medical pathology that arrives at the hospital and with the support of the services 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.500
 central hospitals and a minimum group of super specialists 

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:35.270
 endoscopists interventional radiologist etcetera up to 95% 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.360
 of the medical pathology of a general hospital 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.150
 are therefore the most versatile specialists best trained and most 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.240
 efficient in economic terms of all specialties 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.659
 hence, in any hospital no matter how small 

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:52.550
 some specialties may be missing but there is always a medical service 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.520
 internal 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.000
 I hope you liked my explanation that he is a doctor 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.100
 internist you say goodbye to you once a fraud inside that until the 

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:01.770
 next talk
