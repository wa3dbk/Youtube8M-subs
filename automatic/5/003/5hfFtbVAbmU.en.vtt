inside here you just simply put the key
in<00:03:32.780> there<00:03:32.959> because<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.409> can<00:03:33.530> see<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.769> AC<00:03:33.950> is

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
in there because you can see the AC is

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.920 
in there because you can see the AC is
blowing<00:03:34.670> even<00:03:35.299> though<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.510> vehicle<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.900> not

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
blowing even though the vehicle is not

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.899 
blowing even though the vehicle is not
on<00:03:36.230> or<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:37.159> is<00:03:37.250> actually<00:03:37.579> owned<00:03:37.730> but

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
on or it is actually owned but

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.849 
on or it is actually owned but
electronics<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.510> I'll<00:03:38.599> just<00:03:39.469> turn<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.829> the

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
electronics and I'll just turn it to the

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.890 
electronics and I'll just turn it to the
on<00:03:40.040> position<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:41.090> see<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.329> AC<00:03:41.420> turned<00:03:41.750> off

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
on position you see the AC turned off

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.410 
on position you see the AC turned off
because<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.200> was<00:03:42.290> never<00:03:42.560> really<00:03:42.709> owned<00:03:42.950> and

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
because it was never really owned and

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.729 
because it was never really owned and
