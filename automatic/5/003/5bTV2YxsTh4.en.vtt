00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
winterizer this you put in the pool

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.900 
winterizer this you put in the pool
after<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.240> done<00:00:21.420> vacuuming<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:22.640> you<00:00:23.640> let<00:00:23.820> it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
after you done vacuuming it you let it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.609 
after you done vacuuming it you let it
run<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.240> about<00:00:24.300> eight<00:00:24.630> hours<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.140> have

run for about eight hours and have

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.500 
run for about eight hours and have
instructions<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> back<00:00:26.699> side<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.300> was

instructions on the back side of it was

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.880 
instructions on the back side of it was
how<00:00:27.960> long<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.260> should<00:00:28.289> filter<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.859> through

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
how long you should filter it through

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.429 
how long you should filter it through
the<00:00:29.099> pool<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.570> you're<00:00:30.570> gonna<00:00:30.660> put<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.109> some

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the pool for you're gonna put in some

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.280 
the pool for you're gonna put in some
tabs<00:00:32.219> some<00:00:32.520> winter<00:00:32.759> tabs<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.989> tie

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
tabs some winter tabs these you can tie

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.830 
tabs some winter tabs these you can tie
into<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.790> middle<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.090> pool<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.510> usually

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
into the middle of the pool I usually

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260 
into the middle of the pool I usually
put<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> rope<00:00:37.440> break<00:00:37.649> through<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.270> string

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
put a rope break through it and string

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600 
put a rope break through it and string
it<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.320> middle<00:00:40.350> near<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> float

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it so it's in the middle near the float

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.889 
it so it's in the middle near the float
and<00:00:42.140> here<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> pump<00:00:44.100> protector<00:00:44.789> enzymes<00:00:45.660> at

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and here is a pump protector enzymes at

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
and here is a pump protector enzymes at
all<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.559> put<00:00:46.800> through<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.610> pump<00:00:47.879> it'll

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
all that you put through the pump it'll

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
all that you put through the pump it'll
help<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.629> protect<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> lubricated<00:00:49.680> against

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
help to protect it lubricated against

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.840 
help to protect it lubricated against
corrosion<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> we'll<00:00:52.649> show<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.399> stages

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
corrosion so we'll show you what stages

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.000 
corrosion so we'll show you what stages

the wrapper off and you poke with a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.700 
the wrapper off and you poke with a
screwdriver<00:01:33.659> through<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.290> bunch<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> the

screwdriver through a bunch of the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
screwdriver through a bunch of the
dimples<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.280> open<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.450> that'll<00:01:36.720> allow

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
dimples to open it up and that'll allow

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.030 
dimples to open it up and that'll allow
all<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> water<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.650> go<00:01:37.770> inside<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:39.740> help<00:01:40.740> keep

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
all the water to go inside and help keep

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.649

so I'm gonna open these up now then

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.990 
so I'm gonna open these up now then
we're<00:03:45.990> gonna<00:03:46.080> put<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.410> across<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.860> middle

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
we're gonna put it across the middle

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.160 
we're gonna put it across the middle
make<00:03:48.000> sure<00:03:48.150> when<00:03:48.300> you<00:03:48.360> put<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.020> middle

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
make sure when you put it in the middle

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.960 
make sure when you put it in the middle
of<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.410> pool<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.800> leave<00:03:49.950> enough<00:03:50.160> slack<00:03:50.520> so<00:03:50.820> in

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
of the pool you leave enough slack so in

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.780 
of the pool you leave enough slack so in
the<00:03:51.060> water<00:03:51.300> level<00:03:51.630> goes<00:03:51.690> down<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:53.580> know<00:03:53.670> it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the water level goes down you know it

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.220 
the water level goes down you know it
can<00:03:53.880> float<00:03:54.120> down<00:03:54.150> with<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.020> kind<00:03:55.200> of

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
can float down with it and it's kind of

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.900 
can float down with it and it's kind of
but<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:55.500> gonna<00:03:55.770> put<00:03:55.980> too<00:03:56.070> much<00:03:56.190> tension<00:03:56.670> on

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.890 
way and I never had an issue with it you
can<00:05:42.220> buy<00:05:42.520> plugs<00:05:42.910> and<00:05:43.150> plug<00:05:43.270> up<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.510> filter<00:05:43.810> and

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
can buy plugs and plug up the filter and

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.439 
can buy plugs and plug up the filter and
leave<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.169> water<00:05:44.380> level<00:05:44.770> up<00:05:45.030> but<00:05:46.030> to<00:05:46.180> me<00:05:46.300> it

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
leave the water level up but to me it

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.450 
leave the water level up but to me it
kind<00:05:46.720> of<00:05:46.750> helps<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.080> pull<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.830> Flex<00:05:48.070> a<00:05:48.220> little

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
kind of helps to pull the Flex a little

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.159 
kind of helps to pull the Flex a little
bit<00:05:48.580> if<00:05:48.850> you're<00:05:49.000> turning<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:49.330> on<00:05:49.419> ice<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:49.990> bad

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
bit if you're turning it on ice and bad

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.030 
bit if you're turning it on ice and bad
with<00:05:50.380> this<00:05:50.500> like<00:05:50.680> we<00:05:50.770> do<00:05:50.889> in<00:05:51.190> the<00:05:51.310> Northeast<00:05:51.729> so

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
with this like we do in the Northeast so

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.460 
with this like we do in the Northeast so
I'm<00:05:54.040> going<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.479> remove<00:05:55.479> this<00:05:55.720> and<00:05:55.990> let<00:05:56.110> some

I'm going to remove this and let some

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.629 
I'm going to remove this and let some
more<00:05:56.590> of<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.740> water<00:05:56.919> out<00:05:57.160> they've<00:05:57.490> been
