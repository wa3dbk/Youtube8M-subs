me<00:04:10.400> see<00:04:13.090> see<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.299> it's<00:04:14.930> literally<00:04:15.560> like<00:04:15.890> a

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
me see see that it's literally like a

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.440 
me see see that it's literally like a
milk<00:04:16.519> or<00:04:16.790> something<00:04:18.220> but<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.340> lathers<00:04:19.519> up<00:04:19.700> it

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
milk or something but it lathers up it

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.210 
milk or something but it lathers up it
cleans<00:04:20.930> your<00:04:21.109> hair<00:04:21.380> it's<00:04:21.590> super<00:04:21.919> moisturizing

cleans your hair it's super moisturizing
and<00:04:22.790> I<00:04:22.880> think<00:04:23.150> because<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.510> this<00:04:23.750> texture<00:04:24.320> I

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
and I think because of this texture I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.409 
and I think because of this texture I
actually<00:04:25.130> just<00:04:25.520> started<00:04:25.820> putting<00:04:26.030> my<00:04:26.210> hair

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
actually just started putting my hair

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.850 
actually just started putting my hair
and<00:04:26.479> I<00:04:26.570> went<00:04:26.780> in<00:04:26.900> my<00:04:27.020> scalp<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:27.560> applied<00:04:27.830> it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
and I went in my scalp and applied it

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.880 
and I went in my scalp and applied it
and<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.669> really<00:04:29.000> really<00:04:29.390> covered<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.290> lot<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.590> my

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
and it really really covered a lot of my

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.070 
and it really really covered a lot of my
scalp<00:04:31.160> without<00:04:31.400> me<00:04:31.550> having<00:04:31.700> to<00:04:31.880> put<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> lot<00:04:33.050> of

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
scalp without me having to put a lot of

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.810 
scalp without me having to put a lot of
extra<00:04:33.470> products<00:04:33.890> so<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:33.979> really<00:04:34.280> like<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.669> it's

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
extra products so I really like it it's

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.370 
extra products so I really like it it's
really<00:04:35.150> different<00:04:35.450> from<00:04:35.780> what<00:04:35.960> I'm<00:04:36.080> used<00:04:36.110> to

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
really different from what I'm used to

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.510 
really different from what I'm used to
but<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.770> really<00:04:37.100> loved<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:37.760> just<00:04:37.970> have<00:04:38.360> um

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
but I really loved it it just have um

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.990 
but I really loved it it just have um
sulfates<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.669> believe<00:04:41.060> in<00:04:41.419> it<00:04:41.570> but<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:43.760> don't

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
sulfates I believe in it but I don't

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.480 
sulfates I believe in it but I don't
mind<00:04:44.120> sulfates<00:04:44.890> just<00:04:45.890> don't<00:04:46.100> get<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.340> in<00:04:46.460> your

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
mind sulfates just don't get it in your

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.730 
mind sulfates just don't get it in your
eye<00:04:46.669> so<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.419> next<00:04:47.570> thing<00:04:47.690> is<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.110> hydrating
