00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.410
 finally both where the stationary this 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.610
 morning on lacanau hello to all and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.500
 all we start the day with a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.079
 time that variables can stormy with 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 showers it is already 21 degrees in 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.140
 the water it is 18 degrees mooring is in 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 going down the full of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.690
 glitter at 10:30 the licensing costs 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.430
 we are sixty six nations 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.190
 descending the south low offshore wind 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 is a little strong taste the water plan to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.670
 less than 1 beaufort the lake ellis 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 has a partial idea but we have a swell 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.970
 which mean to long with our second 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.500
 period oriented west to west northwest 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.059
 an area that multiplies quai virtually 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 stationary in size compared to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.920
 last night regular surf at 70 cm 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 and surya 80 and from time to time there are 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.729
 series that show up to the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.100
 beat it's pretty clean it's not 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.549
 super tidy but hey that's clean 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.560
 service 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.620
 there are a lot of places to do that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 waves to the fermented work on both 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.280
 three best tides of low tide 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.190
 it breaks a bit further from the edge and that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.590
 allows a small opening 1 of what 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.789
 open a little what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.079
 so there is a little surf a little 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.100
 action plan but only on 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.409
 best banks it's quiet 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.770
 cushy evolution for the rest of the 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.390
 day 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.679
 it is a train of swell is stationary 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.780
 in the middle of the day, which should run out of steam 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.909
 in the evening drinking cachan and removed 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.740
 another 60 seconds and slightly 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.479
 down the wind he should rise 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.950
 onshore at mid-day to calm down 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.959
 this afternoon be careful with the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.000
 marriott this afternoon we can have 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:50.329
 a much weaker wind than expected 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.189
 so we wait at 13h 80 cm to a meter or 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.409
 west and west northwest 9 seconds 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.140
 van period south-west of three 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.970
 strong words and at 17 hours 80 cm or 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.280
 west and west northwest 9 seconds 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.599
 period with a wind that goes south sees 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.219
 west and that weakens two strong words 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.439
 but who could possibly be more 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.429
 lower than that I also enjoy good 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.590
 repeat 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.640
 next point at 11:30 to watch out 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.640
 this day thank you 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.820
 here
