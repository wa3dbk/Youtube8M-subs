00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.120 

the<00:00:00.659> next<00:00:00.930> tool<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:02.360> project<00:00:03.360> curve<00:00:03.720> and

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
the next tool is the project curve and

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.140 
the next tool is the project curve and
interesting<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:06.799> SolidWorks<00:00:07.799> if<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.970> are

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
interesting to SolidWorks if you are

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
interesting to SolidWorks if you are
throwing<00:00:09.450> us<00:00:09.719> including<00:00:10.590> this<00:00:10.740> part<00:00:11.010> from

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
throwing us including this part from

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.310 
throwing us including this part from
beginning<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:12.030> will<00:00:12.210> remember<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:13.080> have

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
beginning you will remember that we have

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.039 
beginning you will remember that we have
a<00:00:13.710> deleted<00:00:14.250> surface<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.509> been<00:00:15.690> created

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
a deleted surface have been created

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.960 
a deleted surface have been created
before<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.760> go<00:00:18.770> to<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.949> tree<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.670> can't

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
before so if we go to the tree we can't

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.259 
before so if we go to the tree we can't
pick<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.570> delete<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> body<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.269> undo

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
pick that delete the body here and undo

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.870 
pick that delete the body here and undo
by<00:00:24.840> deleting<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:28.460> now<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.519> will

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
by deleting that so now you will

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.350 
by deleting that so now you will
remember<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.750> extruded<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.980> spline<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.210> if

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
remember that extruded a spline so if

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.880 
remember that extruded a spline so if
you<00:00:33.480> don't<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.350> simply

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you don't have that you can simply

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.150 
you don't have that you can simply
create<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.670> spline<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.540> stood<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.980> we

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
create a spline and we stood it so we

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.500 
create a spline and we stood it so we
have<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:40.280> external<00:00:41.280> surface<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.780> are

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
have this external surface now we are

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.850 
have this external surface now we are
make<00:00:45.510> another<00:00:45.960> sketch<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.980> project<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
make another sketch to project it on the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.750 
make another sketch to project it on the
surface<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.960> has<00:00:51.960> quite<00:00:52.500> some<00:00:52.550> sharp<00:00:53.550> it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
surface because has quite some sharp it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.569 
surface because has quite some sharp it
just<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> make<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.070> looks<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.340> little

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
just we want to make it looks a little

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.310 
just we want to make it looks a little
bit<00:00:56.910> better<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.440> let's<00:00:59.039> try<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> find<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.320> poorly

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
bit better so let's try to find a poorly

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.960 
bit better so let's try to find a poorly
planned<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:03.589> sueded<00:01:04.589> surface<00:01:04.820> where<00:01:05.820> we

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
planned to that sueded surface where we

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.370 
planned to that sueded surface where we
are<00:01:06.090> able<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:07.100> project<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.460> curve<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> we

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
are able to project a curve on it so we

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
are able to project a curve on it so we
can<00:01:10.590> find<00:01:11.070> top<00:01:11.909> plane<00:01:13.490> insert<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> schedule

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
can find top plane insert the schedule

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.140 
can find top plane insert the schedule
top<00:01:15.390> plane<00:01:17.689> over<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.850> select

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
top plane over to so now we can select

00:01:21.150 --> 00:02:12.630 
top plane over to so now we can select
the<00:01:21.420> shape<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:23.390> our

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.270 

so<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.790> are<00:02:13.940> done<00:02:14.180> with<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.990> shape<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:16.100> want

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
so you are done with the shape you want

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.580 
so you are done with the shape you want
in<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.170> nothing<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.780> extruded<00:02:23.780> surface

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
in it is nothing that extruded surface

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.210 
in it is nothing that extruded surface
in<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.220> top<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.790> like<00:02:26.600> okay<00:02:26.840> now<00:02:27.800> we<00:02:28.190> are

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
in the top of it like okay now we are

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.880 
in the top of it like okay now we are
able<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.910> project<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.390> sketch<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.230> that

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
able to project that sketch on that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.760 
able to project that sketch on that
surface<00:02:31.630> quarter<00:02:32.920> or<00:02:33.920> exit<00:02:34.640> sketch<00:02:35.209> first

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
surface quarter or exit sketch first

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.570 
surface quarter or exit sketch first
then<00:02:36.850> go<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.910> project<00:02:38.540> care<00:02:38.870> sketch<00:02:39.770> six<00:02:40.370> is

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
then go to project care sketch six is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.430 
then go to project care sketch six is
already<00:02:40.880> selected<00:02:41.060> which<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:41.810> have<00:02:42.080> created

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
already selected which we have created

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.640 
already selected which we have created
already<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:44.390> surface<00:02:44.870> where<00:02:45.260> you're<00:02:45.440> going

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
already the surface where you're going

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.840 
already the surface where you're going
to<00:02:47.170> project<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:49.459> surface<00:02:50.090> or<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.810> space

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
to project is the surface or the space

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.580 
to project is the surface or the space
so<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:52.940> notice<00:02:53.270> here<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:54.080> your

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
so you notice here you have your

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.510 
so you notice here you have your
projected<00:02:55.390> care<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:57.400> okay<00:02:58.510> now
