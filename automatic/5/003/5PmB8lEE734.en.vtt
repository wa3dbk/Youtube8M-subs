00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
middle of cleaning the sensor so take

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.500 
middle of cleaning the sensor so take
our<00:00:49.960> blower<00:00:50.200> brush<00:00:50.500> here<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:52.300> I'm<00:00:52.360> going<00:00:52.480> to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
our blower brush here what I'm going to

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.700 
our blower brush here what I'm going to
do<00:00:52.630> is<00:00:52.810> hold<00:00:53.680> it<00:00:53.860> up<00:00:53.980> like<00:00:54.070> this<00:00:55.470> just<00:00:56.470> give<00:00:56.649> it

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
do is hold it up like this just give it

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.030 
do is hold it up like this just give it
a<00:00:56.800> few<00:00:57.149> blows<00:00:58.149> don't<00:00:58.989> actually<00:00:59.440> stick<00:00:59.829> this

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
a few blows don't actually stick this

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.250 
a few blows don't actually stick this
too<00:01:00.970> deep<00:01:01.210> inside<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.720> camera<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.110> don't

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
too deep inside the camera you don't

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.130 
too deep inside the camera you don't
want<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.470> damage<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.800> sensor<00:01:03.340> or<00:01:03.579> a<00:01:03.640> mirror

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
want to damage the sensor or a mirror

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.870 
want to damage the sensor or a mirror
just<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.229> get<00:01:05.379> any<00:01:05.530> dust<00:01:05.770> out<00:01:06.040> then<00:01:06.610> we'll<00:01:06.759> lay

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
just to get any dust out then we'll lay

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.750 
just to get any dust out then we'll lay
that<00:01:07.060> flat<00:01:10.440> take<00:01:11.440> a<00:01:11.470> swab<00:01:11.920> now<00:01:12.250> these<00:01:12.430> swabs

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
that flat take a swab now these swabs

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.190 
that flat take a swab now these swabs
can<00:01:13.090> only<00:01:13.240> be<00:01:13.450> used<00:01:13.630> once

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
can only be used once

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.570 
can only be used once
so<00:01:14.500> once<00:01:14.680> you've<00:01:14.830> taken<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:15.280> out<00:01:15.400> of<00:01:15.430> the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
so once you've taken it out of the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.610 
so once you've taken it out of the
package<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.090> used<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.540> if<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.110> need<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.409> Reese

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
package and used it if you need to Reese

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.899 
package and used it if you need to Reese
why<00:01:18.210> usually<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.600> use<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.560> new<00:01:20.799> one<00:01:23.729> take<00:01:24.729> that

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
why usually you use a new one take that

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.680 
why usually you use a new one take that
out<00:01:25.119> now<00:01:26.010> with<00:01:27.010> these<00:01:27.159> drops<00:01:27.549> just<00:01:28.090> put<00:01:28.299> two<00:01:28.540> or

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
out now with these drops just put two or

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.060 
out now with these drops just put two or
three<00:01:28.900> drops<00:01:29.140> just<00:01:29.590> enough<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.010> wet<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.920> whole

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
three drops just enough to wet the whole

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.899 
three drops just enough to wet the whole
sensor<00:01:33.640> one<00:01:34.000> two<00:01:34.299> three<00:01:34.990> drops<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:36.610> we<00:01:36.670> give

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
sensor one two three drops now we give

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.490 
sensor one two three drops now we give
that<00:01:37.060> about<00:01:37.180> five<00:01:37.540> seconds<00:01:38.080> just<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.380> make

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
that about five seconds just to make

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.910 
that about five seconds just to make
sure<00:01:38.530> it's<00:01:38.770> saturated<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:41.409> what<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.710> do<00:01:41.890> is

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
sure it's saturated then what you do is

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.179 
sure it's saturated then what you do is
in<00:01:42.369> one<00:01:42.909> pass<00:01:43.270> very<00:01:43.840> gently<00:01:44.170> stick<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.680> in<00:01:44.830> up

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
in one pass very gently stick it in up

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.440 
in one pass very gently stick it in up
against<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.810> side<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.439> sensor<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:48.450> then

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
against one side of the sensor and then

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.450 
against one side of the sensor and then
you<00:01:49.600> press<00:01:49.900> down<00:01:50.110> firmly<00:01:50.470> but<00:01:50.770> not<00:01:50.830> too<00:01:50.979> hard

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
you press down firmly but not too hard

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.310 
you press down firmly but not too hard
and<00:01:51.790> just<00:01:52.150> one<00:01:52.540> pass<00:01:53.140> across<00:01:53.670> pull<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.790> out<00:01:54.939> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
and just one pass across pull it out and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.929 
and just one pass across pull it out and
that's<00:01:56.320> done<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.280> then<00:01:57.430> we'll<00:01:57.610> take<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
that's done so then we'll take the

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.560 
that's done so then we'll take the
camera<00:01:58.439> turn<00:01:59.439> it<00:01:59.590> off<00:01:59.909> mirror<00:02:00.909> is<00:02:01.000> locked<00:02:01.299> back

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
camera turn it off mirror is locked back

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
camera turn it off mirror is locked back
down<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:04.509> lens<00:02:04.659> back<00:02:04.990> on<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:06.060> we're<00:02:07.060> done<00:02:07.210> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
down the lens back on and we're done and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.130 
down the lens back on and we're done and
that's<00:02:09.700> how<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.239> clean<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.599> sensor<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
that's how you clean the sensor on the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.400 
that's how you clean the sensor on the
Nikon<00:02:11.530> d3s<00:02:12.040> camera<00:02:12.489> now<00:02:13.060> if<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.930> still<00:02:14.230> have

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
Nikon d3s camera now if you still have

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.800 
Nikon d3s camera now if you still have
dust<00:02:14.709> spots<00:02:15.069> after<00:02:15.550> doing<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.510> repeat

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
dust spots after doing that just repeat

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.890 
dust spots after doing that just repeat
the<00:02:16.959> process

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
the process

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.470
