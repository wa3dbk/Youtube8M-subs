00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 talk about what is being done 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.220
 sausage what we eat is it useful here 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.740
 look 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.009
 According to the existing guests Gaston 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.090
 stress boiled sausage is created from 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.630
 next year the meat in it is 30 percent 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.810
 less than 3 is meat that is perfect 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.990
 combo sausage garden versions of guests 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.930
 I emphasize 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.539
 place only a third beef meat pork 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.899
 poultry meat may be contained between 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.489
 the rest according to the guests so here 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.270
 further necessarily it will be 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.700
 attend 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.579
 soy protein soy that is vegetable 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 protein from there its content will be 25 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.980
 percent a quarter of that here 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.020
 it contains soy protein 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.789
 there is still a so-called substrate which 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.899
 called on gost of scam language 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.030
 emulsion 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.620
 what is behind this strange 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.050
 the name behind this strange name 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.920
 hiding some substance which 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.770
 obtained from the skin of bones with leftovers 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 meat which is century which has stuck to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.390
 bones with betting wood 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.610
 i.e. this is called offal they 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.110
 crush they are crushed something with 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 they do it turns out really 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.920
 an emulsion that's in such an amount 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 35 percent added to sausage 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.759
 I will definitely be kept 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.009
 starch which will be at least six 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.479
 Eight percent and sometimes water and salt 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.909
 just not a huge amount 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.130
 it's in perfect in the pool not only is it 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 right now I'm another one we are here now about guests 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.460
 finish and then add this yes 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.439
 because there is still in Russia 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.420
 called technical conditions which 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.920
 apart from the guest there is but also 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.259
 have the right to exist so here 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.240
 when the sausage is made for technical 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.360
 conditions so called then in her 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.290
 contains such a substance which 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.590
 called 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.500
 mom m o m is a kind of abbreviation 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.090
 behind which hides the bones with the remnants 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.580
 the meat of this is made sausage that is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.739
 sausage that is made according to GOST she 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.730
 least surely contains 30 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 percent meat sausage here 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.860
 with the technical conditions of the so-called 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.049
 may not contain meat at all but it 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.760
 word specifications you say 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.959
 read it described but that's not all 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.780
 I continue here how much per kilogram 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.400
 sausage is added dye additives and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.420
 preservatives and then thickener so 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.390
 called that is here these forces are blockage and 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.420
 407 carrageenan from algae is called 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.400
 there are 412 here 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.650
 plant guar gum 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.370
 guaranas 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.319
 my gosh I'm 450-460 one this is some 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.510
 phosphate chemicals which 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.299
 are used as moisture binding to 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.780
 the moisture remained inside the sausage 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.510
 salt flavor enhancer antioxidants and 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.480
 nitrates and nitrites tarantino not troll 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.510
 3d as preservatives and as traitors 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.480
 traitor and a give or here such 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.720
 colors which we consider to be beautiful 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.090
 his features give or attach or will 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.639
 traitor and sorrow fall anywhere here 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.560
 such a beautiful rich pink 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.200
 color which is considered home color 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.030
 real meat 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.160
 put in place the sausage call 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.459
 wilted viewer to talk to us about 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.459
 sausage 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.830
 get up close to us here 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.319
 tell me your name tell me what 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.980
 you have a family who is your profession of hope 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.830
 let's 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.830
 but by profession Iâ€™m a seed accountant 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.160
 consists of 3 people husband and son in general 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.260
 there and sausage one for one did not know 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.420
 In general, what is often said right there 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.430
 terrified you know on dimka but we're like 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.500
 always start from the podium 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.019
 Dmitry Nikolaevich on what grounds we 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.180
 today will arrange pedestal rubbed 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.690
 calories done today use and 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.049
 as a separator of these sausages 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.280
 smoked sausage sausage 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.470
 boiled smoked we have here 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.240
 eat sausage boiled most 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.249
 calories it is smoked calorie it 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.919
 the highest 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:39.449
 my calorie that's it all remember 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:41.879
 we have 2 place 2 I think light 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.210
 otherwise on this one my last 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.150
 fired 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.060
 with you right sausage just like that 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.340
 distributed by calories here 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.310
 still giraffe so sausage less then 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.590
 which gives it a calorie such 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.720
 here more here a little smaller and 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.020
 boiled sausage is the smallest fox 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.210
 whom I want to remind everyone that we are not 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.740
 casually sausage treat boiled 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.199
 smoked sausage 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.870
 negative attitude to boiled sausage 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.789
 just negative why of course the whole 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.849
 the secret is that the sausage that we 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.970
 buy in store contains preservative 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.340
 which is called nitrate or nitrite and 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.650
 this preservative is doing its 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.539
 treason in our bodies 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.320
 dmitry nikolaevich let's go cylinders 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:32.680
 peaks of experience and show you in practice what 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.110
 going on go and I want you bye 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.699
 remind that all recipes are all tips from 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.840
 our program you can find in 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.909
 tv program inside nikolay dude we 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.490
 such an installation put on what we 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.560
 we want to hint jager our speech and called 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.919
 . 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.159
 we want to say quite directly about 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.259
 some things in sausage are contained in 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.090
 as preservatives and as 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.020
 stabilizers and and beautiful pink 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.889
 colors 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.139
 nitrites and nitrates chemical compounds 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.090
 which in our body turn into 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.969
 nitrosamines 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.539
 which turn possess direct 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.820
 carcinogenic 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.430
 that is, there is no cancer at all . 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:20.310
 cells form here always turn on 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.310
 keep here imagined block up 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:27.210
 the formation of cancer cells has begun 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:32.699
 but we have defenses that 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:35.369
 block and block german 6 of these 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.499
 no rose amine which is formed thanks 

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:40.680
 want to return to 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:42.869
 it deprives the body of the ability 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.460
 block the formation of cancer cells 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:49.619
 now go trinka your show app here 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.199
 there is a formation of cancer cells it is us 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:55.469
 goes like seconds am if you see 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:58.559
 sausage we tried to learn even you 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:07:01.139
 run the nose that's it we specifically 

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:04.439
 they did so in order not to have reached and forever 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:06.870
 remember that unfortunately nitrates and 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:10.469
 nitrites from sausage turn into subway 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:14.309
 replacements Alan causes the formation of cancer 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:16.589
 cuba ga logy that's such a funny situation 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:19.319
 so of course this is the main minus 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:21.569
 sausages need to say more content 

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:26.009
 nitro replacement in the amount of more than 2 grams 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:27.149
 instantly just kill you here on 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.639

 but let you know what about how to choose 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:36.120
 sausage how to store it and how it 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:39.089
 cook at home healthy 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.749
 you will find out a few minutes later in 

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:46.409
 our program is only meat and nothing 

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:51.460
 besides meat we cook homemade sausage 

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:54.509
 three of the most hidden stomach cancer 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:58.650
 one for all unusual use 

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:58.650
 adhesive tape or duct tape 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.300
 wow
