00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.840
 or the defeats welcome that steer tutorial made by dot base person 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.529
 net the best internet community 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:13.199
 In this video tutorial, my dear friend, I'm going to teach you how to make fire 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.630
 realistic with particle system did not connect simple 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.019
 Efe anyway the atmosphere 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.609
 I think there is 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.699
 let us begin 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.089
 first let's go I'm going to create a 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.089
 no type is going to be a little dish 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.509
 who only for him 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.509
 a disappointed gesture we just want to see how it is done 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.360
 so good for those who do not know how to do it this can be useful intern for 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.380
 you at the time of doing any any scene 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 equal to put a car audi medcup mahou clarion 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.860
 to acquire our line have a thick type 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.130
 that doubt they applied 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.400
 what is called 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 it would be bigger and I modified them 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 you are here is 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.220
 Now let's create an image 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.710
 a cylinder in the middle of this few dishes that made 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.930
 the cylinder will serve us 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.750
 to assign where we want the future to start from 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.949
 I want some to do 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.389
 with the postulate system of particles smaller than 10 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.389
 like droughts week particles 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:21.529
 and let's go 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.529
 after the incident the root 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:32.079
 and here we put it anywhere, that's why it was the reason for everything 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.079
 the reason for being able to replace the cylinder 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:41.529
 I was there going to come out we go Arctic to tie in the modified rosary mobil corp 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.509
 to gray and honduras 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:47.909
 Mexican scientists, let's live with the cylinder that we had made 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.549
 out of that we do not go to the very dissatisfied timeline there are those who think 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.789
 leave him 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.839
 the future 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.839
 well let's see modified the 70s 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.730
 let's not be that modified because at the time of today 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.619
 put the texture 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:10.290
 I have been southern cone example in the diesel going off we will look like a texture 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.569
 not so realistic the bones later because 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.469
 in the modifier 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.810
 moss na 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.479
 according to him 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.819
 here live because he is immersed to see 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.139
 up to here how will not be 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.139
 the speed we will put into service 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:37.299
 good as most of the popular party of this evil particles play 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.229
 with Scottish 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.029
 the result will be its use as a cesc want 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.029
 for one hundrerd 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.609
 you want 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.839
 in some currencies and bonds or parameter message option that we're going to 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.139
 modify that yes they have to go 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.139
 it does not matter what size it is 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.819
 for example in top 100 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.259
 display until 100 exposure 90 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.099
 radiation does not mean a 10 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:19.319
 good heron as alibi when we do not appear anything was a set that everything should 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.150
 in its beginning 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.610
 let's apply one o'clock and came in for whoever drowned most realistic 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.740
 otherwise gualaquiza and affection 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.139
 well now let's go to the pub inc with him 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.120
 beasain 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.479
 with our fire for that we are going to see that button 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.479
 nor the wind is the same 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.880
 we explained in the story and we dragged him 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.779
 but the root 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:59.279
 so that they are united and that it has effects on the particles 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.759
 here in the vogue speed in it estulÃ­n let's put a point 1 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.499
 and of turbulence later we are going to modify or all that is only achieved 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:19.710
 stop 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.710
 to see the particles 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.550
 sadism suppose a 30 in size in 30 years 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.909
 requiem aggression 50 percent to 1 in the living 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:38.600
 Formoso with a 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.930
 I do not have any 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.930
 please do not suppose a 5 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.729
 who are we going to put a 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.729
 9 13 and 6 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.009
 in particular, the type 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.520
 last january easy 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.520
 that agreement is behind those of the other 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.939
 now 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:09.599
 we keep going down 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.599
 and who do not touch anything else 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:14.939
 we go down 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:19.159
 light here in the dynamic division path let's oppose 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.030
 here in spine there is 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.030
 random daimiel control let's put a 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.909
 address 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.219
 bosch ravel 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:32.219
 We are not going to oppose 30% inc 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.270
 that is all 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.270
 now we're going to modify windows 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.460
 i at the speed the ounce put veic 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.669
 points 0 1 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.669
 together to the plans 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:04.710
 They leave me 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.710
 for in turbulence an out 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.889
 little less 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.780
 here we are calculating because he is always the same for subway 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.780
 obviously 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.159
 what you want 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.810
 Ok, that's this simple part 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.220
 now we are going to expand it all
