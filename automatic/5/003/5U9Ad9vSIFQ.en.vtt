00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.310 

this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.700> something<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:12.389> just<00:00:12.660> uncovered

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
this is something we have just uncovered

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.420 
this is something we have just uncovered
recently<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:15.059> batteries<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:15.870> being

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
recently the batteries are being

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.630 
recently the batteries are being
continuously<00:00:17.430> discharged<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:19.310> all<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
continuously discharged with all of the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.029 
continuously discharged with all of the
switches<00:00:20.880> off<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> circuit

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
switches off and all of the circuit

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.170 
switches off and all of the circuit
breakers<00:00:23.460> pulled<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:25.080> theoretically<00:00:26.180> all

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
breakers pulled so theoretically all

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.429 
breakers pulled so theoretically all
open<00:00:27.720> circuits<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.410> yet<00:00:28.710> there's<00:00:28.949> hot-wired

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
open circuits and yet there's hot-wired

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.650 
open circuits and yet there's hot-wired
something<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.619> these<00:00:32.189> airplanes<00:00:32.660> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
something in these airplanes the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.959 
something in these airplanes the
parasitic<00:00:34.350> loads<00:00:34.680> varied<00:00:35.309> from<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.570> low<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.969> 13

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
parasitic loads varied from as low as 13

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.299 
parasitic loads varied from as low as 13
milliamps<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.260> high<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.820> 1<00:00:41.820> point<00:00:42.090> 3<00:00:42.270> amps

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
milliamps to as high as 1 point 3 amps

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.920 
milliamps to as high as 1 point 3 amps
which<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.789> huge<00:00:45.719> draw<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:47.809> battery<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
which is a huge draw on a battery that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.520 
which is a huge draw on a battery that
is<00:00:49.350> only<00:00:49.739> capable<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:51.270> 25<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.739> 40<00:00:53.190> amp<00:00:53.670> hours

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
is only capable of of 25 or 40 amp hours

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
is only capable of of 25 or 40 amp hours
consequently<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.770> batteries<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.579> not<00:00:56.690> self

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
consequently the batteries are not self

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.880 
consequently the batteries are not self
discharging<00:00:58.590> they're<00:00:59.520> actually<00:01:00.090> being

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
discharging they're actually being

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
discharging they're actually being
discharged<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.550> loads<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
discharged with the loads in the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.609 
discharged with the loads in the
aircraft<00:01:05.479> we<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> address<00:01:07.260> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
aircraft we are going to address this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.520 
aircraft we are going to address this
with<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.310> revision<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> our<00:01:09.600> instructions<00:01:10.320> for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
with a revision to our instructions for

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
with a revision to our instructions for
continued<00:01:11.070> air<00:01:11.220> awareness<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
continued air awareness and also with a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.940 
continued air awareness and also with a
bulletin<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> our<00:01:14.220> website<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
bulletin on our website so that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
bulletin on our website so that
mechanics<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.310> actually<00:01:17.850> measure<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
mechanics can actually measure this and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
mechanics can actually measure this and
we<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> very<00:01:21.000> strong

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
we are going to make a very strong

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.399 
we are going to make a very strong
recommendation<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.220> batteries<00:01:23.700> be

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
recommendation that the batteries be

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
recommendation that the batteries be
disconnected<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.520> airplanes<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.540> in

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
disconnected when the airplanes are in

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.160 
disconnected when the airplanes are in
storage<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.450> anything<00:01:30.780> else

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
storage you know it's like anything else

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.330 
storage you know it's like anything else
if<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.890> an<00:01:32.280> airplane<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.939> flies<00:01:33.299> often

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
if you have an airplane that flies often

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.520 
if you have an airplane that flies often
this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.579> incidental<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> fly<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.259> every

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this is incidental if you fly it every

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.609 
this is incidental if you fly it every
day<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.310> five<00:01:38.549> days<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> week<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.659> whatever<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
day or five days a week or whatever you

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.310 
day or five days a week or whatever you
can<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:41.009> by<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.329> airplanes<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
can get by with this but airplanes that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.490 
can get by with this but airplanes that
particularly<00:01:43.979> some<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.729> light<00:01:45.540> turbine

that are not professional pilots and

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.480 
that are not professional pilots and
they<00:01:54.329> don't<00:01:54.630> necessarily<00:01:55.040> get<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.280> those

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
they don't necessarily get to those

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.920 
they don't necessarily get to those
airplanes<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:58.140> month<00:01:58.950> or<00:01:59.250> two

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
airplanes for a month or two

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.420 
airplanes for a month or two
sometimes<00:02:00.930> three<00:02:01.409> before<00:02:01.950> they<00:02:02.130> fly<00:02:02.370> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
sometimes three before they fly the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.340 
sometimes three before they fly the
airplane<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.120> then<00:02:03.690> they<00:02:03.870> end<00:02:04.050> up<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
airplane and then they end up with a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.029 
airplane and then they end up with a
dead<00:02:04.620> battery<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> there's<00:02:07.020> been<00:02:07.350> various

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
dead battery so there's been various

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.820 
dead battery so there's been various
attempts<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:09.170> trying<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.350> keep<00:02:10.560> these

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
attempts I'm trying to keep these

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.280 
attempts I'm trying to keep these
batteries<00:02:11.520> alive<00:02:12.200> with<00:02:13.200> some<00:02:13.530> sort<00:02:13.980> of

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
batteries alive with some sort of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.160 
batteries alive with some sort of
maintaining<00:02:16.290> charger<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:18.690> has<00:02:18.959> not

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
maintaining charger and that has not

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.160 
maintaining charger and that has not
been<00:02:19.470> totally<00:02:20.220> successful<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.810> reason

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
been totally successful and the reason

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.570 
been totally successful and the reason
why<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.440> isn't<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:24.800> charging<00:02:25.800> wears

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
why it isn't is because charging wears

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.930 
why it isn't is because charging wears
batteries<00:02:27.270> out<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.890> subjecting<00:02:29.670> them<00:02:29.910> to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
batteries out so subjecting them to

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.930 
batteries out so subjecting them to
charge<00:02:30.620> 24<00:02:31.620> hours<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.920> day<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.340> seven<00:02:32.730> days<00:02:32.760> a
