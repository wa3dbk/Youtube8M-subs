00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.170
 already the final version went first 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.730
 chip she catches the eye immediately as 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.100

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.590
 ios 7 is a total redesign here 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.359
 now the semi-sweet orphism plane 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.100
 this is a design element when an element 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.550
 copied from another item that is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.519
 here now and all in a flat style then 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 there we see costs icons devoid 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.100
 volume all in well, do not take it yet 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.620
 icons that have already mounted it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.050
 for example and contact 100 grams we and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.110
 basically anything else I ibooks they are not 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.210
 the planes are voluminous that is, it is clear that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.129
 these applications are not yet updated and by the way 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 As for applications yesterday in the appstore 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.770
 not more than 25 flew my update 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.949

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.780
 Iowa 7 support added new icons 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.420
 he like e-mail boxing and now he 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.270
 all so flat and in general guys 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.210
 The first chip is of course the design of ios 7 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.580
 he is top notch in my opinion in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.750
 the second feature does not contain 2 features first 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.820
 of these two vici 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.890
 this control center is our point 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 control our and on devices 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.920

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.119
 Airplane include Wi-Fi and bluetooth 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.430
 night mode but also block 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.479

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.619
 to the creators camera however shit camera 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.740
 the truth is not clear because it is available from 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.360
 unlock screen 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.759
 2 feature in this second feature and the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.790
 notification center, he drank, he did 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.470
 how it is necessary and in principle everything is clear and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.979
 no one is lost here 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.090
 there are missing tabs that is this 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.890
 notification from which we come and we them 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.930
 not seen or missed or just not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.850
 noticed in general they fall into 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.409
 all tabs missed in all of us 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 and today it is a separate page on 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.100
 today here we can dedicate events to 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.750
 calendar reminder can be 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.600

 here it is also available in the tab 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.679
 today in general 2 feature is control 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.450
 center that allows us to manage our 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.430
 iPod without entering any settings and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.980
 notification center 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.689
 which was before pelin 3 feature this 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.700
 we sent multitasking smoothly too 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.079
 stepped forward and now on looks like this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.659
 so that's more like a real one 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.430
 many tasks on here we see the vaccine 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.079
 all programs that are running here 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.909
 for example, can happen between me 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:34.730
 the settings further do not know ibooks in 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.590
 instagram and and everything in this spirit is good then 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.329
 what can two swipe clean up immediately 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.359
 two applications and three each 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.090
 but how would you do the principle of late 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.290
 but it is possible and on one application too 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.180
 maybe clean up now 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.870
