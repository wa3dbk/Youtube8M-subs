00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.590 
planned ahead I think I hope I mean just
handing<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.390> your<00:02:00.570> heart<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.500> that's

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
handing over your heart like that that's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.620 
handing over your heart like that that's
but<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.079> see<00:02:04.320> Virgo<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.939> trafalgar

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
but then we see Virgo with trafalgar

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.480 
but then we see Virgo with trafalgar
loss<00:02:07.429> heart<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
loss heart and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.440 
loss heart and
that<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.450> probably<00:02:11.930> how<00:02:12.140> he<00:02:12.880> took<00:02:13.880> trafalgar

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
that is probably how he took trafalgar

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.250 
that is probably how he took trafalgar
down<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.620> easily<00:02:15.670> before<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:17.000> he<00:02:17.780> has<00:02:17.990> his

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
down so easily before if he has his

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.560 
down so easily before if he has his
heart<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.890> he<00:02:19.850> did<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.060> again<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.450> this

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
heart and he did it again in this

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.620 
heart and he did it again in this
chapter<00:02:20.840> law<00:02:21.440> was<00:02:21.650> like<00:02:21.860> wow<00:02:22.220> it's<00:02:23.090> probably

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
chapter law was like wow it's probably

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.360 
chapter law was like wow it's probably
because<00:02:23.960> he<00:02:24.260> was<00:02:24.380> like<00:02:24.440> pinching<00:02:24.980> his<00:02:25.100> heart

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
because he was like pinching his heart

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.260 
because he was like pinching his heart
or<00:02:25.520> something<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:27.220> yeah<00:02:28.220> virgo<00:02:28.700> as<00:02:28.850> his<00:02:29.000> heart

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
or something and yeah virgo as his heart

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.840 
or something and yeah virgo as his heart
and<00:02:29.540> they<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.500> smokers<00:02:30.950> heart<00:02:31.370> there<00:02:31.610> too
