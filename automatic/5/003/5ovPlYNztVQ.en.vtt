00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.270
 they help a lot to save energy and 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.270
 better visibility 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.300
 in case of long trips at night like this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.580

 like additional we also have a 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.660
 clean headlights that is very important 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.740
 when one leaves long trips the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:07.090
 make the account with a ring 18 ok hoops 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.230

 premium line has 45 wide 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.390
 ok 45 centimeters wide that does 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.040
 that the car is definitely more 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.830
 stable in the curves and all 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.990
 definitely eat very well 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.770
 hollows of lime ok 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:30.250
 has as shock absorbers marc person ok 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.210
 comes with abs brakes and ebd that the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.390
 brake system system 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.200
 is the new generation now of the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.380
 wax also brings the folding mirrors 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.260
 they have a very aerodynamic shape apart 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.920

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.430
 directional lights ok we have here the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.890
 smart opening or the smart one that does not 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.110
 we definitely need to take the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.080
 Pocket key automatically with 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.880
 the d with the fingertip we can do 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.270
 the opening of the entrance door 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.040
 although it is somewhat safer I think that 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.170
 same also when we leave we can 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.750
 close it with the fingertip that 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.900
 it's a tremendous good benefit we have 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.330
 the body the body is one 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.050
 it's a monocoque body that 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.750
 definitely makes 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.090
 the car is safer in any 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.270
 kind of any accident type because 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.110
 we also have the theme of the bar not 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.590
 this sidewalk car came out number 1 in 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.350
 The United States awarded it for being the most 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.550
 sure good now we are in the 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.050
 interior of the sidewalk ok 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.970
 as it characterizes a luxury car 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.630
 on the sidewalk unlike other cars 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.660
 premium in question security that is what 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.810
 first that you highlight this car comes 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.050
 with nine airbags ok pilot by pilot 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.860
 of curtain and an extra one on the knee 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.660
 because apart it comes with belts of 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.670
 three points ok 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:17.590
 has with seats all lined with 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:20.560
 leather we have last super ergonomic 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.940
 comes with climate system because 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.540
 at the helm comes with all the audio 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.699
 because it comes with an audio symphony ok from 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.830
 four of five speakers and 400 watts 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:40.450
 because we also have this 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.300
 we also have an ignition or being 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.120
 English because simply by pressing a 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.620
 button turns on the car has a box 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.540
 and extra sequential knickers ok this one 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.150
 it also brings what is the 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.740

 parking button brings the system of 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.050
 anti wear button so the car 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.080
 is an intelligent system that is going to 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.330
 allow a better braking in case of 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.030
 emergency that we have to brake ok 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.080

 travel case when they shine strong 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.410

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.439
 rear of the vehicle 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.819
 much highlighting the issue of security 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:27.419
