00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
mentioned earlier there's a lot of

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.390 
mentioned earlier there's a lot of
grabbing<00:02:01.050> on<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.260> larger<00:02:01.620> enemies<00:02:01.920> fighting

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
grabbing on to larger enemies fighting

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.070 
grabbing on to larger enemies fighting
that<00:02:02.550> way<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:03.120> aiming<00:02:03.450> directly<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:04.050> the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
that way like aiming directly for the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.080 
that way like aiming directly for the
for<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.500> weak<00:02:04.650> points<00:02:05.010> so<00:02:05.520> these<00:02:05.700> large

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
for the weak points so these large

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.660 
for the weak points so these large
battles<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.110> various<00:02:07.650> different<00:02:08.009> types<00:02:08.580> of

monsters<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> monsters<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.929> more

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
monsters and then the monsters are more

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.180 
monsters and then the monsters are more
of<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
of a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.970 
of a
medieval<00:02:11.670> fantasy<00:02:11.850> set<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.110> sets<00:02:13.710> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
medieval fantasy set so that sets that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100
