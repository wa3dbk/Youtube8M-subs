00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 today in digital sing when I had 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.620
 let's talk about dj phantom 2 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.080
 Hello such salt josé luís do not know if 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.420
 digital tv 'and this time again 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.750
 we are out of the studio because we are going to 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.680
 talk about a quadrocopters 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.190
 probably many of you already 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.230
 you know is the dj phantom 2 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.360
 what is the dj phantom 2 basically is 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.220
 this control box that we have here is 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.260
 a very remote helicopter 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.990
 small that has capacity to be able 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.940
 transport a go prof 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.450
 in this case we have a goal pro black 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.090
 which is with which the recording is made 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.559
 and this this coconut picture has been 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.540
 revolutionary in the sense that by 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.870
 first time for a relatively price 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.000
 low you can achieve aerial shots 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.890
 We have already spoken on other occasions and 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.460
 we have shown teams obviously a lot 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.379
 more sophisticated like how the cars 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.870
 cuppers that we show already in some 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.360
 occasion and obviously also more teams 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.400
 sturdy but a team of its costs 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.990
 many thousands of dollars we are talking 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.590
 in most cases above 10 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.850
 15 thousand and obviously that also implies 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.440
 that the acquisition cost is for a 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.390
 very high side and the cost of rent 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.729
 It is also very high because they are more or 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.310
 minus 10 between 10 and 15 thousand dollars 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.840
 stable cupper more obviously cameras 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.390
 remote controls etc. and so on 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.790
 because to her the equation changes from 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.700
 way so radical then 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.220
 and a quadrocopter of this type we 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.710
 lets enter the world of aerial video 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.450
 with an entry price much much 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.100
 minor for projects where 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.440
 obviously there is no budget to 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.300
 hire a professional quadrocopters 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.270
 of these huge ones that can charge the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.750
 better up to a network or an efe 55 once 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.520
 and 700 about 300 etc. what are the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.729
 characteristics of this cupboard picture is 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.410
 a quadrocopter that is designed from 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.090
 a very different way to other stable 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.920
 Personally, this is the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.899
 second that we bought the first 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.659
 quadrocopters that we bought 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.260
 did not have all the technology and the first 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.909
 day we use it, we try to fly it 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.439
 we raise without any problem and in the 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.950
 moment in which we try to descend 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:24.200
 what crashed we tried again 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.260
 do it and it turns out that I was 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.870
 completely unbalanced this and and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.109
 there were many problems and in the third 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.239
 flight was totally destroyed with this no 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.370
 that happens because he has a system 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.790
 completely digitized a system 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.870
 that interacts with gps to fix the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.379
 position of the coastal chart in the air and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.859
 obviously it gives us some stability and 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.200
 position based on this from the gps the 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.480
 basic unit comes with a very support 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.530
 simple to be able to mount our gogh 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.700
 but nevertheless there is a series of 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.639
 good accessories we went 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.930
 adding to the phantom like a kettledrum 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:06.760
 motorized a timbal that allows us 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.950
 and give stability to the camera because 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.239
 obviously the quadrocopters vibrate and in 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.829
 when you are trying 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.810
 stabilize you can go a little bit to 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.219
 side etcetera then if we do not have a 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.120
 timbal that is what happens in the 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.310
 moment in which the quadrocopters 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.049
 stabilizes and inclines us 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.790
 image is going to tilt us while 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.730
 with the jimbal the jimbal is compensating 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.629
 that movement and it's a kettledrum 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.359
 specifically designed for this 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.620
 coastal block and obviously also 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.480
 specifically designed for one to 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.579
 a something of its own then it even has 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.379
 the same entry to connect the 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.419
 go pro directly already comes 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.579
 perfectly balanced etcetera and that 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.340
 obviously simplifies much we all 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.569
 process and it gives us much greater fluidity in 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.939
 you take another of the equipment 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.909
 additional we add is a 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:51.639
 equipment to be able to lower the signal of the 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.500
 block cupper to a monitor in this case 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.730
 what we have here is the control 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.579
 remote this is the remote control 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.290
 phantom 2 standard and we buy by 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.370
 another side this support and this monitor is 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.590
 a 7-inch monitor that has a 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.469
 integrated receiver transmission for 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.180
 to be able to receive the signal that the phantom 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.500
 is sending the equipment that we assemble in 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.560
 the phantom is also from dj 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.660
 is a signal transmitter that is 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.280
 connected directly through the inba 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.829
 to the pro lake so that we can 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.420
 see on the screen exactly what is it 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.910
 who is watching our hit and that 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.680
 way we can frame 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.020
 our takes and obviously achieve a 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.540
 result of better quality another of the 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.720
 things that we add is a module of 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.190
 telemetry that is called goodbye dj or a 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.320
 thing like that is a little box that 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.000
 it also mounts and that what it does is 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.040
 sends us through the module 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.870
 lowering of signal sends us all the 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.210
 information regarding the position 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.450
 the height at which we are flying the 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.280
 gps signal etc. to be able to have 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.780
 all the information directly in 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.400
 our remote control 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.680
 the operation of the coconut box is 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.350
 relatively simple has no greater 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.550
 complexity once we understand that 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.980
 we understand everything we have to do 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.570
 however obviously something that is fine 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.130
 very important that we have to remember 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.290
 is that this is not a toy is a 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.180
 tool that if what if not the 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.720
 work properly can 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.950
 turn into a danger and obviously 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.690
 it represents a lot of risk 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.100
 we have we have now in about 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.350
 days a production and in fact that's why 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.820
 we take out the quadrocopter and 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.410
 we are doing tests with him and everything 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.300
 this because we are going to use it in this 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.550
 production however we always have 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.730
 that take into account the safety of 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.560
 people who are going to be in this production 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.540
 then we have to take a series of 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.270
 measures because although it is small it is 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.770
 compact and is small the propellers 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.470
 they turn at the best to ten thousand revolutions 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.270
 if this rubs on someone at the best of 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.720
 the scenarios causes a cut 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.160
 but you can seriously hurt another 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.650
 of things is that obviously if we are 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.780
 falls in mid-flight and falls on his head 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.600
 to someone, even if it weighs a couple 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.760
 of kilos a couple of kilos to 30 meters of 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.190
 height above someone's head can 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.230
 present and represent a risk 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.220
 then you have to take certain measures 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:12.800
 of prevention to not have any 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.560
 problem and not suffer any accidents nor 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.840
 put at risk the integrity of our 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.370
 client of our talent and so on 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.320
 then, as I was saying, you have to 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.840
 be very careful there is that you have to 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.500
 observe precautions because in the end 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.820
 of the day 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.620
 the equipment although it is very good and everything 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.350
 this has limitations and if we do not 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.790
 we follow the proper processes we 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.060
 can cause problems and for 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.650
 consequently, it may cause us 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.770
 risk we can drop the equipment 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.670
 obviously the equipment can be damaged 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.030
 etcetera in a later video 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.620
 we will talk about the measures of 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.740
 caution to be taken with 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.020
 With respect to 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.660
 to the phantom because there are many stories 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.970
 of terror of people who suddenly are 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.550
 flying in the stable butler and the 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.190
 quadrocopters are going and they do not have 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.220
 way to control it this from 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.440
 Suddenly they run on battery 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.970
 air is to say a series of questions of 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.500
 type of security that we will talk about in a 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.289
 later video but nevertheless 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.319
 definitely and with the care of vido 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:19.449
 the fandom 2 of dj is an excellent 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:20.680
 alternative if you have any questions 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:22.990
 Any comments please visit the 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.729
 page www points and digital dot tv and 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.590
 We will do our best to answer 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:28.030
 your doubts then I say goodbye my name is 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.060
 jose luís thames and see you in the 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:33.449
 next digital cinema dot tv 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.449
 thank you
