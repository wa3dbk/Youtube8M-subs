and click that always do contour and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.100 
and click that always do contour and
just<00:03:05.470> cut<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.500> bundle<00:03:06.980> whenever<00:03:07.460> and<00:03:07.910> go<00:03:08.120> to

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
just cut a bundle whenever and go to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.100 
just cut a bundle whenever and go to
yeah<00:03:09.800> push<00:03:10.390> 50<00:03:12.970> next<00:03:13.970> we're<00:03:14.120> gonna<00:03:14.540> need<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.960> do

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
yeah push 50 next we're gonna need to do

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.680

is

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.950 
is
because<00:03:17.650> when<00:03:17.800> you're<00:03:17.920> printing<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.960> you

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
because when you're printing it you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
that the actual foil is there let's give

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.500 
that the actual foil is there let's give
a<00:03:23.890> look<00:03:24.040> more<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:24.400> um<00:03:24.520> here<00:03:24.760> in<00:03:25.210> my<00:03:25.330> opinion

delete and push ctrl D to deselect and
then<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:06.039> could<00:05:06.190> delete<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.849> layer<00:05:07.090> right

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
then you could delete this layer right

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.659 
then you could delete this layer right
here<00:05:07.539> so<00:05:08.289> when<00:05:08.409> you<00:05:08.500> print<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.889> this<00:05:09.460> right

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
here so when you print it this right

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.790 
here so when you print it this right
here<00:05:09.909> is<00:05:10.030> gonna<00:05:10.150> be<00:05:10.389> Hollow<00:05:10.690> as<00:05:10.900> well<00:05:11.110> on<00:05:11.560> the

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
here is gonna be Hollow as well on the

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.640 
here is gonna be Hollow as well on the
foil<00:05:14.370> see<00:05:15.370> if<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.550> remove<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.440> in<00:05:17.440> the
