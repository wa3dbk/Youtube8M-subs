00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
twice the first time I did I did it I

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.469 
twice the first time I did I did it I
let<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.900> tea<00:01:31.140> cool<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.369> did<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
let the tea cool down and then did it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
let the tea cool down and then did it
and<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> came<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> little

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and it came out a little just a little

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.399 
and it came out a little just a little
bit<00:01:35.729> lighter<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.570> thought<00:01:38.180> yeah<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
bit lighter I thought yeah but if you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
bit lighter I thought yeah but if you
can<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> difference<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.880> when

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
can see the difference so this is when

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.670 
can see the difference so this is when
the<00:01:42.780> tea<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.290> them<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:44.280> cold<00:01:45.149> basically<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the tea was them was cold basically and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.030 
the tea was them was cold basically and
I<00:01:46.799> am<00:01:47.720> put<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> lace<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
I am put the lace in there and I just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.370 
I am put the lace in there and I just
let<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.850> sit<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:52.619> couple<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:53.100> hours<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
let it sit for a couple of hours and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
let it sit for a couple of hours and
that's<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> result<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.880> when

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that's the result and this one was when

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.410 
that's the result and this one was when
it<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.420> them<00:01:57.689> boiling<00:01:58.020> hot<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> you<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.180> see

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
it was them boiling hot so you can see

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.820 
it was them boiling hot so you can see
the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:11.300 
the
Prince<00:02:05.420> did<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.660> one<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.170> well<00:02:10.130> now<00:02:11.130> it's

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
ink line out so it started off printing

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.939 
ink line out so it started off printing
the<00:06:18.830> natural<00:06:19.279> color<00:06:19.460> of<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.879> paper<00:06:20.120> and<00:06:20.479> then

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.269 
the natural color of the paper and then
it<00:06:21.949> ended<00:06:22.219> up<00:06:22.370> like<00:06:22.550> that<00:06:22.759> awful<00:06:23.210> it<00:06:23.300> looks<00:06:23.479> ok
