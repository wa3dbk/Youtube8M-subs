00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
safety features all the way around Hey

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
safety features all the way around Hey
look<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> new<00:01:10.860> aerodynamic<00:01:11.580> styling<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
look at the new aerodynamic styling a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.910 
look at the new aerodynamic styling a
smoother<00:01:12.750> shape<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.530> lower<00:01:13.680> coefficient

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
smoother shape and a lower coefficient

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.149 
smoother shape and a lower coefficient
of<00:01:14.400> drag<00:01:14.630> coefficient<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> drag<00:01:15.920> yeah<00:01:16.920> that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
of drag coefficient of drag yeah that

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
of drag coefficient of drag yeah that
means<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.490> better<00:01:17.670> fuel<00:01:18.000> economy<00:01:18.119> less<00:01:18.600> wind

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
means a better fuel economy less wind

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.380 
means a better fuel economy less wind
noise<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.320> sleek<00:01:19.710> contemporary<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:20.430> Billy

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
something I'm in the advanced class we

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
something I'm in the advanced class we
don't<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.140> homework<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> guess<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> would

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
don't get homework so I guess that would
