that kind of trifecta for straight
success<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.070> far<00:00:14.340> more<00:00:14.580> odd<00:00:14.849> than<00:00:15.299> even<00:00:15.960> the

power window assemblies that we got are

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.030 
power window assemblies that we got are
actually<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.750> new<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> market<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:28.799> use

actually very new to the market they use
GM<00:01:29.970> motors<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.630> GM<00:01:31.320> switches<00:01:31.710> which<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.070> liked

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
GM motors and GM switches which I liked

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.700 
GM motors and GM switches which I liked
a<00:01:32.369> lot<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:33.090> quickly<00:01:33.630> realized<00:01:34.290> once<00:01:34.590> we

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
a lot we quickly realized once we

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
a lot we quickly realized once we
installed<00:01:35.070> them<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.610> bolt<00:01:36.060> pattern<00:01:36.270> was

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
installed them that the bolt pattern was

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.660 
installed them that the bolt pattern was
off<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.979> enough<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
off just a little bit but enough to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.420 
off just a little bit but enough to
really<00:01:38.939> make<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> install<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> problem

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
really make the install a problem

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
really make the install a problem
comparing<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.549> an<00:01:41.670> original<00:01:42.119> showed<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
comparing to an original showed the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780 
comparing to an original showed the
problem<00:01:42.840> fast<00:01:43.140> they're<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> same<00:01:44.640> as

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
problem fast they're not the same as

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.069 
problem fast they're not the same as
these<00:01:44.939> these<00:01:45.060> are<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> lot<00:01:45.420> wider<00:01:45.600> than<00:01:45.750> these

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
these these are a lot wider than these

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.660 
these these are a lot wider than these
oh<00:01:46.320> yeah<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> put<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.640> right

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
oh yeah so if you put it all right

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.730 
oh yeah so if you put it all right
that's<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.299> should<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.500> actually

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that's what it should be and actually

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
that's what it should be and actually
notice<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> arm<00:01:50.549> comes<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.299> thing

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
notice if the arm comes down this thing

actually assembled quite well we decide
to<00:02:27.750> go<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.530> original<00:02:28.920> bracket<00:02:29.340> tree

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
to go with the original bracket tree

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.550 
to go with the original bracket tree
just<00:02:29.940> because<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.299> fits<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> frame<00:02:30.900> usually<00:02:31.110> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
just because it fits the frame usually a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.240 
just because it fits the frame usually a
little<00:02:31.920> bit<00:02:32.100> better<00:02:32.220> than<00:02:32.430> aftermarket<00:02:33.120> stuff

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
little bit better than aftermarket stuff

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.830 
little bit better than aftermarket stuff
but<00:02:35.250> when<00:02:35.459> we<00:02:35.549> went<00:02:35.760> when<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.209> had<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.569> bumper

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
but when we went when we had the bumper

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.360 
but when we went when we had the bumper
fully<00:02:37.080> assembled<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.650> went<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.890> throw<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.250> on

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
fully assembled we went to throw it on

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.020 
fully assembled we went to throw it on
we<00:02:38.610> actually<00:02:38.910> realized<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:41.160> are<00:02:41.640> some

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
we actually realized that there are some

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.150 
we actually realized that there are some
brackets<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.930> mount<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.410> frame<00:02:43.440> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
brackets that mount to the frame that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
brackets that mount to the frame that
are<00:02:44.459> welded<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.090> frame<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.330> aren't

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
are welded to the frame that aren't

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.979 
are welded to the frame that aren't
there<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:47.220> reason<00:02:47.580> probably<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.360> because<00:02:48.599> I

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
there the reason probably is because I

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.809 
there the reason probably is because I
think<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:49.530> might<00:02:49.860> actually<00:02:50.099> have<00:02:50.280> an<00:02:50.459> earlier

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
think we might actually have an earlier

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.390 
think we might actually have an earlier
frame<00:02:51.120> than<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> 64<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.739> don't<00:02:52.799> believe<00:02:53.370> that

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
frame than a 64 and I don't believe that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.830 
frame than a 64 and I don't believe that
on<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> earlier<00:02:54.120> frames<00:02:54.330> they<00:02:54.480> had<00:02:54.660> this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
on the earlier frames they had this

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.170 
on the earlier frames they had this
bracket<00:02:55.319> that<00:02:55.799> doesn't<00:02:56.099> allow<00:02:56.280> us<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.700> bond<00:02:56.880> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
bracket that doesn't allow us to bond to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.819 
bracket that doesn't allow us to bond to
mount<00:02:57.480> our<00:02:57.570> bumper<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:58.200> we<00:02:58.380> just<00:02:58.560> kind<00:02:58.769> of

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
mount our bumper up so we just kind of

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.620 
mount our bumper up so we just kind of
threw<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.519> up<00:02:59.640> there<00:02:59.670> with<00:02:59.880> some<00:03:00.030> zip<00:03:00.239> ties<00:03:00.269> to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
threw it up there with some zip ties to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.360 
threw it up there with some zip ties to
see<00:03:00.780> how<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.019> fit<00:03:01.290> make<00:03:01.709> sure<00:03:01.859> it<00:03:01.920> fit<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.160> body

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
see how it fit make sure it fit the body

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.610 
see how it fit make sure it fit the body
correctly<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.989> then<00:03:04.109> what<00:03:04.230> we'll<00:03:04.380> do<00:03:04.530> is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
correctly and then what we'll do is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.830 
correctly and then what we'll do is
we'll<00:03:04.769> actually<00:03:04.950> Rob<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:06.030> brackets<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.690> we

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
we'll actually Rob the brackets that we

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.420 
we'll actually Rob the brackets that we
have<00:03:06.959> off<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.350> 64<00:03:07.799> on<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:07.920> back<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.340> we

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
different spot and then what we need for

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.210 
different spot and then what we need for
the<00:04:14.670> console<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.840> what<00:04:16.109> we'll<00:04:16.259> do<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:16.620> we'll

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
the console so what we'll do is we'll

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.789 
the console so what we'll do is we'll
just<00:04:17.600> relocate<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:19.139> shifter<00:04:19.530> into<00:04:19.709> the

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
just relocate the shifter into the

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.469 
just relocate the shifter into the

correct position the stock position and

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.420 
correct position the stock position and
then<00:04:22.079> if<00:04:22.199> anything's<00:04:22.620> left<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.070> original

then if anything's left of the original

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.040 
then if anything's left of the original
hole<00:04:23.580> we'll<00:04:23.910> just<00:04:24.120> weld<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.479> tight<00:04:26.960> we're<00:04:27.960> at
