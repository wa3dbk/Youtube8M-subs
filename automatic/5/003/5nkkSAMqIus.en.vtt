00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.630
 hello here is christian again this time 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.300
 I would like to show a possibility how 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.860
 you play a plectrum accompaniment 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.970
 can 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.610
 this accompaniment is particularly suitable 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:25.739
 for slower songs of my opinion 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.739
 I'll just play it before 1234 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.129
 that's all a matter of her 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.100
 have noticed that I am with the left 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:06.140
 I often put that thumb on my thumb 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.270
 that's important to chord with 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.780
 only five pages off the sixth page 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.200
 to stop 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.659
 so for example a c major chord 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.759
 it is almost impossible this page is not 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.619
 to strike with the sixth but me 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.399
 I would like to hear for five pages 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.799
 So finally one with the thumb off 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.149
 report page lightly and then she is 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.460
 just can not hear anymore 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.539
 That's why I sometimes do that 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.600
 thumb up here but now to 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:39.289
 actual stroke rhythm is going 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.119
 So I count in 16 times the whole 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:46.659
 then you can do that best 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.659
 retrace one and two and three 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.640
 I notice commute all the time 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.720
 teach 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.880
 this is important so that it sounds easy 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.380
 and I do not 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.099
 so they do not care if the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.700
 right hand has a break or one 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.130
 attack 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.019
 I do the movement all the time 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.530
 I kept on changing instead of rhythm 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.530
 it again before 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.010
 it looks best in the notes 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.379
 normal there I also stop 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.959
 symbols are drawn then you can do it 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.310
 best understand 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:58.340
 I feel it again with the example 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.340
 chords g major minor cdu 34 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.530
 yes, then I would like you a lot of fun 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.370
 try out 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.370
 Until next time
