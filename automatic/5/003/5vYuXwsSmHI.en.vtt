00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.560
 hello you love the first thing I take 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.630
 is already aware of him asking for concealer 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.950
 in the color n like 25 and distribute with 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.270
 once on the moving and 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.920
 immovable is so on the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.570
 complete song then I take from me 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.699
 the maybelline news palette this 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.779
 brightest sound and distribute it to me like that 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.100
 under the eyebrow 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.169
 then we come to these already 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.360
 give matte brown tone and look in 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.309
 The lid fold of the serves because that 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.170
 simply the transition much softer later 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.910
 is and that the whole thing is not that hard 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.320
 looks then we just take tesa 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.790
 strip is no matter mosque 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.440
 assume that does not stick quite so 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.230
 brutal and take from maybelline these 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.930
 color tattoo 24 hours a studio 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.070
 things in the color 40 permanent top 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.420
 and I must say I like that 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.360
 really very good keeps the whole 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.039
 day and it really has a lot too 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.680
 very nice color I give with one 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.309
 brush all the way back to the v 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.809
 I wear this and so neat 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.789
 you do not have to do that because we do 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.119
 take the same from the maily palette 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.740
 this gray macket and give that 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.110
 again so over it with its flat 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.610
 Brush it all over again 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.970
 is solidified and me back and forth 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.970
 slips 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.500
 if we matt these two brown ones 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.260
 tones from the news palette and distribute 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.640
 us had once I crease 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.409
 made me luck lately and 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.450
 thought come I take the palette 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.190
 and was really very satisfied I like 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.650
 The palette is very happy to be the colors 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.259
 Great and very suitable for everyday use 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.110
 just totally make-up tutorials with it 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.250
 make-up and you can soja him so 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.020
 In the evening, he puts on suitable things 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 I just do it now then 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.800
 I take the cut rießle good unfortunately in 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.990
 the color 0 10 dating stays that way and 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.310
 I still draw my dear all one 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.330
 I'm the same as you are 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.890
 but of course you can do it too 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.990
 omit and take away at any 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.729
 kajal and let 's just give it to the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.100
 upper waterline so that the lash line 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.700
 still a little bit there on you acts as 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.440
 he is 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.700
 then I take that absolutely 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.869
 mascara and gives me the first layer 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.120
 up and then I take me already 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.060
 my indirectly about in color 250 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.019
 media and then once these perfect 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.260
 match in the color golden beach exactly 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.000
 and that is really really good that is 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.799
 just a bit too bright so I would have to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.350
 get me even darker and then 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.450
 I take this colossal mascara 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.150
 from maybelline and again my 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.829
 concealer and yes mister scholl we ask 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.329
 so a little my make up so the 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.010
 Concealer by noticeably starving 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.450
 and you have to get it really fast 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.880
 I currently have blinded again 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.170
 changed a memory card and then 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.360
 That was very hard and was very 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 hard to blind so immediately on 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.049
 make the best then I take that 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.000
 huder browser of benefit and 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.329
 compete my cheekbones mine 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.040
 child my nose my lips and mine 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.660
 almost disturb my whole 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.660
 face and yes 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.030
 then I'll take my ink 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.040
 from eloro you can do any 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.739
 take any concealer pen and 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.540
 give me that again under the 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.340
 contour on because I'm a little bit so yes 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.959
 I did not really hit it 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.920
 find the brush from the huder bronze 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.560
 a bit too soft 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.290
 then from Bernau the camp in the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.810
 color banana and mps from merck and 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.099
 mix the whole l the two and have 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.110
 me a bit my concealer like that 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.510
 He really keeps it all day and 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.220
 consider the folds and that's how it looks 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.560
 in the evening almost exactly as if 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.239
 I gave them all the morning in the early 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.099
 sluggish 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.810
 and yes, I'm going to band it all over again 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.579
 where I have set a highlight 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.340
 even under the contour again and then 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.049
 I take the movie i dig from maybelline 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.569
 I really like and compete 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.400
 my nose my mine again 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.099
 lips over the lip too 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.780
 right there and lower lip and the whole thing 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.849
 I associate with such a small brush 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.510
 that was from zuewa the concealer bach 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.989
 and i can absolutely be yours as hastings 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.989
 there 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.780
 because the culture on the nose 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.250
 it was still a bit too blatant 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.520
 browser and bronson somebody 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.440
 little bit my face at least that 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.590
 camera but I'll take me like that 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.510
 teaching sound so that's what of adecco 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.640
 really a really nice and beautiful 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.640
 I wear this on my cheeks 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.050
 only very light and discreet and therefore that 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.760
 whole a bit fresh then looks 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.560
 I take my fake mary lungs 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.820
 quieter of trees so that's really 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.890
 not the real one i have that with many 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.690
 has compared real and my so 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.010
 somehow bought somewhere wrong 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.590
 but I still like him and give it to me 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.920

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.900
 and on the lips arch resp 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.210

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.400

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.140

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.850
 I 'm still doing the lower eyelashes 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.950
 I really enjoy doing that 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.020
 I love this rocket valium for it 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.060
 mascara i really like those for above 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.420

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.680
 I like to wear and I wear it once 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.370
