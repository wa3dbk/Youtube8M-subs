00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
640 by 480 I can tell you right off the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
640 by 480 I can tell you right off the
bat<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> runs<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:13.920> 60<00:01:14.220> frames<00:01:14.400> per<00:01:14.820> second

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
bat that it runs at 60 frames per second

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.399 
bat that it runs at 60 frames per second
but<00:01:15.950> let's<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.310> move<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.409> 720

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
but let's see if we move that up to 720

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.460 
but let's see if we move that up to 720
first<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.790> well<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.470> 720p

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
first and well now we're back to 720p

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.580 
first and well now we're back to 720p
and<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.070> looks<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.790> much<00:01:24.119> better<00:01:24.590> we're

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and it looks much much better we're

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.100 
and it looks much much better we're
gonna<00:01:25.680> keep<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.479> window<00:01:27.479> box<00:01:27.750> we're<00:01:28.020> gonna

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
gonna keep the window box we're gonna

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.130 
gonna keep the window box we're gonna
keep<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.650> settings<00:01:29.070> low<00:01:29.250> though<00:01:30.140> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
keep all the settings low though and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.880 
keep all the settings low though and
we're<00:01:31.380> gonna<00:01:31.470> play<00:01:31.770> some<00:01:32.030> single-player<00:01:33.890> some

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
we're gonna play some single-player some

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.969 
we're gonna play some single-player some
training<00:01:35.400> first<00:01:35.729> though<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.710> can<00:01:37.710> tell<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
training first though I can tell you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.950 
training first though I can tell you
right<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> bat<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.850> controls<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.750> kind

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
right off the bat that controls are kind

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
right off the bat that controls are kind
of<00:01:40.020> awkward<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.619> had<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.890> change<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> where

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
of awkward so I had to change it where

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
of awkward so I had to change it where
the<00:01:42.030> light<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.360> Texas<00:01:42.720> jakey<00:01:43.200> medium<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> K

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the light of Texas jakey medium is K

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.910 
the light of Texas jakey medium is K
heavy<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.509> L<00:01:45.720> power<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:47.600> semicolon<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.920> still

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
heavy as L power is semicolon I still

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.679 
heavy as L power is semicolon I still
kept<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> other<00:01:50.670> moves<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> same<00:01:51.450> though

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
kept all the other moves the same though

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.429 
kept all the other moves the same though
so<00:01:53.210> some<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> keys<00:01:54.570> shown<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.259> not

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
so some of the keys shown are not

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.789 
so some of the keys shown are not
exactly<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.040> I'll<00:01:56.130> press<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:58.409> frame<00:01:58.649> rate

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
exactly what I'll press the frame rate

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.530 
exactly what I'll press the frame rate
right<00:01:59.009> now<00:01:59.189> even<00:01:59.490> at<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> lowest<00:02:00.030> settings<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
right now even at the lowest settings is

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.120 
right now even at the lowest settings is
in<00:02:00.960> fact<00:02:01.290> 30<00:02:01.770> frames<00:02:02.310> per<00:02:02.460> second

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
in fact 30 frames per second

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.330 
in fact 30 frames per second
unfortunately

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 

which<00:02:08.880> may<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.119> immediately<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:10.020> apparent

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.820 

the<00:02:26.489> speed<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:27.000> about<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.360> same<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.110> it's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
the speed is about the same so it's it's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.589 
the speed is about the same so it's it's
not<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.160> Japanese<00:02:29.730> port<00:02:30.120> where<00:02:30.330> the

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
not like a Japanese port where the

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.290 
not like a Japanese port where the
action<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.500> slower<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.190> compensate<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.180> the

much<00:02:36.360> choppier<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:40.019> does<00:02:40.200> look<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.680> hell<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
much choppier it does look a hell of a
