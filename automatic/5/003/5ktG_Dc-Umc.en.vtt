00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:05.149 
all right well I've got another little

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.580 
all right well I've got another little
series<00:00:05.420> of<00:00:05.480> videos<00:00:05.779> here<00:00:06.370> on<00:00:07.370> my<00:00:08.149> 77<00:00:08.840> Chevy<00:00:09.080> c10

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
series of videos here on my 77 Chevy c10

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.890 
series of videos here on my 77 Chevy c10
project<00:00:10.150> and<00:00:11.150> I've<00:00:11.240> got<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.480> cylinder<00:00:11.780> head

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
project and I've got the cylinder head

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.400 
project and I've got the cylinder head
off<00:00:11.930> here<00:00:12.260> this<00:00:13.010> is<00:00:13.070> a<00:00:13.900> my<00:00:14.900> truck

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
off here this is a my truck

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.090 
off here this is a my truck
this<00:00:16.219> is<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.430> 250<00:00:16.970> inline<00:00:17.840> 6<00:00:18.199> and<00:00:18.949> you're

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
this is the 250 inline 6 and you're

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.200 
this is the 250 inline 6 and you're
looking<00:00:19.340> here<00:00:19.460> at<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.610> back<00:00:19.790> this<00:00:20.000> is<00:00:20.120> the

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
looking here at the back this is the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.960 
looking here at the back this is the
number<00:00:20.450> 6<00:00:20.690> cylinder<00:00:21.110> and<00:00:21.700> basically<00:00:22.700> what<00:00:22.880> the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
number 6 cylinder and basically what the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.910 
number 6 cylinder and basically what the
problem<00:00:23.330> was<00:00:23.540> as<00:00:23.810> I<00:00:24.230> had<00:00:24.440> some<00:00:24.590> smoke<00:00:24.890> coming

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
problem was as I had some smoke coming

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.790 
problem was as I had some smoke coming
out<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.400> tailpipe<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:26.350> it<00:00:27.350> looked<00:00:27.710> like

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
out of the tailpipe and it looked like

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.440 
out of the tailpipe and it looked like
white<00:00:28.130> smoke<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:28.670> I<00:00:28.700> just<00:00:28.910> assume<00:00:29.210> that<00:00:29.330> the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
white smoke so I just assume that the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.650 
white smoke so I just assume that the
head<00:00:29.600> gasket<00:00:30.080> was<00:00:30.710> bad<00:00:31.300> but<00:00:32.300> it<00:00:32.360> was<00:00:32.480> hard<00:00:32.629> to

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
head gasket was bad but it was hard to

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.200 
head gasket was bad but it was hard to
tell<00:00:32.840> if<00:00:32.930> it<00:00:33.050> was<00:00:33.170> white<00:00:33.320> or<00:00:33.350> if<00:00:33.649> it<00:00:33.739> was<00:00:33.829> blue

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
tell if it was white or if it was blue

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.100 
tell if it was white or if it was blue
so<00:00:35.530> it<00:00:36.530> was<00:00:36.680> either<00:00:36.860> oil<00:00:37.870> getting<00:00:38.870> into<00:00:39.020> the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
so it was either oil getting into the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.229 
so it was either oil getting into the
cylinder<00:00:39.440> or<00:00:39.590> it<00:00:39.739> was<00:00:39.860> water<00:00:40.130> so<00:00:40.880> nonetheless

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
cylinder or it was water so nonetheless

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.240 
cylinder or it was water so nonetheless
I<00:00:41.450> had<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:41.780> take<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.020> cylinder<00:00:42.260> head<00:00:42.470> off<00:00:42.500> and

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
I had to take the cylinder head off and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.060 
I had to take the cylinder head off and
so<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:44.120> checked<00:00:44.690> my<00:00:44.750> head<00:00:45.380> gasket<00:00:45.829> there<00:00:45.950> was

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
so I checked my head gasket there was

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.260 
so I checked my head gasket there was
nothing<00:00:46.370> really<00:00:46.489> wrong<00:00:46.790> with<00:00:46.940> it

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
nothing really wrong with it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.750 
nothing really wrong with it
and<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.290> now<00:00:48.440> I'm<00:00:48.559> checking<00:00:51.220> my<00:00:52.220> valve<00:00:52.460> seals

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
and so now I'm checking my valve seals

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.819 
and so now I'm checking my valve seals
so<00:00:55.090> so<00:00:56.090> I'll<00:00:56.180> get<00:00:56.300> in<00:00:56.390> here<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:56.829> we'll

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
so so I'll get in here and we'll

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.920 
so so I'll get in here and we'll
compress<00:00:58.130> these<00:00:58.280> springs<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.940> we'll<00:00:59.840> get

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
compress these springs and we'll get

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.619 
compress these springs and we'll get
these<00:01:00.079> valve<00:01:00.320> seals<00:01:00.670> pulled<00:01:01.670> out<00:01:01.760> of<00:01:01.790> here<00:01:02.000> so

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
these valve seals pulled out of here so

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.119 
these valve seals pulled out of here so
I<00:01:02.660> went<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.079> auto<00:01:03.530> parts<00:01:03.829> store<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.040> I

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
I went to the auto parts store and I

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.350 
I went to the auto parts store and I
rented<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.699> little<00:01:04.909> valve<00:01:05.089> spring

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
rented the little valve spring

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.609 
rented the little valve spring
compressor<00:01:05.390> tool<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.049> really<00:01:06.290> don't<00:01:06.380> like

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
compressor tool and I really don't like

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.889 
compressor tool and I really don't like
this<00:01:07.459> style<00:01:07.700> of<00:01:07.850> valve<00:01:08.060> spring<00:01:08.389> compressor<00:01:08.420> I

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
this style of valve spring compressor I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.039 
this style of valve spring compressor I
think<00:01:09.200> they're<00:01:09.319> kind<00:01:09.469> of<00:01:09.530> dangerous<00:01:11.049> but

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
think they're kind of dangerous but

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.499 
think they're kind of dangerous but
they're<00:01:12.350> real<00:01:12.499> simple<00:01:13.479> it<00:01:14.479> just<00:01:14.509> fit<00:01:16.389> over<00:01:17.389> the

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
they're real simple it just fit over the

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.730 
they're real simple it just fit over the
valve<00:01:17.689> with<00:01:17.869> two<00:01:17.990> little<00:01:18.200> teeth<00:01:18.380> here<00:01:18.590> on<00:01:18.679> the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
valve with two little teeth here on the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.029 
valve with two little teeth here on the
bottom<00:01:19.840> just<00:01:20.840> grab<00:01:21.079> a<00:01:21.229> couple<00:01:21.499> of<00:01:21.619> wrongs<00:01:21.829> of

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
bottom just grab a couple of wrongs of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.389 
bottom just grab a couple of wrongs of
the<00:01:22.069> spring<00:01:22.749> and<00:01:23.749> what<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:23.929> like<00:01:24.109> to<00:01:24.139> do<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:24.560> get

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
the spring and what I like to do is get

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.719 
the spring and what I like to do is get
it<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.609> where<00:01:25.729> it's<00:01:25.880> snug<00:01:26.770> on<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.009> retaining

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
it to where it's snug on the retaining

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.330 
it to where it's snug on the retaining
cap<00:01:29.060> there<00:01:31.479> get<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:32.569> to<00:01:32.659> where<00:01:32.779> it's<00:01:32.899> snug<00:01:33.340> I'm

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
cap there get it to where it's snug I'm

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.999 
cap there get it to where it's snug I'm
going<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.609> take<00:01:34.819> a<00:01:35.179> zip<00:01:36.109> tie<00:01:36.349> and<00:01:37.359> I'll<00:01:38.359> wrap<00:01:38.539> it

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
going to take a zip tie and I'll wrap it

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.190 
going to take a zip tie and I'll wrap it
around<00:01:40.009> here<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:41.509> reason<00:01:41.719> I<00:01:41.899> don't<00:01:42.049> like

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
around here the reason I don't like

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.440 
around here the reason I don't like
these<00:01:42.759> types<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:44.170> spring<00:01:45.170> compressors<00:01:45.679> is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
these types of spring compressors is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.659 
these types of spring compressors is
they<00:01:47.450> tend<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.749> pop<00:01:48.229> loose<00:01:48.529> right<00:01:49.159> down<00:01:49.369> here

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:49.669 
they tend to pop loose right down here

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:54.539 
they tend to pop loose right down here
so<00:01:50.329> that's<00:01:50.479> why<00:01:50.569> I<00:01:50.599> put<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:52.539> zip<00:01:53.539> tie<00:01:53.719> on<00:01:53.899> there

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
so that's why I put the zip tie on there

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.440 
so that's why I put the zip tie on there
to<00:01:55.549> help<00:01:55.669> hold<00:01:55.939> all<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:57.560> into<00:01:57.770> place<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.450> come

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
to help hold all that into place so come

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.300 
to help hold all that into place so come
in<00:01:59.599> here<00:01:59.859> find<00:02:00.859> my<00:02:01.069> ratchet

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.780 

stick<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> ratchet<00:02:05.760> on<00:02:05.850> top<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:08.610> just

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
stick the ratchet on top and we just

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.240 
stick the ratchet on top and we just
start<00:02:09.030> squeezing<00:02:09.780> these<00:02:10.080> Springs<00:02:10.440> down<00:02:13.250> I'll

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
start squeezing these Springs down I'll

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.710 
start squeezing these Springs down I'll
show<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.550> did<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> leak<00:02:14.970> down<00:02:15.180> test<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.630> this

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
show you I did a leak down test on this

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.030 
show you I did a leak down test on this
engine<00:02:15.930> too<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.670> every<00:02:17.670> single<00:02:17.850> cylinder<00:02:19.040> on

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
engine too and every single cylinder on

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.340

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
chugga and what I'm doing now I'm using

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.199 
chugga and what I'm doing now I'm using
my<00:02:33.300> little<00:02:33.860> homemade<00:02:34.860> leak<00:02:35.400> down<00:02:35.610> tester<00:02:35.640> this

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
my little homemade leak down tester this

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.449 
my little homemade leak down tester this
was<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.500> compression<00:02:37.500> tester<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.070> still<00:02:38.280> is

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
was a compression tester and still is

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.310 
was a compression tester and still is
it's<00:02:38.730> convertible<00:02:40.430> into<00:02:41.430> either<00:02:41.610> or<00:02:42.200> but<00:02:43.200> I'm

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
it's convertible into either or but I'm

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.070 
it's convertible into either or but I'm
using<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:45.120> check<00:02:45.480> my<00:02:45.600> valves<00:02:45.959> now

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
using this to see to check my valves now

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.320 
using this to see to check my valves now
I<00:02:46.110> don't<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.459> cylinder<00:02:48.000> top

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
I don't know if I have this cylinder top

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.090 
I don't know if I have this cylinder top
dead<00:02:48.510> center<00:02:48.810> but<00:02:48.930> what<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.200> know<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.620> my

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
dead center but what I do know is my

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.800 
dead center but what I do know is my
valves<00:02:50.430> are<00:02:50.520> closed<00:02:50.760> I've<00:02:50.970> completely<00:02:51.330> loosen

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
valves are closed I've completely loosen

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.670 
valves are closed I've completely loosen
them<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:52.760> intake<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.660> exhaust<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.590> know

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
them up intake and the exhaust so I know

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.770 
them up intake and the exhaust so I know
those<00:02:55.920> are<00:02:56.100> closed<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.459> let<00:02:56.610> me<00:02:56.670> go<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.030> got<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
those are closed so let me go I got the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.229 
those are closed so let me go I got the
compressor<00:02:58.050> turned<00:02:58.470> off<00:02:58.790> but<00:02:59.790> let<00:02:59.940> me<00:03:00.000> put<00:03:00.209> a

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
compressor turned off but let me put a

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.729 
compressor turned off but let me put a
little<00:03:00.420> bit<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> pressure<00:03:01.230> into<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.620> and

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
little bit of the pressure into it and

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:11.080 
little bit of the pressure into it and
I'm<00:03:01.800> only<00:03:01.920> using<00:03:02.040> about<00:03:02.370> 30<00:03:02.730> psi

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.540 

so<00:03:11.660> we'll<00:03:11.780> come<00:03:11.930> over<00:03:12.050> here<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:13.099> can<00:03:13.250> hear<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
so we'll come over here you can hear the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.890 
so we'll come over here you can hear the
air<00:03:13.700> leakin<00:03:14.260> now<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.319> found<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.920> have<00:03:16.160> an

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
air leakin now I found that I have an

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
air leakin now I found that I have an
air<00:03:17.900> leak<00:03:18.080> coming<00:03:18.470> out<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.450> number<00:03:20.450> one

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
air leak coming out of the number one

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.570 
air leak coming out of the number one
intake<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:22.220> intake<00:03:23.209> valve<00:03:24.400> I'll<00:03:25.400> come<00:03:25.550> over

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
intake of intake valve I'll come over

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.290 
intake of intake valve I'll come over
here<00:03:25.790> I'll<00:03:26.000> get<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.209> dipstick<00:03:26.569> pulled<00:03:26.840> out

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
here I'll get the dipstick pulled out

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.300 
here I'll get the dipstick pulled out
I've<00:03:29.300> also<00:03:29.480> got<00:03:29.750> air<00:03:29.989> bleeding<00:03:30.920> down<00:03:31.069> through

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
I've also got air bleeding down through

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.610 
I've also got air bleeding down through
the<00:03:31.400> Rings
