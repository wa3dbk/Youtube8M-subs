00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.510 

for<00:00:15.150> an<00:00:15.240> environmentalist<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.560> that's<00:00:17.340> what

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
for an environmentalist and that's what

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.400 
for an environmentalist and that's what
we<00:00:17.700> are<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.450> biggest<00:00:18.840> thing<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.050> ever

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410

year the weed pressure and we take that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.450 
year the weed pressure and we take that
information<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.630> wintertime<00:00:51.870> we'll

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460

with<00:00:59.879> these<00:01:00.059> issues<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.590> every

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
with these issues we have you know every

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.219 
with these issues we have you know every
field<00:01:02.160> every<00:01:02.550> year<00:01:02.850> has<00:01:03.030> somewhat<00:01:03.840> different

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
field every year has somewhat different

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.859 
field every year has somewhat different
issues<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.309> know<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.489> includes<00:01:06.149> fertility

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
issues you know that includes fertility

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.850 
issues you know that includes fertility
and<00:01:08.030> everything<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.180> goes<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.860 

one<00:01:15.460> of<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.730> things<00:01:15.970> I<00:01:16.120> think<00:01:16.180> I<00:01:16.510> want<00:01:16.720> to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
one of the things I think I want to

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.990 
one of the things I think I want to
emphasize<00:01:17.320> with<00:01:17.710> GMOs<00:01:18.280> there's<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.610> couple

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
emphasize with GMOs there's a couple

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.500 
emphasize with GMOs there's a couple
things<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:21.040> a<00:01:21.100> farm<00:01:21.730> level<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.360> we've

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
things that on a farm level that we've

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.870 
things that on a farm level that we've
seen<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.080> think<00:01:23.470> most<00:01:24.340> people<00:01:24.700> don't

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
seen that I think most people don't

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.060 
seen that I think most people don't
understand<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.780> don't<00:01:26.020> realize<00:01:26.560> some<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:26.980> the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
understand and don't realize some of the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.900 
understand and don't realize some of the
they're<00:01:27.520> huge<00:01:28.120> positives<00:01:28.780> for<00:01:29.770> us<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:30.700> live

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
they're huge positives for us that live

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.120 
they're huge positives for us that live
out<00:01:31.120> here<00:01:31.570> in<00:01:31.690> this<00:01:32.380> area<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:34.560> basically<00:01:35.560> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
out here in this area is basically the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.310 
out here in this area is basically the
GMOs<00:01:36.730> what<00:01:37.060> they've<00:01:37.300> done<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.020> field

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
GMOs what they've done in this field

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.970 
GMOs what they've done in this field
here<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.710> perfect<00:01:39.100> example<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:41.110> field<00:01:41.680> has

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
here is a perfect example this field has

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.510 
here is a perfect example this field has
went<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:43.600> years<00:01:44.050> with<00:01:44.410> no<00:01:44.520> insecticide

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
went for years with no insecticide

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.800 
went for years with no insecticide
applied<00:01:46.030> at<00:01:46.330> all<00:01:46.500> we've<00:01:47.500> used<00:01:47.910> GMOs<00:01:48.910> to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
applied at all we've used GMOs to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.750 
applied at all we've used GMOs to
control<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:51.210> insect<00:01:52.210> pressures<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:53.380> we

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
control the insect pressures that we

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.410 
control the insect pressures that we
determined<00:01:54.760> that<00:01:54.790> we<00:01:54.940> were<00:01:55.000> going<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.240> have

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
determined that we were going to have

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.340 
determined that we were going to have
from<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.810> year<00:01:55.930> before

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
from the year before

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.340 
from the year before
and<00:01:56.770> it's<00:01:56.950> been<00:01:57.270> totally<00:01:58.270> successful

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
and it's been totally successful

and it's been totally successful
in<00:02:00.640> truth<00:02:01.640> that's<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:03.229> know<00:02:03.350> because

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
in truth that's right you know because

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.910 
in truth that's right you know because

eats<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.100> piece<00:02:37.280> eat<00:02:37.640> some<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.030> green

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
eats a piece eat some of that green

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.310 
eats a piece eat some of that green
tissue<00:02:38.660> basically<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:40.160> protein<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:42.020> the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
tissue basically that protein that the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.310 
tissue basically that protein that the
plant<00:02:42.620> is<00:02:42.770> producing<00:02:43.630> paralyzes<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.900> insects

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
plant is producing paralyzes the insects

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.199 
plant is producing paralyzes the insects
gut

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
gut

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.000 
gut
so<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.239> mean<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.570> know<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.320> way<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:48.860> an

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
so I mean you know in a way it's an

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.630 
so I mean you know in a way it's an
insecticide<00:02:49.810> because<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.959> kills<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.470> insect

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
insecticide because it kills the insect

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.590 
insecticide because it kills the insect
but<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.390> protein<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:55.160> like<00:02:55.489> when<00:02:55.790> cattle

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
but it's a protein so like when cattle

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.380 
but it's a protein so like when cattle
either<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.170> weed<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:59.000> know<00:02:59.120> wheat

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
either to weed it it's you know wheat

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.509 
either to weed it it's you know wheat
proteins<00:02:59.989> from<00:03:00.230> every<00:03:00.500> source<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:01.280> know<00:03:01.400> what

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
proteins from every source you know what

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.270 
proteins from every source you know what
I<00:03:01.550> mean<00:03:01.730> it's<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.540> not<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.750> poison<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:04.190> know

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
I mean it's it's not a poison you know

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.310 
I mean it's it's not a poison you know
what<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> mean<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.120> an<00:03:05.269> insecticide<00:03:05.989> to

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
what I mean but it is an insecticide to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.660 
what I mean but it is an insecticide to
that<00:03:06.820> target<00:03:08.049> insect

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.410 

I<00:03:12.790> don't<00:03:13.569> know<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> farmer

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
I don't know a farmer

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.960 
I don't know a farmer
answer<00:03:14.690> that's<00:03:14.870> not<00:03:15.160> environmentalists<00:03:16.160> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
answer that's not environmentalists the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.240 
answer that's not environmentalists the
problem<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.690> farmers<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.620> ranchers<00:03:18.739> don't

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
problem is farmers and ranchers don't

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.420 
problem is farmers and ranchers don't
have<00:03:19.489> time<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.000> be<00:03:20.120> activists<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.470> we're<00:03:22.190> out

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
have time to be activists so we're out

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.750 
have time to be activists so we're out
here<00:03:22.670> we<00:03:22.819> don't<00:03:23.000> have<00:03:23.180> time<00:03:23.780> or<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.680> energy<00:03:24.830> or

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
here we don't have time or the energy or

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.500 
here we don't have time or the energy or
the<00:03:25.819> money<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:27.290> tell<00:03:28.280> our<00:03:28.489> story<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.390> know

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
the money to tell our story you know

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.990 
the money to tell our story you know
what<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.690> mean<00:03:29.900> what<00:03:30.170> what<00:03:31.069> is<00:03:31.310> actually<00:03:31.880> you

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
what I mean what what is actually you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.690 
what I mean what what is actually you
know<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.180> talk<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.700> activists

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
know to talk to the to the activists

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.280 
know to talk to the to the activists
which<00:03:34.940> are<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.180> ones<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.600> are<00:03:35.750> are

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
which are the ones that are are

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.030 
which are the ones that are are
screaming<00:03:36.770> that<00:03:37.100> were<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:39.230> know<00:03:39.290> doing<00:03:39.620> harm

screaming that were you know doing harm

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.190 
screaming that were you know doing harm
to<00:03:40.910> society<00:03:41.530> when<00:03:42.530> they<00:03:43.180> don't<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.390> time<00:03:44.750> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
to society when they don't have time the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.990 
to society when they don't have time the
activists<00:03:45.800> don't<00:03:45.980> have<00:03:46.190> time<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.700> come<00:03:46.850> out

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
activists don't have time to come out

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.059 
activists don't have time to come out
here<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.360> look<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:47.900> see<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.440> get<00:03:48.800> on<00:03:48.950> our

hands and knees in these cornfields and
see<00:03:52.100> exactly<00:03:52.489> what's<00:03:52.850> going<00:03:52.910> on<00:03:53.299> you<00:03:53.930> know<00:03:54.110> as

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
see exactly what's going on you know as

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.400 
see exactly what's going on you know as
if<00:03:54.680> we're<00:03:55.069> if<00:03:55.819> we're<00:03:56.120> increasing<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.959> micro

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
if we're if we're increasing the micro

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.090 
if we're if we're increasing the micro
population<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.970> soil<00:03:59.269> if<00:03:59.510> we're<00:03:59.720> increasing

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
population in a soil if we're increasing

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.400 
population in a soil if we're increasing
the<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:03.290> know<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:04.840> earthworms<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.290> know

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
the you know the earthworms you know

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.720 
the you know the earthworms you know
that's<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.890> big<00:04:07.069> one<00:04:07.280> that's<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.700> one

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
that's the big one that's the one

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.120 
that's the big one that's the one
everybody<00:04:08.269> can<00:04:08.480> see<00:04:08.720> but<00:04:08.959> there's<00:04:09.200> thousands

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
everybody can see but there's thousands

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.940 
everybody can see but there's thousands
of<00:04:10.220> thousands<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:10.910> microbes<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:12.650> soil

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
of thousands of microbes in this soil

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.360 
of thousands of microbes in this soil
that<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.519> are<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:15.560> know<00:04:15.680> that's<00:04:15.920> what<00:04:16.130> making

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
that we are you know that's what making

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.970 
that we are you know that's what making
us<00:04:16.609> making<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.150> healthy<00:04:17.510> soil

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.690 

yeah<00:04:23.580> organic<00:04:24.830> agriculture<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:26.450> basically

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
yeah organic agriculture is basically

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.610 
yeah organic agriculture is basically
you've<00:04:29.700> we've<00:04:30.360> looked<00:04:30.630> into<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.200> you've<00:04:31.410> got

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
you've we've looked into it you've got

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.540 
you've we've looked into it you've got
to<00:04:31.890> go<00:04:33.170> I'm<00:04:34.170> not<00:04:34.470> real<00:04:34.680> sure<00:04:34.710> three<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.340> four

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
to go I'm not real sure three to four

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.000 
to go I'm not real sure three to four
years<00:04:35.970> without<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.600> use<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.290> pesticide<00:04:37.980> or

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
years without the use of a pesticide or

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.680 
years without the use of a pesticide or
even<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.910> herbicide<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.980> and<00:04:41.300> then<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.450> get

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
even a herbicide and and then you get

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.590 
even a herbicide and and then you get
certified<00:04:43.350> organic<00:04:43.770> all<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.730> research<00:04:45.300> and

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
certified organic all the research and

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.270 
certified organic all the research and
there's<00:04:45.810> been<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> lot<00:04:46.350> of<00:04:46.380> research<00:04:46.920> done

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
there's been a lot of research done

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.700 
there's been a lot of research done
you're<00:04:47.580> gonna<00:04:47.790> get<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.090> yield<00:04:48.450> drag<00:04:48.780> pretty

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
you're gonna get a yield drag pretty

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.060 
you're gonna get a yield drag pretty
much<00:04:49.920> thirty<00:04:50.250> five<00:04:50.490> percent<00:04:51.140> so<00:04:52.140> if<00:04:52.740> this

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
much thirty five percent so if this

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.330 
much thirty five percent so if this
field<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:54.120> know<00:04:54.240> our<00:04:54.390> average<00:04:54.660> normal<00:04:55.620> yields

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
field you know our average normal yields

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.510 
field you know our average normal yields
say<00:04:57.260> three-year<00:04:58.260> average<00:04:58.470> yield<00:04:58.950> is<00:04:59.160> probably

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
say three-year average yield is probably

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.400 
say three-year average yield is probably
just<00:04:59.730> a<00:04:59.880> freckle<00:05:00.270> under<00:05:00.510> two<00:05:00.690> hundred<00:05:00.810> bushel

anything had hurt us but but we were

anything had hurt us but but we were
basically<00:06:20.480> poison<00:06:20.900> ourselves<00:06:21.680> with

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
basically poison ourselves with

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.860 
basically poison ourselves with
organophosphates<00:06:23.030> and<00:06:23.720> and<00:06:25.180> carbamates<00:06:26.180> and
