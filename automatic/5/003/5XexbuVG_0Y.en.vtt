00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.210
 a new video today we're going 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:17.890
 take together the dedication of the junk 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:18.910
 this weekend I do not know if you 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.710
 reminders in price but she had a game 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.240
 which you play and maybe it's called 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.220
 the game of hopscotch add up 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.349
 wanted to box in case on one leg 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.310
 then january jean michaud in reality 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.080
 of imagine that there is only one 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.609
 class in front of you he goes 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.230
 returns between the first box point of 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.390
 starting first box starting point 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.100
 first point box is not I 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.570
 explain to me green which include the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.190
 movement i'm going to break down the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.530
 movement in two I just have him 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.350
 asked to jump on the first box 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.790
 on one leg and then come back this should 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.590
 look like that automatically that is 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.750
 what you did you took support on 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.020
 the left leg to put the leg 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.620
 right back both feet together 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.850
 in the widget 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.460
 it's almost pass to one 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.710
 very condition that does not push the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.590
 two feet on the ground to say that he feels 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.770
 that you take your first step and that you 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.100
 come back if he does not pose this room at the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.010
 leg that has just advanced stays in the air 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.900
 and there it's as if you're starting again and 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.960
 whose movement of wujek must I am 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.479
 called his agency right 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 it's good for me I come back this mac and 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.270
 social thematically I will take my 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.430
 left leg 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.180
 except that I can not leave my leg 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.920
 right I 'm doing my budget move 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.840
 and so on 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 I advance I come back 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.409
 I move forward I come back these movements 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 decomposed we can think 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.240
 differently by imagining left left 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.220
 right right left left right 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 right it's fits the leg on 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 which he will take support let's say 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.830
 I start the left leg with left 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.670
 I jump left 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.750
 I come back right I dread 3 left 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 left right right left left 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.399
 right 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.800
 so how among other movements 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.940
 imagine that this is your foot it can be 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.619
 only for moment when he makes the widget 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.660
 when you make seals quantify of 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.239
 bounce I use all the flat foot 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.380
 Caesar that you take support on the whole 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.570
 of the foot it makes a movement in this 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.450
 moment heavy enough you feel that his 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.640
 method to gain lightness 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.530
 dynamism and speed can see that you 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.690
 builds on different areas of the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.180
 foot including for example the full 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.540
 before you want to go a little short 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.799
 concrete foot or so heel I would have 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.360
 right away his jumps will be over 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.410
 dynamics you can gain speed 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.880
 flexibly 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.250
 you will be able to make small jumps 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.480
 can move more easily 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.680
 expect to see some variations 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.680
 variant number one 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.940
 the idea of ​​this variant is to make 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.940
 it 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.970
 what am I going to do it I come 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.760
 to place me on a diagonal going 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.990
 on my right except when I jumped and 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.480
 land I landed to orient myself towards 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.310
 my other court on the left is 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.870
 really the whole body that turns and 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.790
 not only the feet is the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.690
 shoulders the hips to give the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.460
 directions 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.590
 if you understood and assimilated the basis of 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.850
 budget wingles in this variant there one 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.010
 keep the same movement for the feet 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:24.300
 ie if they are on the left left 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:33.240
 right right left left right 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:35.880
 right second variant in the object of 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.680
 base makes rather forward movements 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.210
 and back so I left 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.520
 left right right left left 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.880
 right right game in this variant there 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.350
 we will rather use the sides for the 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.700
 moment we will start by taking support 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.410
 on both barefoot because without them 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.090
 legs I opened a little jump for 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.250
 cross my legs I put first 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.040
 put my left leg in front of people 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.390
 jump to uncross I'm recrossing this 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.990
 this time it's my right leg that is 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.980
 before I discourage where I meet again 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.540
 uncross 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.400
 pink rock a little tip for this 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.470
 movement there takes much more on the flat 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.640
 before foot on acton movement will be 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.440
 much lighter and more dynamic 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.659
 now I think you are asking for 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.670
 initial budget a good exercise for 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.470
 this variant is first it was on 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.449
 place and make a left left right 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.609
 right to take good support on dish 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.500
 before the foot little by little and that's 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.320
 to go to the side is a blow you go 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.760
 start by doing your first left 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.410
 nevertheless bring him back inward 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.600
 left left 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.160
 the same for the right starts with 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.800
 the outside then brings back firefighters 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.199
 were busy left left right 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.699
 right left left 3 right it takes 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.190
 that I understood that to do this 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.560
 variant of the whimsical direct is the 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.789
 leg that is not resting on the ground are 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.710
 crossed behind your knee but that 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.270
 do my arms I like in this 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.820
 faucet variant with arms d 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.000
 winding I take jean boulevard 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.070
 inside I will unfold the outside I 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.729
 take this kind to the lgv inside I 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.729
 you have no outside 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.199
 good and good 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.569
 remains to find variants 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:16.509
 find your style especially and practice 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.509
 in fact please see you soon
