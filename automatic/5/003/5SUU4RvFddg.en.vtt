00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
twice as many LEDs as anybody else it's

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.050 
twice as many LEDs as anybody else it's
about<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.920> hundred<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.460> nine<00:04:40.580> dollars<00:04:41.030> for

I'm<00:06:41.490> thinking<00:06:41.970> about<00:06:42.060> maybe<00:06:42.420> lowering<00:06:42.990> it

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
I'm thinking about maybe lowering it

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.310 
I'm thinking about maybe lowering it
it's<00:06:44.250> already<00:06:44.490> lowered<00:06:44.910> two<00:06:45.120> inches<00:06:45.510> in<00:06:45.780> the

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
it's already lowered two inches in the

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.000 
it's already lowered two inches in the
rear<00:06:46.490> so<00:06:47.490> it's<00:06:47.640> leveled<00:06:48.000> out<00:06:48.120> right<00:06:48.360> now<00:06:49.010> and

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
rear so it's leveled out right now and

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.110 
rear so it's leveled out right now and
I'm<00:06:50.160> thinking<00:06:50.490> about<00:06:50.930> maybe<00:06:51.930> lower<00:06:52.290> in<00:06:52.590> it

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
I'm thinking about maybe lower in it

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.460 
I'm thinking about maybe lower in it
either<00:06:54.120> one<00:06:54.660> or<00:06:54.690> two<00:06:54.930> inches<00:06:55.200> in<00:06:55.350> the<00:06:55.440> front

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.890 
either one or two inches in the front
and<00:06:55.920> then<00:06:56.640> you<00:06:56.730> know<00:06:56.880> to<00:06:56.940> level<00:06:57.480> out<00:06:57.660> maybe

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
and then you know to level out maybe

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.960 
and then you know to level out maybe
another<00:06:58.110> inch<00:06:58.410> or<00:06:58.560> two<00:06:58.710> and<00:06:59.040> the<00:06:59.520> rear<00:06:59.730> so
