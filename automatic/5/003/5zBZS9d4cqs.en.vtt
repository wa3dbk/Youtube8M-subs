to get to I don't know if the regular
Yankee<00:04:07.390> sword<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.750> think<00:04:07.959> they<00:04:08.049> may<00:04:08.170> have

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
Yankee sword I think they may have

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.440 
Yankee sword I think they may have
switched<00:04:08.650> over<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.100> all<00:04:09.610> of<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.850> spring<00:04:10.150> sense

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
switched over to all of the spring sense

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.350 
switched over to all of the spring sense
now<00:04:10.720> but<00:04:11.049> if<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:11.830> live<00:04:12.070> near<00:04:12.340> an<00:04:12.640> outlet<00:04:12.850> I

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
now but if you live near an outlet I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.849 
now but if you live near an outlet I
know<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.840> at<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.230> outlets<00:04:14.799> they<00:04:15.160> have<00:04:15.519> a

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
know that at the outlets they have a

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.440 
know that at the outlets they have a
frosted<00:04:17.859> Apple<00:04:18.280> which<00:04:18.580> is<00:04:18.700> basically<00:04:19.060> a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
frosted Apple which is basically a

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.060 
frosted Apple which is basically a
package<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.810> sugared<00:04:20.110> apple<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:20.710> you<00:04:20.800> could

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
package of sugared apple so you could

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.570 
package of sugared apple so you could
definitely<00:04:21.540> sniff<00:04:22.540> that<00:04:22.720> out<00:04:22.780> there<00:04:23.430> or<00:04:24.430> they

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
definitely sniff that out there or they

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.700 
definitely sniff that out there or they
may<00:04:24.760> even<00:04:24.790> have<00:04:25.120> some<00:04:25.270> sugared<00:04:25.780> apple<00:04:26.110> candles

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710

this<00:04:55.510> candle<00:04:55.990> for<00:04:56.830> me<00:04:57.010> it's<00:04:57.340> borderline<00:04:57.970> more

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
this candle for me it's borderline more

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.480 
this candle for me it's borderline more
of<00:04:59.110> a<00:05:00.510> fall/winter<00:05:01.510> type<00:05:02.470> sent<00:05:02.860> rather<00:05:03.220> than

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
of a fall/winter type sent rather than

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.140 
of a fall/winter type sent rather than
spring<00:05:04.210> summer<00:05:05.140> but<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.950> definitely<00:05:06.640> think

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
spring summer but I definitely think

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.330 
spring summer but I definitely think
that<00:05:07.510> for<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.140> lot<00:05:08.350> of<00:05:08.590> people<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:09.070> could<00:05:09.190> be

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
that for a lot of people it could be

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.600 
that for a lot of people it could be
pretty<00:05:09.640> interchangeable<00:05:10.000> um<00:05:11.280> you<00:05:12.280> know<00:05:12.400> I

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
pretty interchangeable um you know I

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.950 
pretty interchangeable um you know I
could<00:05:12.850> see<00:05:13.000> where<00:05:13.150> some<00:05:13.300> people<00:05:13.360> would<00:05:13.780> think

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
could see where some people would think

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.750 
could see where some people would think
that<00:05:14.080> this<00:05:14.260> would<00:05:14.320> be<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.620> really<00:05:14.770> nice<00:05:15.250> summer

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
that this would be a really nice summer

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.340 
that this would be a really nice summer
fragrance<00:05:16.060> because<00:05:16.540> it<00:05:16.780> does<00:05:16.960> have<00:05:17.170> that

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
fragrance because it does have that

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.370 
fragrance because it does have that
sweet<00:05:18.010> apple<00:05:18.430> ii<00:05:18.550> sent<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.960> really

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
sweet apple ii sent and that really

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.590 
sweet apple ii sent and that really
truly<00:05:20.800> could<00:05:21.010> be<00:05:21.130> year<00:05:21.340> round<00:05:21.370> but<00:05:22.060> just

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
truly could be year round but just

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.660 
truly could be year round but just
because<00:05:22.690> i<00:05:22.900> tend<00:05:23.170> to<00:05:23.320> burn<00:05:23.590> sugar<00:05:23.920> apple<00:05:24.250> more

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
because i tend to burn sugar apple more

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.420 
because i tend to burn sugar apple more
during<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.270> fall<00:05:25.600> and<00:05:25.630> winter<00:05:25.930> it<00:05:26.710> seems<00:05:27.010> more

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
during the fall and winter it seems more

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.660 
during the fall and winter it seems more
appropriate<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:28.270> me<00:05:28.390> during<00:05:28.600> that<00:05:28.750> time<00:05:29.140> so

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
appropriate to me during that time so

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.280 
appropriate to me during that time so

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
half um could be like almost at an eight

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.880 
half um could be like almost at an eight
to<00:05:44.500> be<00:05:44.590> honest<00:05:45.010> um<00:05:45.930> most<00:05:46.930> of<00:05:47.200> my<00:05:47.350> candles

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
to be honest um most of my candles

to be honest um most of my candles
recently<00:05:48.880> from<00:05:49.120> Bath<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.480> Body<00:05:49.570> Works<00:05:49.720> have

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
recently from Bath and Body Works have

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.910 
recently from Bath and Body Works have
not<00:05:50.410> been<00:05:50.770> in<00:05:51.130> like<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:52.570> solid<00:05:53.200> eight<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.890> a

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
not been in like the solid eight and a

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.980 
not been in like the solid eight and a
half<00:05:53.950> to<00:05:54.340> nine<00:05:54.370> range<00:05:54.850> so<00:05:55.390> that's<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.900> little

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
half to nine range so that's a little

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.710 
half to nine range so that's a little
bit<00:05:56.200> surprising<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.920> me<00:05:57.040> because<00:05:57.070> I<00:05:57.720> normally

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
bit surprising to me because I normally

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.120 
bit surprising to me because I normally
purchase<00:05:59.080> back<00:05:59.260> and<00:05:59.440> Body<00:05:59.560> Works<00:05:59.620> candles

purchase back and Body Works candles

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.890 
purchase back and Body Works candles
because<00:06:00.280> they<00:06:00.520> have<00:06:00.790> that<00:06:01.060> stronger<00:06:01.570> type<00:06:01.780> of

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
because they have that stronger type of

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.110 
because they have that stronger type of
throw<00:06:02.140> but<00:06:03.040> what<00:06:03.490> I've<00:06:03.580> been<00:06:03.700> picking<00:06:04.030> up

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
throw but what I've been picking up

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.150 
throw but what I've been picking up
lately<00:06:04.390> has<00:06:04.690> been<00:06:04.840> much<00:06:05.080> more<00:06:05.350> of<00:06:05.590> like<00:06:05.830> you

completely different going upstairs and

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.240 
completely different going upstairs and
that<00:06:22.090> is<00:06:22.360> definitely<00:06:22.750> like<00:06:23.320> its<00:06:23.560> own<00:06:23.770> thing<00:06:24.100> up

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
honestly if this was any stronger it

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.100 
honestly if this was any stronger it
might<00:06:35.580> be<00:06:35.730> true<00:06:35.910> sickeningly<00:06:36.420> sweet<00:06:36.660> for<00:06:36.990> some
