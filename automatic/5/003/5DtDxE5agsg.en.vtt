00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
ready as a normal let's bring this in

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.910 
ready as a normal let's bring this in
our<00:01:17.740> first<00:01:18.450> start<00:01:19.450> by<00:01:19.690> measuring<00:01:20.260> this<00:01:20.530> figure

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
our first start by measuring this figure

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.469 
our first start by measuring this figure
and<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.610> inches<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:23.080> is<00:01:23.190> just<00:01:24.190> under<00:01:24.550> 11<00:01:24.580> say<00:01:25.120> 10

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
and in inches it is just under 11 say 10

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.230 
and in inches it is just under 11 say 10
and<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.930> half<00:01:25.960> inches<00:01:26.650> there<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.640> height<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.210> a

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
and a half inches there in height so a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.320 
and a half inches there in height so a
very<00:01:29.010> larger<00:01:30.010> figure<00:01:30.370> you<00:01:30.490> can<00:01:30.700> see<00:01:30.940> we<00:01:31.120> have

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
very larger figure you can see we have

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.420 
very larger figure you can see we have
Thor's<00:01:31.900> hammer<00:01:32.229> there<00:01:32.470> in<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.920> hand<00:01:33.130> now

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
Thor's hammer there in the hand now

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.690 
Thor's hammer there in the hand now
ready<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.600> throw<00:01:35.229> we<00:01:35.979> also<00:01:36.190> have<00:01:36.549> an

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
ready to throw we also have an

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.969 
ready to throw we also have an
articulated<00:01:37.479> arm<00:01:37.510> so<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:37.990> can<00:01:38.080> move<00:01:38.409> that<00:01:38.770> arm

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
articulated arm so you can move that arm

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.490 
articulated arm so you can move that arm
at<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.370> top<00:01:39.580> at<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.960> elbow<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.320> can

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
at the top at the elbow and you can

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.660 
at the top at the elbow and you can
twist<00:01:41.799> that<00:01:42.010> hand

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
twist that hand

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.480 
twist that hand
now<00:01:43.479> that's<00:01:43.750> arm<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.260> just<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.680> fourth<00:01:44.950> throwing

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
now that's arm is just a fourth throwing

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.120 
now that's arm is just a fourth throwing
so<00:01:45.820> not<00:01:46.030> as<00:01:46.240> much<00:01:46.390> articulation<00:01:46.900> there<00:01:47.560> you

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
so not as much articulation there you

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.899 
so not as much articulation there you
can<00:01:48.369> move<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.760> head<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.940> little<00:01:49.150> it<00:01:49.420> will<00:01:49.600> rock

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
can move the head a little it will rock

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.910 
can move the head a little it will rock
not<00:01:51.909> much<00:01:52.330> movement<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.080> but<00:01:53.229> we<00:01:53.590> -<00:01:53.740> well

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
not much movement in it but we - well

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.550 
not much movement in it but we - well
move<00:01:54.390> slightly<00:01:55.390> we<00:01:55.750> have<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.049> activation

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
move slightly we have the activation

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560 
move slightly we have the activation
button<00:01:56.890> there<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.520> middle<00:01:57.760> if<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.330> just

back into place you pull the torso

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.410 
back into place you pull the torso
backwards<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:24.310> will<00:03:24.520> go<00:03:24.730> back<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.390> see

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
backwards this will go back you can see

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.660 
backwards this will go back you can see
that's<00:03:25.720> also<00:03:26.170> moving<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.770> then<00:03:27.220> I'll<00:03:27.430> let<00:03:27.640> go

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
that's also moving and then I'll let go

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.470 
that's also moving and then I'll let go
and<00:03:31.650> there<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:32.890> see<00:03:32.950> Thor<00:03:33.550> doesn't<00:03:34.120> throw

and there you can see Thor doesn't throw

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.710 
and there you can see Thor doesn't throw
his<00:03:35.290> hammer<00:03:35.739> on<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.250> floor<00:03:36.489> making<00:03:37.300> me<00:03:37.420> pick

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
his hammer on the floor making me pick

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.250 
his hammer on the floor making me pick
it<00:03:37.870> up

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
it up

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.960 
it up
and<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.680> can<00:03:38.830> get<00:03:38.950> lots<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.340> phrases<00:03:39.610> let's

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
and you can get lots of phrases let's

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.860 
and you can get lots of phrases let's
try<00:03:40.239> those<00:03:40.450> out

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
try those out

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:57.250 
try those out
[Applause]

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
[Applause]

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.539 
[Applause]
so<00:03:58.260> there<00:03:58.379> are<00:03:58.409> about<00:03:58.620> five<00:03:59.129> different

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
so there are about five different

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.140 
so there are about five different
phrases<00:04:00.299> on<00:04:00.450> then<00:04:00.629> every<00:04:01.170> time<00:04:01.379> you<00:04:01.969> pull<00:04:02.969> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
phrases on then every time you pull the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.569 
phrases on then every time you pull the
arm<00:04:03.420> back<00:04:03.719> and<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.530> pull<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.890> torso<00:04:05.370> back

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
arm back and you pull the torso back

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.339 
arm back and you pull the torso back
like<00:04:05.879> that<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:08.730> will<00:04:08.970> activate<00:04:09.540> those<00:04:09.810> noises

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
like that it will activate those noises

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.179 
like that it will activate those noises
so<00:04:10.650> every<00:04:10.920> time<00:04:11.069> you<00:04:11.220> throw<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.609> hammer<00:04:13.189> Thor

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
so every time you throw the hammer Thor

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.800 
so every time you throw the hammer Thor
will<00:04:14.430> actually<00:04:15.030> say<00:04:15.870> one<00:04:16.259> of<00:04:16.500> those<00:04:16.859> phrases

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
will actually say one of those phrases

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.840 
will actually say one of those phrases
but<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.199> all<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.799> action<00:04:20.160> features<00:04:20.609> on

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
but that is all the action features on

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.020 
but that is all the action features on
this<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:21.780> do<00:04:22.019> get<00:04:22.259> this<00:04:22.860> more<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.639> rubbery

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
this we do get this more of a rubbery

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.350 
this we do get this more of a rubbery
material<00:04:24.150> well<00:04:24.870> it's<00:04:25.289> actually<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:26.360> thinner

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
material well it's actually a thinner

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.540 
material well it's actually a thinner
