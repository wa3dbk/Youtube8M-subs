00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
let's take a look well

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.809 
let's take a look well
looking<00:02:13.380> pretty<00:02:13.470> organized<00:02:14.040> now<00:02:14.340> aren't<00:02:14.670> they

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
looking pretty organized now aren't they

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.940

huh<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> tell<00:02:15.930> me<00:02:16.020> there<00:02:16.170> there<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.680> there

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.640 

and<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.069> bet<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.270> yeah<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:22.050> it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and I bet is it that yeah so you see it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.309 
and I bet is it that yeah so you see it
seems<00:02:22.980> impossible<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:24.060> when<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.050> know<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
seems impossible but when you know the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.040 
seems impossible but when you know the
trick<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.770> really<00:02:26.280> easy<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.569> like

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
trick it's really easy it's just like
