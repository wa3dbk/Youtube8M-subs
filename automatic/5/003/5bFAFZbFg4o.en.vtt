00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.099
 Now let's talk about problems with 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.719
 plastics forehead or which can 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.429
 eliminate on their own very often 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.110
 encountered the next problem window 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.820
 opens immediately two positions in 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.419
 air mode and open mode 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.610
 window 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.439
 it was usually greeting gusts 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.529
 wind or improper use 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.320
 window 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.820
 the window opens at once in two positions 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.510
 do not close it does not appear 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.790
 possible you can produce the following 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.860
 the operation window is covered with 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.960
 slight pressure 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.199
 the handle turns up then 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.150
 snuggles and turns back to 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.470
 open position of the window after which she 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.470
 freely closed 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:02.450
 Also very often the following 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:07.780
 flap problem starts to catch on 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:10.960
 with their parts for the answers and the planks 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.340
 mounted on the frame that is throughout 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.540
 perimeter at the bottom in the area just 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.799
 top or back and back 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.420
 eliminate it in principle is not 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.050
 no difficulty since on the window 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.820
 there are three adjustment cult 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.649
 The first view is under protective 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.479
 cap 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:37.090
 responsible for adjusting so on top bottom 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.399
 regulated by a regular hexagon of 4 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.140
 millimeter when turning clockwise 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:48.190
 the arrow . month rises 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.220
 the assembly goes down haji there are 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.860
 need to pik one more adjusting 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.729
 which is responsible for the movement of the sash 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.679
 left and right relatively wounds go 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.880
 the very same brave four 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.880
 millimeters hex 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.030
 turn and shift thicker either right 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.950
 I do not remember and probably loop and 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.260
 carnival adjusting which 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.960
 is here here here in view 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.790
 find bread which is responsible for the business of 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.080
 its movement is right and left adjustment 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.100
 performed by the same key 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.710
 4 mm hexagon when turning 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.320
 key clockwise sash 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.320
 moves in the direction of the loop 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.099
 turn the key counterclockwise 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.599
 the sash is moving backwards then about 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.090
 than these simple manipulations can 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.670
 adjust the window yourself to 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.870
 she did not score with you to return 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.870
 the strap must be installed 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.670
 also very common next 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.590
 moment seal falls out of 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.319
 own for that is about here 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.819
 so it is usually winter 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.379
 time here podgotovochka 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.560
 is in airing mode and 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.090
 consolidation occurs and he 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.489
 some services stick 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.950
 when opening the tamers falls out of 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.709
 own groove is made this very 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.019
 just simply break the habit and this is such 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:33.890
 motions pushed back in red 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.890
 all the problem bed 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.709
 let's talk about one more problem 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.379
 often encountered when loose 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.750
 window handle that is something like this 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.480
 that's the way 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.220
 a bunch of dangles that is eliminated who 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.010
 very, very simple 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.830
 the knob turns the position open 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.800
 the window has a protective cap 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.160
 decorative which is such a movement 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.180
 turns where under the cap 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.020
 there is no handle mounted 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.550
 they can be screwed 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.550
 any screwdriver any screwdriver 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.860
 that's the way after which 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.700
 the cap turns back to the same 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.540
 position on the face. 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.540
 gets up rich 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.139
 breaking window handles is not 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.509
 warranty case since basically 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.440
 breakdown 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.169
 happens as a result of the wrong 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.320
 operating windows let them pull the handles 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.870
 either the window 8 is not closed correctly 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.009
 don't worry about it 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.050
