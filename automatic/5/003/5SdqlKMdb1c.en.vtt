00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.240
 this makes zimon the muscle maker in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.090
 this video is about the question 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.469
 Muscle development in calorie deficit can 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.599
 you can achieve that at all 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.060
 we need to build muscle around calories 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.400
 deficit two levels remember once 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.189
 muscle building which belongs to the second 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.140
 level it is energy deficit that is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.689
 relatively clearly formulated there 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.449
 ultimately quite clearly what to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.800
 calorie deficit is in calorie deficit 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.989
 means no more and no less 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.809
 as a negative energy balance the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.579
 means that you eat less calories 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.890
 than that she burns the body 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.930
 needed or or that you 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.879
 burn more than you take on 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.430
 then you have negative energy balance 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.140
 then you have calories deficit and the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 First level on it again briefly 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.860
 to come to speak is the muscle building 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 and what do we need there? 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.059
 of course building blocks for muscle building 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.469
 and are the one acer at the white 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.420
 we finally have to use the nitrogen 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.399
 the balance sheet considers the nitrogen balance 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.070
 that simply expresses what 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.409
 from what the rate between recorded 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.030
 and excreted protein is that is 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.710
 our body of it in the constant 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.299
 and dismantling process while I 'm sitting here 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 and rhede with us my muscles 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.810
 my muscles are starting to build up and it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 at the same time that is a process of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.229
 so constantly a constant 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 renewal process of getting in is transition 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.250
 of course, the question is now 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.020
 let's put these two levels on a plane 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.630
 Let's get these two levels together 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.040
 I'll tell you these two levels are 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.560
 not directly so have yourself 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.659
 Exclude but they are competitors 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.520
 because the energy level ultimately 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.860
 the energy deficit we achieve 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 have to close a little bit far 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 yes, that's just a lot 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.689
 can take protein 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.729
 but only a small piece 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.829
 far from the energy balance 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.320
 the fat and the carbohydrates 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.360
 proteins in the nitrogen balance 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.549
 let's take a look at the white ones, that is the ones 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.280
 energy balance that must be so designed 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.200
 that if we have fat carbohydrates and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.600
 take a total of whites 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.350
 still take less than that 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 we burn 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.850
 but just the white ones have to 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.500
 still be so numerous 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.979
 we just have a positive nitrogen balance 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.780
 to reach 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.640
 Of course these are things that are somewhere in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.230
 of reality ultimately with each other 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.580
 collided 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.800
 in theory, it is definitely 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.930
 possible the artificial light in the reality 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
 so then in it an energy balance so too 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.700
 Make sure you have low carbs 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.739
 little fat but many white ones 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.049
 that you are just a positive nitrogen 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.720
 But overall, they still have the balance sheet 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.310
 negative energy balance has if you do that 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.170
 all now declares again en detail 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.940
 or if you want 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.140
 exactly which specific contexts 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.819
 then probably know the pitfalls 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.739
 the advantages the disadvantages 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.299
 maybe also in what way possible 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.470
 i have to look like the nutrition 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.090
 do not know what you are exactly then 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.890
 interested then let me in the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.540
 comments to know then again one with 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.280
 video maybe synonymous all one 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.290
 Wakeboard where I do it all again 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.700
 but directly to show that you have to give 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.379
 write me down exactly what you know 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.329
 I can then start again 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.040
 and take care of it as I said in the 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.840
 Theory is the whole thing as possible 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.430
 a positive nitrogen balance an 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.560
 negative energy balance the whole 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.109
 combined and then, so to speak, one 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.910
 Muscle development in calorie deficit possible 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.370
 since that's also possible in the end 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.060
 like simultaneous muscle building and 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.950
 fat loss 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.900
 but as I said the theory is not the same 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.730
 practice a very narrow ridge which one because 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.319
 it must be clear that must go 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.970
 and who stands on the scales and 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.440
 is celebrating afterwards because he has something 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.269
 has increased or decreased or 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.829
 is sad because something has increased or 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.569
 which has decreased under 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.220
 circumstances chosen the wrong indicator 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.510
 See you in the next video many 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.510
 greetings from your simon
