00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.750
 did we think best is omg van 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 emoji to the jan farmer cuckoo 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.980
 know this principle of a square meter 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.080
 suit that is measuring a measuring app bin 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.420
 cupcakes yes it's that simple really 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 a bin of a meter on the meter 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.020
 the cell that is able to put on small 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.280
 surfaces also vegetables and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.420
 to be able to grow herbs 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.520
 because a lot of people have 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.590
 vast deserts and if not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.050
 needed with a square meter container and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.680
 comes all printf proposal for the mine 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.680
 stabbing each 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:01:13.810
 sander fun I've not just yeah 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.810
 you get the soil 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.619
 poll before we can fill with 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.540
 potting soil is important to another one 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.580
 laying carrot cloth on the floor 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.729
 that is necessary to prevent leaching 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.880
 les simples traffic does work with you and us 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.880
 pull there what you buy about it 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.609
 the corners 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.329
 let cut 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.820
 then I will buy a strip in advance 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.110
 sonja the square meter bin that is like 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.490
 a lasagna 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.409
 but actually means that we have everything 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.340
 go into layers and we start with the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.869
 bottom layer 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.970
 there the hydro grains are hydro grains 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.830
 will ensure proper drainage of the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.910
 Grab all the water that is in it 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.910
 it goes again may 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.280
 cool to playful layer there is our next 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.739
 layer is one mixed with 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.390
 soil conditioner is soil conditioner and 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.099
 potting soil for vegetables and herbs 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.099
 how to mix and that was it again 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.160
 on 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.110
 so say our second layer that will like 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.000
 last layer 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.459
 one is used with normal potting soil 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.060
 vegetables and herbs then it's easy 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.060
 to make payments 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.040
 so say sonja our lasagna is ready 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:07.739
 we still have a few things to do and 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.209
 we can make his fax one more 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.180
 surprise skip 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.159
 genes lasagna without vegetables have one 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.010
 number of things to plant 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.689
 then you can turn the boxes are quite small 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.840
 so a salad 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.670
 per package because those heads will be later 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.480
 so big so you really have to place in between 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.569
 load 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.430
 there may also timing could plant 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.799
 I think I am one of those at least 10 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.290
 art to make long number of seeds 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.209
 have ford focus on to rattling the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.739
 looking for tasty 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.739
