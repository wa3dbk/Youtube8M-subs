00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.329
 hello friends here writes young 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.449
 the man that he has known for two 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:17.090
 of the month lives the united states and nobody 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:19.220
 it just does not help but how 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.840
 Here is the question of his views there is still that 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.270
 it means you have to pay 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.480
 to the Russians, he seems to be there in some kind of 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:31.730
 I do not know Russian in a big city and 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.339
 after him for all the money they take there for 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.870
 advice and there and so on and shops 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.850
 he asks where something like the same way here at 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.819
 we are at a feast neighbors each other just like that 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.129
 help means it turns out in America 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.979
 people change somehow or something and here 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.739
 as if any other Russians there I 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:52.280
 I want to say that if we look at it 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.649
 where did the young man come from there 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.909
 Here in the language that is used there 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.690
 There are words like 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:03.530
 rogue rogue kidalovo dishonest 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.170
 man and many other bad words not 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.930
 cute which characterize quite 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.760
 how local reality she is 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.470
 local reality may be in 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.560
 the united states and canada in australia 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.380
 in israel in poland in the czech republic absolutely in 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.470
 Any place where the media here this 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.159
 reality gets so when 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.829
 man lives in his country so 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.039
 he also has the ability to deal 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.289
 with all these negative things but he 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.020
 just already born its serial 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.709
 parents themselves there schools there and so on 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.289
 this environment and that's how it saves given 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.810
 pulls him out somewhere and he has 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.929
 many opportunities to avoid under that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.359
 to step on something or fumes 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.369
 enter into something here he comes 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.500
 no environment he has no way 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.069
 does not protect therefore he constantly walks and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.729
 enters 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.369
 In general, the fact that a person enters it too 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.329
 characterizes if of course sometimes 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.069
 that well , somehow that 's really simple 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.740
 a place where you do not got tread 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.120
 come steadily but 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.370
 I think it is like from my experience is that it 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.960
 that in this sense there are some 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.590
 predisposition and it is possible that 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.810
 this man is always at home too 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.760
 somewhere stepped in there and so forth 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.160
 but it really doesn't have any 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.100
 values means to exist that with a point 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.760
 view from this questions and answers to it 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.070
 so this is the choice of the person where he was 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.950
 there with whom he should communicate or not communicate 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.170
 if he doesn't like if he understands 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.670
 that something abnormal happens he 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.060
 communicates with some kind of wrong 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.760
 people so it began to look at 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.070
 the parties go right if he 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.670
 considers it normal to deal here with 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.170
 so and he does not have a desire 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.270
 look for others to find out what will have 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.000
 dealing with such I don't know means not 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.430
 by chance all is well so here to this 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.430
 inclined that not just like that all this happens 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.710
 Well, I show the video, I show you 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:20.480
 guys that we have in school and we have here 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:23.150
 so i don't even know how to compare 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.890
 very people come nobody know well 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.840
 the truth is no aura on video can be anyone 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.569
 then they know themselves and I know you I 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.569
 I know the experience in Cortana, but it doesn't matter 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.319
 getting experience comes falls into this 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.840
 told looking 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.640
 oll the food begins to obihazhivat 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.799
 somehow there they explain to him how to open 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.930
 bank account and it can by car is 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.650

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.989

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.060
 past for the weekend there take there to the ocean 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.900
 that there is something no one from him there and 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.920
 money especially 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.569
 for what among well, that is, when you enter there 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.910
 tradition in which people are each other 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.459
 I help because it is very natural and 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.200
 even i don't need require some 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.010
 explanations why people help each other 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.920
 to a friend because im nice paper 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.870
 nice to go and because im someone 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.819
 helped both really helped me but they all 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.829
 equally help and it happens that they were helped 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.049
 they still will not help this very 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.419
 it happens to them a little bit they helped 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.639
 there until the end of his life and remember and be grateful 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.699

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.950
 gold from the barrel in the bat he says what 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.620
 they didn't give that gold was the wrong sample and 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.539
 the barrel was full of holes that is unknown 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.139

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:36.349
