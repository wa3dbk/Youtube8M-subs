seconds<00:02:42.230> left<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.650> game<00:02:42.849> we<00:02:43.849> played<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
seconds left in this game we played the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.520 
seconds left in this game we played the
Seahawks<00:02:44.480> yesterday<00:02:44.900> play<00:02:45.079> them<00:02:45.200> again<00:02:45.349> today

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
Seahawks yesterday play them again today

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.470 
Seahawks yesterday play them again today
I<00:02:46.010> know<00:02:46.459> they<00:02:46.640> don't<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.910> Harvin<00:02:47.420> and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
I know they don't have Harvin and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.880 
I know they don't have Harvin and
whatnot<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.019> they're<00:02:48.140> still<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.349> solid<00:02:48.560> squad

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
whatnot but they're still a solid squad

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.740 
whatnot but they're still a solid squad
obviously<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> defense<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.819> real<00:02:50.000> tough<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:50.510> I

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
obviously the defense is real tough so I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.599 
obviously the defense is real tough so I
can't<00:02:51.139> blame<00:02:51.349> ponents<00:02:51.920> for<00:02:52.040> using<00:02:52.310> them<00:02:52.400> but<00:02:52.549> I

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
can't blame ponents for using them but I

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.970 
can't blame ponents for using them but I
think<00:02:53.329> Dallas<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.810> one<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.049> like<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.380> think<00:02:54.859> like

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
think Dallas is one of like I think like

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.370 
think Dallas is one of like I think like
the<00:02:55.130> top<00:02:55.370> three<00:02:55.940> overall<00:02:56.150> rated<00:02:56.750> team<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.139> I'm

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the top three overall rated team so I'm

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.930 
the top three overall rated team so I'm
not<00:02:57.500> even<00:02:57.680> mad<00:02:57.769> at<00:02:57.829> that<00:02:58.040> hour<00:02:58.609> ponent

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
not even mad at that hour ponent

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.490 
not even mad at that hour ponent
actually<00:02:59.180> misses<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.540> kick<00:02:59.750> here<00:02:59.989> because<00:03:00.380> he

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
actually misses the kick here because he

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.050 
actually misses the kick here because he
doesn't<00:03:00.650> have<00:03:00.799> Dan<00:03:00.950> Bailey<00:03:01.400> kicking<00:03:01.910> most

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
doesn't have Dan Bailey kicking most

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.430 
doesn't have Dan Bailey kicking most
accurate<00:03:02.450> kicker<00:03:02.569> of<00:03:02.780> all<00:03:02.900> time<00:03:03.109> I<00:03:03.139> guess

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
accurate kicker of all time I guess

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.250 
accurate kicker of all time I guess
right<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.060> anyway<00:03:05.060> good<00:03:05.450> stuff<00:03:05.660> for<00:03:05.690> us<00:03:05.959> and

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
right so anyway good stuff for us and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.110 
right so anyway good stuff for us and
then<00:03:06.769> mcclain<00:03:07.130> man<00:03:07.370> he's<00:03:07.609> literally<00:03:07.849> turned

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
then mcclain man he's literally turned

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.030 
then mcclain man he's literally turned
out<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.299> be<00:03:08.359> like<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.569> MVP<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.230> team<00:03:09.410> dudes

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
out to be like the MVP the team dudes

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.039 
out to be like the MVP the team dudes
not<00:03:10.220> fast<00:03:10.549> but<00:03:10.700> he<00:03:10.970> makes<00:03:11.209> plays<00:03:11.540> for<00:03:11.780> he's<00:03:11.870> got

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
not fast but he makes plays for he's got

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.780 
not fast but he makes plays for he's got
hit<00:03:12.260> power<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:13.220> catch<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.579> ball<00:03:13.760> and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
hit power and catch the ball and

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.729 
hit power and catch the ball and
everything<00:03:14.329> so<00:03:14.599> that<00:03:15.139> really<00:03:15.290> helps<00:03:15.590> our

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
everything so that really helps our

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.289 
everything so that really helps our
scenario<00:03:16.250> out<00:03:16.430> here<00:03:16.639> because<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.030> know<00:03:17.150> where

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
scenario out here because you know where

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.970 
scenario out here because you know where
we're<00:03:17.450> going<00:03:17.660> Dez<00:03:18.109> Bryant<00:03:18.590> but<00:03:18.680> we<00:03:18.739> can't

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
we're going Dez Bryant but we can't

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.379 
we're going Dez Bryant but we can't
complete<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.519> then<00:03:20.030> we're<00:03:20.150> going<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.329> go

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
complete it and then we're going to go

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.599
