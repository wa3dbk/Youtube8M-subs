00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 when you see continental countries as 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.290
 Brazil can have a system 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.330
 adequate railways we see that they 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.000
 able to move their goods and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.740
 goods in the most efficient and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.650
 you have a cost reduction 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.900
 logistically increasing with certainty 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.150
 competitiveness of the productive sectors 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.760
 to have more foreign trade 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.430
 more attractive even in developed 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.220
 interior corner of goods and provides faith 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.869
 are low on society as in the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.369
 proper old title 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.960
 this even makes a price control 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.540
 best about on the chain of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.610
 products today that the great challenge is 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.710
 expand the brand is to do 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.660
 To love is to increase in size so that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.190
 reach the agricultural frontiers regions 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.260
 minerals in our country so that people 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.070
 able to export their goods with more 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.750
 competitiveness is to make exports and 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.969
 For this we have to bring the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 private investment is to make railroad 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.399
 without the participation of the private sector is 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.289
 very difficult then in that sense is that 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.390
 the government made the investment program 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.900
 in logistics where we seek to expand 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.960
 the mesh in 11 thousand that you did not have new is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.590
 is an economic modeling different from 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.780
 previously done in the sense of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.420
 that we're looking for lower freights 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.210
 of a more intense private participation 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.220
 in the expansion of the railway network 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 it has a large structuring axis that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.630
 the north south railroad that goes to search 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.860
 connect from points in the northern region 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.110
 he in itaqui region will also us 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.540
 barcarena the stop to the posts of 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.340
 Southern region mainly and you saints 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.840
 really has a large axis 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.180
 structure that will put the country of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.979
 north to south and will be almost the column 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.450
 spinal the right system 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.159
 has another project that is also 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.570
 more advanced in terms of study 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.430
 already approved the ceiling of the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.460
 court of accounts of the union that is the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.409
 Lucas River Excerpt 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.210
 of campinorte that will reach the region 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.150
 in the north of the state of mato grosso is a 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.979
 large agricultural region capable of exporting 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.960
 a large amount of soybeans with these 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.550
 railways making more competitiveness 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.550
 for the Brazilian electric sector
