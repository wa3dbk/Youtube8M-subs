00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
by but what I usually do is I just fill

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
by but what I usually do is I just fill
this<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.630> almost<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.110> quarter<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.740> jar

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
this up to almost a quarter of the jar

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.219 
this up to almost a quarter of the jar
then<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> would<00:01:50.939> pour<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> drink<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
then I would pour in the drink and I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.730

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
would pour the drink up to like 3/4 of

own<00:02:14.659> pudding<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.319> usually<00:02:16.069> like<00:02:16.219> to<00:02:16.250> use<00:02:16.519> a

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
own pudding I usually like to use a

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.179 
own pudding I usually like to use a
coconut<00:02:17.180> milk<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.659> make<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.109> more<00:02:18.500> creamy<00:02:18.890> I

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
coconut milk to make this more creamy I

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.190 
coconut milk to make this more creamy I
would<00:02:19.819> fill<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> rest<00:02:20.359> of<00:02:20.480> my<00:02:20.599> jar<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.019> with

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
would fill the rest of my jar in with

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.240 
would fill the rest of my jar in with
some<00:02:21.349> coconut<00:02:21.530> milk<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:23.650> if<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.799> want<00:02:25.099> to

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
some coconut milk and if you want to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.740 
some coconut milk and if you want to
make<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.579> sweeter<00:02:25.969> I<00:02:26.209> think<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.659> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
make this sweeter I think that the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.569 
make this sweeter I think that the
almond<00:02:27.170> milk<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.709> coconut<00:02:28.099> milk<00:02:28.250> makes

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
almond milk and the coconut milk makes

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.360 
almond milk and the coconut milk makes
this<00:02:28.849> flavorful<00:02:29.599> enough<00:02:30.079> but<00:02:30.620> if<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.889> want<00:02:31.189> to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
this flavorful enough but if you want to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.819 
this flavorful enough but if you want to
add<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:32.030> more<00:02:32.239> sweetness<00:02:32.629> then<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.680> would

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
add in more sweetness then I would

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.580 
add in more sweetness then I would
recommend<00:02:33.980> using<00:02:34.549> 1<00:02:34.879> spoon<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.510> organic<00:02:36.260> cane
