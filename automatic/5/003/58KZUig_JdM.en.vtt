we thought we might have customers
similar<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:39.240> our<00:03:39.510> existing<00:03:39.870> customers<00:03:40.260> and

similar to to our existing customers and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.840 
similar to to our existing customers and

talk to them about taking you know
advertising<00:03:42.060> directly<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.960> but<00:03:43.110> it's<00:03:43.230> not

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
advertising directly on it but it's not

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.500 
advertising directly on it but it's not
as<00:03:43.500> effective<00:03:43.950> because<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.670> manage

where<00:06:14.640> I<00:06:14.670> think<00:06:14.730> in<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.060> past<00:06:15.240> it's<00:06:15.900> usually

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
where I think in the past it's usually

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.900 
where I think in the past it's usually
kind<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:16.590> exclusive<00:06:17.040> to<00:06:17.400> people<00:06:17.640> who<00:06:17.760> can

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
spend you know at this level I'm you can

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.200 
spend you know at this level I'm you can
really<00:06:20.100> come<00:06:20.280> to<00:06:20.400> a<00:06:20.430> draw<00:06:20.610> with<00:06:20.760> any<00:06:20.940> amount

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
really come to a draw with any amount

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.060 
really come to a draw with any amount
and<00:06:21.480> start<00:06:21.780> a<00:06:21.840> campaign<00:06:22.260> and<00:06:22.590> then<00:06:22.770> as<00:06:22.890> we've

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
and start a campaign and then as we've

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.440 
and start a campaign and then as we've
grown<00:06:23.310> we've<00:06:23.610> really<00:06:23.820> been<00:06:23.940> able<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.150> scale

that that spend with them so it's nice
that<00:06:26.670> I<00:06:27.210> think<00:06:27.450> for<00:06:27.570> the<00:06:27.630> first<00:06:27.780> time<00:06:27.930> it's

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
that I think for the first time it's

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.330 
that I think for the first time it's
kind<00:06:28.200> of<00:06:28.290> opening<00:06:28.560> that<00:06:28.680> technology<00:06:29.220> to

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
kind of opening that technology to

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.640 
kind of opening that technology to
smaller<00:06:29.580> businesses<00:06:29.670> and<00:06:30.360> as<00:06:31.050> they<00:06:31.320> grow<00:06:31.470> it's

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
smaller businesses and as they grow it's

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.080 
smaller businesses and as they grow it's
gonna<00:06:31.740> be<00:06:31.890> able<00:06:31.950> to<00:06:32.070> grow<00:06:32.190> with<00:06:32.250> them<00:06:32.520> so<00:06:32.940> do

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
gonna be able to grow with them so do
