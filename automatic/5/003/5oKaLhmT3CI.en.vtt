like Marshall he spent the weekend

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.040 
like Marshall he spent the weekend
facing<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.190> reality<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:42.000> he's<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
facing the reality that he's now a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.840 
facing the reality that he's now a
backup<00:00:43.620> quarterback<00:00:44.100> peer<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.399> least<00:00:44.640> last

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
year he knew he had to do whatever he

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
year he knew he had to do whatever he
had<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.770> back<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> league<00:00:47.399> now

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
had to do to get back in the league now

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.869 
had to do to get back in the league now
it<00:00:48.120> sounds<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.559> he's<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.460> fence<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.820> you

think<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.180> an<00:00:51.360> issue<00:00:51.480> moving<00:00:51.899> forward

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
think this is an issue moving forward

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.479 
think this is an issue moving forward
well<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> Eagles<00:00:52.739> did<00:00:52.860> him<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> favor<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
well the Eagles did him a favor and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.760 
well the Eagles did him a favor and
picking<00:00:54.420> him<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.629> last<00:00:54.809> year<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.680> they

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
decided to pick up the ark option

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.549 
decided to pick up the ark option
because<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.840> could<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.079> let<00:00:58.260> allow

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
could be a heck of a quarterback like he

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.559 
could be a heck of a quarterback like he
once<00:02:14.190> was<00:02:14.400> well<00:02:14.760> that's<00:02:14.940> part<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.269> scouting

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
once was well that's part of scouting

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.089 
once was well that's part of scouting
and<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.870> think<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.319> last<00:02:16.620> year<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.920> was<00:02:16.950> very

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
and I think really last year it was very

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.520 
and I think really last year it was very
difficult<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.940> watch<00:02:18.090> his<00:02:18.390> plays<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.349> think

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
difficult to watch his plays and think

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.199 
difficult to watch his plays and think
that<00:02:19.650> he<00:02:19.769> was<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> Michael<00:02:20.190> victim<00:02:20.640> old<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.120> I

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
that he was the Michael victim old and I

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.400 
that he was the Michael victim old and I
think<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> only<00:02:21.599> people<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.019> know<00:02:22.200> where

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
think the only people that know where

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.870 
think the only people that know where
Michael<00:02:22.620> Vick<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.220> terms<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.519> his<00:02:23.670> career

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
cobb struggled last summer and I really

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.940 
cobb struggled last summer and I really

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
was concerned that they didn't have a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.890 
was concerned that they didn't have a
backup<00:03:23.190> quarterback<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.269> thought<00:03:24.630> that
