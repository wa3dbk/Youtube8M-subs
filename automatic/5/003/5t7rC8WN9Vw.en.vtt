00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
to do how we've dealt with it is we came

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.060 
to do how we've dealt with it is we came
up<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> digital<00:00:39.540> file<00:00:39.900> package<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.860> no

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
up with a digital file package that no

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.799 
up with a digital file package that no
one<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.370> buy<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.790> priced<00:00:42.150> it<00:00:42.330> so<00:00:42.570> high<00:00:42.780> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
one will buy we priced it so high that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.900 
one will buy we priced it so high that
no<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.410> wants<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> gives<00:00:44.580> our

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
no one wants that that it gives our

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.229 
no one wants that that it gives our
packages<00:00:45.809> value<00:00:46.290> so<00:00:46.980> that's<00:00:47.610> how<00:00:47.790> we've<00:00:47.970> dealt

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
packages value so that's how we've dealt

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.820 
packages value so that's how we've dealt
with<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> because<00:00:48.690> what<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.650> our

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
with it because what we do is our

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.770 
with it because what we do is our
largest<00:00:50.370> package<00:00:50.700> actually<00:00:51.420> our<00:00:51.510> two<00:00:51.629> largest

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
largest package actually our two largest

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.690

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
because we've already retouched them and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.980 
because we've already retouched them and
everything<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> album's<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.570> what

we<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.560> is<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.800> give<00:00:59.100> them<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
we do with that is we give them the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.550 
we do with that is we give them the
digital<00:00:59.940> files<00:01:00.150> if<00:01:00.420> they<00:01:00.900> buy<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.380> of<00:01:01.410> those

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
digital files if they buy one of those

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.680 
digital files if they buy one of those
two<00:01:01.739> packages<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.670> an<00:01:02.790> upsell<00:01:03.239> from<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
two packages and it's an upsell from the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.090 
two packages and it's an upsell from the
lower<00:01:03.840> packages<00:01:04.380> because<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:05.009> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
lower packages because those are the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
lower packages because those are the
only<00:01:05.250> way<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.300> digital<00:01:06.509> files

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
only way they can get digital files

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
only way they can get digital files
unless<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.800> buy<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.070> big<00:01:08.550> digital<00:01:08.850> package

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
unless they buy the big digital package

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.150 
unless they buy the big digital package
and<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.899> digital<00:01:10.080> package<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.649> I<00:01:10.770> said<00:01:10.979> is

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
and the digital package like I said is

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.600 
and the digital package like I said is
so<00:01:11.759> expensive<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.649> it<00:01:13.649> actually<00:01:13.890> adds<00:01:14.250> value

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so expensive that it actually adds value

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.850 
so expensive that it actually adds value
to<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.630> package<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> few<00:01:16.770> hundred

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
to the package because for a few hundred

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100 
to the package because for a few hundred
dollars<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.490> they<00:01:18.119> actually<00:01:18.360> get<00:01:18.660> prints

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
dollars more they actually get prints

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.740 
dollars more they actually get prints
and<00:01:19.320> album<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.520> know<00:01:20.640> gallery<00:01:21.060> wrap<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.509> that

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
we like to keep it simple that's why we

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.040 
we like to keep it simple that's why we
went<00:03:58.030> with<00:03:58.090> two<00:03:58.300> and<00:03:58.510> they've<00:03:58.660> got<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> whole
