00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.399
This is the EOS-1DX, the latest model in Canon's
1D-series of professional SLRs.

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.460
Unlike the 1D Mark IV which has a 1.3x crop
factor, the 1DX has a full-frame sensor, so

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.590
there's no focal length maginifaction factor.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.500
At just 18.1 million, the pixel count of the
1Dx was a bit of a surprise to owners of the

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.030
21.1 million pixel 1DS Mark 3, but Canon has
kept the new camera's resolution down to ensure

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.990
better image quality at the higher sensitivity
settings.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.750
To this end, Canon tells us that the pixels
on the 1DX's sensor are 21% bigger than those

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.480
on the 1DS Mark 3's chip.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.140
Image quality is further boosted by the fact
that the micro lenses over the photoreceptors

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.210
are gapless, and this increases their light
gathering potential.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.440
Two DIGIC 5 plus procesors handle the output
from the 1DX's sensor.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.970
As well as allowing sensitivity to be set
at up to ISO 204,800 when the range is expanded,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.440
this enables images to be shot at up to 12
frames per second.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.810
In fact, if you can cope with the focus and
exposure being set at the start of the sequence,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:15.330
it's even possible to shoot JPEGS at up to
14 frames per second.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.039
Like the 5D Mark III, the 1DX has a 61-point
autofocus system.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.270
These points can be selected individually
or in groups.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.780
The way the system responds in continuous
focus mode can also be customised using this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.109
dedicated menu screen.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.070
As you would expect with a camera that retails
for around Â£4500, the 1DX feels very solidly

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.490
built and it's able to withstand exposure
to bad weather thanks to seals around all

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.499
the controls and joints.

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.590
Handling-wise the big news for the 1DX is
the introduction of this second mini-joystick

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.829
multicontroller which is within easy reach
of your thumb when the camera is held in upright

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.490
orientation.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.869
This makes it much easier to navigate the
menu or change AF point when shooting in portrait

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.659
format, but it's a shame that the menu doesn't
rotate to make it easier to read when the

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.950
camera is on its side.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.750
Full HD video technology is becoming increasingly
important feature and the 1DX has ports to

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.009
connect both an external mic and headphones
to monitor sound recording.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.739
Helpfully, this dial is touch-sensitive during
video shooting and can be used to adjust the

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.650
exposure compensation and the sound level.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.519
Tapping the top or bottom of the dial switches
between the two options, while tapping the

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.840
left or right sides adjusts the settings.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.200
Although it can't match the Nikon D800 for
resolving power, the 1DX is still capable

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.819
of capturing a lot of detail and on the whole
JPEG images look great straight from the camera.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.739
As usual, post capture adjustment of the raw
files is the best option for maximising image

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.739
quality.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.450
In evaluative mode the iFCL metering does
an excellent job with the exposure and the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.480
auto white balance system produces natural
looking, if slightly warm, images.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.390
Noise is also extremely well controlled and
images captured at ISO 51,200 generally look

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.909
great even at A3 size.

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.599
All things considered the 1DX is an excellent,
if expensive camera.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.540
