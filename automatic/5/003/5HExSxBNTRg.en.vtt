hey<00:00:19.600> guys<00:00:19.780> today<00:00:20.260> I'm<00:00:20.530> going<00:00:20.650> to<00:00:20.740> talk<00:00:20.920> about

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
hey guys today I'm going to talk about

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.670 
hey guys today I'm going to talk about
eye<00:00:21.369> movement<00:00:22.020> now<00:00:23.020> there<00:00:23.230> is<00:00:23.320> lots<00:00:23.560> of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
eye movement now there is lots of

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.950 
eye movement now there is lots of
different<00:00:23.740> kinds<00:00:24.400> of<00:00:24.490> eye<00:00:24.700> movements<00:00:25.420> and

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
different kinds of eye movements and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.870 
different kinds of eye movements and
then<00:00:26.350> for<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.680> sauce<00:00:26.860> of<00:00:27.010> different<00:00:27.310> kinds<00:00:27.610> of

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
then for the sauce of different kinds of

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.990 
then for the sauce of different kinds of
ways<00:00:28.450> to<00:00:28.480> test<00:00:28.900> them<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.369> your<00:00:30.520> eyes<00:00:30.640> can<00:00:30.820> move

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
ways to test them so your eyes can move

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.110 
ways to test them so your eyes can move
up<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.300> down<00:00:31.450> in<00:00:31.779> and<00:00:32.050> out<00:00:32.169> and<00:00:32.590> in<00:00:33.580> a<00:00:33.670> circle

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
up and down in and out and in a circle

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.939 
up and down in and out and in a circle
and<00:00:34.330> each<00:00:34.780> of<00:00:35.020> your<00:00:35.199> eyes<00:00:35.320> can<00:00:35.590> do<00:00:35.770> this

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
and each of your eyes can do this

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.160 
and each of your eyes can do this
individually<00:00:36.250> so<00:00:37.239> when<00:00:37.449> you're<00:00:37.660> moving<00:00:37.809> just

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
individually so when you're moving just

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.570 
individually so when you're moving just
one<00:00:38.440> eye<00:00:38.470> is<00:00:39.460> called<00:00:39.730> adduction<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:42.340> both<00:00:42.550> of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
one eye is called adduction one both of

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.729 
one eye is called adduction one both of
your<00:00:42.850> eyes<00:00:42.970> move<00:00:43.239> together<00:00:43.449> like<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:44.500> you're

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
your eyes move together like if you're

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.670 
your eyes move together like if you're
reading<00:00:45.010> or<00:00:45.460> following<00:00:45.970> an<00:00:46.090> object<00:00:46.680> then

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
reading or following an object then

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.160 
reading or following an object then
that's<00:00:47.980> called<00:00:48.370> versions<00:00:49.030> there's<00:00:49.690> two<00:00:49.870> kinds

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
that's called versions there's two kinds

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.860 
that's called versions there's two kinds
of<00:00:50.260> versions<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.160> first<00:00:51.430> is<00:00:51.730> called<00:00:52.480> a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
of versions and the first is called a

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.310 
of versions and the first is called a
cicada<00:00:53.500> which<00:00:54.219> is<00:00:54.399> a<00:00:54.430> fast<00:00:54.820> moving<00:00:55.360> movement

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
cicada which is a fast moving movement

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.130 
cicada which is a fast moving movement
from<00:00:56.500> point<00:00:56.739> A<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:56.920> B<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:58.180> second<00:00:58.660> kind<00:00:58.809> is

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
from point A to B and the second kind is

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.350 
from point A to B and the second kind is
called<00:00:59.200> a<00:00:59.530> pursuit<00:00:59.980> which<00:01:00.640> is<00:01:00.790> like<00:01:00.940> pursuit

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
called a pursuit which is like pursuit

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.690 
called a pursuit which is like pursuit
like<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:02.320> follow<00:01:02.559> something<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.370> if<00:01:03.520> you're

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
like to follow something so if you're

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.170 
like to follow something so if you're
following<00:01:04.350> something<00:01:05.350> slow<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.940> Third

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
following something slow and the Third

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.639 
following something slow and the Third
Kind<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.660> eye<00:01:07.810> movement<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.320> called<00:01:08.470> the

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
Kind of eye movement is called the

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.960 
Kind of eye movement is called the
Regents<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.690> that's<00:01:10.690> when<00:01:10.960> your<00:01:11.110> eyes<00:01:11.970> work

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
Regents and that's when your eyes work

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.850 
Regents and that's when your eyes work
together<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.750> move<00:01:13.899> towards<00:01:14.380> each<00:01:14.500> other<00:01:14.710> or

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
together to move towards each other or

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.109 
together to move towards each other or
away<00:01:15.310> from<00:01:15.340> each<00:01:15.759> other

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
away from each other

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.870 
away from each other
it's<00:01:16.780> like<00:01:16.990> convergence<00:01:17.649> and<00:01:17.860> divergence<00:01:17.890> we

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
it's like convergence and divergence we

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.600 
it's like convergence and divergence we
just<00:01:19.090> classify<00:01:19.840> it<00:01:19.960> all<00:01:20.259> as<00:01:20.470> virgins<00:01:20.950> now<00:01:21.550> the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
just classify it all as virgins now the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.080 
just classify it all as virgins now the
reason<00:01:22.030> we<00:01:22.180> have<00:01:22.210> two<00:01:22.509> tests<00:01:22.810> we<00:01:23.140> use<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:24.090> to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
reason we have two tests we use is to

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.120 
reason we have two tests we use is to
see<00:01:25.299> if<00:01:25.570> there's<00:01:25.810> any<00:01:26.020> problems<00:01:26.560> with<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.100> eye

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
see if there's any problems with the eye

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.390 
see if there's any problems with the eye
muscle<00:01:27.850> there's<00:01:28.200> six<00:01:29.200> eye<00:01:29.560> muscles<00:01:30.010> we<00:01:30.220> want

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
muscle there's six eye muscles we want

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.039 
muscle there's six eye muscles we want
to<00:01:30.490> see<00:01:30.580> if<00:01:30.670> there's<00:01:30.820> any<00:01:31.030> problems<00:01:31.600> with<00:01:31.810> them

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
to see if there's any problems with them

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.600 
to see if there's any problems with them
like<00:01:32.290> if<00:01:32.439> they're<00:01:32.619> too<00:01:32.830> weak<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:33.280> could<00:01:33.430> also

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
like if they're too weak we could also

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.280 
like if they're too weak we could also
see<00:01:33.939> if<00:01:34.030> there's<00:01:34.210> problems<00:01:34.659> with<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.930> nerves

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
see if there's problems with the nerves

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.570 
see if there's problems with the nerves
there's<00:01:35.530> three<00:01:35.710> turn<00:01:36.009> your<00:01:36.040> nerves<00:01:36.430> that

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
there's three turn your nerves that

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.609 
there's three turn your nerves that
innervate<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.330> muscles<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:38.200> control<00:01:38.439> eye

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
innervate the muscles that control eye

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.320 
innervate the muscles that control eye
we're<00:01:39.009> also<00:01:39.159> checking<00:01:39.490> if<00:01:39.759> there's<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.000> problem

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
we're also checking if there's a problem

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.749 
we're also checking if there's a problem
there<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.810> third<00:01:41.500> thing<00:01:41.770> we<00:01:41.920> can<00:01:42.100> check<00:01:42.310> is<00:01:42.580> if

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
there a third thing we can check is if

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.300 
there a third thing we can check is if
there's<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.119> problem<00:01:43.390> in<00:01:43.720> between<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:45.070> nerve

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
there's a problem in between the nerve

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.039 
there's a problem in between the nerve
and<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.759> muscle<00:01:46.150> at<00:01:46.330> what<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.689> called<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
and the muscle at what is called the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.319 
and the muscle at what is called the
neuromuscular<00:01:47.650> Junction<00:01:48.340> some<00:01:48.729> chemicals

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
neuromuscular Junction some chemicals

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.109 
neuromuscular Junction some chemicals
that<00:01:49.479> move<00:01:49.960> back<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.470> forth<00:01:50.770> from<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.700> end<00:01:51.970> of

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
that move back and forth from the end of

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.819 
that move back and forth from the end of
the<00:01:52.210> nerve<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.750> muscle<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.409> want<00:01:53.740> to

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
the nerve to the muscle and we want to

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.460 
the nerve to the muscle and we want to
see<00:01:53.979> all<00:01:54.250> those<00:01:54.579> chemicals<00:01:55.119> are<00:01:55.360> working<00:01:56.290> well

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
see all those chemicals are working well

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.960 
see all those chemicals are working well
we<00:01:56.799> can<00:01:56.979> also<00:01:57.130> see<00:01:57.400> if<00:01:57.490> there's<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.759> problem

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
we can also see if there's a problem

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.880 
we can also see if there's a problem
with<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.479> brain<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:59.200> part<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.680> brain<00:01:59.860> and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
with the brain the part of the brain and

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.880 
with the brain the part of the brain and
where<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.189> nerves<00:02:00.570> come<00:02:01.570> from<00:02:01.869> we<00:02:02.170> can<00:02:02.380> see<00:02:02.649> if

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
where the nerves come from we can see if

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.009 
where the nerves come from we can see if
there's<00:02:03.130> any<00:02:03.369> space-occupying<00:02:04.409> lesions<00:02:05.409> like

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:07.019 
there's any space-occupying lesions like

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:10.410 
there's any space-occupying lesions like
tumors<00:02:08.019> or<00:02:08.290> any<00:02:08.440> other<00:02:08.649> lesions<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.420> might

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
tumors or any other lesions that might

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
smooth pursuits and we use the pen light

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.890 
smooth pursuits and we use the pen light
and<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> transilluminator<00:02:34.970> or<00:02:35.300> sometimes

just<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.260> stick<00:02:36.530> can<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.040> say<00:02:37.270> we<00:02:38.270> ask<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
just a stick can we say we ask the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.660 
just a stick can we say we ask the
patient<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.110> keep<00:02:39.350> their<00:02:39.500> headstone<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.220> to

patient to keep their headstone and to

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.070 
patient to keep their headstone and to
follow<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.180> light<00:02:41.330> with<00:02:41.360> their<00:02:41.630> eyes<00:02:41.810> only

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
follow the light with their eyes only

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.900 
follow the light with their eyes only
and<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.770> patient<00:02:43.130> follows<00:02:43.430> with<00:02:43.580> their<00:02:43.760> eyes

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and the patient follows with their eyes

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.630 
and the patient follows with their eyes
and<00:02:44.420> then<00:02:44.540> we<00:02:44.660> go<00:02:44.810> up<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.710> pattern<00:02:46.220> like

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
and then we go up and a pattern like

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.720 
and then we go up and a pattern like
this<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.590> then<00:02:51.770> sometimes<00:02:52.190> we<00:02:52.370> could<00:02:52.550> go

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
this and then sometimes we could go

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.150 
this and then sometimes we could go
around<00:02:53.090> domestic<00:02:53.390> mess<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.200> check<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.890> smooth

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
around domestic mess to check the smooth

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.640 
around domestic mess to check the smooth
pursuit<00:02:55.490> usually<00:02:56.240> what<00:02:56.450> we<00:02:56.600> do<00:02:56.840> immediately

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
pursuit usually what we do immediately

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.140 
pursuit usually what we do immediately
following<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:58.550> because<00:02:58.820> it's<00:02:58.970> easy

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
following that just because it's easy

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.580 
following that just because it's easy
because<00:02:59.390> we<00:02:59.630> have<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.960> pen<00:03:00.140> light<00:03:00.350> right<00:03:00.560> in

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
because we have the pen light right in

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.590 
because we have the pen light right in
their<00:03:00.800> hand<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.190> we<00:03:01.280> check<00:03:01.520> your<00:03:01.700> ability<00:03:02.150> to

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
their hand so we check your ability to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.200 
their hand so we check your ability to
converge<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.500> diverge<00:03:03.560> slowly<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.910> we<00:03:05.000> move

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
converge and diverge slowly so we move

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.990 
converge and diverge slowly so we move
the<00:03:05.390> pen<00:03:05.660> light<00:03:05.840> slowly<00:03:06.200> towards<00:03:06.740> the

the pen light slowly towards the
person's<00:03:08.000> eyes<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.540> we<00:03:08.600> tell<00:03:08.810> them<00:03:08.960> to<00:03:09.050> keep

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
person's eyes and we tell them to keep

this normal to start to see double

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.730 
this normal to start to see double
because<00:03:17.150> it's<00:03:17.330> hard<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.570> keep<00:03:17.840> your<00:03:18.080> eyes

this<00:03:58.930> and<00:04:00.100> see<00:04:01.100> if<00:04:01.250> they<00:04:01.550> can<00:04:01.760> do<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.150> all

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
this and see if they can do it in all

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.600 
this and see if they can do it in all
those<00:04:02.570> different<00:04:02.959> directions<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:04.310> can<00:04:04.459> also

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
those different directions you can also

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.050 
those different directions you can also
do<00:04:05.180> regions<00:04:05.870> as<00:04:06.080> fast<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:07.010> can<00:04:07.160> tell<00:04:07.910> them

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
do regions as fast and you can tell them

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.760 
do regions as fast and you can tell them
to<00:04:08.090> look<00:04:08.300> at<00:04:08.450> your<00:04:08.570> nose<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.230> then<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.500> look<00:04:09.650> at

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
to look at your nose and then to look at

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.380 
to look at your nose and then to look at
their<00:04:09.920> film<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.340> they're<00:04:10.520> holding<00:04:10.820> here<00:04:10.970> and

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
their film that they're holding here and

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.150 
their film that they're holding here and
same<00:04:11.959> plane<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.260> can<00:04:12.410> see<00:04:12.560> if<00:04:12.680> they<00:04:12.800> doing<00:04:13.070> it

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
same plane you can see if they doing it

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.210 
same plane you can see if they doing it
accurately<00:04:13.700> smoothly<00:04:14.270> and<00:04:14.660> quickly<00:04:15.220> there

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
accurately smoothly and quickly there

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.500 
accurately smoothly and quickly there
are<00:04:16.280> two<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.520> their<00:04:16.640> special<00:04:17.030> kinds<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.359> eye

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
are two of their special kinds of eye

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.180 
are two of their special kinds of eye
movements<00:04:18.080> movements<00:04:18.410> that<00:04:18.830> I've<00:04:18.920> talked

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
movements movements that I've talked

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.390 
movements movements that I've talked
about<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.730> far<00:04:19.970> are<00:04:20.410> ones<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.739> can<00:04:21.980> make<00:04:22.010> your

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
about so far are ones that can make your

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.990 
about so far are ones that can make your
eyes<00:04:22.580> look<00:04:22.610> from<00:04:23.480> one<00:04:23.660> place<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:23.990> another

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
eyes look from one place to another

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.020 
eyes look from one place to another
these<00:04:25.570> are<00:04:25.930> movements<00:04:26.220> off-key<00:04:27.220> low<00:04:27.430> kinetic

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
these are movements off-key low kinetic

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.610 
these are movements off-key low kinetic
nystagmus<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:29.730> vestibulo-ocular<00:04:30.730> reflex

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
nystagmus and vestibulo-ocular reflex

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.590 
nystagmus and vestibulo-ocular reflex
these<00:04:32.620> two<00:04:32.890> eye<00:04:32.950> movements<00:04:33.670> make<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.270> look<00:04:34.450> at

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
these two eye movements make you look at

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.120 
these two eye movements make you look at
the<00:04:34.720> same<00:04:34.930> thing<00:04:35.230> when<00:04:35.500> even<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.950> yourself

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
the same thing when even you yourself

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.370 
the same thing when even you yourself
are<00:04:36.670> moving<00:04:37.030> or<00:04:37.210> when<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.570> world<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.080> moving

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
are moving or when the world is moving

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.990 
are moving or when the world is moving
around<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:38.920> might<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.280> noticed<00:04:39.670> after

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
around you might have noticed after

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.720 
around you might have noticed after
spinning<00:04:40.450> around<00:04:40.570> or<00:04:41.430> sometimes<00:04:42.430> people

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
spinning around or sometimes people

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.190 
spinning around or sometimes people
usually<00:04:42.880> notice<00:04:43.330> if<00:04:43.480> like<00:04:43.690> they're<00:04:43.900> brother

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
usually notice if like they're brother

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.380 
usually notice if like they're brother
and<00:04:44.320> sister<00:04:44.620> spins<00:04:45.340> around<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.700> circle<00:04:46.180> for<00:04:46.360> a

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
and sister spins around the circle for a

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.270 
and sister spins around the circle for a
while<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:46.960> then<00:04:47.260> they<00:04:47.380> stop<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:48.040> try<00:04:48.250> to

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
while and then they stop and I try to

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.040 
while and then they stop and I try to
look<00:04:48.490> still<00:04:48.790> their<00:04:49.300> eyes<00:04:49.450> are<00:04:49.660> moving<00:04:49.780> around

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
look still their eyes are moving around

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.920 
look still their eyes are moving around
like<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.520> that's<00:04:51.520> because<00:04:51.970> of<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.390> stabile

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
like that that's because of the stabile

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.710 
like that that's because of the stabile
Acula<00:04:53.440> reflex<00:04:53.890> and<00:04:54.190> another<00:04:54.880> thing<00:04:55.240> is<00:04:55.510> when

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
Acula reflex and another thing is when

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.190 
Acula reflex and another thing is when
the<00:04:56.200> world<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.680> actually<00:04:57.160> moving<00:04:57.480> like<00:04:58.480> here<00:04:59.170> I

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
the world is actually moving like here I

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.270 
the world is actually moving like here I
have<00:04:59.530> an<00:04:59.920> OK<00:05:00.790> hand<00:05:00.970> drum<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.830> think<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:03.010> will

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
have an OK hand drum I think this will

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.570 
have an OK hand drum I think this will
show<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.090> ocular<00:05:04.870> kinetic<00:05:05.350> nystagmus<00:05:05.740> so<00:05:06.460> if

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
show the ocular kinetic nystagmus so if

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.900 
show the ocular kinetic nystagmus so if
I<00:05:06.730> try<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.090> look<00:05:08.020> at<00:05:08.170> one<00:05:08.350> place<00:05:08.680> my<00:05:09.460> eyes<00:05:09.640> won't

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
I try to look at one place my eyes won't

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.940 
I try to look at one place my eyes won't
move<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.300> stay<00:05:10.480> in<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.720> one<00:05:10.870> place<00:05:11.080> let<00:05:11.710> me<00:05:11.800> see

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
move to stay in the one place let me see

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.280 
move to stay in the one place let me see
if<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.130> can<00:05:12.310> show<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.610> because<00:05:13.090> it's<00:05:13.480> moving<00:05:13.960> my

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
if I can show you because it's moving my

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.260 
if I can show you because it's moving my
eyes<00:05:14.440> are<00:05:14.650> gonna<00:05:14.740> just<00:05:15.280> naturally<00:05:15.790> follow<00:05:16.030> it

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
eyes are gonna just naturally follow it

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.840 
eyes are gonna just naturally follow it
but<00:05:17.020> because<00:05:17.200> I<00:05:17.470> want<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.740> keep<00:05:18.310> my<00:05:18.490> eyes<00:05:18.670> in

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
but because I want to keep my eyes in

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.330 
but because I want to keep my eyes in
the<00:05:18.910> same<00:05:19.090> place<00:05:19.420> it'll<00:05:19.740> move<00:05:20.740> back<00:05:21.040> to<00:05:21.250> the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
the same place it'll move back to the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.130 
the same place it'll move back to the
original<00:05:21.370> place<00:05:22.030> but<00:05:22.570> then<00:05:22.720> and<00:05:22.870> I'll<00:05:22.960> keep

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
original place but then and I'll keep

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.180 
original place but then and I'll keep
following<00:05:23.650> it<00:05:23.710> again

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
following it again

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.490 
following it again
and<00:05:24.730> it<00:05:24.850> goes<00:05:25.000> in<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.240> cycle<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.840> those<00:05:29.020> are<00:05:29.200> a

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
and it goes in a cycle so those are a

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.620 
and it goes in a cycle so those are a
reasonable<00:05:30.160> number<00:05:30.400> of<00:05:30.970> tests<00:05:31.300> that<00:05:31.450> you<00:05:31.600> can

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
reasonable number of tests that you can

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.060 
reasonable number of tests that you can
just<00:05:31.900> do<00:05:31.990> in<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.169> couple<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.530> minutes<00:05:32.830> so

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
just do in a couple of minutes so

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.340 
just do in a couple of minutes so
problems<00:05:33.610> with<00:05:34.240> any<00:05:34.480> of<00:05:34.630> these<00:05:34.840> kind<00:05:35.169> of<00:05:35.260> eye

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
problems with any of these kind of eye

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.110 
problems with any of these kind of eye
movements<00:05:35.980> can<00:05:36.190> lead<00:05:36.370> to<00:05:36.490> problems<00:05:36.700> with

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
movements can lead to problems with

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.600 
movements can lead to problems with
reading<00:05:37.930> or<00:05:38.050> following<00:05:38.530> any<00:05:38.680> object<00:05:39.190> showing

future<00:05:52.540> any<00:05:53.530> problems<00:05:54.070> that<00:05:54.220> we<00:05:54.370> might<00:05:54.550> find

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
future any problems that we might find

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.100 
future any problems that we might find
with<00:05:55.900> any<00:05:56.110> of<00:05:56.320> these<00:05:56.470> could<00:05:56.890> lead<00:05:57.100> to<00:05:57.130> that<00:05:57.460> or

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
with any of these could lead to that or

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.290 
with any of these could lead to that or
it<00:05:59.110> could<00:05:59.350> also<00:05:59.620> indicate<00:06:00.220> that<00:06:00.610> that<00:06:01.120> there's

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
it could also indicate that that there's

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.750 
it could also indicate that that there's
a<00:06:01.360> problem<00:06:01.690> at<00:06:02.260> any<00:06:02.890> of<00:06:03.100> the<00:06:03.220> levels<00:06:03.370> that<00:06:03.700> I

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
a problem at any of the levels that I

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.909 
a problem at any of the levels that I
mentioned<00:06:04.240> before<00:06:04.330> so<00:06:05.230> I'm<00:06:05.350> just<00:06:05.500> gonna<00:06:05.650> miss

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
mentioned before so I'm just gonna miss

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.070 
mentioned before so I'm just gonna miss
some<00:06:06.130> of<00:06:06.160> the<00:06:06.360> disorders<00:06:07.360> or<00:06:07.600> the<00:06:07.690> problems

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
some of the disorders or the problems

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.780 
some of the disorders or the problems
here<00:06:08.290> that<00:06:08.590> could<00:06:08.770> lead<00:06:09.010> to<00:06:09.040> bad<00:06:09.760> eye

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
here that could lead to bad eye

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.330 
here that could lead to bad eye
movements<00:06:10.600> just<00:06:11.350> like<00:06:11.530> most<00:06:11.770> of<00:06:11.919> our<00:06:12.070> other

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
movements just like most of our other

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.560 
movements just like most of our other
tests<00:06:12.610> this<00:06:12.760> is<00:06:12.910> a<00:06:12.940> pretty<00:06:13.180> simple

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
tests this is a pretty simple

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.780 
tests this is a pretty simple
straightforward<00:06:14.020> test<00:06:14.560> that<00:06:15.310> could<00:06:15.490> lead<00:06:15.760> to

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
straightforward test that could lead to

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.450 
straightforward test that could lead to
finding<00:06:16.630> a<00:06:16.720> lot<00:06:16.870> of<00:06:17.020> different<00:06:17.380> things<00:06:17.560> so<00:06:17.919> I

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
finding a lot of different things so I

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.460 
finding a lot of different things so I
