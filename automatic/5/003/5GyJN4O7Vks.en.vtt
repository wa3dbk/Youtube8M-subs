00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
reserves and you know like the youth

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.720 
reserves and you know like the youth
squad<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.170> I'm<00:03:05.410> assuming<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:05.860> guy<00:03:06.070> has<00:03:06.400> come

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
squad so I'm assuming this guy has come

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.910 
squad so I'm assuming this guy has come
through<00:03:06.940> there<00:03:07.210> and<00:03:07.360> he<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:08.410> seemed<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:08.560> a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
through there and he just seemed like a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.590
