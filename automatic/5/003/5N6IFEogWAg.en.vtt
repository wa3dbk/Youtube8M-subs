00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.050
 hello everyone I'm a teacher 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.240
 Conservatory of Gijón 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.190
 we continue with the fifth video 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.050
 explanation on the benefits of 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.850
 breathing apparatus have for the 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.330
 musicians playing wind instruments 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.800
 wood wind metal and also for 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.859
 singers 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.730
 today I'm going to talk about the tri flow this 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.970
 apparatus consists of three balls 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.039
 located in three interconnected chambers 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.519
 and it has been designed to practice 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.739
 prolonged maximum inhalation benefits 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.680
 that gives us the use of this device 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.720
 first help us to develop improve 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.780
 and maintain our ability 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.000
 second respiratory allows us 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.309
 work visually inhaling the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.670
 air in two different ways one 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.219
 slow to raise the ball of the first 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.989
 camera and another one a little faster when 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.760
 we raise the balls together 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.260
 the first of the second bed 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 On the contrary, if we turn it over 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.549
 we can also work the exhalation 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.990
 slow in the same way as in the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.479
 inhalation 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.920
 by focusing on keeping the ball 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.200
 balls up is power that the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.020
 inhalation is much more complete and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.810
 deep without hardly thinking about it as 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.060
 we use it because it is very simple we place 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.890
 the apparatus vertically and we 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.700
 we empty of air for next 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.560
 inhale through the touring 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.479
 the next step would be to make a 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.549
 radiation looking to fill us with air 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.039
 completely but only lifting the 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.890
 ball of the first camera which 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.929
 will produce an inhalation will be made of 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.429
 slow and prolonged way and this is what 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.759
 that we can repeat as many times as 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.759
 want 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.909
 in following the next step would be 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.079
 inhale while lifting the balls 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.060
 located in the first in the second 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.700
 camera which will produce us 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.200
 fill in a faster way and 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.239
 we always have to be careful that 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.239
 the grandmother of the third chamber stayed 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.299
 we will repeat these exercises before and 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.610
 during instrumental practice so 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.379
 both the use of the tri flow 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.870
 trains us to perform inhalations 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.819
 slow and deep 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.060
 You can find more information about 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.549
 this topic on my website www the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.260
 dotcom victim and in my blog the class 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.120
 Conservatory of you to gijón one 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.120
 greeting and until the next video
