I<00:00:46.940> don't<00:00:47.089> know<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.780> just<00:00:48.739> vote<00:00:49.549> there<00:00:49.879> and

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
I don't know and just vote there and

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.579 
I don't know and just vote there and
then<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.449> check<00:00:50.839> that<00:00:50.960> every<00:00:51.199> day<00:00:51.320> and

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
then I check that every day and

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.630 
then I check that every day and
basically<00:00:52.519> I<00:00:52.610> just<00:00:52.670> make<00:00:53.000> a<00:00:53.869> video<00:00:54.559> if<00:00:55.040> enough

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
basically I just make a video if enough

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.479 
basically I just make a video if enough
people<00:00:55.670> like<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:56.949> that's<00:00:57.949> what<00:00:58.339> I'm<00:00:58.400> doing

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
people like it so that's what I'm doing

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.820 
people like it so that's what I'm doing
today<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.269> I'll<00:01:00.019> be<00:01:00.049> scrambling<00:01:00.470> with<00:01:00.589> white

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
today and I'll be scrambling with white

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.429 
today and I'll be scrambling with white
on<00:01:00.949> top<00:01:01.129> green<00:01:01.460> on<00:01:01.610> front<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.920> think<00:01:05.170> yeah

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
on top green on front and I think yeah

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.210 
on top green on front and I think yeah
oh<00:01:06.670> also<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:07.939> is<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:08.590> 1080p<00:01:09.590> I<00:01:09.619> just<00:01:09.920> want<00:01:10.100> to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
oh also this is in 1080p I just want to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920 
oh also this is in 1080p I just want to
see<00:01:10.400> if<00:01:10.670> there's<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.150> huge<00:01:11.390> difference<00:01:11.600> between

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
see if there's a huge difference between

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.770 
see if there's a huge difference between
video<00:01:12.320> quality<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:13.820> it's<00:01:14.090> also<00:01:14.360> sort<00:01:14.630> of<00:01:14.689> a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
video quality so it's also sort of a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.640 
video quality so it's also sort of a
camera<00:01:15.110> test<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:15.619> hope<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:16.250> guys<00:01:16.280> enjoy<00:01:20.650> okay

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
camera test so hope you guys enjoy okay

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.190 
camera test so hope you guys enjoy okay
so<00:01:21.770> here's<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.340> first<00:01:22.580> scramble<00:01:24.850> first

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
so here's the first scramble first

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.580 
so here's the first scramble first
obviously<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.290> see<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:27.710> white<00:01:29.350> white<00:01:30.350> piece

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
obviously I see this white white piece

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.500 
obviously I see this white white piece
here<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.010> then<00:01:31.159> there's<00:01:31.340> blue<00:01:31.610> orange<00:01:32.360> and

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
here and then there's blue orange and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.530 
here and then there's blue orange and
red<00:01:33.520> normally<00:01:34.520> for<00:01:34.700> something<00:01:34.970> like<00:01:35.120> this<00:01:35.300> I

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
red normally for something like this I

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.490 
red normally for something like this I
would<00:01:35.870> probably<00:01:40.840> there's<00:01:41.840> not<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.050> great<00:01:42.350> way

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
would probably there's not a great way

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.260 
would probably there's not a great way
to<00:01:42.530> do<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.920> because<00:01:43.100> since<00:01:43.880> green<00:01:44.150> is

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
to do this because since green is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.570 
to do this because since green is
already<00:01:44.510> down<00:01:44.690> here<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.830> red<00:01:46.220> piece<00:01:46.400> is

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
already down here this red piece is

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.640 
already down here this red piece is
gonna<00:01:46.729> have<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.180> be<00:01:47.330> shifted<00:01:47.870> around<00:01:48.110> anyway

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
gonna have to be shifted around anyway

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.950 
gonna have to be shifted around anyway
so<00:01:49.580> for<00:01:49.729> something<00:01:49.909> like<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.600> would

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
so for something like this I would

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.580 
so for something like this I would
probably<00:01:52.030> see<00:01:53.030> something<00:01:53.360> like<00:01:53.840> this<00:01:54.050> so<00:01:54.409> this

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
probably see something like this so this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.800 
probably see something like this so this
is<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:54.920> knife<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.460> appear<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:55.940> I<00:01:56.570> would

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
is a knife to appear and I would

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.350 
is a knife to appear and I would
probably<00:01:57.140> track<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.040> just<00:01:58.940> do<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> slower

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
probably track that and just do a slower

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.840 
probably track that and just do a slower
cross<00:01:59.659> off<00:01:59.870> so<00:02:00.140> for<00:02:00.590> instance<00:02:00.979> if<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.790> do

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
cross off so for instance if I do

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.880 
cross off so for instance if I do
something<00:02:02.299> like<00:02:02.330> this<00:02:02.690> I<00:02:02.960> see<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.440> these<00:02:03.650> two

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
something like this I see that these two

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.120 
something like this I see that these two
are<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.190> checkerboarded<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.260> as<00:02:06.260> I<00:02:06.740> finish

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
are now checkerboarded and as I finish

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.059 
are now checkerboarded and as I finish
this<00:02:07.310> cross<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:08.869> know<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.560> these<00:02:09.709> two<00:02:09.890> pieces

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
this cross I know that these two pieces

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.479 
this cross I know that these two pieces
are<00:02:10.340> right<00:02:10.459> there<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.780> it's<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.590> lengthy<00:02:12.920> cross

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
are right there so it's a lengthy cross

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.880 
are right there so it's a lengthy cross
solution<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.230> way<00:02:15.319> it's<00:02:15.470> worth<00:02:15.650> it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
solution but in a way it's worth it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.830 
solution but in a way it's worth it
because<00:02:16.790> it'll<00:02:18.069> put<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.159> the<00:02:19.250> wrong<00:02:19.400> spot

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
because it'll put in the wrong spot

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.559 
because it'll put in the wrong spot
because<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:21.200> it'll<00:02:22.129> decrease<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.269> time<00:02:23.450> it

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
because it's it'll decrease the time it

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.959 
because it's it'll decrease the time it
takes<00:02:23.659> me<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.930> transition<00:02:24.799> so<00:02:25.579> right<00:02:25.790> after

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
takes me to transition so right after

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.970 
takes me to transition so right after
that<00:02:26.269> there's<00:02:26.569> these<00:02:26.810> two<00:02:26.989> pieces<00:02:27.170> hopefully

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
that there's these two pieces hopefully

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.059 
that there's these two pieces hopefully
it's<00:02:28.129> obvious<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.620> probably<00:02:30.620> just<00:02:30.860> break

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
it's obvious to you probably just break

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.430 
it's obvious to you probably just break
it<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.180> give<00:02:32.920> rotation<00:02:34.000> insert<00:02:35.319> from<00:02:36.319> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
it up and give rotation insert from the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.570 
it up and give rotation insert from the
back<00:02:36.650> which<00:02:37.340> sounds<00:02:37.730> pretty<00:02:37.909> dirty<00:02:39.580> here

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
back which sounds pretty dirty here

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.600 
back which sounds pretty dirty here
these<00:02:41.090> two<00:02:41.269> are<00:02:41.330> pretty<00:02:41.450> obvious<00:02:42.610> something

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
these two are pretty obvious something

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.170 
these two are pretty obvious something
they<00:02:44.030> think<00:02:44.150> really<00:02:44.450> sets<00:02:45.670> 15-second<00:02:46.670> salts

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
they think really sets 15-second salts

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.180 
they think really sets 15-second salts
and<00:02:47.680> 12<00:02:48.680> seconds<00:02:48.950> selves<00:02:49.160> apart<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:51.190> you

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
and 12 seconds selves apart is that you

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.920 
and 12 seconds selves apart is that you
have<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.459> sort<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.730> learn<00:02:52.879> to<00:02:53.030> prioritize<00:02:53.209> I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
have to sort of learn to prioritize I

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.569 
have to sort of learn to prioritize I
think<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.319> lot<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.560> people<00:02:54.769> would<00:02:54.860> get<00:02:55.040> greedy

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
think a lot of people would get greedy

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.080 
think a lot of people would get greedy
see<00:02:56.030> this<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.599> pare<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.409> do<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.970> know

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
see this and pare it and do you know

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.240 
see this and pare it and do you know
whatever<00:02:59.440> in<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.590> case<00:03:00.799> I<00:03:00.920> think<00:03:00.980> I'm<00:03:01.129> going

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
whatever in this case I think I'm going

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.430 
whatever in this case I think I'm going
to<00:03:01.310> do<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.420> notice<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.260> pairs

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
to do this and I notice that it pairs

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.819 
to do this and I notice that it pairs
with<00:03:03.560> this<00:03:03.769> corner<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.819> I<00:03:04.910> can<00:03:05.090> do<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:08.290> now<00:03:09.290> if

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
with this corner so I can do that now if

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.050 
with this corner so I can do that now if
I<00:03:10.310> insert<00:03:10.790> you'll<00:03:11.569> notice<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:13.430> splits

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
I insert you'll notice that it splits

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.869 
I insert you'll notice that it splits
these<00:03:14.390> two<00:03:14.629> back<00:03:14.930> up<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.180> harder

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
these two back up and this is a harder

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.729 
these two back up and this is a harder
case<00:03:19.879> than<00:03:19.940> before<00:03:20.569> when<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.840> was<00:03:20.930> about<00:03:21.500> right

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
case than before when it was about right

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.080 
case than before when it was about right
here<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.180> pair<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.709> insert<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.879> fat

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
here so pair and insert and this is fat

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.089 
here so pair and insert and this is fat
soon<00:03:26.359> I<00:03:26.540> might<00:03:27.379> make<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> video<00:03:27.769> in<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.069> future

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
soon I might make a video in the future

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.830 
soon I might make a video in the future
talking<00:03:28.760> about<00:03:28.910> how<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.090> memorize<00:03:29.450> olls

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
talking about how to memorize olls

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.990 
talking about how to memorize olls
because<00:03:30.379> basically<00:03:31.160> if<00:03:31.670> you're<00:03:31.819> having

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
because basically if you're having

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.400 
because basically if you're having
trouble<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:33.230> very<00:03:33.940> generic<00:03:34.940> tool<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.169> I'm

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
trouble the very generic tool that I'm

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.009 
trouble the very generic tool that I'm
gonna<00:03:36.620> tell<00:03:36.829> you<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.099> that<00:03:37.370> basically<00:03:37.910> all<00:03:38.030> ll

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
gonna tell you is that basically all ll

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.099 
gonna tell you is that basically all ll
cases<00:03:39.440> are<00:03:39.620> just<00:03:40.069> variations<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:41.150> F<00:03:41.569> sexy

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
cases are just variations of the F sexy

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.830 
cases are just variations of the F sexy
F<00:03:42.230> Prime<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.700> soon<00:03:44.000> that's<00:03:44.450> really<00:03:44.690> all

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
F Prime and the soon that's really all

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.319 
F Prime and the soon that's really all
you<00:03:45.019> need<00:03:45.829> as<00:03:46.099> far<00:03:46.160> as<00:03:46.370> finger<00:03:46.639> tricks<00:03:46.910> go<00:03:47.090> and

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
you need as far as finger tricks go and

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.629 
you need as far as finger tricks go and
then<00:03:47.480> it's<00:03:47.660> just<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.230> variations<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.370> the

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
then it's just the variations and the

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.120 
then it's just the variations and the
order<00:03:49.970> at<00:03:50.060> which<00:03:50.209> they<00:03:50.930> come<00:03:51.139> that<00:03:51.470> determines

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
order at which they come that determines

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.740 
order at which they come that determines
which<00:03:52.250> lol<00:03:52.669> you<00:03:52.790> have<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.150> in<00:03:53.269> this<00:03:53.329> case<00:03:53.540> it's

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
which lol you have so in this case it's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.309 
which lol you have so in this case it's
just<00:03:53.780> fat<00:03:54.079> soon<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:56.450> that's<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.989> OL<00:03:57.079> along

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
just fat soon and that's the OL along

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.740 
just fat soon and that's the OL along
here<00:03:58.069> this<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.370> J<00:03:58.639> perm<00:03:58.910> which<00:03:59.209> is<00:03:59.359> one<00:03:59.569> of<00:03:59.599> my

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
here this is J perm which is one of my

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.740 
here this is J perm which is one of my
least<00:03:59.930> favorite<00:04:00.319> PLL's<00:04:00.799> not<00:04:01.069> because<00:04:01.430> I'm

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
least favorite PLL's not because I'm

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.180 
least favorite PLL's not because I'm
slow<00:04:02.750> at<00:04:02.959> it<00:04:02.989> but<00:04:03.290> just<00:04:03.440> because<00:04:03.590> I'm<00:04:03.799> bad<00:04:04.040> in

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
slow at it but just because I'm bad in

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.659 
slow at it but just because I'm bad in
it<00:04:04.280> relative<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.819> everyone<00:04:05.000> else<00:04:05.180> but<00:04:07.989> yeah<00:04:09.669> so

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
it relative to everyone else but yeah so

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.359 
it relative to everyone else but yeah so
that's<00:04:10.819> a<00:04:10.940> first<00:04:11.120> off
