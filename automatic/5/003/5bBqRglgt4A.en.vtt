all<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.779> seventh<00:00:19.199> chords<00:00:20.180> so<00:00:21.180> we're

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
all that the seventh chords so we're

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.950 
all that the seventh chords so we're
using<00:00:22.289> C<00:00:22.710> again<00:00:24.199> C<00:00:25.199> major<00:00:26.160> seventh<00:00:26.789> which<00:00:27.689> will

using C again C major seventh which will

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
using C again C major seventh which will
usually<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.769> indicated<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:30.119> popcorn

next to it or in in jazz music sometimes

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.240 
next to it or in in jazz music sometimes
you'll<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> triangle<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.800> C<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
you'll see a triangle just C and then a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.590 
you'll see a triangle just C and then a
triangle<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.750> means<00:00:46.170> major<00:00:46.590> seven<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
triangle and that means major seven and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.660 
triangle and that means major seven and
that's<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.530> major<00:00:49.739> seat<00:00:51.020> with<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:53.449> major<00:00:54.449> 7

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
that's just a major seat with a major 7

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.420 
that's just a major seat with a major 7
the<00:00:56.670> 7th<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.360> half<00:00:58.079> step<00:00:58.410> down<00:00:58.649> from<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> octave

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the 7th a half step down from the octave

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
the 7th a half step down from the octave
that<00:01:00.289> is<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> major<00:01:02.010> 7th<00:01:02.670> chord<00:01:03.559> now<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that is a major 7th chord now when you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.469 
that is a major 7th chord now when you
see<00:01:05.840> for<00:01:06.840> example<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.549> c7<00:01:08.549> without<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> major

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
see for example a c7 without the major

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.120 
see for example a c7 without the major
in<00:01:09.720> it

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
in it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.170 
in it
c7<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:13.020> means<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.549> means<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
c7 that means it it's that means it's a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.300 
c7 that means it it's that means it's a
C<00:01:15.450> dominant<00:01:15.900> 7<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
C dominant 7 and all that is is that the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
C dominant 7 and all that is is that the
C<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.670> major<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> 7th<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.400> minor<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
C is major and the 7th is minor so you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.420 
C is major and the 7th is minor so you
lower<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.950> 7th<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:27.439> it<00:01:28.439> makes<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> C

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
lower the 7th and it makes it a C

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.300 
lower the 7th and it makes it a C
dominant<00:01:30.240> 7<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.680> Cee<00:01:32.220> G<00:01:32.759> major<00:01:33.570> chord

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
dominant 7 so you have Cee G major chord

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.749 
dominant 7 so you have Cee G major chord
triad<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.750> lowered<00:01:38.030> 7th<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
triad and then the lowered 7th and

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.899 
triad and then the lowered 7th and
that'll<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.850> indicated<00:01:42.420> by<00:01:42.450> C<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
that'll be indicated by C and then the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.760 
that'll be indicated by C and then the
number<00:01:45.240> 7<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:48.259> two<00:01:49.259> half<00:01:49.560> steps

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
number 7 and that is two half steps

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.200 
number 7 and that is two half steps
below<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.549> octave<00:01:53.450> okay<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:56.210> you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
below the octave okay then you have you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.080 
below the octave okay then you have you
have<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> C<00:01:57.899> minor<00:01:58.619> 7th<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.310> this<00:02:01.969> causes<00:02:02.969> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
have a C minor 7th and this causes you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.410 
have a C minor 7th and this causes you
to<00:02:03.119> change<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.079> C<00:02:04.409> chord<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.460> triad<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
to change the C chord this triad to a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.820 
to change the C chord this triad to a
minor

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
minor

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.420 
minor
and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.820> seventh<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.500> also<00:02:10.500> minor<00:02:13.790> okay

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and then the seventh is also minor okay

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.270 
and then the seventh is also minor okay
C<00:02:17.690> minor<00:02:18.690> seventh<00:02:19.370> then<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.490> also<00:02:20.670> have

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
C minor seventh then you also have

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.040 
C minor seventh then you also have
diminished<00:02:25.130> there's<00:02:26.130> half<00:02:26.490> diminished<00:02:27.050> you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
diminished there's half diminished you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.810 
diminished there's half diminished you
probably<00:02:28.650> won't<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:28.980> too<00:02:29.370> much<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
probably won't see too much of this

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.450 
probably won't see too much of this
unless<00:02:30.180> you're<00:02:30.360> playing<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.440> guess<00:02:32.160> jazz

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
unless you're playing like I guess jazz

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.950 
unless you're playing like I guess jazz
music<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.570> there's<00:02:34.190> diminished<00:02:35.240> seventh<00:02:36.240> but

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
music but there's diminished seventh but

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.790 
music but there's diminished seventh but
this<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.320> half<00:02:37.620> diminished<00:02:38.160> seven<00:02:39.680> where<00:02:40.680> you

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
this is half diminished seven where you

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.890 
this is half diminished seven where you
have<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> diminished<00:02:41.340> chord<00:02:41.730> diminished<00:02:42.660> triad

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
have a diminished chord diminished triad

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.380 
have a diminished chord diminished triad
right<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:46.410> minor<00:02:48.380> seventh

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
right here and a minor seventh

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.230 
right here and a minor seventh
that's<00:02:51.390> half<00:02:51.780> diminished<00:02:52.320> seven<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> fully

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
that's half diminished seven but a fully

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.600 
that's half diminished seven but a fully
diminished<00:02:54.540> seventh<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:56.310> still<00:02:56.580> have

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
diminished seventh is you you still have

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.340 
diminished seventh is you you still have
the<00:02:56.880> diminished<00:02:57.300> triad<00:02:57.800> but<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.920> lower<00:02:59.190> and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
the diminished triad but you lower and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.670 
the diminished triad but you lower and
make<00:03:01.350> diminish<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.250> minor<00:03:02.670> seventh<00:03:03.680> so

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
make diminish this minor seventh so

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.250 
make diminish this minor seventh so
that's<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:05.040> fully<00:03:05.400> diminished<00:03:05.990> C<00:03:06.990> chord<00:03:07.650> C<00:03:09.260> C

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
that's a fully diminished C chord C C

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.140 
that's a fully diminished C chord C C
seventh<00:03:10.709> chord<00:03:12.709> fully<00:03:13.709> demisch<00:03:14.040> half<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
seventh chord fully demisch half the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.880 
seventh chord fully demisch half the
measure

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890
