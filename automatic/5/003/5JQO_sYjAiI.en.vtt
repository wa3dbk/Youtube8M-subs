00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.840
 they cut the nails so that you animate to 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.640
 do it yourself the nail has a 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.610
 living part where the glasses are 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.260
 blood and nerve endings 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.950
 and a dead part that is what we have 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.260
 to cut it is important not to arrive 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.110
 to cut the living part will be painful 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.870
 For the dog, the nail will start to 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.600
 Bleed dramatically 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.170
 we will have to cut immediately that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.170
 hemorrhage 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.360
 It is advisable that you have at hand a 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.470
 cutting powder or liquid hemorrhages 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.470
 in case it were the case 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 how to know how far to cut then 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.100
 white nails is easier to see it looks 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.100
 perfectly the pink color of the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 live part we cut hurriedly to the maximum 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.170
 in black it is preferable to cut 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.200
 advancing little by little giving small 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 cuts in that way we make sure you do not 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.750
 get to the living area looking at the nail 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.390
 from below you can also sense where 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.670
 begins the living zone is softer and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.060
 usually colored a little bit more 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.060
 Clear 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.120
 to do it after the bath takes advantage of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.260
 the nails have softened with water 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.420
 hot and you'll see how it's easier 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.670
 The frequency of the cut depends on the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.610
 growth and wear of each dog 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.710
 It is generally advisable to cut them 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.560
 every 15 days 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.380
 do not get distracted it 's very important not 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.140
 neglect those if we let a lot grow 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.800
 the nails the glasses also advance and 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.410
 every time we can cut less nail 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
 the long nails cause that when walking in 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.070
 instead of supporting the weight on 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.860
 pads are made partly on the 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.650
 nails in turn that weight is transferred to 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.950
 bone and that is painful for the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.950
 dog 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.370
 even in extreme cases they can get 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.370
 to deform fingers 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.250
 when choosing a nail clipper is 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.069
 important that the blades cut in the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.170
 nail without bending it must be a good 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.250
 0 with a good edge as are the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.250
 cortauñas ibáñez 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.270
 the size must also be appropriate 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.170
 When in doubt, always choose the nail clippers 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.170
 larger 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.580
 I hope that you have been helpful and that 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.580
 You feel encouraged to do it yourself
