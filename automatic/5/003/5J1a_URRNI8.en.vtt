 importance on the world stage

 while speakers are currently using it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.200
 the history of English began 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.959
 when three Germanic tribes invaded 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.980
 Great Britain during the 5th century 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.069
 these tribes the angles the Saxons and the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.940
 together cross the northern sea where 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.709
 today is denmark and north of germany 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.800
 at that time the inhabitants of the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.500
 spoke the Celtic language with the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.739
 invasion, the Celts had to flee to 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.989
 the west and north more precisely to the 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.770
 region where today is Wales 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.130
 scotland and ireland 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.220
 the English language is divided into three phases 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.400
 the old English the middle and the modern 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.580
 around the year 1000 60 william o 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.820
 conqueror than from normandy 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.660
 of modern France invaded and conquered 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.000
 in england the new conquerors 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.330
 called Normans brought with them the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.570
 becoming the official language of the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.390
 of the ruling classes and of the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.520
 business for a period there was a 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.610
 kind of division of classes 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.760
 languages and thus became the 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.780
 the lowest spoke English and the classes 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.790
 superiors spoke French from the 14th century 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.460
 English became dominant in the grain 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.120
 Britain again but with many 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.150
 French words added this 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.510
 language was denominated average English 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.360
 but it would not be a language 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.910
 easy to understand today the end of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.850
 average English occurred with a sudden and 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.630
 significant change in pronunciation 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.490
 the greatest vowel change 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.990
 specifically with vowels being 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.620
 pronounced with the shortest sound 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.530
 from the 16th century the British had 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.810
 contact with many people around the world 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.240
 a famous example of modern English are 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.790
 the works of Shakespeare and one of his 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.820
 main characters remedies 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.489
 famous for being or not to be or 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.190
 not being a renaissance meant that 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.210
 many new words and phrases entered 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.670
 in the tongue 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.090
 The invention of the press also 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.940
 great significance because now there was more 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.400
 common language in the printing of 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.250

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.710
 people have learned to read the print 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.340
 also brought standardization to English 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.190
 the grammar spelling became fixed 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.130
 and the London dialect where most 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.970
 of publishing houses became 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:58.120
 standard in 1604 the first dictionary 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.979
 English was published today we have many 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.660

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.950
 language of one country or another 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.020
 but an international language of 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.480
 knowledge of all the people of the 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.060
