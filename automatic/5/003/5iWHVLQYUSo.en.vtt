00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
yellow on some of the spikes but it's
only<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:33.960> maybe<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.439> kind<00:01:34.680> of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
only right here or maybe that's kind of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.219 
only right here or maybe that's kind of
a<00:01:34.950> green<00:01:35.520> bright<00:01:36.360> green<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> think<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> back

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
a green bright green I think on the back

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.649 
a green bright green I think on the back
it's<00:01:37.439> bright<00:01:37.650> green<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.210> either<00:01:39.210> yellow<00:01:39.570> or

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it's bright green so either yellow or

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.730 
it's bright green so either yellow or
bright<00:01:39.930> green<00:01:40.170> whatever<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> call

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
bright green whatever you want to call

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.679 
bright green whatever you want to call
it<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:41.909> spikes<00:01:42.299> here

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it but then you have some spikes here

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.950 
it but then you have some spikes here
that<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.290> didn't<00:01:43.710> color<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.840> how

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that they didn't color I don't know how

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.569 
that they didn't color I don't know how
much<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> cost<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.159> fill

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
much more would it cost just to fill

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.649 
much more would it cost just to fill
that<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> maybe<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.240> something<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that in that maybe that's something that

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.200 
that in that maybe that's something that
I'll<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.020> my<00:01:49.140> own<00:01:49.520> here<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> inside<00:01:50.939> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
I'll do on my own here on the inside of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.520 
I'll do on my own here on the inside of
the<00:01:51.270> hands<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.049> any<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the hands you don't have any of the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710 
the hands you don't have any of the
black<00:01:52.950> paint<00:01:53.220> which<00:01:53.460> doesn't<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.450> bother

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
black paint which doesn't really bother

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.020 
black paint which doesn't really bother
me<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> fact<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.340> you're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
me just because of the fact that you're

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.490 
me just because of the fact that you're
not<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.329> gonna<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.960> anyway<00:01:58.469> just

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
not really gonna see it anyway just

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.039 
not really gonna see it anyway just
because<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.189> such<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> dark<00:02:00.119> looking

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
because it's so such a dark looking

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.289 
because it's so such a dark looking
figure<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.799> also<00:02:02.460> whenever<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> put<00:02:03.060> his

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
figure and also whenever you put his

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.810 
figure and also whenever you put his
weapon<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.810> his<00:02:03.960> hand<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
weapon in his hand then you don't if it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340 
weapon in his hand then you don't if it
was<00:02:05.969> painted<00:02:06.210> black<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:06.750> over<00:02:07.079> time<00:02:07.290> it

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
was painted black then over time it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.499 
was painted black then over time it
would<00:02:07.590> probably<00:02:07.770> start<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> wear<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.209> or

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
would probably start to wear that out or

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.940 
would probably start to wear that out or
if<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.660> had<00:02:09.840> two<00:02:10.020> weapons<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.530> fortunately

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
if you had two weapons so fortunately

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.050 
if you had two weapons so fortunately
has<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.760> see<00:02:11.940> here

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
has the one that you see here

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.449 
has the one that you see here
then<00:02:13.540> here<00:02:14.050> at<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.560> top<00:02:14.890> I'm<00:02:15.099> gonna<00:02:15.190> go<00:02:15.370> ahead

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
then here at the top I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.190 
then here at the top I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:15.610> point<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:15.970> out<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.360> because<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
and point this out just because it's the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.740 
and point this out just because it's the
most<00:02:17.410> awkward<00:02:17.890> thing<00:02:18.160> with<00:02:18.340> him<00:02:18.660> want<00:02:19.660> to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
most awkward thing with him want to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.300 
most awkward thing with him want to
focus<00:02:19.900> there<00:02:20.200> buddy<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.010> see<00:02:21.130> some

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
focus there buddy you can see some

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.309 
focus there buddy you can see some
spikes<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:21.880> which<00:02:22.120> he's<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> little<00:02:23.170> bitty

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
spikes here which he's a little bitty

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.290 
spikes here which he's a little bitty
ones<00:02:23.500> right<00:02:23.709> here<00:02:23.739> they<00:02:24.220> should<00:02:24.580> be<00:02:24.790> painted

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
ones right here they should be painted

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.420 
ones right here they should be painted
you<00:02:25.450> know<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.690> yellow<00:02:25.989> or<00:02:26.260> I'm<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.280> gonna

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you know this yellow or I'm just gonna

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.759 
you know this yellow or I'm just gonna
call<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.730> yellow<00:02:28.060> from<00:02:28.239> here<00:02:28.420> on<00:02:28.540> out<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:29.500> you

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
call it yellow from here on out but you

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.890 
call it yellow from here on out but you
know<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:30.069> color<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.849> something<00:02:31.180> again<00:02:31.750> that

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
know that color so something again that

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.300 
know that color so something again that
I<00:02:31.930> could<00:02:32.050> probably<00:02:32.140> do<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.410> my<00:02:32.590> own<00:02:32.709> but<00:02:33.099> then

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
I could probably do on my own but then

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.100 
I could probably do on my own but then
there's<00:02:33.550> this<00:02:33.720> weird-looking<00:02:34.720> one<00:02:34.900> right

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
there's this weird-looking one right

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.870 
there's this weird-looking one right
here<00:02:35.410> if<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.680> kind<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.950> see<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.489> that

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
here if you can kind of see that that

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.630 
here if you can kind of see that that
eye<00:02:37.300> that's<00:02:38.170> supposed<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> spike<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
eye that's supposed to be a spike I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.250 
eye that's supposed to be a spike I
guess<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.510> see<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.780> rest<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.140> them

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
guess you can see the rest of them

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.870 
guess you can see the rest of them
aren't<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:42.010> but<00:02:42.280> then<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.550> got<00:02:42.700> this

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
aren't like that but then you got this

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.410 
aren't like that but then you got this
one<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:44.140> looks<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.769> peg<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.910> it's

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
one that just looks like a peg and it's

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.160 
one that just looks like a peg and it's
just<00:02:46.630> very<00:02:46.709> strange-looking<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.900> know<00:02:49.989> what

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
just very strange-looking you know what

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.600 
just very strange-looking you know what
even<00:02:50.380> if<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.709> paint<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.310> gonna<00:02:51.430> look

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
even if you paint that it's gonna look

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.280 
even if you paint that it's gonna look
it's<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:52.560> really<00:02:53.560> weird<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.840> know<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.110> you

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
it's just really weird you know like you

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.890 
it's just really weird you know like you
don't<00:02:57.160> know<00:02:57.370> what<00:02:57.549> how<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.209> explain<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.690> I'll

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
don't know what how to explain it I'll

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.320 
don't know what how to explain it I'll
probably<00:02:59.110> end<00:02:59.500> up<00:02:59.709> you<00:03:00.610> know<00:03:00.670> sanding<00:03:01.299> that

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
probably end up you know sanding that

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.630 
probably end up you know sanding that
off<00:03:01.720> or<00:03:02.049> sanding<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.680> down<00:03:02.920> some<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.430> make<00:03:03.549> it

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
off or sanding it down some to make it

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.490 
off or sanding it down some to make it
look<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.880> little<00:03:04.000> bit<00:03:04.180> better<00:03:04.299> but<00:03:05.049> as<00:03:05.170> far<00:03:05.410> as

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
look a little bit better but as far as

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
as you can see yeah it it just took a

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.460 
as you can see yeah it it just took a
little<00:05:24.730> bit<00:05:24.820> more<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.270> it's<00:05:25.690> more<00:05:26.050> secure

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
little bit more and it's more secure

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.010 
little bit more and it's more secure
it's<00:05:26.800> not<00:05:27.010> moving<00:05:27.700> around<00:05:27.820> in<00:05:28.180> his<00:05:28.300> hand<00:05:28.540> so<00:05:28.750> I

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
it's not moving around in his hand so I

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.540 
it's not moving around in his hand so I
kind<00:05:29.560> of<00:05:29.590> prefer<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:30.190> plus<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:32.550> negative

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550

kind of prefer that plus the negative
with<00:05:33.700> his<00:05:33.940> legs<00:05:34.420> I<00:05:34.960> guess<00:05:35.230> we<00:05:35.410> can<00:05:35.560> go<00:05:35.680> ahead

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
with his legs I guess we can go ahead

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.240 
with his legs I guess we can go ahead
and<00:05:36.100> segue<00:05:36.430> into<00:05:36.840> articulation<00:05:38.040> let<00:05:39.040> me<00:05:39.130> go

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
and segue into articulation let me go

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.400 
and segue into articulation let me go
over<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.760> top<00:05:39.940> portion<00:05:40.300> his<00:05:40.600> head<00:05:40.810> does<00:05:41.170> go

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
over the top portion his head does go

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.950 
over the top portion his head does go
back<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:41.980> forth<00:05:42.220> just<00:05:43.150> kind<00:05:43.360> of<00:05:43.420> like<00:05:43.750> that

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
back and forth just kind of like that

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.320 
back and forth just kind of like that
just<00:05:44.320> because<00:05:44.590> of<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.740> angle<00:05:45.070> with<00:05:45.160> that<00:05:45.400> it

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
just because of the angle with that it

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.080 
just because of the angle with that it
goes<00:05:46.510> back<00:05:46.840> that<00:05:47.050> way<00:05:47.290> and<00:05:47.880> doesn't<00:05:48.880> have<00:05:48.970> any

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
goes back that way and doesn't have any

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.180 
goes back that way and doesn't have any
kind<00:05:49.180> of<00:05:49.300> pivot<00:05:49.570> to<00:05:49.690> at<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:49.930> arms<00:05:50.260> go<00:05:50.500> back<00:05:50.950> and

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
kind of pivot to at the arms go back and

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.030 
kind of pivot to at the arms go back and
forth<00:05:51.460> they<00:05:51.730> rotate<00:05:52.330> you<00:05:52.870> also<00:05:53.050> have<00:05:53.320> a<00:05:53.350> bin<00:05:53.740> at

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
forth they rotate you also have a bin at

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.690 
forth they rotate you also have a bin at
the<00:05:54.070> elbow<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:55.870> also<00:05:56.080> rotates<00:05:56.470> there<00:05:57.340> as<00:05:57.490> well

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700

the vintage one - now here's the thing
it<00:07:08.050> slashes<00:07:09.300> supposed<00:07:10.300> to<00:07:10.480> be<00:07:10.600> much<00:07:10.990> taller

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
it slashes supposed to be much taller

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.090 
it slashes supposed to be much taller
and<00:07:12.419> as<00:07:13.419> you<00:07:13.540> can<00:07:13.630> see<00:07:13.690> that<00:07:14.290> he's<00:07:14.530> about<00:07:14.800> just

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
and as you can see that he's about just

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.400 
and as you can see that he's about just
head<00:07:15.280> to<00:07:15.400> head<00:07:15.580> with<00:07:15.820> Roth<00:07:16.060> here<00:07:16.419> let's<00:07:17.230> bring

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
head to head with Roth here let's bring

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.450 
head to head with Roth here let's bring
in<00:07:18.930> character<00:07:19.930> here<00:07:20.230> that<00:07:20.560> is<00:07:20.860> you<00:07:21.190> know<00:07:21.280> one

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
in character here that is you know one

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.010 
in character here that is you know one
of<00:07:21.490> the<00:07:21.610> taller<00:07:21.880> ones<00:07:22.210> he's<00:07:22.390> definitely<00:07:22.960> not

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
of the taller ones he's definitely not

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.820 
of the taller ones he's definitely not
the<00:07:23.169> tallest<00:07:23.440> I<00:07:24.190> think<00:07:24.580> snakeweed<00:07:25.180> is<00:07:25.419> but

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830 
the tallest I think snakeweed is but

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.020 
the tallest I think snakeweed is but
then<00:07:26.830> you<00:07:26.919> can<00:07:27.040> see<00:07:27.130> him<00:07:27.190> with<00:07:27.340> Casey<00:07:27.550> Jones

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030 
then you can see him with Casey Jones

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.909 
then you can see him with Casey Jones
and<00:07:28.270> this<00:07:28.360> is<00:07:28.419> definitely<00:07:28.780> not<00:07:29.020> what<00:07:29.380> it<00:07:29.500> we

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
and this is definitely not what it we

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.250 
and this is definitely not what it we
see<00:07:30.190> in<00:07:30.310> the<00:07:30.430> anime<00:07:30.880> or<00:07:31.150> you<00:07:31.570> know<00:07:31.660> the<00:07:31.780> cartoon

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
see in the anime or you know the cartoon

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.340 
see in the anime or you know the cartoon
that<00:07:32.500> slashes<00:07:33.010> a<00:07:33.490> much<00:07:33.850> larger<00:07:34.630> figure<00:07:35.110> so

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.350 
that slashes a much larger figure so

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.960 
that slashes a much larger figure so
that's<00:07:35.800> something<00:07:36.100> that<00:07:36.280> I<00:07:36.460> wish<00:07:36.669> they<00:07:36.850> would

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:36.970 
that's something that I wish they would

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.409 
that's something that I wish they would
have<00:07:37.030> done

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:37.419 
have done

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:39.650 
have done
one<00:07:37.990> last<00:07:38.260> comparison<00:07:38.889> we'll<00:07:38.979> be<00:07:39.070> done<00:07:39.250> guys

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 
one last comparison we'll be done guys

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.500 
one last comparison we'll be done guys
since<00:07:40.660> he<00:07:40.810> is<00:07:40.840> a<00:07:41.050> little<00:07:41.500> bit<00:07:41.710> wider<00:07:42.130> I<00:07:42.940> figured

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.510 
since he is a little bit wider I figured

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.080 
since he is a little bit wider I figured
why<00:07:43.750> not<00:07:43.780> grab<00:07:44.169> the<00:07:44.380> other<00:07:44.770> really<00:07:45.669> wide<00:07:46.060> and

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090 
why not grab the other really wide and

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.620 
why not grab the other really wide and
kind<00:07:46.690> of<00:07:46.750> heavy<00:07:47.310> hitter<00:07:48.310> for<00:07:49.060> the<00:07:49.120> bad<00:07:49.390> guys

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:49.630 
kind of heavy hitter for the bad guys

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.150 
kind of heavy hitter for the bad guys
here<00:07:49.960> and<00:07:50.080> you<00:07:50.320> have<00:07:50.440> dog<00:07:50.680> pound

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.160 
here and you have dog pound

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.820 
here and you have dog pound
so<00:07:51.310> still<00:07:52.050> compared<00:07:53.050> to<00:07:53.140> this<00:07:53.290> guy<00:07:53.560> I<00:07:53.590> mean

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:53.830 
so still compared to this guy I mean

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.860 
so still compared to this guy I mean
he's<00:07:53.950> still<00:07:54.220> quite<00:07:54.640> small<00:07:54.910> even<00:07:55.479> though<00:07:55.600> he's

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:55.870 
he's still quite small even though he's

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.320 
he's still quite small even though he's
pretty<00:07:56.500> much<00:07:56.560> paired<00:07:56.830> up<00:07:56.950> with<00:07:57.039> Ross<00:07:57.370> are<00:07:57.550> but

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.330
