 September 26, 2013 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:18.980

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:26.160
 here just seen your street Repin 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:30.539
 this is what yesterday did death here 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.380
 the house was blown away completely 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.190
 roof in general 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.550

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.050
 cover roofs eliminate 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:05.370
