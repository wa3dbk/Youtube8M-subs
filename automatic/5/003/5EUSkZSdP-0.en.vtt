00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.629
 banned in turkey 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.389
 this is the question that all 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.670
 lovers of this famous game indeed the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.429
 Turkish daily habertürk revealed this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 possibility on March 10 last 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.520
 explanations in February a day 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.650
 questions the Turkish Minister of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.689
 social and family policies go 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.189
 with us sick islam minister a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.630
 question please there is a game that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.000
 is called minecraft in which a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 Swiss player at parent scores points 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.070
 what do you plan to do against games 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 violent little foot this day was 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 visibly hard to train because the game does not 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.559
 not offer this option 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 no matter the ministry of the family 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 and social policies turkey did it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.450
 matter very seriously and asked for a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.100
 investigation of the game the idea was to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.020
 know if actually minecraft 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.700
 encourage and violate 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 women but the conclusions of this 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.300
 investigation remains surprising 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.520
 the report of the NGO in its report 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.469
 unveiled by after on ten is unveiled 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.059
 that seeing others kill 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.489
 creatures protect his own 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.719
 constructions thereby making it a 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.520
 game based on violence 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.780
 otherwise always according to this same 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210
 Minecraft investigation 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.380
 you will be at social isolation 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.850
 would expose young players to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.189
 bad meetings on the servers 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 particular and would incite them stole the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.259
 blue card of their parents especially 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.939
 to buy the day finally this report 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.320
 stresses the need to kill 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.180
 animals in the game in order to survive 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.750
 without these appearing to express 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.700
 suffering 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.619
 it could bring young players 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 to martyrise the animals in the arena 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 these conclusions have therefore brought this 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.460
 Turkish Ministry called for intervention 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.840
 of minecraft in his country know 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.850
 nevertheless that this ministry does not have the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.110
 power to ban this game because as 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.880
 in many other countries 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.579
 only a court decision in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.659
 would have the power recalls minecraft 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.729
 is one of the most played games of all 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.310
 times with tens of millions 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.970
 copies passed in the water but that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.740
 you already know it 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.540
 I would like to remind you that minecraft 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 is also a game acclaimed for its 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.930
 pedagogical virtues 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.130
 so where some uses to make sure of a 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.409
 game they do not understand anything 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.270
 otherwise use this tool for 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.340
 teaching purposes minecraft is due in 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.840
 is an excellent field created by joël 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.789
 the twenty professors in new york 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.060
 this version acclaimed by our legs 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.260
 integrates many educational tools 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.640
 already used by thousands of 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.380
 teachers and students 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.450
 this version of the game run and 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.110
 teaching maths science and 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.860
 languages ​​in class with the jo 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.300
 personally I would have loved 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.260
 have math and minecraft lessons 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.030
 to colleagues 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.470
 you will find different links in 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.300
 the description of this video in order to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.620
 learn more about this subject but also 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.980
 you will see that I do not say too much 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.050
 bullshit 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 especially do not hesitate to share your 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.820
 opinion on this subject and in the news 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.980
 comments in conclusion we will notice 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.080
 that for the same game we have two approaches 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.680
 very different on one side the path of 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.660
 censorship 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.340
 on the other the path of teaching 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.720
 it's a fight that's old as the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.830
 world 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.650
 personally I have already chosen my 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.450
 hands and friends if you do not do 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.040
 part of the Turkish government and that you 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.260
 love video games subscribe to my 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.790
 chain I have nothing to beat to kill 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.320
 virtual enemies just for fun 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.580
 and you whenever meetings 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.040
 and flies it had been some 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.170
 chelou like that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.629
 what she will do that will draw 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.450
 a poop as formidable fight is 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.829
 more in the refinement and in the 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.829
 attention to detail that now
