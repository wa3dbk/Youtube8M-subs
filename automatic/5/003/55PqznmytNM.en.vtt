you'll still need to do a bit of
fiddling<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> get<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:20.270> right<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.440> then

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
fiddling to get it just right and then

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.770 
fiddling to get it just right and then
comes<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.340> adjustment<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.060> balance<00:02:23.540> with

comes the adjustment of the balance with

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.660 
comes the adjustment of the balance with
the<00:02:23.960> ball<00:02:24.260> head<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.710> make<00:02:24.830> sure<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.160> sits<00:02:25.340> level

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
the ball head to make sure it sits level

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.190 
the ball head to make sure it sits level
doesn't<00:02:25.970> flop<00:02:26.270> over<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> side<00:02:26.810> or<00:02:26.990> tilt

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
forward or back or whatnot and this is a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.410 
forward or back or whatnot and this is a
pretty<00:02:30.080> fiddly<00:02:30.740> process<00:02:31.340> as<00:02:31.550> indeed<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.300> on

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
pretty fiddly process as indeed it is on

the big units - and this is where most

will<00:02:37.400> get<00:02:37.760> frustrated<00:02:38.570> but<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.560> take<00:02:39.740> it

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
will get frustrated but just take it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.160 
will get frustrated but just take it
slow<00:02:40.220> make<00:02:40.610> very<00:02:40.970> small<00:02:41.300> adjustments<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:42.140> you

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
slow make very small adjustments and you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.660 
slow make very small adjustments and you
will<00:02:42.350> find<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.890> balance<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.460> will

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
will find the balance and you will

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.430 
will find the balance and you will
develop<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:44.150> knack<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:44.420> quickly<00:02:44.930> seeing<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.320> up

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
develop a knack for quickly seeing it up

now<00:02:52.070> I'm<00:02:52.250> in<00:02:52.430> use<00:02:52.730> again<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.420> behaves<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.020> very

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
now I'm in use again it behaves it very

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.170 
now I'm in use again it behaves it very
much<00:02:54.380> like<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.830> big<00:02:54.980> units<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.610> takes<00:02:55.880> little

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
much like the big units it takes little

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.700 
much like the big units it takes little
care<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.510> practice<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.050> get<00:02:57.140> consistent

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
care and practice to get consistent

care and practice to get consistent
results<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:58.460> it<00:02:58.550> behaving<00:02:59.000> like<00:02:59.150> you

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
results and get it behaving like you

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.270 
results and get it behaving like you
want<00:02:59.540> but<00:02:59.810> as<00:02:59.990> you<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:00.740> for<00:03:00.950> yourself

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
want but as you can see for yourself

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.680 
want but as you can see for yourself
here<00:03:01.460> it<00:03:01.610> does<00:03:01.760> indeed<00:03:01.940> make<00:03:02.240> quite<00:03:02.450> a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
here it does indeed make quite a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.630 
here it does indeed make quite a
noticeable<00:03:03.290> difference<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:04.310> worked

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
noticeable difference it worked

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.850 
noticeable difference it worked
wonderfully<00:03:05.180> well<00:03:05.540> with<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> GoPro<00:03:06.320> which<00:03:06.620> in

the iPhone tended to catch the breeze a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.350 
the iPhone tended to catch the breeze a
bit<00:03:27.380> like<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.710> sail<00:03:28.130> which<00:03:28.430> led<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.820> some<00:03:29.030> slight

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360

optical stabilization onboard which is
one<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.000> reasons<00:03:47.210> I<00:03:47.300> love<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.630> so<00:03:47.750> much<00:03:47.900> so

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
one of the reasons I love it so much so

one of the reasons I love it so much so
the<00:03:48.320> difference<00:03:48.680> isn't<00:03:48.890> quite<00:03:49.310> as<00:03:49.490> dramatic

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
the difference isn't quite as dramatic

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.120

as<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.390> GoPro<00:03:50.780> footage<00:03:50.990> is<00:03:51.320> but<00:03:51.740> it<00:03:51.860> still

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
as the GoPro footage is but it still

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.560 
as the GoPro footage is but it still
does<00:03:52.370> make<00:03:52.640> a<00:03:52.670> noticeable<00:03:53.420> difference

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
does make a noticeable difference

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.800 
does make a noticeable difference
especially<00:03:54.560> while<00:03:54.830> walking<00:03:55.520> and<00:03:55.730> if<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.630> are

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
the walk-and-talk a type it's going to

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.820 
the walk-and-talk a type it's going to
make<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.240> stuff<00:03:59.540> much<00:03:59.810> more<00:04:00.080> watchable<00:04:00.500> for
