a small one I've done a bit of a meat
lovers<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.290> many

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
for Evan and me and Evan Evan and I and
I<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.390> dough<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> with

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
I think the dough on this one is with

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.360 
I think the dough on this one is with
the<00:00:53.539> wild<00:00:54.539> yeast<00:00:54.809> which<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> use<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the wild yeast which is the use that I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.849 
the wild yeast which is the use that I
made<00:00:56.640> myself<00:00:57.050> I'm<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.199> sure<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.739> know

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
made myself I'm not sure if you know

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.730 
made myself I'm not sure if you know
maybe<00:00:59.129> maybe<00:00:59.579> not<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:07.080> there's<00:01:07.350> still<00:01:07.560> plenty

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
maybe maybe not and there's still plenty

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.649 
maybe maybe not and there's still plenty
of<00:01:07.920> heat<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> we'll<00:01:12.240> probably<00:01:12.450> only

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
of heat in there so we'll probably only

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.760 
of heat in there so we'll probably only
take<00:01:12.990> about<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.530> minutes<00:01:13.560> I'd<00:01:14.010> say
