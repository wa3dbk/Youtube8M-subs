00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.980
 and good to all the people who have 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.690
 asked how to put together a machine 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.149
 Foam will give you the following 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.639
 look at how you can see this is a 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.980
 industrial fan that you use is from 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.040
 a quarter of a horse to 1,725 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.260
 revolutions per minute 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.350
 as you can see here is a quarter of 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.250
 horsepower at 1,725 â€‹â€‹revolutions 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.439
 per minute 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.720
 ok side of the other data that is also 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.430
 important is the water sprinkler if not 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.950
 can you see that the people that I 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.200
 then I used this to the pilot not 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.010
 physically what I did was in the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.360
 weights here and this will take 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.600
 factory this little tube how can you 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.860
 see is not the great science is a very tube 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.710
 basic 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.989
 this is where I'm going to put where I'm going to 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.780
 ride the people of waters here I 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.480
 I'm riding and then this is going to 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.180
 whatever is in front of here but now 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.450
 fixed by when he's giving me I'm going to 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.480
 put this one 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.280
 the water never has contact with him with 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.670
 the engine so there's no problem that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.650
 in any case the pump is a pump 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.890
 also because it is very ordinary this is 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.480
 one of a horse of second a horse 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.440
 of power 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.440
 this is where I'm going to put 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.920
 I will implement after developing 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.470
 a graffiti to make it better now 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.799
 Well, as you can see are some materials 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.689
 very basic very ordinary 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.350
 Here, for example, I have one that is already 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.090
 the one that had finished 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.950
 and sometimes a video to see how 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.030
 work 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.100
 Y 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.090
 as you can see the great science is 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 ends and was armed 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.310
 and it's the same thing we're occupying here but 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.810
 then he will put us here the liquid 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.090
 that I am using is called the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.360
 shore can be on a base of I do not know of 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.360
 laurel 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.469
 before it occupied one liter per 100 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.869
 after starting to use elements 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.269
 and media at 4 liters per 100 of water 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.209
 and a half worked much better throw 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.250
 much better more foam and lasts much longer 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.110
 out because the grid will already put 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.239
 different part this is a video for 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.549
 see how I want this and you can 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.110
 do yours when thank you very much that 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.110
 spend an afternoon until then
