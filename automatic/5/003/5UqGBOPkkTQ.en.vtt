00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.210
 the painter takes a beautiful day wishes 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:13.929
 the size warmly to the press conference on the occasion as the second 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.009
 their championship games scripts on Frankfurt 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.150
 become a real hans-jÃ¼rgen boysen coach of our opponent already around today 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.220
 to my left our boss coach 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.369
 Norbert Meier 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 Marc Peters was first to our guest taz Mr. Boysen 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.609
 yes, at first lived and overthrow deserved victory 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.220
 I had before which fair 8% or if it wants to do with his 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.770
 Team after the rise over this outstanding percent developed far 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.930
 has and 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.030
 who had spotted the last three encounters per cent supernaturally but 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
 even oldies clearly underlined century 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.910
 for a lively crew the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.330
 very closed negative for the ball can work 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.590
 Even in the game, hardship must be given, the Swedes are now controlling the pace again 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.050
 record and percent 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.130
 yes then it is of course always nice so not so easy percent 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.540
 In the same way we want to meet it in the first place 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.000
 Building one 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.440
 ordered and defensive percent per cent try to persist what they do 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.630
 not on a pedestal 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.090
 know that Dusseldorf 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.740
 This can only show that he was successful 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.100
 then he succeeds us is even even a gate and if you then with 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.790
 1 0 in the break is about to make up percent of these students 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.509
 Best to push the result for a long time, that's a bit 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.020
 Unrest arose zol that did not succeed the goal came 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.500
 too early to count yes it was then one 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.530
 Kite by percent 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.520
 Insufficient percentages to one percent 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.380
 Error chain the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.390
 Percent then punished us very hard with four goals of the accident 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.520
 Percent although I turn to click as a sticking point percent to laugh 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.820
 or me clear penalty because she was pregnant and percent before more 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.909
 fully confirmed as obvious player blanket also keeps going 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.379
 there remain the rule and percent but he Shriver was of the opinion 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.269
 RP Fortune or a little help 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.420
 and percent 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.690
 3 percent at the third goal, we raise at the moment even on foul 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.699
 and then at the penalty this is annoying but that she has the god 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.749
 Title forced because of pressure percent in Portugal would have exercised 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:27.789
 and 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:30.789
 the player passes shown today would be hard 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.719
 this one left with angrier than half-timed but dimmed 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.199
 even a game takes 3 at FSV 90 minutes 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 and there is still a lot to do 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.579
 Coach Carlos Dunga test questions a coach Frank Schroth Frankfurt with 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.899
 that it obviously does not require the word Nordmeier so far 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.030
 Hermann I started 50 in the first ten minutes AMD tried 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.629
 Build up pressure 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.629
 But then we have against a Frankfurt team the 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.139
 As my colleague says, of course, strives to keep the order 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.599
 We did not allow our game to get underway 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.139
 also do not have much 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.529
 Lord maybe somewhere in the subconscious believed that what 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.749
 has been transported in advance of this game 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:26.909
 that you can agree to win this game game without being played and then 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.839
 have also been punished with Enke the only chance Frankfurt a first 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.059
 half 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.099
 and then, of course, it's even harder 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.339
 Sicilia, of course, that Amon herself got drunk on me too 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.909
 a bit of a passion missing 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.429
 in the second half 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.639
 and that is also an important point that I want to see what we do 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:47.419
 have yes 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.459
 in the past already regionalized zookeepers often 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.549
 Games came back in those store in the Heininger and that is 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.249
 one point the team 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.639
 take the project with you 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.069
 nothing happened and in the second half there is the team 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.949
 It is also important to have fun in this passion shown in you 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.949
 This league simply needs attitude is not just with playful means 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.579
 before this league can hold but you have to keep it right 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.590
 epd we did that's like a jerk going through the team 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.919
 but that's just what I sell to him now, which in essence I say say that 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.870
 not me now 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.449
 There are tickets though 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.449
 in our coach 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.110
 that is also not pleasing gave to 2 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.650
 more games 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.960
 FC Augsburg against Karlsruher SC 1 1 and TuS Koblenz and Rot weiss Ahlen broke up 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.080
 also 1 1 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.950
 Photo is now on the sixth place in the table and are off 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.430
 Frankfurt at 18th place 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.639
 the next away game is waiting for us, that is serious 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.629
 Chancellery and this is on Friday 23 10 Top 18 o'clock 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.999
 and the next home game here in the esprit-arena 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:04.309
 takes place against Karlsruher SC most expensive also counted 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:08.039
 Friday evening at 18 clock in Sportlerheim still set 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.710
 until Sunday noon locked so high 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.680
 for that in the conclusion
