00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.070
 hello friends with you tiberian 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.870
 and this is the 31st edition of the master category for all 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.910
 the tanks heading in which i'm trying 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.340
 get a mark of class master on 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.600
 technique whose name you specify in 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 comments on your numerous 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.560
 today's release requests will be 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 devoted to the Soviet medium tank 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.599
 eighth level t-44 for some reason, many 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.369
 viewers in the comments are not particularly flattering 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.469
 spoke about this tank although I think 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.170
 that 44 is very bright 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.270
 representative of real medium tanks 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 and besides this is a Soviet tank 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.079
 then by definition scaffold could be not 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.809
 may in general let's understand what 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.660
 t-44 represents himself and how this tank 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.100
 better apply dynamics to 44 no 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 no complaints maximum speed 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 forward 51 kilometer an hour ago 20 ours and 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 the stitch rides quite cheerfully and quickly 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.039
 spinning on the spot yes and generally change 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.800
 referral or return to base defense 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.809
 can be no problem but good dynamics 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.880
 Quartet stalls have good armor 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.170
 upper armor liner 90 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.780
 millimeters located under good 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.670
 slope which means with a successful statement 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.310
 corps you will be able to repel shells from 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.290
 level 7 tanks and some tanks 8 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.020
 the tower also has relatively small 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.790
 120 forehead size and ricochet shape 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.229
 millimeters and it allows everything also 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.600
 tank tanks seventh and eighth 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.430
 level and in some cases even more 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.290
 serious opponents also on this 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 Soviet ester can sometimes tank 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.759
 but especially not fond of the sides because 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 that armor is not that serious 75 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.329
 millimeters so I do not recommend 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.329
 try to trade this way tanks 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.250
 above level 7 total t-44 like 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.590
 subsequent Soviet step forgive 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.229
 the player some mistakes sometimes even evil 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.149
 and terrible pt 10 level can you not 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.799
 break through the collection but again I repeat 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.630
 never count on the occasion and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.700
 once again under the enemy try not 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.290
 substituted well and before we go to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.600
 talk about the gun I would like to say 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.329
 a few words about crit and suit of our tank 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.250
 weak point 44 is ammunition 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.290
 which is not only often criticized but 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 and often bk blocks explode 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.050
 located on the right side of the tank behind 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.000
 top sheet armor also they on 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.100
 starboard and back street 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.780
 towers and damage or blow this 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.880
 module opponents can like when 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.830
 hitting the forehead of the hull and the tower so and 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.810
 when hit by a gboard to 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.790
 reduce chances of undermining the ammo and I 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.380
 I recommend to pump the charging second 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.790
 or even the first skill skill 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.920
 contactless ammunition 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.720
 and if that does not help either then 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.000
 set as equipment in 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.890
 wet combat but try to play 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.690
 supply the starboard as seldom as possible 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.550
 how am I doing now 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.310
 well now let's discuss the gun 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.320
 our medium tank 44 has two 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.900
 top guns lovers of large drones 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.610
 can stop 122 mm but 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.040
 I personally think that but absolutely not 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.240
 suitable for medium tank so 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.460
 used exclusively 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.220
 100mm lp-1 penetration 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.470
 he has an armor-piercing projectile 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.410
 175 millimeters under-calf 235 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.210
 turn 250 units accuracy is good 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.950
 spread over 100 meters 035 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.260
 and the time of mixing two point three 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.390
 seconds with rammer it recharges 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.510
 just over 7 seconds the corners are vertical 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.350
 pickups are 7 degrees down and 23 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.510
 degrees up 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.400
 the whole is pretty comfortable guns 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.050
 his stabilization is normal accuracy 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.180
 allows you to target vulnerable areas 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.980
 tanks at medium distances to 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.810
 punch most tanks eighth and 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.700
 the ninth level is enough and armor-piercing 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.920
 shells and with dozens of you will help 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.410
 subcaliber but do not forget 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.480
 that 44 is the mobility of an average tank 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.090
 so you can always bypass the enemy with 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.739
 flank and punch him in board the conclusion 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.870
 analysis of characteristics recall about 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.670
 overview which is 380 meters 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.560
 rather weak indicator for 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.900
 screed eighth level would like to have 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.670
 400 but if you install enlightened 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.459
 optics, in principle, you can live 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.680
 but disguise 44 very good 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.660
 and so with tsiferkami figured out and now 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.820
 let's find out how to apply it 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.010
 medium tank in battles at the beginning of the video i 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.200
 said the t-44 is bright 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.090
 representative of real medium tanks 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.310
 under real medium tanks i 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.019
 I mean the dough that can play 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.660
 aggressive enough to occupy key 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.670
 positions and at the same time instantly 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.080
 die in this battle on a cliff in which 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.630
 I managed to get a mark of class 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.010
 the master was by the way the seventh in a row I and 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.230
 tried to act more or less 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.610
 aggressively but not mindlessly in 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.100
 this fight was only one artillery 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.970
 so I immediately went to the center to 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.560
 to have a possibility 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.540
 and shoot at the sides passing 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.580
 enemy st if medium tanks 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.140
 opponents did not go ranked third 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.180
 fourth line then one could 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.400
 look a little further and highlight the tanks 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.410
 who drive along the road and also understand 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.570
 shoot but again I repeat it all 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.320
 possible if there is little or no battle 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.330
 from artillery 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.340
 otherwise you risk quickly going to 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.600
 hangar then I shifted from the center to 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.730
 third line to control 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.490
 enemy medium tanks there first 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.320
 managed to destroy careless type 59 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.780
 then it was the turn of the second Chinese 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.000
 though I myself lost php and 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.250
 repair kit well and after that super 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.170
 Pershing also went to the hangar down on 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.970
 first-second line were enemy 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.950
 Fri-shki unfortunately not to shoot at them 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.300
 It turned out because it would have to be very 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.980
 I could go far 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.050
 Substitute again under these pt 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.550
 or under artillery and so I just 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.650
 some time they illuminated but 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.520
 allies for some reason are not really 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.560
 they shot 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.870
 meanwhile allied heavy tanks 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.890
 suppressed the enemy behind the beacon and I 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.080
 there was a great opportunity 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.750
 shoot it in the stern because to this 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.520
 I have already taken a suitable position in time. 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.249
 general joint effort alpha sneaker 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.319
 you and allies 2 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.569
 and now I will go help our guns 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.879
 on the first-second line , we will first 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.919
 finish off t28 and then of course 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.779
 punish the enemy artillery as well, 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.459
 until it all happens you can bring 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.369
 a small summary of our today's 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:43.079
 hero generally 40 is four 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:45.869
 good simulator not only for members 

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:47.369
 crew but also for the player himself because 

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:49.859
 that she prepares you to play on 

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:52.559
 subsequent soviet medium tanks like 

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:54.209
 I already said t-44 is the real middle 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.369
 tank dynamics allows it to occupy 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:58.199
 profitable key positions armor 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:58.679
 often spa here put enemy 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.689
 shells 

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:02.039
 guns comfortable with it you can 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.079
 normal damage 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.329
 and disguise and review though not the most 

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:08.429
 best allow when you need to perform 

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:10.529
 the role of the firefly all the skills that you 

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:12.449
 will get on this tank will be useful to you 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:14.579
 further and generally speaking 40 four 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.829
 i always loved it good 

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:18.989
 among other things I honestly do not understand 

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:21.599
 why many players treat him with 

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:23.699
 disregard for dynamics there is armor 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.319
 guns good if you're still ammo-laying 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.179
 often wouldn’t be critical 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.689
 probably the perfect tank in the eighth 

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:29.429
 level 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.079
 maybe an amateur was talking to me 

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:33.169
 Soviet tanks but for some reason 

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:35.939
 it seems that it's not just that 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.979
 Well, on this I have everything for today 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:39.539
 thank you for your attention with you now he was 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.369
 do not forget to write in the comments 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:42.709
 the name of the next tank on which 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:44.999
 want me to take the master 

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:46.529
 subscribe to the channel that's fan and not 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:49.019
 forget to look at my channel 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:51.589
 strong armor precision weapons to you to 

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:51.589
 new meetings
