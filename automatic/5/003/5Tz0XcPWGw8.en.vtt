00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.480
 first of all to ask you how 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.399
 dress up chacarita in this match for 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.660
 Argentine Cup in the previous was a rival 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.210
 accessible with back but finished 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.490
 only 1 to 0 beyond the funeral 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.530
 of domino the bus party how did you see it 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.380
 yes as I said earlier in the week 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.630
 do not underestimate the rivals anymore 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.369
 beyond the category all that part of 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.320
 when they come to play chacarita if they 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.050
 they want to show play their match 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.330
 life and this was seen on the court thanks to 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.609
 god first time we could do our 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.619
 game that is something that we play 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.690
 us what what we train all 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.729
 the week after second half was 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.190
 a little more obvious that we were going to 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:40.839
 come started to put people in attack 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.789
 able we could not do so much to our 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.620
 game but but good I think we went 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.739
 just deserving capable of result 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.420
 no then you do not see it you do not see but 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.999
 well we are happy because we were 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.069
 a chance to play what is not 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.690
 we were playing and we could take advantage 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.760
 you think this was the main thing the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.709
 motivation to be able to show yourself to a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.479
 way because they know they are the second 

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:04.269
 Chacarita team two owners are 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.350
 to play in tucumÃ¡n and you are the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.090
 that come from behind they feel that 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.560
 They are one of the opportunities 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.920
 to demonstrate and obviously try to 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.140
 win the place in the headlines 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.630
 and obviously while we do not have to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.310
 prove anything because that what nobody 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.830
 It's technical that if we're in the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.950
 campus is for something because he 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.600
 we are in consideration so 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.240
 we try to make the most of it 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.869
 to add minutes to add game to 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.789
 add football and good the idea was always 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.130
 play with the ball on the floor we go 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.840
 there which is the rival for the moment what 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.240
 We could do for other times, but not 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.369
 I think a lot of the game like 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.319
 I said before we were just deserving of the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.970
 triumph beyond that still those 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.840
 guys in today's game you were a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.729
 of the largest of what more 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.310
 experience had in terms of minutes 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.360
 on the court from outside unanimous 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.580
 that you were the figure to you how you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080
 you felt not personal well well me 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.670
 I felt very good I really wanted to 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.399
 to play was not playing 90 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.190
 minutes in a row and it's like that in the networks 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.440
 So 23 years ago it was my turn to debut 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.030
 how it was the kids' turn and today it's my turn 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.500
 able a little more experience not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.310
 I say a lot but a little more 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.049
 encourage them to help them in anything and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.720
 luck came in very well those who 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.100
 they debuted and I'm very happy for them 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.520
 the chacarita in general argentine glass 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.710
 tournament you as it is we are fighting 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.990
 on all fronts now this match 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.160
 it was very important are instance 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.680
 decisive now I think it's 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.260
 thirty-somethings we have to play with 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.700
 you also in championship we are 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.930
 fighting there we are being escorted if 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.110
 well it is very long missing a lot of 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.910
 dates we have a campus now short 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.250
 that unfortunately due to the injury 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.840
 our partner but as he says 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.830
 as they say we all have to be 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.940
 shot because at any time 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.940
 anyone can leave the court 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.820
 good facundo antich area the party 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.140
 first I 'll tell you the reception 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.030
 these people just get out of the locker room 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.030
 tell me the first thing that is now 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.880
 beautiful people beautiful people know 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.740
 that makes me endurance I liked the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 chacarita also how you felt 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.860
 first sensations of having debuted 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.250
 with the shirt the funebrero so 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.760
 official 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.640
 I was very happy very happy because 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.130
 because I blame the children of boys 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.090
 came then all the courts are still 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.400
 as a fan and it's the biggest thing is the most 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.200
 great for my dream fulfilled 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.780
 the most beautiful a giant smile and it is born 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.630
 like tonight the truth that very 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.550
 happy a match where in a 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.340
 moment it complicated us but we knew 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.380
 keep calm and we climb up to 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.000
 to pass is easy it does not go as I told you before 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.150
 we did not have it to be carried away by the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.250
 division that had difference but 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.930
 we knew where we hold 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.740
 the ball and we put a change of pace 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.320
 we were very superior and it was 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.270
 moments happened in the game and we look 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.880
 0 but I think we ask that the player 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.070
 much more the opportunity to show 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.330
 sure is for you obviously are the 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.830
 team sees in some way that is 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.300
 trying to be on the team to 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.530
 that is the opportunity to show 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.660
 try to convince biglieri to 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.970
 be on that team to 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.160
 as it existed I think it's the match for 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.010
 show us to take advantage of the ball 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.410
 and I think that even if it was not a result 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.690
 very bulky we did not know how to take advantage of him 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.220
 fulfilled and the truth that yes good here 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.420
 first of all, nobody knows what's wrong with you 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.010
 by the head now after having 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.780
 debuted the first jacket I think that 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.120
 now I still do not fall, do not you remain 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.310
 aside to have all the people behind I think 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.780
 that was a very nice feeling is a 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.040
 dream fulfilled 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.750
 yes yes it is a part of the dream fulfilled 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.080
 let's say I think there's still a lot left 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.789
 go and this just starts 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.830
 and your personal feelings how do you 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.120
 you saw inside the field of play I do not think 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.650
 that I did well to comply with what I 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.120
 said the technician that I entered and that I wear it 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.370
 a little bit to the monkey behind by the brand 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.780
 what and after when it came out a good 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.759
 attack that reaches the area I think that 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.469
 I did everything the technician asked me 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.050
 the last one you have distribution to of this 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.909
 way to get more shoot along 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.830
 of the games yes yes that I do not think 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.110
 that I'm missing a little more than 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.199
 trust but there is an illusion very 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.199
 big
