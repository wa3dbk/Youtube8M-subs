00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
yesterday explain card company designs

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.270 
yesterday explain card company designs
like<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:18.789> so<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:19.810> asked<00:04:19.959> LT<00:04:20.380> how<00:04:20.650> this<00:04:20.950> deck

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
like so so I asked LT how this deck

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.740 
like so so I asked LT how this deck
handles<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:24.669> spreads

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
handles so it spreads

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.890 
handles so it spreads
very<00:04:27.750> neat<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.380> very<00:04:29.010> smooth<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.370> fans

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
very neat and very smooth and it fans

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.800 
very neat and very smooth and it fans
very<00:04:33.900> evenly<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.850> think<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.240> reason<00:04:36.660> why

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
very evenly and I think the reason why

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.300 
very evenly and I think the reason why
it's<00:04:36.990> very<00:04:37.290> smooth<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:37.680> obviously<00:04:38.070> because

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
it's very smooth is obviously because

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.830 
it's very smooth is obviously because
the<00:04:38.460> LIA<00:04:38.610> noise<00:04:38.730> finish<00:04:39.150> it's<00:04:39.360> not<00:04:39.540> standard

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
the LIA noise finish it's not standard

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.660 
the LIA noise finish it's not standard
air<00:04:40.260> crush<00:04:40.500> finish<00:04:40.800> it's<00:04:40.950> dolena<00:04:41.250> finish

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
air crush finish it's dolena finish

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.610 
air crush finish it's dolena finish
which<00:04:41.820> is<00:04:41.850> much<00:04:42.150> smoother<00:04:42.810> then<00:04:43.290> a<00:04:43.410> crush

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
which is much smoother then a crush

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.430 
which is much smoother then a crush
finish<00:04:43.920> so<00:04:44.250> yeah<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:45.420> and<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:46.200> very

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
finish so yeah so and it it's very

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.870 
finish so yeah so and it it's very
smooth<00:04:47.810> riffle<00:04:48.810> shuffle<00:04:48.980> it<00:04:49.980> just<00:04:50.460> riffles

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880
