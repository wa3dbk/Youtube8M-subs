down underneath underground in the
subway<00:00:08.880> system<00:00:08.940> as<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.750> can<00:00:09.900> see<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.260> trains

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
subway system as you can see the trains

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.720 
subway system as you can see the trains
just<00:00:11.010> don't<00:00:11.219> stop<00:00:11.460> coming<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.269> one<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
just don't stop coming so one of the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.589 
just don't stop coming so one of the
significant<00:00:14.730> difficulties<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
significant difficulties with the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.769 
significant difficulties with the
Subway's<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.920> 24/7<00:00:17.880> which<00:00:18.240> was<00:00:18.449> sitting

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
Subway's is it is 24/7 which was sitting

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.330 
Subway's is it is 24/7 which was sitting
behind<00:00:18.900> us<00:00:19.260> you're<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> get<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> crowd<00:00:20.310> of

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
behind us you're going to get a crowd of

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.160 
behind us you're going to get a crowd of
people<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:21.000> are<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> just<00:00:21.660> slam<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
people that are going to just slam the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.769 
people that are going to just slam the
the<00:00:22.949> capacity<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.880> system<00:00:24.060> then<00:00:24.660> they're

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the capacity of the system then they're

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.759 
the capacity of the system then they're
going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> get<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> train<00:00:25.410> they're<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
going to get on a train they're going to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.230 
going to get on a train they're going to
go<00:00:25.859> away<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> then<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> process<00:00:26.849> repeats

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
go away and then the process repeats

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.330 
go away and then the process repeats
itself<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.199> need<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> design<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.830> system

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
itself so you need to design a system

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.669 
itself so you need to design a system
that<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:30.029> able<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.539> provide<00:00:30.779> those<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.470> those

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
that is able to provide those for those

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
that is able to provide those for those

station equipment
this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> typical<00:01:43.140> base<00:01:43.560> station<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
this is a typical base station that you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.030 
this is a typical base station that you
would<00:01:44.520> find<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.000> any<00:01:45.119> base<00:01:45.509> station<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
would find in any base station for a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.969 
would find in any base station for a
tower<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.640> top<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.390> building<00:01:48.780> inside<00:01:49.680> this

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
tower or top of the building inside this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.600 
tower or top of the building inside this
equipment<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.729> their<00:01:50.939> GSM<00:01:51.720> their<00:01:52.560> 3G<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
equipment is their GSM their 3G and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.120 
equipment is their GSM their 3G and
their<00:01:54.149> LTE<00:01:54.509> equipment<00:01:55.200> each<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.009> these

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
their LTE equipment each one of these

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.859 
their LTE equipment each one of these
base<00:01:56.430> stations<00:01:56.460> which<00:01:57.119> holds<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> three

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
base stations which holds up to three

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
base stations which holds up to three
sectors<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.950> feeding<00:01:59.430> three<00:01:59.700> different

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
sectors will be feeding three different

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.810 
sectors will be feeding three different
stations<00:02:00.479> throughout<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> network<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
stations throughout the network so this

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
stations throughout the network so this
location<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.939> hold<00:02:03.180> 60<00:02:03.750> sectors<00:02:04.229> which<00:02:04.439> in

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
location can hold 60 sectors which in

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.860 
location can hold 60 sectors which in
out<00:02:04.829> turns<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.520> 6

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
out turns is 6

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.859 
out turns is 6
stations<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:07.130> from<00:02:07.370> this<00:02:07.550> point<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.420> can

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
stations so from this point on you can

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.719 
stations so from this point on you can
see<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.290> there's<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.860> significant<00:02:10.430> amount<00:02:10.460> of

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
see that there's a significant amount of

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.130 
see that there's a significant amount of
fiber<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.270> comes<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:11.990> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
fiber that comes in and this is the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.260 
fiber that comes in and this is the
backhaul<00:02:12.740> equipment<00:02:13.340> for<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> carriers<00:02:14.090> to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
backhaul equipment for the carriers to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.480 
backhaul equipment for the carriers to
bring<00:02:14.600> into<00:02:14.990> their<00:02:15.110> base<00:02:15.350> station<00:02:15.830> from<00:02:15.980> this

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
bring into their base station from this

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.070 
bring into their base station from this
point<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.270> actually<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.750> RF

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
point on this is actually the RF

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.290 
point on this is actually the RF
component<00:02:18.710> as<00:02:19.010> if<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:19.430> were<00:02:19.550> going<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.120> top

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
component as if we were going to the top

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.690 
component as if we were going to the top
of<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.570> tower<00:02:20.780> onto<00:02:21.140> antennas<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.040> from<00:02:22.520> this

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
of a tower onto antennas but from this

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.640 
of a tower onto antennas but from this
point<00:02:22.940> it's<00:02:23.150> distributing<00:02:23.660> over<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.470> head

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
point it's distributing over to the head

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.010 
point it's distributing over to the head
and<00:02:24.830> equipment<00:02:25.280> these<00:02:25.580> are<00:02:25.880> what<00:02:26.660> we<00:02:26.780> called

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
and equipment these are what we called

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.290 
and equipment these are what we called
as<00:02:27.290> trays<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:27.980> essentially<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.880> carrier

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
as trays and essentially the carrier

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.510 
as trays and essentially the carrier
equipment<00:02:29.750> comes<00:02:29.960> in<00:02:30.140> at<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> high<00:02:30.650> power<00:02:31.010> level

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
equipment comes in at a high power level

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.700 
equipment comes in at a high power level
and<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.300> equipment<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.810> goes<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.380> our<00:02:33.410> head

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
and the equipment that goes for our head

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.500 
and the equipment that goes for our head
in<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:33.980> actually<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.340> low<00:02:34.580> power<00:02:34.850> level<00:02:35.270> so

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
in is actually a low power level so

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.470 
in is actually a low power level so
those<00:02:35.750> big<00:02:35.930> cables<00:02:36.580> those<00:02:37.580> were<00:02:37.790> for<00:02:38.300> high

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
those big cables those were for high

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.420 
those big cables those were for high
powers<00:02:38.960> coax<00:02:39.410> Kalyan<00:02:42.070> yes<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.280> these

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
powers coax Kalyan yes so these

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.820 
powers coax Kalyan yes so these
essentially<00:02:44.210> is<00:02:44.360> stepping<00:02:44.810> down<00:02:44.960> from<00:02:45.020> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
essentially is stepping down from the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.910 
essentially is stepping down from the
carrier<00:02:46.400> high<00:02:46.610> power<00:02:46.880> taking<00:02:47.510> away

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
carrier high power taking away

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.440 
carrier high power taking away
significant<00:02:48.920> amounts<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.340> power<00:02:49.520> down<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
significant amounts of power down to the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.600 
significant amounts of power down to the
low<00:02:51.020> levels<00:02:51.440> that's<00:02:51.620> required<00:02:52.070> by<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.340> head

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
low levels that's required by the head

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.850 
low levels that's required by the head
and<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.090> each<00:02:53.630> carrier<00:02:54.200> will<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.560> similar

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
and so each carrier will have similar

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.100 
and so each carrier will have similar
sort<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.340> equipment<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.510> advantage<00:02:56.990> of

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
sort of equipment and the advantage of

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.690 
sort of equipment and the advantage of
this<00:02:57.290> these<00:02:57.530> trays<00:02:57.860> also<00:02:58.250> give<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:58.580> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
this these trays also give you the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.120 
this these trays also give you the
ability<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:59.510> adjust<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.990> levels<00:03:00.410> into<00:03:00.950> the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
ability to adjust the levels into the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.340 
ability to adjust the levels into the
they<00:03:01.730> had<00:03:01.880> an<00:03:02.030> equipment<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:02.870> also<00:03:03.020> make

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
they had an equipment but also make

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.410 
they had an equipment but also make
additional<00:03:03.920> optimization<00:03:04.820> on<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.060> uplink

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
additional optimization on the uplink

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.730 
additional optimization on the uplink
side<00:03:05.690> when<00:03:05.930> there's<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.230> different<00:03:06.590> noise

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
side when there's a different noise

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.680 
side when there's a different noise
floor<00:03:07.130> in<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.370> station<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.420> now<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
floor in the station this is now the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.710 
floor in the station this is now the
head<00:03:09.440> end<00:03:09.710> of<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.950> facility<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.940> this<00:03:11.540> is

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
head end of the facility so this is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.530 
head end of the facility so this is
essentially<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.680> central<00:03:13.670> component<00:03:14.330> for

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
essentially the central component for

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.380 
essentially the central component for
every<00:03:14.900> single<00:03:15.170> station<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.100> this<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.970> where<00:03:17.180> we

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
every single station so this is where we

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.410 
every single station so this is where we
take<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:18.440> inputs<00:03:19.010> from<00:03:19.250> every<00:03:19.610> carrier<00:03:19.910> so

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
take the inputs from every carrier so

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.729 
take the inputs from every carrier so
from<00:03:20.980> 2g<00:03:21.980> 3G<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.820> 4G<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.540> combine<00:03:24.320> them<00:03:24.560> into

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
from 2g 3G and 4G and combine them into

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.680 
from 2g 3G and 4G and combine them into
a<00:03:24.890> system<00:03:25.370> that<00:03:25.550> we<00:03:25.640> can<00:03:25.850> communicate<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
a system that we can communicate to the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.300 
a system that we can communicate to the
station<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.350> what<00:03:27.500> we're<00:03:27.620> looking<00:03:27.860> at<00:03:27.950> here<00:03:28.250> is

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
station so what we're looking at here is

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.750 
station so what we're looking at here is
each<00:03:28.760> rack<00:03:29.209> is<00:03:29.420> essentially<00:03:30.110> two<00:03:30.890> stations<00:03:31.550> so

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
each rack is essentially two stations so

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.110 
each rack is essentially two stations so
is<00:03:31.940> station<00:03:32.390> number<00:03:32.420> references<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:34.120> the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
is station number references to the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.540 
is station number references to the
MTA's<00:03:35.600> association<00:03:36.500> for<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.709> station<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.370> this

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
MTA's association for a station so this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.180 
MTA's association for a station so this
may<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:38.050> 33rd<00:03:39.050> Street<00:03:39.500> or<00:03:39.709> something<00:03:39.739> like

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
may be 33rd Street or something like

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.479 
may be 33rd Street or something like
that

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
that

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.449 
that
and<00:03:40.670> then<00:03:41.180> each<00:03:41.450> sector<00:03:42.230> has<00:03:42.530> each<00:03:42.890> technology

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
and then each sector has each technology

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.230 
and then each sector has each technology
inside<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.420> so

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.330 

it<00:03:49.240> all<00:03:49.420> aggregates<00:03:49.990> into<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.440> same<00:03:50.680> box<00:03:50.950> but

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
it all aggregates into the same box but

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.340 
it all aggregates into the same box but
essentially<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.000> system<00:03:52.450> is<00:03:52.569> broken<00:03:52.870> up<00:03:53.140> into

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
essentially the system is broken up into

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.680 
essentially the system is broken up into
bands<00:03:53.770> so<00:03:54.190> obviously<00:03:54.580> on<00:03:54.819> our<00:03:54.940> system<00:03:55.390> we<00:03:55.540> have

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
bands so obviously on our system we have

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.699 
bands so obviously on our system we have
700<00:03:56.470> we<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.770> 800<00:03:57.430> we<00:03:57.610> have<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.910> 15<00:03:58.500> 1900<00:03:59.500> and

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
700 we have 800 we have a 15 1900 and

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.520 
700 we have 800 we have a 15 1900 and
2100<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.610> we'll<00:04:01.240> keep<00:04:01.420> expanding<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.290> so

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
2100 and we'll keep expanding that so

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.590 
2100 and we'll keep expanding that so
the<00:04:02.680> advantage<00:04:03.100> of<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.310> system<00:04:03.580> is<00:04:04.030> it's

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
the advantage of this system is it's

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.630 
the advantage of this system is it's
flexible<00:04:05.200> enough<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.680> add<00:04:05.830> different<00:04:06.400> bands

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
flexible enough to add different bands

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.730 
flexible enough to add different bands
that<00:04:06.970> add<00:04:07.090> different<00:04:07.480> carriers<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.620> the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
that add different carriers to the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.410 
that add different carriers to the
network<00:04:09.130> from<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.730> point<00:04:09.970> on<00:04:10.150> there's<00:04:10.360> a

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
network from this point on there's a

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.330 
network from this point on there's a
single<00:04:10.840> fiber<00:04:11.080> that<00:04:11.440> leads<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.980> whichever

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
single fiber that leads to whichever

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.760 
single fiber that leads to whichever
station<00:04:12.880> this<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.180> connected<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
station this is connected to this is the

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.470 
station this is connected to this is the
massive<00:04:15.250> amount<00:04:15.580> of<00:04:15.700> batteries<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.329> they

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
massive amount of batteries that they

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.509 
massive amount of batteries that they
provide<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.930> protect<00:04:17.530> their<00:04:17.769> equipment<00:04:18.340> so

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
provide to protect their equipment so

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.300 
provide to protect their equipment so
essentially<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:20.140> power<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:20.859> building

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
essentially the power to this building

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.640 
essentially the power to this building
was<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.609> go<00:04:21.730> down<00:04:22.060> we<00:04:22.930> wouldn't<00:04:23.230> want<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.470> lose

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
was to go down we wouldn't want to lose

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.140 
was to go down we wouldn't want to lose
all<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.070> equipment<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:24.580> this<00:04:24.760> building

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
all the equipment in this building

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.610 
all the equipment in this building
because<00:04:25.480> that<00:04:25.660> would<00:04:25.810> affect<00:04:26.140> what's<00:04:26.350> in<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
because that would affect what's in the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.890 
because that would affect what's in the
subway<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.610> can<00:04:27.760> see<00:04:27.940> there's<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.270> significant

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
subway you can see there's a significant

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.780 
subway you can see there's a significant
amount<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.230> equipment<00:04:29.500> here<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.100> this<00:04:30.610> is

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
amount of equipment here and this is

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.909 
amount of equipment here and this is
extremely<00:04:31.270> heavy<00:04:31.840> equipment<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:32.620> all<00:04:32.770> the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
extremely heavy equipment so all the

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.250 
extremely heavy equipment so all the
flooring<00:04:33.430> is<00:04:33.550> actually<00:04:33.910> being<00:04:34.260> reinforced

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
flooring is actually being reinforced

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.050 
flooring is actually being reinforced
with<00:04:35.410> steel<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.980> ensure<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.520> it's<00:04:36.700> held<00:04:36.910> up

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
with steel to ensure that it's held up

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.280 
with steel to ensure that it's held up
inside<00:04:37.480> this<00:04:37.660> building

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
inside this building

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.650 
inside this building
so<00:04:38.530> nathan<00:04:38.830> is<00:04:38.919> our<00:04:39.070> last<00:04:39.310> up<00:04:39.580> on<00:04:39.760> our<00:04:39.910> transit

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
so nathan is our last up on our transit

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.810 
so nathan is our last up on our transit
wireless<00:04:41.020> tour<00:04:41.260> talk<00:04:41.980> about<00:04:42.250> how<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.460> fiber

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
wireless tour talk about how the fiber

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.700 
wireless tour talk about how the fiber
comes<00:04:43.180> in<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.600> fiber<00:04:43.810> goes<00:04:44.080> out<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.560> what

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
comes in the fiber goes out and what

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.320 
comes in the fiber goes out and what
we're<00:04:44.830> looking<00:04:44.950> at<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.370> room<00:04:45.669> so

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
we're looking at in this room so

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.900 
we're looking at in this room so
obviously<00:04:46.830> feeding<00:04:47.830> fiber<00:04:48.130> from<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.640> room

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
obviously feeding fiber from this room

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.030 
obviously feeding fiber from this room
needs<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.419> go<00:04:49.630> out<00:04:49.780> into<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.200> street<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:50.800> from

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
needs to go out into the street so from

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.550 
needs to go out into the street so from
this<00:04:51.190> point<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:52.479> head<00:04:52.690> end<00:04:52.870> connections<00:04:53.410> of

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
this point the head end connections of

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.469 
this point the head end connections of
fiber<00:04:53.800> distribution<00:04:54.070> frames<00:04:54.850> that<00:04:55.060> converts

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
fiber distribution frames that converts

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:01.380 
fiber distribution frames that converts
onto<00:04:55.900> our<00:04:56.020> eight<00:04:56.229> sixty<00:04:56.680> four<00:04:56.890> five

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.210 

it<00:05:01.780> doesn't<00:05:02.229> look<00:05:02.380> like<00:05:02.410> it<00:05:02.740> would<00:05:02.890> hold<00:05:03.010> eight

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
it doesn't look like it would hold eight

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.740 
it doesn't look like it would hold eight
hundred<00:05:03.520> and<00:05:03.610> sixty-four<00:05:04.090> but<00:05:04.300> this<00:05:04.419> is<00:05:04.570> two

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
hundred and sixty-four but this is two

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:22.230 
hundred and sixty-four but this is two
reels<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.280> 864<00:05:12.030> 538<00:05:20.460> in<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.550> street<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.060> in

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
reels of 864 538 in the street and in

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.840 
reels of 864 538 in the street and in
the

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
the

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.670 
the
