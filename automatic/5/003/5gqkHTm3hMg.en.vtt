00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:18.090
 healthy plants and high yields are 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.980
 our biggest goal 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.140
 long before the first plant starts 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.480
 we want to start germinating 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.739
 conditions for a rich harvest 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.149
 create a breezy and loose ground 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.960
 supports the growth of your plants 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.980
 from the beginning with the underground loose 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.140
 ran terratec xs and xxs we have something 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.780
 created that their floors change 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.780
 will and it will change you 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.230
 we use special tines the new one 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.550
 form is ideal for 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.769
 deep and humus rich soil with the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.010
 aggressive position we reach one 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:07.890
 special ease at very large 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.890
 Working depths up to 70 centimeters 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.470
 the terratec raises the floor over the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.510
 entire work is deep and big 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.229
 clods will not cut through any 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.229
 crushed 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.490
 wings flock additionally cause one 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 full-surface machining 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.480
 All these features are the key too 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.840
 a balanced water balance of their 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.070
 floors 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.979
 Surface water thinks faster in the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.440
 soil and capital water 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.869
 unhindered to the roots of 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.240
 additional oxygen activates the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.430
 Soil life increases plant health 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.430
 and thus increases your income 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.509
 we use at the terratec as well 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.030
 a completely new frame construction by 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.979
 we achieve fixed welded elements 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.239
 a stability at a 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.280
 bolted method would be impossible 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.530
 a tear-off screw protects the frame 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.730
 and the tines also in addition 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.940
 overloads as standard is also the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.860
 hydraulic roller adjustment with 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.080
 she is revolutionary 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
 insensitive to dirt and moreover 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.280
 wear they can to their 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.180
 use a wide variety of wheat 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.760
 Surface treatment and underground 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.220
 No loosening in one go 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.910
 which soil regardless of harvest 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.040
 arrears of the terratec opens a 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.799
 new world of possibilities at the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.220
 preserving mulch sowing direct sowing 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.220
 the same procedure as conventional 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.220
 processing methods 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.470
 the terra thick 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.140
 will change how they work and how 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.140
 you think
