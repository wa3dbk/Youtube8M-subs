00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.090
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.040
 those two on the seo today we work one 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.740
 new section is a new section that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.480
 is called the angle of the monkey is not 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.460
 a section on kids animals for 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.560
 monkey we mean that desire you 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.000
 take something to buy and then 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.859
 it will be a column that will deal with it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 mainly in our projects 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.330
 of purchase in the videogame field 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 you know when you plant it 1 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.220
 monkeys is not here 15 quintals them there 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.370
 the whisper take take take it 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.290
 should even if you don't have the money 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 bribes to the mafia to buy 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.860
 that game here is this corner 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.520
 he will talk about those games 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 we absolutely want to have or start 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.989
 this is a column with news 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.469
 which indeed could shock many 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.750
 of you 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.180
 we are talking about a purchase that many 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.430
 do not expect because we miss from 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.920
 this series of three video games 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.619
 outputs instead of 4,000 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.960
 we haven't created it for very long 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.200
 time but we are talking about the series 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.869
 call of duty exact pool 9 exit there 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.210
 costa we decided to go back to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 head on this game and see how 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.990
 it goes on because there are dogs there are 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.440
 dogs and we don't talk about developers 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.869
 for once we talk about we talk about 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.970
 real dogs actually boys 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.530
 we have collected some information 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.320
 on the game we have seen some 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.229
 review a few articles in preview 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.670
 and we must tell you that unless these 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.899
 journalists have not written one 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.240
 tide of bullshit 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.799
 we are facing a step backwards from 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.289
 part of infinity ward and activision 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.390
 because some things and they were there 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.240
 Deep down on the cock they were 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.399
 eliminate exactly starting from some 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.229
 mode we say actually have been 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.970
 enter some new modes that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.459
 which perhaps interests us a little more 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.500
 of the others is the blitz in mode 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.110
 practice you are two bersani teams 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.909
 as usual and each must reach 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.399
 a portal an opposing door 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.740
 within which once entered 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.739
 will do precisely and will return to the base then 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.390
 to defend it precisely a teleportation 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.150
 exactly as it happened in fps 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.700
 more classic arena and which it should 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.350
 give the game that immediacy that 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.049
 maybe it has no horns capture the flag 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.880
 with a normal death match everything 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.310
 it should come a little faster like 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.590
 you know we don't have much time for 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.989
 then play these quick modes there 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.900
 really like a lot of exact 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.780
 in short, this blitz mode is 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.600
 interesting but also interesting 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.980
 subtraction in this case because they have 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.040
 finally eliminated 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.580
 a back that was there was particularly 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.890
 disliked it is the former trade which 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.110
 what happens with this with this burke 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.190
 which once reached a jill top 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.290
 this was activated because attack 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.840
 plane could kill from above 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.690
 whoever is an escape thing relieves ie one 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.849
 that already reaches you a thousand thousand kill not 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.610
 you can make him do a thousand more that 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.829
 from above that I give you if they have it 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.720
 understood therefore anyway they reported 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.700
 fighting on a more human level 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.160
 I hope you shoot me there is no jesus 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.410
 which sends me the flood certain point 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.910
 so let's say this thing is a lot 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.560
 We liked one thing we are waiting 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.140
 to see to see with ours 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.540
 hands and that control system 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.160
 however the control wires are always 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.220
 the usual because we always have it 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.260
 said of cod there is something we like 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.980
 that is, we have always liked the sector 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.080
 technician is exact in fact it is over that ai 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.060
 cod. commands 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.540
 and almost perfect, that is, it can be traced 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.430
 almost to a counter strike counter strike 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.730
 that we remember it is a game for us 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.600
 very much like it will have some flaws 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.520
 there are some roses to the graphics 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.570
 several things that can please and not 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.820
 pleasure but the affinity with the commands is 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.670
 unquestionable perfect so much so that cod 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.990
 is also fine played on games and 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.210
 this is something they can 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.220
 really afford very few games 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.060
 we will obviously play on pc 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.690
 so with the fuck that I use a game of 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.480
 boys 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.330
 until single player again but still in 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.120
 multiplayer we will not use main game for e 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.820
 so we'll play on the pc and we'll do it 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.410
 also know how this behaved 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.020
 time infinity ward for what 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.580
 concerns the graphic sector considering that 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.650
 su modern warfare 3 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.570
 we played very little at home 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.280
 of a friend who has a pc of the madonna 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.230
 here is anna normal game ie he was going 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.510
 really a framerate that view 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.419
 that graphic you didn't expect ok 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.360
 the last thing we have to say about cod 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.790
 is the fact that we could decide to 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.400
 use the ten different soldiers 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.460
 so once the class decided 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.790
 we can make that determined grow 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.250
 soldier I don't know sniper fairies fairies 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.610
 grow the sniper then position yourself 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.440
 because of the fact of upgrades 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.540
 is placed by check in and so on for 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.730
 the assault we are unfortunately not 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.130
 we are too practical for what they are 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.110
 the loans no these bands of 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.060
 growth of the characters because they like you 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.350
 we said nothing 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.330
 we played the last chapters 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.580
 but we are pleased to know that this 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.100
 what has been simplified there is only one 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.050
 prestige from the mayor the tragedy e 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.070
 so to us but we like it when a 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.350
 game does not have this component gdr that 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.570
 forces you to survive from it 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.720
 boy can't I save knight's 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.639
 place to shoot while waiting but not there 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.220
 like to stay 40 hours behind a game 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:52.310
 because in short if after three years we have 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.440
 now 80 90 now said go ie how it does 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.510
 in fact battlefield 4 I think that 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.290
 we will dispute shit also for 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:03.950
 this then you will take gta 5 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.500
 you will take part p4 you will take the 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.720
 chickenpox measles and so on 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.150
 write us in the comments what we must 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.970
 take write us if you like this 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.889
 heading you want we would like 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.600
 then carry on in the week then 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.760
 Let us know what you think 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.570
 yes, maybe write us below 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.570
 your ski
