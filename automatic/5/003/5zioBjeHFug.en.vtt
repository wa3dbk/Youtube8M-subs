00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.640 
is of course because I use a random
number<00:02:42.480> generator<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.110> if<00:02:43.260> people<00:02:43.530> leave

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
number generator and if people leave

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.900 
number generator and if people leave
more<00:02:43.920> than<00:02:44.070> one<00:02:44.220> comment<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:44.790> it

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
more than one comment then it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.820 
more than one comment then it
artificially<00:02:45.570> changes<00:02:46.140> people's<00:02:46.440> chances

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
artificially changes people's chances

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.200 
artificially changes people's chances
around<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.190> messes<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.550> whole<00:02:47.670> thing<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:47.970> so

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
around it messes the whole thing up so

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.570 
around it messes the whole thing up so
that's<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.870> very<00:02:48.900> important<00:02:49.470> rule<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.280> only

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
that's a very important rule the only

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.830 
that's a very important rule the only
other<00:02:50.610> requirement<00:02:51.240> is<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.480> must<00:02:51.750> be

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
other requirement is that you must be

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.630 
other requirement is that you must be
subscribed<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.650> channel<00:02:52.710> although<00:02:53.610> I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
subscribed to this channel although I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.430 
subscribed to this channel although I
would<00:02:53.850> think<00:02:54.000> that's<00:02:54.210> kind<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.600> given<00:02:54.900> so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
would think that's kind of a given so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.930 
would think that's kind of a given so
that's<00:02:55.620> all<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.890> guys<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.760> then

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
that's all you guys have to do and then

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.250 
that's all you guys have to do and then
what<00:02:57.090> I'm<00:02:57.240> gonna<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.720> I'm<00:02:57.900> going<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.110> come
