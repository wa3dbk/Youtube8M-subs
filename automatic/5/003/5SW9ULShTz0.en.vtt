warfare<00:01:02.670> 2<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.589> personally<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
warfare 2 I personally like the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.010 
warfare 2 I personally like the
submachine<00:01:05.430> gun<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.939> many<00:01:06.090> dislike<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
submachine gun for many dislike it and I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
submachine gun for many dislike it and I
can<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.409> why<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:08.460> gun<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.729> known<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.299> its

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
can see why this gun is known for its

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
can see why this gun is known for its
high<00:01:09.600> rate<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> fire<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.500> use<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.920> gun

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
high rate of fire and use this gun

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.679 
high rate of fire and use this gun
effectively<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> carrier<00:01:12.210> must<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
effectively the carrier must have

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.109 
effectively the carrier must have
perfect<00:01:13.260> accuracy<00:01:13.680> alright<00:01:14.580> let's<00:01:14.820> find<00:01:15.000> out

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
perfect accuracy alright let's find out

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.359 
perfect accuracy alright let's find out
some<00:01:15.330> details<00:01:15.540> about<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.259> gun<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.009> vector

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
some details about this gun the vector

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.270 
some details about this gun the vector
k10<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.060> unlocked<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.900> level<00:01:18.930> 16<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
k10 is unlocked at level 16 and I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.859 
k10 is unlocked at level 16 and I
wouldn't<00:01:20.670> recommend<00:01:21.000> using<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.509> prestige

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
wouldn't recommend using a prestige

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170 
wouldn't recommend using a prestige
token<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.590> gun<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.580> very<00:01:23.850> close<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
token on this gun as it is very close to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
token on this gun as it is very close to
the<00:01:24.390> starting<00:01:24.810> level<00:01:25.020> next<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.430> amazed<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the starting level next I was amazed to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.700 
the starting level next I was amazed to
see<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.420> time<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.840> kill<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> vector

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
see that the time to kill for the vector

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550 
see that the time to kill for the vector
was<00:01:28.920> four<00:01:29.250> bullets<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.880> close<00:01:30.180> range<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.840> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
was four bullets at close range as I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
was four bullets at close range as I
went<00:01:31.770> farther<00:01:32.040> back<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.640> turned<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> five

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
went farther back it turned to a five

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.810 
went farther back it turned to a five
and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> six<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.979> only<00:01:35.220> reason<00:01:35.640> people

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and then a six the only reason people

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.999 
and then a six the only reason people
probably<00:01:36.329> dislike<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.259> gun<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
probably dislike this gun is because of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.340 
probably dislike this gun is because of
the<00:01:38.159> low<00:01:38.340> damage<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.060> recoil<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.200> takes

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the low damage and recoil as it takes

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.710 
the low damage and recoil as it takes
four<00:01:40.680> bullets<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> kill<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.180> definitely

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
four bullets to kill this is definitely

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.240 
four bullets to kill this is definitely
below<00:01:43.020> average<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.829> most<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
below average because most of the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.679 
below average because most of the

you guys the recoil of the vector and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.330 
you guys the recoil of the vector and
show<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.959> guys<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.379> how<00:02:43.530> accurate<00:02:43.739> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
show you guys just how accurate it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670 
show you guys just how accurate it
really<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.879> as<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.690> see<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.110> vector<00:02:46.440> k10

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
really is as you can see the vector k10

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.130 
really is as you can see the vector k10
has<00:02:47.129> a<00:02:47.160> lot<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.459> recoil<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.180> at<00:02:48.480> close<00:02:48.780> range

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.440 
has a lot of recoil and at close range
the<00:02:49.410> recoil<00:02:49.829> lessons<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:50.489> one<00:02:50.700> at<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.879> distance

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the recoil lessons but one at a distance

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.770 
the recoil lessons but one at a distance
the<00:02:51.599> recoil<00:02:51.989> goes<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.560> vertical<00:02:52.799> angle<00:02:53.459> as

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
the recoil goes in a vertical angle as

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.030 
the recoil goes in a vertical angle as
vertical<00:02:54.780> recoil<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.290> pretty<00:02:55.560> easy<00:02:55.799> to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
vertical recoil is pretty easy to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.559 
vertical recoil is pretty easy to
control<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.670> will<00:02:56.910> still<00:02:57.120> say<00:02:57.359> that<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
control I will still say that the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
control I will still say that the
accuracy<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:58.470> gun<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.709> below<00:02:59.129> average

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
accuracy on this gun is below average

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.250 
accuracy on this gun is below average
which<00:02:59.879> is<00:03:00.060> why<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.269> gun<00:03:00.629> is<00:03:00.660> some<00:03:00.989> people's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
which is why this gun is some people's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.710 
which is why this gun is some people's
most<00:03:01.500> hated<00:03:01.859> weapon<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.910> perks<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.420> think

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
most hated weapon the perks that I think

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.509 
most hated weapon the perks that I think
would<00:03:03.810> be<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:03.989> best<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.560> use<00:03:04.709> for<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.099> weapon

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
would be the best to use for this weapon

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.130 
would be the best to use for this weapon
would<00:03:05.640> be<00:03:05.790> lightweight<00:03:06.090> scavenger<00:03:06.959> and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
would be lightweight scavenger and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.170 
would be lightweight scavenger and
extreme<00:03:07.680> conditioning<00:03:08.190> when<00:03:08.849> you<00:03:08.940> are<00:03:09.030> using

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
extreme conditioning when you are using

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.789 
extreme conditioning when you are using
a<00:03:09.390> submachine<00:03:09.959> gun<00:03:10.109> you<00:03:10.260> have<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.620> use<00:03:10.769> a

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
a submachine gun you have to use a

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.160 
a submachine gun you have to use a
strength<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.370> mobility<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.690> only<00:03:12.900> way<00:03:13.109> to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
strength in mobility and the only way to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.050 
strength in mobility and the only way to
do<00:03:13.379> that<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.799> put<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.250> perk<00:03:14.459> lightweight

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
do that is to put the perk lightweight

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.539 
do that is to put the perk lightweight
on<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:15.599> you<00:03:15.660> guys<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:16.019> move<00:03:16.230> faster<00:03:16.549> scavenger

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
on so you guys can move faster scavenger

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.069 
on so you guys can move faster scavenger
is<00:03:17.639> a<00:03:17.669> good<00:03:17.880> perk<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.329> all<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.720> submachine

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
is a good perk with all the submachine

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.170 
is a good perk with all the submachine
guns<00:03:19.410> because<00:03:19.650> with<00:03:19.950> all<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.340> high<00:03:20.549> fire<00:03:20.880> rate

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
