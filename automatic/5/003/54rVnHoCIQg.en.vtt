 and after a two year break which both 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.340
 just enough to save money 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.590

 combined all-wheel drive cars 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.900
 class m 4 for a beginner to pacify so powerful 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.580
 and fast technique is not an easy task 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.180
 and in the debut year of 2005 among difficult and his 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.600
 when I finally got behind the wheel 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.890
 car in able to fight 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.370
 if not for the victory, then for the podium and for sure 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.130
 but here it should be noted 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.520
 what over the years 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 the existence of class m 4 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.520
 it has practically 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.159
 unattainable for the rest 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.259

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.189
 became exclusively pilots 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.760

 destroy the existing 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.709
 alignment of forces is not enough to have 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.079
 talent and desire alone 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.319
 you also need to spend a lot 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.039
 amount of money 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.859
 Sergey Dubinkin Denis Parshin of his own 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.889
 the printing machine did not have banknotes and 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.659
 the upcoming season decided 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.989
 concentrate on the platform create 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.919

 car repair racing team 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.019
 which could enter 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.359
 same as they are not burdened 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.239
 money but burned do rally 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.019
 people 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.749
 in 2006 year 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.259
 safari auto team was the only one 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.679
 team of our city are represented 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:48.819
 Moscow 7 4 But there were times when the tables 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.779
 members of this prestigious class 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.839
 sports cars were 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.319
 at least a quarter full 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.639
 from Khabarovsk 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.019
 2006 did not become something outstanding in life 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.179
 our team 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:03.169
 as the season progressed 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.229
 lack of funds 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.009
 so and lack of experience fighting on 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.819
 track nevertheless sergey trubin in 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.949
 some moments of racing is not something 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.379
 inferior to rivals but at times even their 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.249
 excelled Andrei Chernetsky who 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.199
 debuted that year speaking in a pass 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.049
 from 6 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.269
 became the best newcomer to that championship 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.840
 it's one thing to build a team 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.529
 lead her to success 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:30.779
 2007 began with the fact that as part of cars safari 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.369
 appeared promising 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:33.059
 riders 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:35.369
 which went for this kart school 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:37.870
 and ice racing and also held 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.129
 a pair of rime rides 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.010
 Championship Khabarovsk region 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.649
 earlier 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:43.339
 Viktor Medvedev was going to 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:44.749
 participate far east 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.169
 championship in full 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.409
 meant visiting all of them 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.709
 exception stages 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.859
 and the fact that he joined the safari card allowed 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.079
 he use their experience more experienced 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:56.879
 athletes 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.989
 as for sergey trubina 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.319
 and Denis Parshin they started the championship 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.290
 2007 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.650
 with more or less clear to yourself 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.189
 goals first 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.760
 they would like each of the races 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.069
 earn points 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.739
 secondly, how to perform better 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.559
 yourself in Khabarovsk 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.169
 where they will be closely watched 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.249
 their fans as well as the only show 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:24.249
 Primorye oil brand sponsor 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.770
 in the first race of the season which took place in 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.819
 Blagoveshchensk 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.050
 Sergey from ruby ​​had a hard time 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.190
 literally the day before his Subaru race 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.370
 has undergone nothing provoked 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.669
 local military auto attacks 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:38.809
 professional 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:40.770
 in an unequal fight with a truck 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.360
 impreza lost all night before the race 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.400
 the guys had to recover 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.300
 broken front of their cars 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.710
 in this situation for a good result 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.499
 I did not have to hope 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.039
 and fourth in the race 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.699
 more likely to regard as success did not go 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:57.559
 defeats 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:59.339
 second stage of the championship on the island 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:02.269
 Russian safari car crew had to 

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.179
 miss two weeks before the start 

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.939
 I found the race in Vladivostok 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.540
 Komarovsky edge during which 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.310
 According to Sergey Trubina 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.770
 engine failed 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.949
 among them is not so Khabarovsk Minimal 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.650
 yourself the third stage of the championship distant 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.569
 east 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.080
 however, for the sake of Konovalov’s memory 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.050
 Khabarovsk disappointment 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.289
 second time in a row 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.590
 their engine failed 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.919
 everything went to that 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.129
 what's the expected breakthrough up 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.430
 will turn out 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.690
 autumn has come which means it's about time 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.400
 go to Ussuriysk 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.190
 before the end of the championship 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.379
 there were only two stages left 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.819
 On account Sergei Denis still 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.039
 there will be all the same 10 points for the first stage 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.779
 Ussuri dublin marked on the third 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:48.460
 a place 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.169
 which is not bad at all considering that 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.240
 class table 1 4 appeared twelve 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.860
 plowing in the end 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.770
 interrupted by the death of Vladimir Safonov 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.740
 race 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.690
 the parshin pipe has finished on 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.289
 fourth position and this allowed them 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:04.089
 hope 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:05.800
 on decent and pulkovo 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 at the end of the season 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.000
 but your own 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.999
 result 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.309
 the guys read less valuable 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:14.699
 much more they were worried about their fate 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.830
 team standings 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.830
 d author safari ranked second 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.509
 cause so unexpected since summer 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:24.620
 teams have become successful performances 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.499
 Dmitry Medvedev cluster 6 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:30.249
 with whom only reliably scored points 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:31.070
 was happening 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.809
 according to their results on occasion 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.909
 but also won the first stage 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:36.469
 Blagoveshchensk 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.049
 final fifth stage of the championship 

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:41.290
 Far East earlier Amur Dawns 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.540
 passed more adverse 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.029
 weather conditions 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.509
 heavy rains race game 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.770
 during the competition became heavy 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.729
 a challenge when technicians and pilots 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:53.780
 Viktor Medvedev 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.210
 came down to the first kilometer of races 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.790
 was coming this time 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.790
 defend the interests of the team alone 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:04.419
 over the past five years 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.249
 no Khabarovsk team 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:08.399
 did not rise so high table 

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.430
 results 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.949
 do not miss yourself at home 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.389
 such a possibility rubens pussiny not 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:14.770
 were going 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.470
 at the finish of the race Subaru Impreza Auto 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.080
 safari came 30 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.139
 which guaranteed the team a second 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:22.909
 line team 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.069
 as for personal grade rome class 4 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:28.499
 tons and then at the last stage points 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:30.370
 we allowed ourselves this minute 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.639
 Denis Parshin 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.270
 take the fourth row 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.629
 overall championship lazio m 4 

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:38.219
 Here and in this regard with the fact that despite 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:40.509
 all tons problems got to the finish 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:43.509
 Of course, all the same team thrown out 

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:45.710
 we will cope with problems
