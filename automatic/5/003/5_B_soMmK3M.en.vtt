00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
trying to do is what we've got here

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.189 
trying to do is what we've got here
which<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.130> Sal<00:00:20.369> poem<00:00:20.760> Oh<00:00:20.910> image<00:00:21.300> plane<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.990> that

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
which is Sal poem Oh image plane so that

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920 
which is Sal poem Oh image plane so that
you've<00:00:22.680> got<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> front<00:00:23.100> side<00:00:23.490> view<00:00:23.930> working

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
you've got the front side view working

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.570 
you've got the front side view working
off<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> both<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.470> them<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.010> we'll<00:00:26.430> be

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
off of both of them so we'll be

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.339 
off of both of them so we'll be
duplicating<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.390> before<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.230> want

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
duplicating but before we do that I want

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.970 
duplicating but before we do that I want
to<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:28.740> set<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:30.199> settings<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.740> if

sure your undo is set to on and you're
cuter<00:01:21.060> infinite<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.650> back<00:01:22.830> as

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
cuter infinite so you can go back as

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.010 
cuter infinite so you can go back as
many<00:01:23.159> times<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:23.939> we're<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> be

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
many times as you like we're going to be

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.420 
many times as you like we're going to be
deleting<00:01:25.470> history<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.369> really

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
deleting history so it's not really

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.429 
deleting history so it's not really
going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> make<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.030> processor<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:27.869> memory

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
going to make a processor or memory

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.550 
going to make a processor or memory
problem<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:30.030> make<00:01:30.450> sure<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.659> they're<00:01:31.200> there

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
problem so make sure that they're there

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.590 
problem so make sure that they're there
set<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.759> keep<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:33.299> back

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
set and that way you can keep going back

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
set and that way you can keep going back
if<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.900> need<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 

don't<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.870> need<00:01:40.020> anything<00:01:40.380> there

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
don't you think we need anything there

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280 
don't you think we need anything there
I've<00:01:40.830> had<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.780> tell<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.050> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
I've had just out just to tell you the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.930 
I've had just out just to tell you the
applications<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.160> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.550> set

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
applications there you can actually set

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.900 
applications there you can actually set
paths<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.710> Maya<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.430> communicate

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
paths so that Maya can communicate

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.270 
paths so that Maya can communicate
directly<00:01:48.150> with<00:01:48.480> other<00:01:48.780> programs<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.040> see

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
directly with other programs you can see

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.420 
directly with other programs you can see
