00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.350 
secondly we have the x-wing Starfighter
I<00:01:25.369> don't<00:01:26.369> think<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:27.119> need<00:01:27.299> another

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.380 
I don't think we really need another
x-wing<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.590> think<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.759> an<00:01:29.939> x-wing

Starfighter<00:01:31.020> somewhere<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.869> for

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Starfighter somewhere but you know for

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.130 
Starfighter somewhere but you know for
all<00:01:34.170> those<00:01:34.380> new<00:01:34.650> people<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:36.140> anybody

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
all those new people you know anybody

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
all those new people you know anybody
knew<00:01:37.350> until<00:01:37.530> lego<00:01:38.040> might<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.790> well<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.119> make

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
knew until lego might as well just make

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.469 
knew until lego might as well just make
another<00:01:39.329> X<00:01:39.780> 1<00:01:40.250> then<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.430> Cacique<00:01:41.939> trooper

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
another X 1 then we have Cacique trooper

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.429 
another X 1 then we have Cacique trooper
and<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:44.250> believe<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> battle<00:01:45.750> pack<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and I believe that is a battle pack and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.880 
and I believe that is a battle pack and
which<00:01:47.040> will<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.399> getting<00:01:47.990> acha<00:01:48.990> jee<00:01:49.170> clone

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
which will be getting acha jee clone

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.960 
which will be getting acha jee clone
troopers<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> bookies<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
troopers and bookies so that would be a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.319 
troopers and bookies so that would be a
very<00:01:54.360> cool<00:01:54.840> set<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.759> especially<00:01:56.759> for

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
very cool set to get especially for

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.310 
very cool set to get especially for
those<00:01:57.509> trying<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> make<00:01:58.290> chic<00:01:59.130> mocks<00:02:00.320> second

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
those trying to make chic mocks second

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.940 
those trying to make chic mocks second
layer<00:02:01.939> secondly<00:02:02.939> fourthly<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
layer secondly fourthly we have the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.029 
layer secondly fourthly we have the
death<00:02:05.189> star<00:02:05.549> trooper<00:02:06.299> which<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.320> battle

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
death star trooper which is a battle

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.580 
death star trooper which is a battle
pack<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.550> well<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:09.140> believe<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.289> will<00:02:10.379> come

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.640 
some battle droids we have the vulture
droid<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:48.510> who<00:02:49.510> knows<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:49.750> that's<00:02:50.109> a<00:02:50.230> planet's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
droid and who knows if that's a planet's

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.449 
droid and who knows if that's a planet's
it<00:02:50.829> or<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.340> says<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.239> can<00:02:52.659> be<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:54.010> don't

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
it or not it says it can be I don't

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.920 
it or not it says it can be I don't
think<00:02:54.549> it<00:02:54.879> will<00:02:55.000> just<00:02:55.269> because<00:02:55.599> they<00:02:55.750> won't

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
think it will just because they won't

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.050 
think it will just because they won't
have<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:56.379> planet<00:02:56.980> sets<00:02:57.250> they'll<00:02:57.730> probably

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
have to planet sets they'll probably

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.030 
have to planet sets they'll probably
have<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.269> three<00:02:58.689> so<00:02:58.959> my<00:02:59.079> guess<00:02:59.139> is<00:02:59.319> they<00:02:59.620> won't

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
have a three so my guess is they won't

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.160 
have a three so my guess is they won't
be<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> planet<00:03:00.549> said<00:03:00.909> it<00:03:01.629> will<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:01.959> be<00:03:02.019> a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
be a planet said it will just be a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.809 
be a planet said it will just be a
normal<00:03:02.879> vulture<00:03:03.879> droid<00:03:04.090> should<00:03:04.629> be<00:03:04.750> alright

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
normal vulture droid should be alright

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.460 
normal vulture droid should be alright
I'm<00:03:06.819> not<00:03:06.939> sure<00:03:07.000> feel<00:03:07.480> good<00:03:07.659> even<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.200> figure

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
I'm not sure feel good even to figure

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.009 
I'm not sure feel good even to figure
some<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.799> are<00:03:08.920> not<00:03:09.239> then<00:03:10.239> we<00:03:10.359> have<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> V<00:03:10.810> wing

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
some that are not then we have a V wing

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.270 
some that are not then we have a V wing
I<00:03:11.859> think<00:03:12.400> all<00:03:12.639> of<00:03:12.670> us<00:03:12.849> know<00:03:13.150> about<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.889> viewing

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
I think all of us know about the viewing

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.229 
I think all of us know about the viewing
that<00:03:15.489> we<00:03:15.579> got<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:16.109> 2005<00:03:17.109> I<00:03:17.530> have<00:03:17.889> that<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.489> it

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
that we got in 2005 I have that so it

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.259 
that we got in 2005 I have that so it
was<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> very<00:03:19.900> cool<00:03:20.379> set<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.970> wonder<00:03:21.970> if<00:03:22.060> they'll

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
was a very cool set I wonder if they'll

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.500 
was a very cool set I wonder if they'll
even<00:03:22.510> make<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.019> better<00:03:23.169> so<00:03:23.340> that's<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.639> good<00:03:25.239> set

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
even make it better so that's a good set

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.659 
even make it better so that's a good set
to<00:03:25.690> look<00:03:25.930> at<00:03:26.169> and<00:03:26.919> we<00:03:27.069> all<00:03:27.160> know<00:03:27.340> about<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
to look at and we all know about the

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.750 
to look at and we all know about the
atapi<00:03:28.090> don't<00:03:28.599> have<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.840> go<00:03:28.959> into<00:03:29.139> that<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
atapi don't have to go into that the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.420 
atapi don't have to go into that the
droid<00:03:30.940> gunship<00:03:31.299> we<00:03:32.230> got<00:03:32.409> that<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:33.190> Clone

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
droid gunship we got that in the Clone

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.009 
droid gunship we got that in the Clone
Wars<00:03:33.639> in<00:03:34.030> 2008<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:35.730> don't<00:03:36.730> know<00:03:37.030> if<00:03:37.629> it'll<00:03:37.959> be

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
Wars in 2008 I don't know if it'll be

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.039 
Wars in 2008 I don't know if it'll be
based<00:03:38.319> off<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.799> clone<00:03:39.010> wars<00:03:39.280> or<00:03:39.400> not<00:03:39.549> but<00:03:40.980> I

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
based off the clone wars or not but I

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.979 
based off the clone wars or not but I
would<00:03:44.049> be<00:03:44.199> cool<00:03:44.949> if<00:03:45.129> it<00:03:45.220> was<00:03:45.280> if<00:03:45.940> they<00:03:46.720> made<00:03:46.959> it

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
would be cool if it was if they made it

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.110 
would be cool if it was if they made it
better<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:48.549> yeah<00:03:49.889> next<00:03:50.889> is<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.040> Republic<00:03:51.699> idea

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
better so yeah next is the Republic idea

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.330 
better so yeah next is the Republic idea

a lot of you are probably asking me what

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.759 
a lot of you are probably asking me what

this forgot to put seven on here and
you're<00:04:03.099> still<00:04:03.400> probably<00:04:03.579> saying<00:04:03.909> what<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.209> the

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
you're still probably saying what is the

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.089 
you're still probably saying what is the
Republic<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:05.079> v7<00:04:05.699> well<00:04:06.699> the<00:04:07.510> Republic<00:04:07.989> a<00:04:08.139> v7<00:04:08.650> is

Republic a v7 well the Republic a v7 is
an<00:04:09.599> anti-vehicle<00:04:10.599> cannon<00:04:11.440> its<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.250> cannons

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
an anti-vehicle cannon its the cannons

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.059 
an anti-vehicle cannon its the cannons
we<00:04:12.849> first<00:04:13.239> see<00:04:13.449> in<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.959> Clone<00:04:14.229> Wars<00:04:14.470> movie

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
we first see in the Clone Wars movie

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.250 
we first see in the Clone Wars movie
that<00:04:15.909> are<00:04:16.239> in<00:04:16.810> like<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.519> one<00:04:18.690> two<00:04:19.690> three<00:04:20.019> four

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
that are in like a one two three four

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.620 
that are in like a one two three four
legs<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:20.829> then<00:04:20.979> they<00:04:21.099> had<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.370> huge<00:04:22.000> cannon

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
legs and then they had the huge cannon

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.510 
legs and then they had the huge cannon
that<00:04:22.659> completely<00:04:23.289> destroys<00:04:23.860> everything<00:04:24.279> in

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
that completely destroys everything in

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.500 
that completely destroys everything in
the<00:04:24.880> first<00:04:25.539> clone<00:04:25.810> wars<00:04:26.080> battle

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
the first clone wars battle

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.500 
the first clone wars battle
so<00:04:26.660> that's<00:04:26.870> what<00:04:27.200> that<00:04:27.230> is<00:04:27.680> if<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:29.000> wanted<00:04:29.360> to

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
so that's what that is if you wanted to

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.320 
so that's what that is if you wanted to
know<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.350> Battle<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:31.480> solid<00:04:32.480> co<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:34.330> I'm

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
know and the Battle of solid co is I'm

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.570 
know and the Battle of solid co is I'm
not<00:04:35.540> actually<00:04:35.900> sure<00:04:36.140> what<00:04:36.680> battle<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.340> is

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
not actually sure what battle that is

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.600 
not actually sure what battle that is
but<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.540> am<00:04:38.720> being<00:04:39.050> told<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:40.070> a<00:04:40.100> battle

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
but I am being told that it is a battle

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.360 
but I am being told that it is a battle
pack<00:04:41.090> so<00:04:41.480> whatever<00:04:44.080> whatever<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.860> it

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
pack so whatever whatever that is it

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.790 
pack so whatever whatever that is it
will<00:04:46.880> have<00:04:47.150> some<00:04:47.570> clone<00:04:47.870> troopers<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.500> believe

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
will have some clone troopers I believe

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.520 
will have some clone troopers I believe
in<00:04:48.980> it<00:04:49.130> if<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:50.210> is<00:04:50.480> truly<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:51.020> clone<00:04:51.290> horse

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
in it if that is truly a clone horse

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.710 
in it if that is truly a clone horse
battle<00:04:51.980> it<00:04:52.400> may<00:04:52.700> be<00:04:52.760> an<00:04:52.910> older<00:04:53.180> public<00:04:53.540> battle

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
battle it may be an older public battle

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.440 
battle it may be an older public battle
i'm<00:04:53.930> not<00:04:54.110> even<00:04:54.290> sure<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:55.130> I'm<00:04:55.670> just<00:04:56.060> being<00:04:56.270> told

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
i'm not even sure so I'm just being told

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.000 
i'm not even sure so I'm just being told
that<00:04:56.600> that<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.020> battle<00:04:57.440> pack<00:04:57.590> which<00:04:57.770> means
