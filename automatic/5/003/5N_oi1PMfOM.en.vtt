even though the trucks don't have a
story<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.760> mean<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> transformers<00:00:30.900> concept<00:00:31.320> was

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
story I mean a transformers concept was

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.810 
story I mean a transformers concept was
simple<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.830> goofy<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.430> least<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> made

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
simple in goofy but at least it made

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.630 
simple in goofy but at least it made
sense<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.290> races<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.380> robots<00:00:34.770> waging<00:00:35.219> war<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
sense to races of robots waging war and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
sense to races of robots waging war and
hiding<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.059> earth<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.390> disguise<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:37.380> what

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
point in the writing process that they

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.119 
point in the writing process that they
go<00:00:39.239> from<00:00:39.420> slot<00:00:39.780> car<00:00:40.050> racers<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> truck

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
