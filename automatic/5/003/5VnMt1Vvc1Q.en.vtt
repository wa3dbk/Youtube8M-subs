bonus here is that I can tell you how
it's<00:00:32.689> actually<00:00:32.899> been<00:00:33.290> going<00:00:33.649> um<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.070> how<00:00:34.190> good

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
it's actually been going um and how good

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.340 
it's actually been going um and how good
it<00:00:34.520> really<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.940> because<00:00:35.629> I've<00:00:35.840> been<00:00:35.870> using<00:00:36.170> it

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
it really is because I've been using it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.490 
it really is because I've been using it
for<00:00:36.379> a<00:00:36.530> while<00:00:36.680> now<00:00:37.059> it<00:00:38.059> is<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.239> polyurethane<00:00:39.020> one

for a while now it is a polyurethane one

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.329 
for a while now it is a polyurethane one
so<00:00:39.890> it's<00:00:40.730> not<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.000> leather<00:00:41.300> ones<00:00:41.539> but<00:00:42.339> it's

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339

it<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:59.660> stays<00:01:59.990> smudged<00:02:00.380> as<00:02:01.370> far<00:02:01.730> as<00:02:01.760> linkers<00:02:02.270> it

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
it it stays smudged as far as linkers it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.790 
it it stays smudged as far as linkers it
may<00:02:02.600> pick<00:02:02.810> up<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:03.050> little<00:02:03.290> bit<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.470> lint<00:02:03.650> if

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
may pick up a little bit of lint if

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.680 
may pick up a little bit of lint if
there's<00:02:04.010> anything<00:02:04.310> on<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:05.000> actual<00:02:05.300> screen

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
there's anything on the actual screen

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.149 
there's anything on the actual screen
but<00:02:05.960> again<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.560> doesn't<00:02:07.430> really<00:02:07.760> do<00:02:08.450> much<00:02:09.159> yes

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
but again it doesn't really do much yes

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.890 
but again it doesn't really do much yes
so<00:02:10.429> doesn't<00:02:11.060> really<00:02:11.180> clean<00:02:11.480> that's<00:02:11.750> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
so doesn't really clean that's the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.180 
so doesn't really clean that's the
honest<00:02:12.170> truth<00:02:12.640> from<00:02:13.640> my<00:02:13.819> experience<00:02:15.190> now

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190

on case now it does have a groove an
opening<00:02:34.760> here<00:02:34.940> which<00:02:35.150> allows<00:02:35.540> me<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.840> use<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
opening here which allows me to use a

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.600 
opening here which allows me to use a
smart<00:02:36.319> cover<00:02:36.530> with<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.010> I've<00:02:37.099> got<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.310> back

smart cover with it so I've got the back

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.699 
smart cover with it so I've got the back
of<00:02:37.819> this<00:02:37.970> protected<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:39.019> can<00:02:39.260> also<00:02:39.409> now

have at the front so let's just see how

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.110 
have at the front so let's just see how
this<00:02:42.230> snaps<00:02:42.530> on<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.860> if<00:02:43.250> general<00:02:43.670> generally

just grips without any issue there you
go<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:48.230> lines<00:02:48.500> up<00:02:48.709> itself<00:02:49.099> which<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.489> great

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
go and it lines up itself which is great

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.680 
go and it lines up itself which is great
and<00:02:50.030> as<00:02:51.019> far<00:02:51.200> as<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.379> goes<00:02:51.530> for<00:02:51.739> putting<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.129> on

now<00:03:15.190> in<00:03:16.190> terms<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.549> using<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.090> cover<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.840> does

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
now in terms of using the cover it does

allow you to use it as a stand which is
great<00:03:20.239> before<00:03:21.049> we<00:03:21.140> use<00:03:21.349> it<00:03:21.500> as<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.620> stand<00:03:21.920> where

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
great before we use it as a stand where

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.920 
great before we use it as a stand where
i'll<00:03:22.099> show<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.310> how<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.700> works<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:23.269> doubles<00:03:23.840> as

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
i'll show you how it works it doubles as

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.140 
i'll show you how it works it doubles as
a<00:03:23.989> stand<00:03:24.319> firm<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:25.220> few<00:03:25.489> different<00:03:25.609> angles

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
a stand firm for a few different angles

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.190 
a stand firm for a few different angles
but<00:03:26.409> let's<00:03:27.409> look<00:03:27.500> at<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.769> sleep<00:03:28.459> mode<00:03:28.730> now

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
but let's look at the sleep mode now

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.330 
but let's look at the sleep mode now
have<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.230> sneak<00:03:30.530> peek<00:03:30.769> here<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.160> see<00:03:31.310> if

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
have a sneak peek here and see if

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.750 
have a sneak peek here and see if
anything's<00:03:31.910> on<00:03:32.290> suck<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.440> off<00:03:33.620> up<00:03:34.040> turned<00:03:34.609> on

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
anything's on suck it off up turned on

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.940 
anything's on suck it off up turned on
now<00:03:34.790> look<00:03:35.150> now<00:03:35.359> it's<00:03:35.660> turned<00:03:35.840> off<00:03:35.930> now<00:03:36.799> it's

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
now look now it's turned off now it's

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.759 
now look now it's turned off now it's
turned<00:03:37.160> on<00:03:37.250> now<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:38.660> turned<00:03:38.870> off<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.590> as<00:03:39.650> you

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
turned on now it's turned off so as you

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.680 
turned on now it's turned off so as you
can<00:03:39.889> see<00:03:40.099> we're<00:03:40.370> not<00:03:40.400> enough<00:03:41.090> like<00:03:41.419> it's

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690

and<00:05:35.330> what<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:35.780> mean<00:05:35.960> by<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.169> is<00:05:36.380> that<00:05:36.909> if<00:05:37.909> you

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
and what I mean by that is that if you

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.350 
and what I mean by that is that if you
if<00:05:39.319> you<00:05:39.500> hit<00:05:39.680> this<00:05:39.830> enough<00:05:40.130> or<00:05:40.610> hard<00:05:40.849> enough<00:05:41.120> it

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
if you hit this enough or hard enough it

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.810 
if you hit this enough or hard enough it
can<00:05:41.570> actually<00:05:42.020> sort<00:05:42.650> of<00:05:42.770> fall<00:05:42.949> and<00:05:43.219> not<00:05:43.250> so

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
can actually sort of fall and not so

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.279 
can actually sort of fall and not so
much<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.030> little<00:05:44.360> fall<00:05:44.539> back<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:44.990> it'll

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
much a little fall back that it'll

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.339 
much a little fall back that it'll
bounce<00:05:45.469> and<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:45.979> could<00:05:46.130> fall<00:05:46.340> forward<00:05:46.990> and<00:05:47.990> it

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
bounce and it could fall forward and it

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.240 
bounce and it could fall forward and it
could<00:05:48.590> damage<00:05:49.099> your<00:05:49.330> iPad<00:05:50.330> so<00:05:51.130> you<00:05:52.130> know

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
could damage your iPad so you know

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.070 
could damage your iPad so you know

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
it and put it up on an angle like that I

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.200 
it and put it up on an angle like that I
personally<00:06:34.099> don't<00:06:34.370> like<00:06:34.520> to<00:06:34.759> use<00:06:34.789> it<00:06:35.060> that<00:06:35.180> way

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
personally don't like to use it that way

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.020 
personally don't like to use it that way
never<00:06:35.780> have<00:06:35.990> never<00:06:36.169> will<00:06:36.409> but<00:06:37.310> I<00:06:37.520> have<00:06:37.759> seen

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.149 
never have never will but I have seen
people<00:06:38.090> doing<00:06:38.780> that<00:06:38.930> and<00:06:39.409> they'll<00:06:39.620> pop<00:06:39.919> it<00:06:40.069> up

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
people doing that and they'll pop it up

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.640 
people doing that and they'll pop it up
and<00:06:40.400> use<00:06:41.150> it<00:06:41.180> on<00:06:41.360> this<00:06:41.479> angle<00:06:41.810> I'm<00:06:42.169> not<00:06:42.440> really

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
and use it on this angle I'm not really

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.379 
and use it on this angle I'm not really
sure<00:06:42.740> if<00:06:42.919> it's<00:06:43.159> even<00:06:43.430> meant<00:06:43.699> to<00:06:43.849> be<00:06:43.969> used<00:06:44.180> at

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
sure if it's even meant to be used at

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.260 
sure if it's even meant to be used at
that<00:06:44.569> angle<00:06:44.780> but<00:06:45.229> some<00:06:45.830> people<00:06:46.190> do<00:06:46.339> and<00:06:46.639> but

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
that angle but some people do and but

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.050 
that angle but some people do and but
again<00:06:47.510> at<00:06:47.690> your<00:06:47.750> own<00:06:48.080> risk<00:06:48.409> I<00:06:49.219> had<00:06:49.820> don't
