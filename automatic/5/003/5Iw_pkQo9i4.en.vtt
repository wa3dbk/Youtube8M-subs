 The district is quite a young sport and 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.160
 just starting to gain momentum however 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.030
 despite this among the pupils 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.800

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.500
 regional and between genes 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.250
 to become a good gymnast 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.220
 necessary strength and volitional qualities 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.720
 it's a tough sport enough to 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.850
 flutter on the carpet like a butterfly 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.100

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.920
 We try not to refuse to take seven 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.230
 children because if the baby starts 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.360
 engage may not be so textured 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.550
 in a year or two the girl can stretch out 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.560
 The most important quality gymnastics is 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.830
