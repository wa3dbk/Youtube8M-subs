00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.210

 peel 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.520
 cake and well then that also also this 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.380
 text for what is one that I found 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 watching searched videos of these packs and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.180
 I really liked it and I do not know why 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710
 good put to record because I like 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.140
 the swords and lovers on these 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.240
 I love looking swords and advisers 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 the lights but it is not the best for me 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.840
 this sword and those things in good 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.960
 little busy with college high school 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.320

 do not ask me how you ask me 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.470
 at the end it is a combo 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.209
 because the time 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.540
 to see this is going to be easy 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.470
