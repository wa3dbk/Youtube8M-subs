00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.230 
corner in to make a right triangle there
you<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.549> you're<00:01:42.509> folding<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.530> middle

you'll have a long skinny strip down

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.190 
you'll have a long skinny strip down
here<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> two<00:01:55.710> triangles<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.759> top<00:01:57.200> you're

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
here and two triangles up top you're

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.830 
here and two triangles up top you're
going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> fold<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.860> flap<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.399> it<00:02:00.000> onto

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
going to fold this flap up it onto

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.780 
going to fold this flap up it onto
itself

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
itself

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.240 
itself
okay<00:02:02.660> let's<00:02:03.140> see<00:02:03.260> how<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.410> folded<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:03.890> up<00:02:04.040> onto

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
okay let's see how I folded it up onto

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.610 
okay let's see how I folded it up onto
itself<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.910> meet<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.930> bottom<00:02:06.260> of<00:02:06.410> those

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
itself to meet the bottom of those

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.330 
itself to meet the bottom of those
triangles<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.780> just<00:02:09.080> fold<00:02:10.040> it<00:02:10.250> up

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
triangles and then you just fold it up

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.530 
triangles and then you just fold it up
again<00:02:12.220> okay<00:02:13.220> now<00:02:13.820> you're<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.180> turn<00:02:14.360> it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
again okay now you're going to turn it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.660 
again okay now you're going to turn it
around<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.920> same<00:02:16.190> thing<00:02:16.460> you're

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
around and do the same thing you're

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.510 
around and do the same thing you're
gonna<00:02:16.790> fold<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.150> bottom<00:02:17.660> flap<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:19.280> that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
gonna fold that bottom flap up so that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.630 
gonna fold that bottom flap up so that
it<00:02:19.700> meets<00:02:20.260> roughly<00:02:21.260> at<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.920> point<00:02:22.340> at<00:02:22.520> the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
it meets roughly at this point at the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.930 
it meets roughly at this point at the
bottom<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.300> triangle<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:25.550> should<00:02:25.790> be

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
bottom of the triangle and you should be

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.750 
bottom of the triangle and you should be
able<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.360> tell<00:02:26.600> where<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.220> bottom<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.400> just

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
able to tell where that bottom is just

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.400 
able to tell where that bottom is just
by<00:02:28.880> looking<00:02:28.910> at<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.450> other<00:02:29.570> side<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.380> just

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
by looking at the other side so just

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.740 
by looking at the other side so just
guess<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.250> very<00:02:31.670> rough<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.210> doesn't<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:32.630> to

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
guess it's very rough it doesn't have to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.510 
guess it's very rough it doesn't have to
be<00:02:32.870> perfect<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.860> then<00:02:34.040> you're<00:02:34.190> gonna<00:02:34.310> fold

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
be perfect and then you're gonna fold

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.890 
be perfect and then you're gonna fold
that<00:02:34.730> rectangle<00:02:35.240> up<00:02:35.390> again<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.810> it

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that rectangle up again so that it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.920 
that rectangle up again so that it
matches<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.620> other<00:02:39.740> side<00:02:40.240> now<00:02:41.240> all<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.870> you

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
matches the other side now all that you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.760 
matches the other side now all that you
need<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.350> do<00:02:42.500> at<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.680> stage<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:44.750> open<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.560> up

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
need to do at this stage is open it up

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.540 
need to do at this stage is open it up
and<00:02:46.100> as<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.610> can<00:02:46.730> see<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:48.170> creates<00:02:48.650> what

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
and as you can see it creates what

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.550 
and as you can see it creates what
appears<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:50.120> like<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> captain's<00:02:51.050> hat

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
appears to be like a captain's hat

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.050 
appears to be like a captain's hat
