00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.519
 welcome everyone to the thunder portal to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.519
 fund.ru I Selivans and today I will talk about 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.470
 such a wonderful greg as broforce 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 go broforce this side shooter 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.009
 like any 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.390
 there is no counter either in this counter 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.980
 you shoot them in the island although you know 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.260
 In principle, the meaning is the same yes 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 absolutely every mission begins with 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 the fact that we are planted in a helicopter 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.620
 god forgotten place populated of course 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.230
 any pirates terrorists and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.629
 other bad people about them more 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.430
 a little later , we have a little goal to save 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.530
 all hostages turn everything upside down on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.219
 head and ward music blame 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.500
 by helicopter 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.109
 it would seem that there is an interesting run 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.090
 from point a to point b saving a hostage 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.610
 blowing out the terrorists all this we have seen already 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.619
 a bunch of times but that one is revealed the most 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.510
 the trump card of the game is playing or for 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.510
 some nameless soldier for 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.810
 eat it in the ass 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.660
 how to explain it 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.670
 for all the most memorable characters 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.620
 80s blockbusters and action films tired 90 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.780
 natural turns by all 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.220
 immediately most of them start the game you 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.440
 will be unavailable on as you progress 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.630
 you will slowly open one for 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.550
 others saving the hostages by the way after 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.500
 how you saved another hostage 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.110
 your character changes to another and so 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 to the end of the level what is your own kind of well 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.460
 then pour bored from pretty 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.260
 still monotonous gameplay by the way oh 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.450
 gameplay each character has 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.940
 the usual so and this is his main weapon 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.550
 whether it is a regular machine gun or a rocket launcher 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.920
 and the ultimate amount of which is shown 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.630
 icon next to your character should be 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.030
 note what exactly boule so manifest 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.860
 the main features of your characters let's say 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.660
 the terminal turns itself into 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.790
 terminator and gives you no visibility on 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.080
 a few seconds a robocop at a time can 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.170
 shoot down most opponents 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.820
 being in sight and so on that 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.220
 the most interesting despite all your 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.110
 indestructible might you die with one 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.000
 bullets or from an accidental explosion of a cylinder 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.130
 propane that actually makes the game 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.920
 certainly not hardcore but at least 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.200
 quite complicated to the pluses can also be 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.180
 add fully destructible level 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.580
 pretty nice in pixel graphics and 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.989
 of course you play multiplayer 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.800
 you can both against players in the mode 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.930
 dezmatchi 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.790
 so with friends on the network or sat down 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.830
 one computer go accommodates itself 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.230
 four types of opponents here too 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.900
 a lot of you and the usual dudes sako 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.910
 suicide bombers who explode 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.820
 after a few seconds burgundy noticed 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.860
 you and super big jocks with machine guns 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.870
 which need long and hard to wet and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.420
 Of course, there are not many of them; 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.519
 but trust me a couple of times your farts all 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.820
 the game itself will burn 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.410
 into this alpha gamma testing therefore 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.540
 possible when you release after all 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.459
 All that I say will take place 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.200
 the word is not quite true here 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.910
 level editor so if you 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.190
 there really will be nothing to do then 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.690
