very soon now and it's a very very very
cool<00:00:15.450> set<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.199> basically<00:00:16.800> like<00:00:17.119> rakers

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
cool set this is basically like rakers

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
change I don't think this is really

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.599 
change I don't think this is really
going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.529> change<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.890> think<00:00:29.039> mechanically

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
going to change I think mechanically

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.609 
going to change I think mechanically
this<00:00:29.730> set<00:00:29.910> works<00:00:30.119> very<00:00:30.300> well<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> numbers

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this set works very well and the numbers

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
this set works very well and the numbers
just<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:31.920> tweaked<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:33.000> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
just got tweaked this is the in this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
just got tweaked this is the in this
iteration<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.690> PTR<00:00:34.040> they<00:00:35.040> got<00:00:35.190> changed<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
iteration of PTR they got changed a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.010 
iteration of PTR they got changed a
little<00:00:35.730> bit<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> mechanics<00:00:36.660> still<00:00:36.840> stay

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
little bit but the mechanics still stay

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.940 
little bit but the mechanics still stay
the<00:00:37.140> same<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.469> think<00:00:37.649> they're<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the same and I think they're going to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.619 
the same and I think they're going to
stay<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> same<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.210> other<00:00:39.329> thing<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.510> want

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
stay the same and the other thing I want

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.060 
stay the same and the other thing I want
to<00:00:39.660> mention<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> build<00:00:40.800> video

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to mention is this is not a build video

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
to mention is this is not a build video
guys<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.700> some<00:00:41.790> stuff<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.090> put<00:00:42.270> together

to kind of show a concept and explain
the<00:00:44.340> mechanics<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> set<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.390> two<00:00:46.260> piece

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the mechanics of the set so two piece

the mechanics of the set so two piece
bonus<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.860> spirit<00:00:47.129> generators<00:00:47.550> have

increased damage that increased damage

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.490 
increased damage that increased damage
does<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.160> show<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.460> anywhere<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.289> they

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
does not show up anywhere here but they

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.950 
does not show up anywhere here but they
do<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.980> damage<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.550> they<00:00:57.210> attack<00:00:57.690> like

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
do more damage and they attack like

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.930 
do more damage and they attack like
fairly<00:00:58.379> fast<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.309> especially<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.850> you're

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
fairly fast and especially if you're

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.250 
fairly fast and especially if you're
using<00:01:00.059> something<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.480> fist<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.899> thunder

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
using something like fist of thunder

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.189 
using something like fist of thunder
which<00:01:01.440> has<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:02.090> higher<00:01:03.090> attack<00:01:03.390> speed<00:01:03.750> scalar

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
which has a higher attack speed scalar

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.929 
which has a higher attack speed scalar
so<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> tax<00:01:05.129> faster<00:01:05.549> than<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:05.790> normal

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
so just a tax faster than your normal

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.710 
so just a tax faster than your normal
attack<00:01:06.299> speed<00:01:06.570> anyway<00:01:07.610> pretty<00:01:08.610> cool<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
attack speed anyway pretty cool now the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.570 
attack speed anyway pretty cool now the
four<00:01:10.110> piece<00:01:10.320> set<00:01:10.350> bonus<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.010> dashing<00:01:11.400> strike

four piece set bonus is dashing strike

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
four piece set bonus is dashing strike
spend<00:01:11.970> 75<00:01:12.330> spirit<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:12.840> refunds<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> charge

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
spend 75 spirit but refunds the charge

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
spend 75 spirit but refunds the charge
when<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.950> does<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.580> now<00:01:15.000> dashing<00:01:15.659> strike<00:01:15.900> no

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
when it does so now dashing strike no

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.080 
when it does so now dashing strike no
wonder<00:01:16.470> has<00:01:16.590> charges<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.430> costs<00:01:17.640> spirits

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
wonder has charges it just costs spirits

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
wonder has charges it just costs spirits
so<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.259> my<00:01:19.409> spirit<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> be

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so you can see my spirit is going to be

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.560 
so you can see my spirit is going to be
going<00:01:20.130> down<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.299> could<00:01:21.479> just

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
going down a little bit and I could just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.230 
going down a little bit and I could just
dashing<00:01:21.960> strike<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.439> non-stop<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> it's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
dashing strike like non-stop and it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.780 
dashing strike like non-stop and it's
actually<00:01:24.390> very<00:01:24.659> very<00:01:25.080> fast<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.280> stand

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
actually very very fast so if I stand

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.100 
actually very very fast so if I stand
here<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.090> dash<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> strike<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.869> wall

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
here and I dash you strike into a wall

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590 
here and I dash you strike into a wall
basically<00:01:28.369> like<00:01:29.369> let's<00:01:29.640> say<00:01:29.729> right<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
basically like let's say right here you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260 
basically like let's say right here you
can<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.960> how<00:01:31.110> fast<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.890> action<00:01:32.250> does<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> I'm

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
can see how fast this action does it I'm

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.960 
can see how fast this action does it I'm
going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> demo<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.140> bit<00:01:34.290> better

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
going to demo this a little bit better

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
going to demo this a little bit better
later<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> six-piece<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.560> bonus<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
later now the six-piece the bonus is

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
later now the six-piece the bonus is
your<00:01:38.700> spirit<00:01:39.119> generators<00:01:39.509> increase<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
of the gear that I have right now that's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.330 
of the gear that I have right now that's
like<00:01:48.180> 300<00:01:48.509> mil<00:01:48.930> crits<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> single<00:01:49.979> dashing

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
like 300 mil crits on a single dashing

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.100 
like 300 mil crits on a single dashing
strike<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.420> anywhere<00:01:51.960> near

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
strike and that's not anywhere near

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.340 
strike and that's not anywhere near
close<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.700> being<00:01:54.030> optimized<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.140> just

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
close to being optimized but it's just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.580 
close to being optimized but it's just
something<00:01:56.009> interesting<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.670> note<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:57.590> with

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
something interesting to note now with

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.230 
something interesting to note now with
this<00:01:58.740> works<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.219> when<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> use<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.939> spear

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this works is when you use a spear

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.399 
this works is when you use a spear
generator<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:00.930> actually<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.259> hit

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
generator you don't actually have to hit

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.840 
generator you don't actually have to hit
anything<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.399> like

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
anything just have to use it so like

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.459 
anything just have to use it so like
this<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.210> you'll<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:04.140> dashing

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
this one you'll see that my dashing

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.380 
this one you'll see that my dashing
strike<00:02:04.770> lights<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.310> well<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:05.820> long<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.240> is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
strike lights up well as long as this is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.639 
strike lights up well as long as this is
lit<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> unfortunately<00:02:07.200> there's<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.530> it

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
lit and unfortunately there's not it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.570 
lit and unfortunately there's not it
would<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.770> nice<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:07.979> there's<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.340> timer

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
would be nice if there's like a timer

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.270 
would be nice if there's like a timer
maybe<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> buff<00:02:09.330> icon<00:02:09.709> but<00:02:10.709> you'll<00:02:11.129> get

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
maybe like a buff icon but you'll get

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.440 
maybe like a buff icon but you'll get
the<00:02:11.400> hang<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.700> after<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.060> play<00:02:12.239> with<00:02:12.330> it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
the hang of it after you play with it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.830 
the hang of it after you play with it
for<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.629> while

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
for a while

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.210 
for a while
as<00:02:13.319> long<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.800> let<00:02:13.950> your<00:02:14.069> dashing

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
as long as this is let your dashing

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.770 
as long as this is let your dashing
strike<00:02:14.489> does<00:02:14.760> more<00:02:14.940> damage<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.420> basically

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
strike does more damage so basically

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.000 
strike does more damage so basically
going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> want<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.440> dashing<00:02:16.860> strike

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
going to want to like dashing strike

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.100 
going to want to like dashing strike
dashing<00:02:17.430> strike<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.269> one<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.660> pop<00:02:18.930> your

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
dashing strike and one like pop your

even<00:02:41.730> more<00:02:41.970> once<00:02:42.180> i<00:02:42.299> have<00:02:42.480> sweeping<00:02:42.780> winter

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
even more once i have sweeping winter

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.069 
even more once i have sweeping winter
storm<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.720> rest<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.959> my

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
storm and this is what the rest of my

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.559 
storm and this is what the rest of my
gear<00:02:46.230> looks<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:47.180> again<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.329> not<00:02:48.480> really

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
gear looks like again this is not really

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.030 
gear looks like again this is not really
build<00:02:48.900> video<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.410> guys<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.680> hover<00:02:49.860> over

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
build video so you guys can hover over

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.350 
build video so you guys can hover over
the<00:02:50.130> pieces<00:02:50.459> but<00:02:50.579> basically<00:02:50.940> i'm<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.299> be

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
the pieces but basically i'm going to be

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.800 
the pieces but basically i'm going to be
using<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:52.470> fire<00:02:52.970> version<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.060> radiance<00:02:54.660> of

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
using the fire version of radiance of

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.780 
using the fire version of radiance of
dashing<00:02:55.230> strike<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:55.890> cinder<00:02:56.280> coats<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
dashing strike with cinder coats so the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.699 
dashing strike with cinder coats so the
resource<00:02:57.120> cost<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:58.019> reduced<00:02:58.410> then<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.620> have

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
resource cost is reduced then I have

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.319 
resource cost is reduced then I have
some<00:02:58.860> more<00:02:59.010> resource<00:02:59.370> cost<00:02:59.549> reduction<00:03:00.060> and

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
some more resource cost reduction and

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.280 
some more resource cost reduction and
also<00:03:00.599> have<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> little<00:03:00.870> bit<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.019> cooldown

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
also have a little bit of cooldown

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.259 
also have a little bit of cooldown
reduction<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.829> i<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:02.040> use<00:03:02.220> epiphany<00:03:02.879> with

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
reduction so i can use epiphany with

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.390 
reduction so i can use epiphany with
insight<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:04.680> for<00:03:04.950> those<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.250> wondering

insight now for those of you wondering
how<00:03:06.000> fast<00:03:06.510> does<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.019> actually<00:03:07.260> move<00:03:07.860> it's

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
how fast does this actually move it's

that and if you use epiphany you have so

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.640 
that and if you use epiphany you have so
much<00:03:20.880> spirit<00:03:21.299> generation<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.319> is<00:03:22.440> even

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
much spirit generation this is even

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.920 
much spirit generation this is even
without<00:03:22.799> inner<00:03:23.130> storm<00:03:23.489> I'm<00:03:23.760> sitting<00:03:23.970> at<00:03:24.120> 76

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
without inner storm I'm sitting at 76

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.259 
without inner storm I'm sitting at 76
spirit<00:03:25.200> regen<00:03:25.440> per<00:03:25.590> second<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.819> can<00:03:27.150> just

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
spirit regen per second that I can just

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.990 
spirit regen per second that I can just
do<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:28.250> basically<00:03:29.250> all<00:03:29.489> day<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.880> you

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
do this like basically all day and you

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.500 
do this like basically all day and you
move<00:03:30.180> around<00:03:31.430> extremely<00:03:32.430> quickly<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:33.030> mean

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
move around extremely quickly I mean

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.110 
move around extremely quickly I mean
this<00:03:33.599> is<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.590> actually<00:03:34.799> hurts<00:03:35.220> if<00:03:35.940> you

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
this is like this actually hurts if you

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.629 
this is like this actually hurts if you
aim<00:03:36.329> correctly<00:03:37.069> this<00:03:38.069> actually<00:03:38.280> kind<00:03:38.609> of

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
aim correctly this actually kind of

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.120 
aim correctly this actually kind of
hurts<00:03:38.819> my<00:03:38.970> eyes<00:03:39.000> because<00:03:39.630> look<00:03:40.590> how<00:03:40.620> fast<00:03:40.950> you

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
hurts my eyes because look how fast you

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.470 
hurts my eyes because look how fast you
move<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.400> only<00:03:41.549> thing<00:03:41.730> what's<00:03:42.120> going<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.299> slow

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
move the only thing what's going to slow

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.420 
move the only thing what's going to slow
you<00:03:42.599> down<00:03:42.630> actually<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.680> cast

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
you down actually is not the cast

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.270 
you down actually is not the cast
animation<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.120> going<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.329> be<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:46.280> running

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
animation it's going to be like running

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.960 
animation it's going to be like running
into<00:03:47.340> objects<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.630> it's<00:03:49.260> pretty<00:03:49.470> insane<00:03:49.970> and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
into objects so it's pretty insane and

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.990 
into objects so it's pretty insane and
for<00:03:51.840> damage<00:03:52.440> output<00:03:52.620> yeah<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.430> does<00:03:53.639> it<00:03:53.910> does

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
for damage output yeah it does it does

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.569 
for damage output yeah it does it does
very<00:03:54.419> significant<00:03:54.930> damage<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.530> I'm<00:03:56.010> going<00:03:56.400> to

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
very significant damage and I'm going to

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.990 
very significant damage and I'm going to
demonstrate<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:57.480> here<00:03:58.169> in<00:03:58.500> 86<00:03:59.459> rift<00:03:59.760> for<00:03:59.910> you

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
demonstrate that here in 86 rift for you

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.430 
demonstrate that here in 86 rift for you
guys<00:04:00.150> real<00:04:00.359> quick<00:04:01.459> so<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.790> think<00:04:03.359> it's<00:04:03.840> safe<00:04:04.410> to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
guys real quick so I think it's safe to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.360 
guys real quick so I think it's safe to
say<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:05.510> monk<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.750> going<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.260> be<00:04:07.470> hands<00:04:08.250> down

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
say that monk is going to be hands down

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.550 
say that monk is going to be hands down
the<00:04:08.819> fastest<00:04:09.540> technically<00:04:10.169> as<00:04:10.260> far<00:04:10.470> as

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
the fastest technically as far as

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.729 
the fastest technically as far as
movement<00:04:10.799> speed<00:04:11.160> goes<00:04:11.900> class<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.410> entire

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
movement speed goes class in the entire

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.580 
movement speed goes class in the entire
game<00:04:14.040> calm<00:04:14.519> patch<00:04:14.760> 2.2<00:04:15.419> so<00:04:15.690> let's<00:04:16.440> say<00:04:16.560> this

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
game calm patch 2.2 so let's say this

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.020 
game calm patch 2.2 so let's say this
looks<00:04:16.859> like<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.070> want<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.280> make<00:04:17.400> sure<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.760> pop

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
looks like you want to make sure you pop

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.390 
looks like you want to make sure you pop
your<00:04:18.180> spirit<00:04:18.650> generator<00:04:19.650> first<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.220> then

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
your spirit generator first and then

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.710 
your spirit generator first and then
book<00:04:20.579> one<00:04:20.909> shot

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
book one shot

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.439 
book one shot
and<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.810> can<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:24.050> stand<00:04:24.500> in<00:04:24.590> place<00:04:25.419> kind<00:04:26.419> of

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
and you can just stand in place kind of

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.260 
and you can just stand in place kind of
do<00:04:26.569> this<00:04:27.189> and<00:04:28.189> this<00:04:28.490> is<00:04:28.550> how<00:04:28.759> you<00:04:28.789> clear<00:04:29.240> out

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
do this and this is how you clear out

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.800 
do this and this is how you clear out
stuff<00:04:29.860> with<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.979> set<00:04:31.509> and<00:04:32.509> it's<00:04:32.659> actually

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
stuff with the set and it's actually

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.300 
stuff with the set and it's actually
like<00:04:33.169> this<00:04:33.409> is<00:04:33.530> actually<00:04:33.800> so<00:04:33.979> fast<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.689> the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
like this is actually so fast that the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.179 
like this is actually so fast that the
problem<00:04:37.310> for<00:04:37.490> me<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.819> just<00:04:38.949> keeping<00:04:39.949> like

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189 
problem for me is just keeping like

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.369 
problem for me is just keeping like
track<00:04:40.819> of<00:04:41.030> everything<00:04:41.419> because<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:42.259> just

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:42.379 
track of everything because you just

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.249 
track of everything because you just
move<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:42.949> fast<00:04:43.189> this<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.930> it's<00:04:45.110> not<00:04:45.199> like

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
move so fast this is and it's not like

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.929 
move so fast this is and it's not like
rakers<00:04:45.740> where<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:45.979> have<00:04:46.069> charges<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.729> this

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:46.939 
rakers where you have charges and this

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.020 
rakers where you have charges and this
thing<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.150> this<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:47.990> insane<00:04:48.759> like<00:04:49.759> this<00:04:49.909> is

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
thing is this is insane like this is

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.929 
thing is this is insane like this is
absolutely<00:04:50.509> insane<00:04:51.520> let's<00:04:52.520> actually<00:04:52.699> let's

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:52.939 
absolutely insane let's actually let's

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.869 
absolutely insane let's actually let's
see<00:04:53.030> what<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:53.210> looks<00:04:53.270> like<00:04:53.509> with<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.840> conduit

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
see what this looks like with a conduit

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.740 
see what this looks like with a conduit
now<00:04:55.879> you<00:04:55.940> see<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.240> wasn't<00:04:56.509> doing<00:04:56.569> a<00:04:56.659> whole

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
now you see that I wasn't doing a whole

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.730 
now you see that I wasn't doing a whole
lot<00:04:56.870> damage<00:04:57.110> that's<00:04:57.289> because<00:04:57.500> i<00:04:57.560> don't<00:04:57.710> have

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
lot damage that's because i don't have

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.129 
lot damage that's because i don't have
my<00:04:57.919> buff<00:04:58.099> up<00:04:58.310> but<00:04:59.300> now<00:04:59.449> i<00:04:59.479> can<00:04:59.750> just<00:04:59.930> actually

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
my buff up but now i can just actually

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.980 
my buff up but now i can just actually
do<00:05:00.379> without<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.680> conduit<00:05:00.979> but<00:05:01.669> i<00:05:01.990> basically

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
do without the conduit but i basically

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.629 
do without the conduit but i basically
one<00:05:03.169> shot<00:05:03.349> everything<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:04.430> let's<00:05:04.550> see<00:05:04.610> how

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
one shot everything so let's see how

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.080 
one shot everything so let's see how
these<00:05:04.789> along<00:05:05.120> these<00:05:05.270> elites<00:05:05.539> take<00:05:06.379> down<00:05:07.090> let's

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
these along these elites take down let's

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.119

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
you look how much damage this does

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.649 
you look how much damage this does
that's<00:05:49.250> assuming<00:05:49.550> you<00:05:49.610> can<00:05:49.699> actually<00:05:49.849> you're

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
that's assuming you can actually you're

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.930 
that's assuming you can actually you're
not<00:05:50.690> moving<00:05:51.139> so<00:05:51.289> fast<00:05:51.529> that<00:05:51.889> you<00:05:52.610> can<00:05:52.789> actually

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
not moving so fast that you can actually

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.510 
not moving so fast that you can actually
hit<00:05:53.330> your<00:05:53.509> targets<00:05:53.900> but<00:05:54.169> yeah<00:05:54.650> your<00:05:55.009> one<00:05:55.339> shot

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
hit your targets but yeah your one shot

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.360 
hit your targets but yeah your one shot
elite<00:05:55.789> packs<00:05:56.110> this<00:05:57.110> is<00:05:57.289> whatever<00:05:57.949> whatever

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
elite packs this is whatever whatever

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.749 
elite packs this is whatever whatever
you<00:05:58.669> know<00:05:58.879> about<00:05:58.909> rakers<00:05:59.690> the<00:06:00.080> barbs<00:06:00.469> this<00:06:01.430> is

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
you know about rakers the barbs this is

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.689 
you know about rakers the barbs this is
faster<00:06:02.569> because<00:06:02.750> that<00:06:03.310> twelve<00:06:04.310> thousand

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
faster because that twelve thousand

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.499 
faster because that twelve thousand
percent<00:06:05.000> weapon<00:06:05.360> damage<00:06:05.479> is<00:06:05.870> just<00:06:06.110> insane<00:06:07.509> so

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
percent weapon damage is just insane so

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.990 
percent weapon damage is just insane so
let's<00:06:08.690> see<00:06:08.839> what<00:06:08.930> this<00:06:09.020> looks<00:06:09.080> like<00:06:09.879> with<00:06:10.879> the

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
let's see what this looks like with the

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.939 
let's see what this looks like with the
rift<00:06:11.210> Guardians

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.469 

so<00:06:15.949> long<00:06:16.129> it<00:06:16.249> takes<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:16.520> take<00:06:16.879> him<00:06:17.059> down<00:06:17.089> I

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
so long it takes to take him down I

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.329 
so long it takes to take him down I
don't<00:06:18.379> want<00:06:18.499> to<00:06:18.559> almost<00:06:18.740> do<00:06:18.919> it<00:06:18.949> against<00:06:19.219> the

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:19.339 
don't want to almost do it against the

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:24.010 
don't want to almost do it against the
wall<00:06:20.620> there<00:06:21.620> we<00:06:21.740> go<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:23.180> earlier<00:06:23.479> hits<00:06:23.839> that

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
wall there we go the earlier hits that

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.999 
wall there we go the earlier hits that
was<00:06:24.139> hitting<00:06:24.319> them<00:06:24.439> actually<00:06:24.589> didn't<00:06:24.949> I

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
was hitting them actually didn't I

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:26.739 
was hitting them actually didn't I
