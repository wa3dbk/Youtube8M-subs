00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
if you do get the early release and I

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.170 
if you do get the early release and I
think<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.050> five<00:00:25.320> games<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.920> lawn<00:00:26.160> with<00:00:26.519> messy

but like someone did tweet me there is a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
but like someone did tweet me there is a
high<00:00:29.910> possibility<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.990> you'll<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.410> 45

games<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:32.189> messy<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:32.850> you're

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
games are messy and then you're

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.090 
games are messy and then you're
disconnecting<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> game<00:00:34.020> 4<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.559> 5<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.010> you
