00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.050 

I<00:02:13.830> think<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.370> hard<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.700> tell<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.880> mean

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I think it's hard to tell I mean

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.430 
I think it's hard to tell I mean
obviously<00:02:15.150> what<00:02:15.480> we've<00:02:15.630> heard<00:02:15.750> with<00:02:15.990> reports

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
obviously what we've heard with reports

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.500 
obviously what we've heard with reports
is<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.650> there's<00:02:17.640> been<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.790> suspension<00:02:18.210> for

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
is that there's been a suspension for

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.600 
is that there's been a suspension for
the<00:02:18.570> whaling<00:02:18.900> season<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.440> year<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:19.890> um<00:02:20.040> one

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
the whaling season this year but um one

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.190 
the whaling season this year but um one
thing<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.910> think<00:02:21.120> that's<00:02:21.270> clear<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.840> certainly

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
thing I think that's clear and certainly

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.600 
thing I think that's clear and certainly
from<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> work<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:23.070> International

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
from the work that the International

Japan<00:02:24.990> itself<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.100> wailings<00:02:26.790> and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
Japan itself is that wailings and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.640 
Japan itself is that wailings and
economic<00:02:27.360> loser<00:02:27.600> for<00:02:27.900> Japan<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.560> a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
economic loser for Japan and it's a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.630 
economic loser for Japan and it's a
dying<00:02:28.890> industry

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
dying industry

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.250 
dying industry
it's<00:02:30.060> catering<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.690> an<00:02:30.810> increasingly

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
it's catering to an increasingly

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.350 
it's catering to an increasingly
shrinking<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.010> aging<00:02:32.520> market<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.210> there's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
shrinking and aging market and there's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.150 
shrinking and aging market and there's
really<00:02:33.570> no<00:02:33.780> demand<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.410> whale<00:02:34.560> meat<00:02:34.740> anymore

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
really no demand for whale meat anymore

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.630 
really no demand for whale meat anymore
so<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.490> think<00:02:35.760> its<00:02:35.940> future<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.620> uncertain<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
so I think its future is uncertain and I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.370 
so I think its future is uncertain and I
think<00:02:38.880> we're<00:02:39.060> seeing<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> last<00:02:39.990> days<00:02:40.200> of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
think we're seeing the last days of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.010 
think we're seeing the last days of
whaling<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.790> could<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:41.970> economic<00:02:42.720> pressure

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
whaling so it could be economic pressure

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.140 
whaling so it could be economic pressure
rather<00:02:43.590> than<00:02:43.920> pressure<00:02:44.220> from<00:02:44.610> groups<00:02:44.880> like

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
rather than pressure from groups like

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.060 
rather than pressure from groups like
yourself<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.960> sea<00:02:46.170> Shepherd<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.770> could

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
yourself and the sea Shepherd that could

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.030 
yourself and the sea Shepherd that could
mean<00:02:48.060> whaling<00:02:48.480> will<00:02:48.750> end<00:02:49.020> well<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.920> think

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
mean whaling will end well I think

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.470 
mean whaling will end well I think
there's<00:02:50.280> multiple<00:02:50.460> factors<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.240> obviously

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
there's multiple factors and obviously

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.480 
there's multiple factors and obviously
external<00:02:52.020> pressure<00:02:52.290> from<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.740> outside<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:53.370> an

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
external pressure from the outside is an

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.860 
external pressure from the outside is an
important<00:02:53.970> part<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:54.780> ultimately

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
important part of that but ultimately

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.020 
important part of that but ultimately
the<00:02:55.440> decision<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.980> end<00:02:56.520> way<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.850> will<00:02:56.940> be

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the decision to end way and will be

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.090 
the decision to end way and will be
taken<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.510> Japan<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.110> has<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.440> be<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.740> reasons

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
taken in Japan and has to be for reasons

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.760 
taken in Japan and has to be for reasons
that<00:02:59.280> make<00:02:59.850> sense<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.270> Japanese<00:03:00.660> people<00:03:01.110> while

that's<00:03:18.330> not<00:03:18.390> something<00:03:18.870> they're<00:03:18.990> going<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.200> be

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
in the last year and that we're seeing a

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.490 
in the last year and that we're seeing a
real<00:03:33.060> difference<00:03:33.480> between<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> kind<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.290> an

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
meat in a younger demographic that

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.040 
meat in a younger demographic that
doesn't<00:03:38.910> want<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.540> think<00:03:39.720> over<00:03:40.020> time

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
doesn't want to and I think over time

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.480 
doesn't want to and I think over time
that's<00:03:40.440> really<00:03:40.650> going<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.980> tell<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.400> that's

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
that's really going to tell and that's

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.340 
that's really going to tell and that's
why<00:03:41.760> there's<00:03:41.970> such<00:03:42.120> an<00:03:42.300> economic<00:03:42.450> pressure<00:03:43.080> on

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
why there's such an economic pressure on

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.560 
why there's such an economic pressure on
the<00:03:43.470> whaling<00:03:43.740> industry<00:03:43.860> in<00:03:44.190> Japan<00:03:44.520> now<00:03:44.790> what's
