00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
seconds away so one that takes over 2 30

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.870 
seconds away so one that takes over 2 30
minutes<00:01:05.110> we'll<00:01:05.560> get<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.860> s4<00:01:06.220> active<00:01:06.400> out<00:01:06.729> the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
so we'll stop the timer there and grab

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.300 
so we'll stop the timer there and grab
that<00:01:12.220> as<00:01:12.640> for<00:01:12.970> active<00:01:13.479> screen<00:01:14.380> stayed<00:01:15.070> on

that as for active screen stayed on

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.460 
that as for active screen stayed on
during<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.030> entire<00:01:16.540> process<00:01:16.900> which<00:01:17.320> is

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
during that entire process which is

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.490 
during that entire process which is
interesting<00:01:18.310> because<00:01:18.899> screen<00:01:19.899> timer<00:01:20.140> was

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
interesting because screen timer was

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.870 
interesting because screen timer was
said<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.890> be<00:01:21.780> 30<00:01:22.780> I'll<00:01:23.320> say<00:01:23.560> 30<00:01:23.830> 10<00:01:24.310> minutes<00:01:24.700> so

just<00:01:50.020> bring<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.259> in<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.560> little<00:01:50.770> bit<00:01:50.950> closer

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
just bring that in a little bit closer

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.910 
just bring that in a little bit closer
screen<00:01:52.479> looks<00:01:52.810> pretty<00:01:53.259> good

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
screen looks pretty good

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.430 
screen looks pretty good
I<00:01:53.950> can't<00:01:54.580> see<00:01:54.700> any<00:01:54.880> marks<00:01:55.360> on<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:56.110> screen

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
I can't see any marks on the screen

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.770 
I can't see any marks on the screen
there<00:01:56.679> to<00:01:56.950> indicate<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:57.909> water<00:01:58.300> leaked

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
there to indicate that water leaked

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.830 
there to indicate that water leaked
inside<00:01:59.289> of<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.560> which<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.640> always<00:02:01.240> really<00:02:01.720> good

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
inside of it which is always really good

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.620 
inside of it which is always really good
camera<00:02:02.710> hasn't<00:02:03.159> missed<00:02:03.399> up<00:02:03.579> just<00:02:04.030> yet<00:02:04.299> but

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
camera hasn't missed up just yet but

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.660 
camera hasn't missed up just yet but
chances<00:02:05.470> are<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.619> will<00:02:05.860> miss<00:02:06.009> top<00:02:06.220> once<00:02:06.520> it

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
chances are that will miss top once it

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.419 
chances are that will miss top once it
dries<00:02:06.970> out<00:02:07.149> a<00:02:07.210> little<00:02:07.479> bit<00:02:08.130> while<00:02:09.130> we're<00:02:09.250> here

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
dries out a little bit while we're here

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.130 
dries out a little bit while we're here
let's<00:02:09.850> have<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.810> look<00:02:11.110> at<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:13.150> speaker<00:02:13.660> because

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
let's have a look at the speaker because

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.810 
let's have a look at the speaker because
normally<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:14.829> say<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.400> let<00:02:15.519> it<00:02:15.579> dry

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
normally as I say you have to let it dry

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.259 
normally as I say you have to let it dry
out<00:02:16.049> but<00:02:17.049> we'll<00:02:17.230> play<00:02:17.500> anyway<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:18.970> what

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
out but we'll play anyway and see what

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:28.110 
out but we'll play anyway and see what
it<00:02:20.110> looks<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:23.070> oops<00:02:26.670> screen<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.760> playing<00:02:28.000> up

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
it looks like oops screen is playing up

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:43.870 
it looks like oops screen is playing up
a<00:02:28.180> little<00:02:28.360> bit<00:02:28.480> there<00:02:28.630> maybe<00:02:28.959> go

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.670 

so<00:02:44.880> speakers<00:02:45.420> sounding<00:02:45.930> pretty<00:02:46.200> good<00:02:46.319> for

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
so speakers sounding pretty good for

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.170 
so speakers sounding pretty good for
what<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.280> fair<00:02:47.520> by<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.970> say<00:02:48.150> for

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
what it is to be fair by the say for

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.480 
what it is to be fair by the say for
best<00:02:48.510> results<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.170> need<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.470> let<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.100> dry<00:02:50.340> out

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
best results you need to let it dry out

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.460 
best results you need to let it dry out
for<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.760> while<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.209> we'll<00:02:51.750> press<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.140> home

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
for a while so we'll press the home

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.290 
for a while so we'll press the home
button<00:02:52.500> air<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.010> come<00:02:53.130> out<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.819> I

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
button air to come out of that and I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.090 
button air to come out of that and I
want<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.600> see<00:02:54.750> if<00:02:54.810> there's<00:02:54.990> any<00:02:55.140> water<00:02:55.350> got

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
into the back of the phone here so I'm

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.240 
into the back of the phone here so I'm
just<00:02:57.540> gonna<00:02:57.630> pair<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.110> off<00:02:58.319> here<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
just gonna pair this off here so the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.880 
just gonna pair this off here so the
phone<00:02:59.490> goes<00:02:59.880> off<00:03:00.200> lights<00:03:01.200> still<00:03:01.440> coming<00:03:01.770> on

there notification LEDs working still

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.830 
there notification LEDs working still
excellent<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.830> that's<00:03:05.330> vibrated<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.420> say<00:03:06.569> it's

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
excellent so that's vibrated to say it's

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.000 
excellent so that's vibrated to say it's
off<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.350> what<00:03:07.500> we'll<00:03:07.620> do

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
off so what we'll do

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.710 
off so what we'll do
just<00:03:08.340> wipe<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.880> remaining<00:03:09.209> bit<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.540> water

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
just wipe that remaining bit of water

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.199 
just wipe that remaining bit of water
off<00:03:09.989> there<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:11.430> we'll<00:03:11.610> know<00:03:11.819> do<00:03:12.000> like

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
off there and what we'll know do like

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.479 
off there and what we'll know do like
still<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.200> there<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.069> go<00:03:14.190> now<00:03:14.430> to

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
still on there so there we go now to

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.610 
still on there so there we go now to
vibrate<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.120> AIT's<00:03:15.330> off<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.050> let's<00:03:16.350> take<00:03:16.590> a

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
vibrate it's AIT's off so let's take a

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.560 
vibrate it's AIT's off so let's take a
look<00:03:16.950> see<00:03:17.459> if<00:03:17.489> there's<00:03:17.700> any<00:03:17.820> water<00:03:18.090> actually

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
look see if there's any water actually

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.320 
look see if there's any water actually
inside<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.920> case<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:21.300> get<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:21.959> open<00:03:22.440> and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
inside the case so get that open and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.759 
inside the case so get that open and
let's<00:03:24.330> take<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.510> look<00:03:24.660> cool<00:03:24.840> look<00:03:25.110> along<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
let's take a look cool look along the

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.540 
let's take a look cool look along the
bottom<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.640> be<00:03:26.730> expected<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.209> water<00:03:28.550> has

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
bottom as to be expected that water has

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.790 
bottom as to be expected that water has
penetrated<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.810> outer<00:03:30.959> side<00:03:31.410> which<00:03:31.650> is

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
penetrated the outer side which is

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.040 
penetrated the outer side which is
normal<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.340> nothing<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.090> inside<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.870> that

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
normal but nothing on the inside of that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.840 
normal but nothing on the inside of that
rubber<00:03:34.500> seal<00:03:34.709> as<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.100> can<00:03:35.250> see<00:03:35.400> which<00:03:35.640> goes

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
rubber seal as you can see which goes

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.460 
rubber seal as you can see which goes
right<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.180> way<00:03:36.209> around<00:03:36.569> which<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.200> pretty

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
right the way around which is pretty

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.970 
right the way around which is pretty
good<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:37.950> we'll<00:03:38.519> leave<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.880> one<00:03:39.180> side

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
good so we'll leave that to one side

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.130 
good so we'll leave that to one side
having<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.040> look<00:03:41.220> at<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.670> back<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> device

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
having a look at the back of the device

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.350 
having a look at the back of the device
here<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.800> see<00:03:43.980> water<00:03:44.640> along<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.180> outside

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
here you can see water along the outside

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.240 
here you can see water along the outside
of<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:46.370> pathway<00:03:48.560> where<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.769> rubber<00:03:50.070> seal

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
of this pathway where that rubber seal

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.250 
of this pathway where that rubber seal
was<00:03:50.459> going<00:03:50.700> around<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.180> which<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.540> okay<00:03:52.079> with

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
was going around so which is okay with

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.949 
was going around so which is okay with
that's<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.620> be<00:03:52.709> expected<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.280> up<00:03:53.459> there<00:03:53.700> I'm

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
that's to be expected to be up there I'm

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.690 
that's to be expected to be up there I'm
expecting<00:03:54.959> inside<00:03:55.530> here<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:56.010> bone<00:03:56.310> dry

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
expecting inside here to be bone dry

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
where that rubber seal isn't you've got

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.219 
where that rubber seal isn't you've got
some<00:04:35.070> water<00:04:35.729> droplets<00:04:36.060> there<00:04:36.479> not<00:04:36.690> too<00:04:36.870> bad<00:04:37.050> to

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
some water droplets there not too bad to

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.690 
some water droplets there not too bad to
be<00:04:37.260> honest<00:04:37.620> let's<00:04:37.800> also<00:04:37.979> take<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> look<00:04:38.490> at<00:04:38.610> the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
be honest let's also take a look at the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.940 
be honest let's also take a look at the
microUSB<00:04:39.210> cover<00:04:40.140> here<00:04:40.380> because<00:04:40.650> as<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.800> can

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
microUSB cover here because as you can

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.040 
microUSB cover here because as you can
see<00:04:41.070> there's<00:04:41.280> some<00:04:41.430> slight<00:04:41.760> traces<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.300> water

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
see there's some slight traces of water

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.140 
see there's some slight traces of water
just<00:04:43.470> there<00:04:43.740> towards<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.070> end<00:04:44.130> so<00:04:44.550> let's<00:04:44.729> see

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
just there towards the end so let's see

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.279 
just there towards the end so let's see
if<00:04:45.210> we<00:04:45.240> can<00:04:45.360> open<00:04:45.510> this<00:04:45.720> up<00:04:45.870> see<00:04:46.080> if<00:04:46.140> there's

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
if we can open this up see if there's

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.250 
if we can open this up see if there's
any<00:04:46.410> traces<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:46.800> water<00:04:47.130> inside<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:48.110> look<00:04:49.110> it

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
any traces of water inside and look it

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.070 
any traces of water inside and look it
looks<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.800> be<00:04:49.950> bone-dry<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.419> what<00:04:51.840> seems

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
looks to be bone-dry so this what seems

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.630 
looks to be bone-dry so this what seems
to<00:04:52.200> be<00:04:52.289> this<00:04:52.440> flimsy<00:04:52.919> little<00:04:53.010> cover<00:04:53.340> here

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
to be this flimsy little cover here

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.990 
to be this flimsy little cover here
seems<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.599> hold<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.560> water<00:04:55.770> out<00:04:56.190> of

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
seems to hold the water out of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.450 
seems to hold the water out of
micro<00:04:57.450> USB<00:04:57.900> port<00:04:57.930> there<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.710> as<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.310> can<00:04:59.400> see

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
micro USB port there and as you can see

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.280 
micro USB port there and as you can see
there's<00:04:59.760> some<00:04:59.880> traces<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.330> water<00:05:00.480> along<00:05:01.020> those

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
there's some traces of water along those

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.800 
there's some traces of water along those
little<00:05:01.920> ridges<00:05:02.430> across<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.330> bottom<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
little ridges across the bottom of the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.030 
little ridges across the bottom of the
unit<00:05:03.990> here<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.410> that's<00:05:04.530> been<00:05:04.680> a<00:05:04.710> look<00:05:04.860> at<00:05:04.950> the

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
unit here and that's been a look at the

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.340 
unit here and that's been a look at the
Samsung<00:05:05.250> Galaxy<00:05:05.610> s4<00:05:06.120> active<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.170> does

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
Samsung Galaxy s4 active and it does

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.340 
Samsung Galaxy s4 active and it does
hold<00:05:07.560> up<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:07.950> its<00:05:08.100> IP<00:05:08.520> 67<00:05:08.940> claims<00:05:09.600> so<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.200> can

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
hold up to its IP 67 claims so it can

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.590 
hold up to its IP 67 claims so it can
withstand<00:05:10.500> water<00:05:11.220> being<00:05:11.610> fully<00:05:11.880> submerged<00:05:12.330> in

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
withstand water being fully submerged in
