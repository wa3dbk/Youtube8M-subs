00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.920 

now<00:01:34.620> to<00:01:34.680> explain<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.240> works

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
now to explain how it works

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.530 
now to explain how it works
so<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> may<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.340> seen<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.550> video<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.180> posted

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
so you may have seen a video I posted

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.440 
so you may have seen a video I posted
recently<00:01:40.070> about<00:01:41.070> secret<00:01:41.700> bed<00:01:41.880> entrances

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
recently about secret bed entrances

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.110 
recently about secret bed entrances
although<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> problem<00:01:43.830> with<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.980> was<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.730> it

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
although the problem with it was that it

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.300 
although the problem with it was that it
wasn't<00:01:45.330> set<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:45.870> that<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.890> could<00:01:47.220> be

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
wasn't set up in a way that it could be

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
wasn't set up in a way that it could be
really<00:01:47.490> used<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.850> an<00:01:47.910> adventure<00:01:48.240> map<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.230> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
really used in an adventure map so I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.060 
really used in an adventure map so I
took<00:01:49.740> another<00:01:49.920> look<00:01:50.010> at<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:52.040> made<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
took another look at it and I made it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.730 
took another look at it and I made it
bit<00:01:53.250> more<00:01:53.400> adventure<00:01:53.760> about<00:01:53.820> friendly<00:01:54.740> so

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
bit more adventure about friendly so

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.800 
bit more adventure about friendly so
basic<00:01:56.280> how<00:01:56.370> this<00:01:56.520> works<00:01:56.730> is<00:01:57.210> when<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> sleep

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
basic how this works is when you sleep

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.750 
basic how this works is when you sleep
in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> bed<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.410> creates<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.100> new<00:01:59.520> spawn

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
in the bed that creates your new spawn

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.930 
in the bed that creates your new spawn
point<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.960> either<00:02:01.020> spawn<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.950> either<00:02:02.730> of

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
point you can either spawn in either of

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.630 
point you can either spawn in either of
the<00:02:03.030> corner<00:02:03.330> blocks<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:04.350> these<00:02:04.560> or<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the corner blocks like these or all of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.250 
the corner blocks like these or all of
you<00:02:05.760> Jason<00:02:06.120> blocks<00:02:06.300> but<00:02:06.570> we've<00:02:06.720> blocked<00:02:06.960> them

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
you Jason blocks but we've blocked them

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.940 
you Jason blocks but we've blocked them
off<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:08.300> there's<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> preference<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.379> yellow

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
off and there's a preference so yellow

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.790 
off and there's a preference so yellow
comes<00:02:11.400> first<00:02:11.670> then<00:02:12.150> red<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.900> blue<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.470> green

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
comes first then red then blue in green

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
comes first then red then blue in green
that's<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.489> preference<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.269> bed<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.630> if<00:02:15.720> I

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
that's the preference of the bed so if I

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.290 
that's the preference of the bed so if I
was<00:02:16.050> sleep<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.440> bed<00:02:16.760> I'd<00:02:17.760> wake<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
was sleep in the bed I'd wake up the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.790 
was sleep in the bed I'd wake up the
yellow<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.660> both<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.380> yellow<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:19.680> was

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
yellow on both the yellow one was

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.270 
yellow on both the yellow one was
blocked<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.310> I'd<00:02:20.430> wake<00:02:20.610> up<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.850> red<00:02:21.000> one

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
blocked then I'd wake up in the red one

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
blocked then I'd wake up in the red one
Red<00:02:21.550> Rock<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:21.970> wake<00:02:22.420> up<00:02:22.540> in<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.690> blue<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:23.050> etc

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
Red Rock to wake up in the blue one etc

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.360 
Red Rock to wake up in the blue one etc
so<00:02:25.300> basically<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:25.930> works<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.650> when<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.130> hit

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
so basically this works is when you hit

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.600 
so basically this works is when you hit
one<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:27.940> their<00:02:28.120> switches<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:30.130> will<00:02:30.250> obstruct

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
one of their switches it will obstruct

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.110 
one of their switches it will obstruct
this<00:02:31.000> morning<00:02:31.360> point<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.890> if<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.580> were<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.819> die

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
this morning point so if I were to die

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.360 
this morning point so if I were to die
now<00:02:34.420> I'm<00:02:34.600> going<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.900> read<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.080> bit<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.530> if<00:02:35.740> I<00:02:35.860> can

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
now I'm going to read a bit and if I can

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.520 
now I'm going to read a bit and if I can
the<00:02:36.459> red<00:02:36.580> bit<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:36.970> activate<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:38.410> will

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
the red bit and activate this that will

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.110 
the red bit and activate this that will
obstruct<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.950> red<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.430> then<00:02:39.610> I'll<00:02:39.730> go<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:39.850> new

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
obstruct the red and then I'll go to new

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.860 
obstruct the red and then I'll go to new
and<00:02:40.150> etc<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:43.270> quite<00:02:43.420> simple<00:02:43.480> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
and etc so it's quite simple to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.360 
and etc so it's quite simple to
implement<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:46.060> only<00:02:46.470> sort<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.560> downside<00:02:48.220> to

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
implement the only sort of downside to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.180 
implement the only sort of downside to
it<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.640> because<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:50.080> know<00:02:50.200> they're<00:02:51.010> quite

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
it is because is you know they're quite

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.729 
it is because is you know they're quite
near<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.970> each<00:02:52.000> other<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:53.410> not<00:02:53.590> too

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
near to each other but that's not too

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.900 
near to each other but that's not too
much<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.010> problem<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.459> think<00:02:54.610> it's<00:02:54.760> quite

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
much of a problem and I think it's quite

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.940 
much of a problem and I think it's quite
a<00:02:55.209> nifty<00:02:56.700> way<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.730> go<00:02:58.209> about<00:02:58.450> making<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:59.019> room<00:02:59.739> a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
a nifty way to go about making a room a

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.030 
a nifty way to go about making a room a
syringe<00:03:00.400> app<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:00.970> yeah<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.260> disinterested<00:03:02.680> to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
syringe app so yeah it disinterested to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.070 
syringe app so yeah it disinterested to
you<00:03:03.190> know<00:03:03.340> feel<00:03:03.670> free<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.850> use<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.209> it's<00:03:04.420> quite

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
you know feel free to use it it's quite

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.990 
you know feel free to use it it's quite
it's<00:03:05.650> quite<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.860> different<00:03:06.400> way<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.550> do<00:03:06.790> things

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
it's quite a different way to do things

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
it's quite a different way to do things
no<00:03:07.300> just<00:03:07.569> a<00:03:07.690> linear<00:03:08.200> where<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.709> were<00:03:09.190> your

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
no just a linear where you were your

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.420 
no just a linear where you were your
things

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.489 

you
