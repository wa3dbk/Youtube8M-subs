this<00:01:25.200> year<00:01:25.410> as<00:01:25.500> part<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.770> personality<00:01:26.490> plus

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
this year as part of personality plus

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.590 
this year as part of personality plus
we've<00:01:27.720> added<00:01:28.100> nine<00:01:29.100> based<00:01:29.550> geometries<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
we've added nine based geometries and a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.480 
we've added nine based geometries and a
few<00:01:30.990> special<00:01:31.410> cases<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.980> year<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
player models and I think in the video

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.210 
player models and I think in the video
that<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.550> posted<00:01:35.730> on<00:01:36.030> facebook<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.980> Monday<00:01:37.980> if

that was posted on facebook on Monday if

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.450 
that was posted on facebook on Monday if
you<00:01:38.670> follow<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.360> mic<00:01:39.810> day<00:01:40.140> section<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.280> art

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you follow the mic day section with art

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.430 
you follow the mic day section with art
you'll<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.880> how<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.090> generate<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.900> pretty<00:01:43.290> much

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
you'll see how we generate a pretty much

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.440 
you'll see how we generate a pretty much
an<00:01:43.620> infinite<00:01:44.100> number<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.460> player<00:01:44.820> models<00:01:45.240> off

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
an infinite number of player models off

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170 
an infinite number of player models off
of<00:01:45.600> those<00:01:45.750> base<00:01:45.990> geometries<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:47.120> sort<00:01:48.120> of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of those base geometries by sort of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
of those base geometries by sort of
changing<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.870> shapes<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.410> arms<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.040> legs

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
changing the shapes of the arms the legs

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.250 
changing the shapes of the arms the legs
and<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.550> player<00:01:50.760> body<00:01:51.030> types<00:01:51.300> so<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> we're

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
and the player body types so and we're

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.680 
and the player body types so and we're
pretty<00:01:52.380> pretty<00:01:53.190> able<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.700> support<00:01:54.150> any<00:01:54.390> kind

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
pretty pretty able to support any kind

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.570 
pretty pretty able to support any kind
of<00:01:54.810> player<00:01:54.990> models<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.010> should<00:01:56.190> see<00:01:56.400> quite

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
of player models so you should see quite

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.750 
of player models so you should see quite
a<00:01:56.640> few<00:01:56.729> differences<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> players<00:01:57.870> there

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
a few differences in the players there

both very different and last year they

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.940 
both very different and last year they
weren't<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.200> different<00:02:40.320> at<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:40.769> they

weren't so different at all they

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.680 
weren't so different at all they
actually<00:02:41.250> use<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.640> same<00:02:41.850> kind<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.180> locomotion
