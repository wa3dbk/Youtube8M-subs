week of pronation and specifically today
looking<00:00:11.429> at<00:00:11.580> when<00:00:12.000> pronation<00:00:12.660> should<00:00:13.110> occur

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
looking at when pronation should occur

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.039 
looking at when pronation should occur
to<00:00:13.860> maximize<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.940> amount<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.330> power<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.929> it

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
to maximize the amount of power that it

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.939 
to maximize the amount of power that it
can<00:00:16.230> give<00:00:16.440> us<00:00:17.960> I'm<00:00:18.960> gonna<00:00:19.170> backtrack<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.800> little

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
can give us I'm gonna backtrack a little

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.939 
can give us I'm gonna backtrack a little
bit<00:00:20.310> okay<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.970> went<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> player<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:21.990> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
bit okay if I went to a player that you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.800 
bit okay if I went to a player that you
know<00:00:23.039> kind<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.400> used<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> frying-pan<00:00:24.060> grip

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
know kind of used the frying-pan grip

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
know kind of used the frying-pan grip
for<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> serve<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.800> we're<00:00:26.550> keeping<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
for the serve and we're keeping the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.689 
for the serve and we're keeping the
strings<00:00:27.390> available<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> ball<00:00:28.800> at<00:00:29.189> all

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
strings available to the ball at all

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.020 
strings available to the ball at all
times<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:31.590> reason<00:00:32.040> they<00:00:32.189> would<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
times the reason they would do that is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.389 
times the reason they would do that is
because<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.960> fear<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.290> probably<00:00:35.190> not

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
because of the fear of probably not

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.090 
because of the fear of probably not
making<00:00:35.850> good<00:00:36.030> contact<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:37.590> getting<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
making good contact and not getting the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.090 
making good contact and not getting the
servant<00:00:38.579> okay<00:00:39.420> step<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
servant okay step that up now to a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.850 
servant okay step that up now to a
player<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.520> does<00:00:42.180> serve<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> continental

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
player that does serve in a continental

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.560 
player that does serve in a continental
grip<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:44.879> some<00:00:45.450> pronation<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.969> timing

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
grip and has some pronation the timing

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.290 
grip and has some pronation the timing
of<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.860> about<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.730> level<00:00:51.059> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
of it really now is about a level of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350 
of it really now is about a level of
commitment<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.489> waiting<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.760> little<00:00:54.149> longer

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
commitment and waiting a little longer

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.470 
commitment and waiting a little longer
than<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.140> see<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.710> Club<00:00:56.100> players<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
than I see a lot of Club players you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.470 
than I see a lot of Club players you
know<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:59.100> order<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.670> maximize

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
know kind of make in order to maximize

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
know kind of make in order to maximize
that<00:01:00.510> power<00:01:01.079> okay<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.460> point<00:01:02.699> being

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that power okay and my my point being

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.020 
that power okay and my my point being
that<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> players<00:01:05.309> end<00:01:05.670> up

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that I think a lot of players end up

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.780 
that I think a lot of players end up
kind<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> pronating<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:07.590> making<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.220> move<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
kind of pronating or making that move a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.870 
kind of pronating or making that move a
little<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:09.360> too<00:01:09.659> early<00:01:10.010> probably<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.400> ensure

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
little bit too early probably to ensure

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
little bit too early probably to ensure
good<00:01:12.150> contact<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.530> give<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.979> kind<00:01:14.340> of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
good contact and to give them kind of

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.700 
good contact and to give them kind of
that<00:01:14.549> safety<00:01:15.030> feeling<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> okay<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that safety feeling that okay the the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.090 
that safety feeling that okay the the
edge<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> racket<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.240> leading<00:01:18.830> let<00:01:19.830> me<00:01:19.950> get

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
edge of the racket is leading let me get

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
edge of the racket is leading let me get
the<00:01:20.250> strings<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.759> there<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.090> ball<00:01:21.360> let<00:01:21.720> me

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the strings up there to the ball let me

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380 
the strings up there to the ball let me
turn<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.290> hand<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.369> kind<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.729> down<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
turn that hand you know kind of down to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.320 
turn that hand you know kind of down to
get<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> strings<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> ball<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.430> lot<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
get the strings on the ball a lot of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
get the strings on the ball a lot of
players<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.680> full<00:01:29.070> commitment

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
players don't have that full commitment

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.170 
players don't have that full commitment
of<00:01:30.229> leading<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.619> edge<00:01:31.950> long<00:01:32.640> enough

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
of leading with that edge long enough

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.170 
of leading with that edge long enough
and<00:01:33.740> then<00:01:34.740> waiting<00:01:35.310> till<00:01:35.549> probably<00:01:36.000> only

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and then waiting till probably only

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
and then waiting till probably only
about<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.509> foot<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.229> guys<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.040> racket

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
about a foot you guys I think the racket

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
about a foot you guys I think the racket
honestly<00:01:39.090> should<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.540> getting<00:01:39.930> almost<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
honestly should be getting almost to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.980 
honestly should be getting almost to
just<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> foot<00:01:41.700> before<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.240> tennis<00:01:42.630> ball

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
just about a foot before the tennis ball

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.010 
just about a foot before the tennis ball
before<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.340> should<00:01:44.579> start<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.659> move

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
before we should start to see that move

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.160 
before we should start to see that move
of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.490> racket<00:01:47.909> head<00:01:48.060> turning<00:01:48.479> downward

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
of the racket head turning downward

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.039 
of the racket head turning downward
which<00:01:49.770> obviously<00:01:50.130> means<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:51.329> palm<00:01:51.630> goes

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
which obviously means my my palm goes

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.460 
which obviously means my my palm goes
from<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.640> there<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
from there to there and I think what you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.679 
from there to there and I think what you
guys<00:01:55.590> will<00:01:55.890> find<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> delay<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
guys will find is when you delay that

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.730 
guys will find is when you delay that
that<00:01:58.380> pronation<00:01:59.369> till<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> last<00:02:00.360> possible

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
that pronation till the last possible

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.889 
that pronation till the last possible
second<00:02:01.740> you're<00:02:02.369> gonna<00:02:02.490> see<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> big<00:02:03.119> bump<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.689> in

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
second you're gonna see a big bump up in

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.980 
second you're gonna see a big bump up in
power<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.560> you'll<00:02:05.250> actually<00:02:05.549> feel<00:02:06.329> more

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
power and you'll actually feel more

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.859

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
the ball and then they're literally

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
right because that move is so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.520 
right because that move is so
exaggerated<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.420> they're<00:02:40.110> they're<00:02:40.380> almost

exaggerated and they're they're almost

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.680 
exaggerated and they're they're almost
using<00:02:41.069> lag<00:02:41.370> at<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.760> point<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.239> it's<00:02:42.480> like

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
using lag at that point it's it's like

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.430 
using lag at that point it's it's like
that<00:02:43.010> last-second<00:02:44.010> snap<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.959> creating<00:02:45.959> such

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
big action at the ball that the wrist

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.140 
big action at the ball that the wrist
can't<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.830> stop<00:02:50.040> there<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.370> ends<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.700> turning

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
can't just stop there it ends up turning
