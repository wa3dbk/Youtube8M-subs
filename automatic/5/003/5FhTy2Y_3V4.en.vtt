 cooked by the kids for example of xda 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:31.140
 which will aim for example at savings in 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.399
 more battery or performance terms 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.079

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.280
 of roma dundee z3 we will have a single 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.560
 file which will be a file with extension md5 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.200
 this file we have to go to insert 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.710
 in the box pd has then we click on 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 pda let's find the file that 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.090
 we downloaded the folder with 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.759
 all the previous roms so look 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.329

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:46.920
 this is the abbreviation you look at we will have this 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:52.939
 file here type md5 file and we select it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 net there is sounds here later 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:03.600
 we need to download the phone 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.600
 so this is my turn off 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.509
 we are waiting for it to go out 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.750
 here is the brandization 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.950
 of the other I don't know if you've seen it 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.950
 we wait for it to go out 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.959
 now my phone is turned off for 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.420
 put it in download mod 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.250
 the procedure is very simple you have to 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.209
 press the button simultaneously 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.489
 volume down button volume down button 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:36.340
 menu this here and the power button 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.819
 then volume key down menu key is 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.060
 power button 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.400
 here it will give you a warning in this 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.440
 warning tells you that put rom 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.660
 modified may be problems go well 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.319
 bullshit with volume on we give the confirmation 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.209
 and we continue this is the screen of 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.620
 download mod 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.660
 after doing this thing we must 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.340
 connect the phone to the PC via the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.980
 normal cable that you also have 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.980
 we connect the charger 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.770
 always download and order immediately 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.570
 recognized the door with four in the 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.890
 case my how 4 work this is 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:30.510
 common with two depends and results adado 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.500
 swat in the mobile is all done 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.460
 just simply start up and 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.520
 he will do everything 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:44.310
 this procedure also served first for 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.730
 to modify kernels to rotate the 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.560
 telephone for example in some roms 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.770
 cooked you can find instead of a 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.920
 md5 single file you can find three files 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.080
 one called pd a 1 phone is a csc 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.650
 obviously the pd in rome and here is the 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.450
 sound whose csc here 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.300
 what else is there to say about the routes 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.750
 the very same watery 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:13.280
 take the file you find in the guides 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.390
 and use it in the same way 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.220
 I think I was clear enough 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.340
 if there is any problem of course 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:26.669
 write on the page in the phone 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:29.280
 together I don't spend anything on it 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.610
 that's all 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.810
 I repeat for any problems there 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:40.560
 we hear on the page galaxy s3 with my 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.440
 thumb coming from here to here you see 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.680
