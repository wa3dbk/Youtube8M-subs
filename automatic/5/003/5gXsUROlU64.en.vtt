00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.610 

there's<00:00:10.440> all<00:00:10.650> sorts<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:10.980> different<00:00:11.040> terms<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
there's all sorts of different terms and

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.589 
there's all sorts of different terms and
the<00:00:13.620> whole<00:00:13.769> point<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.190> think<00:00:14.249> is<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.669> go<00:00:14.879> faster

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the whole point I think is to go faster

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.750 
the whole point I think is to go faster
on<00:00:15.690> them<00:00:15.870> all<00:00:15.990> such<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.010> change<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:17.400> technique

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
on them all such a change or technique

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.609 
on them all such a change or technique
up<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.060> little<00:00:18.240> bit<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.570> basically<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.380> same

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
up a little bit but basically the same

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.500 
up a little bit but basically the same
thing<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.519> go<00:00:20.939> through<00:00:21.090> them<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.240> fast<00:00:21.390> as

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
thing is just go through them as fast as

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.080 
thing is just go through them as fast as
you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.810> momentum<00:00:22.289> carry<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> speed<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:24.000> if

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
you can momentum carry the speed but if

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.450 
you can momentum carry the speed but if
you're<00:00:24.210> smooth<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.099> me<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.220> think

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you're smooth I think it's me I think

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.490 
you're smooth I think it's me I think
that's<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> key<00:00:26.910> most<00:00:27.570> times<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.230> see<00:00:28.380> this

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that's the key most times you see this

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.210 
that's the key most times you see this
you<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.820> leaders<00:00:30.449> they're<00:00:30.750> not<00:00:31.220> you're

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
you see the leaders they're not you're

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.120 
you see the leaders they're not you're
not<00:00:32.369> always<00:00:32.520> busting<00:00:32.970> their<00:00:33.060> rear<00:00:33.240> and<00:00:33.270> around

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
not always busting their rear and around

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.410 
not always busting their rear and around
there's<00:00:35.130> some<00:00:35.310> there's<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:35.910> things<00:00:36.150> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
there's some there's some things that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.880 
there's some there's some things that
are<00:00:36.540> always<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.990> same<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.380> some<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> terms

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
are always the same in some of the terms

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.200 
are always the same in some of the terms
I<00:00:38.010> mean<00:00:38.130> you<00:00:38.250> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.640> those<00:00:38.730> elbows<00:00:38.940> up

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I mean you want to have those elbows up

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.600 
I mean you want to have those elbows up
you<00:00:40.020> want<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.250> everyone's

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
different though I mean this guy's

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.060 
different though I mean this guy's
elbows<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.290> might<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.560> that<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.860> guy's

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
elbows up might be that and this guy's

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.710 
elbows up might be that and this guy's
might<00:00:44.310> be<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.150> there's<00:00:45.300> no<00:00:45.390> really

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
might be there so there's no really

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.900 
might be there so there's no really
right<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:45.930> wrong<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.380> I<00:00:46.410> mean<00:00:46.910> everyone's

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
right or wrong way I mean everyone's

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
right or wrong way I mean everyone's
body's<00:00:48.420> built<00:00:48.690> differently<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.290> how<00:00:49.380> can<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
body's built differently so how can you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.630 
body's built differently so how can you
say<00:00:49.740> they<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:49.980> need<00:00:50.130> to<00:00:50.190> ride<00:00:50.310> the<00:00:50.400> same<00:00:50.580> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
say they all need to ride the same I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
say they all need to ride the same I
mean<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.150> short<00:00:51.330> guy<00:00:51.540> you<00:00:52.170> can't

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
mean if you get a short guy you can't

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.600 
mean if you get a short guy you can't
tell<00:00:52.530> them<00:00:52.590> go<00:00:52.740> through<00:00:52.860> loops<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> same<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.580> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
tell them go through loops the same as a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150 
tell them go through loops the same as a
guy<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.210> six<00:00:54.510> five<00:00:54.720> you<00:00:55.290> just<00:00:55.440> can't<00:00:55.740> do<00:00:55.830> it<00:00:55.860> so

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
guy you six five you just can't do it so

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.790 
guy you six five you just can't do it so
everyone<00:00:57.030> has<00:00:57.210> their<00:00:57.360> own<00:00:57.390> style

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.740 

for<00:01:01.800> them<00:01:01.950> their<00:01:02.250> own<00:01:02.340> fit<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> be

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
for them their own fit you want to be

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
for them their own fit you want to be
smooth<00:01:03.990> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> throttle<00:01:04.199> always<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.860> think<00:01:05.070> no

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
smooth on the throttle always I think no

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
smooth on the throttle always I think no
matter<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.850> want<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.119> smooth<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
matter what you want to be smooth you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
matter what you want to be smooth you
got<00:01:06.929> to<00:01:07.020> keep<00:01:07.109> your<00:01:07.259> leg<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> close<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
got to keep your leg up and close a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
got to keep your leg up and close a
front<00:01:09.299> tire<00:01:09.479> kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> keeps<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> weighted<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
front tire kind of keeps it weighted and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.060 
front tire kind of keeps it weighted and
balanced<00:01:12.170> not<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> whole<00:01:13.409> lot<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> clutch<00:01:13.829> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
balanced not a whole lot of clutch I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.770 
balanced not a whole lot of clutch I
don't<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.399> don't<00:01:14.460> use<00:01:14.759> my<00:01:14.939> clutch<00:01:15.149> sometimes<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
don't I don't use my clutch sometimes in

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
don't I don't use my clutch sometimes in
the<00:01:15.869> terms<00:01:16.109> I<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.679> one<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.399> particular

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the terms I think one one particular

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.440 
the terms I think one one particular
area<00:01:18.179> for<00:01:18.210> clutch<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.380> turn<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.740> maybe<00:01:20.450> you're

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
area for clutch and turn is maybe you're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.459 
area for clutch and turn is maybe you're
going<00:01:21.600> through<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> whoop<00:01:21.960> section<00:01:22.320> near

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
going through a whoop section near

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.649 
going through a whoop section near
fourth<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.429> you<00:01:23.579> have<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.240> after<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
fourth and you have right after that a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.120 
fourth and you have right after that a
turn<00:01:24.899> well<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.469> have<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.829> to<00:01:25.859> shift

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
turn well you don't have time to shift

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.889 
turn well you don't have time to shift
down<00:01:26.189> twice<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.939> shift<00:01:27.149> on<00:01:27.329> once<00:01:27.539> maybe<00:01:27.719> in

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
down twice you shift on once maybe in

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.749 
down twice you shift on once maybe in
your<00:01:28.020> third<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.249> coming<00:01:29.520> out<00:01:29.609> of<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
your third and so coming out of that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.190 
your third and so coming out of that
that<00:01:30.030> turn<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.509> third<00:01:30.719> it's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> tight

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that turn you're in third it's a tight

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.169 
that turn you're in third it's a tight
turn<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> stupid<00:01:31.829> cross<00:01:32.009> turn<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.399> you<00:01:32.460> feed

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
turn it stupid cross turn so you feed

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.359 
turn it stupid cross turn so you feed
the<00:01:33.329> clutch<00:01:33.560> don't<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.679> wild<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.249> but

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the clutch don't get wild with it but

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
the clutch don't get wild with it but
just<00:01:35.399> speed<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.789> clutch<00:01:36.030> keep<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.479> RPMs<00:01:36.840> up

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
just speed the clutch keep the RPMs up

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.209 
just speed the clutch keep the RPMs up
because<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.679> got<00:01:37.770> next

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
because what do you got next
