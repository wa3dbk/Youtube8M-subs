00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.559
 I hate to be single in the obvious bores me 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:13.259
 the mockery a year ago a year a year ago 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.340
 what an imbecile Robert told me 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.980
 I needed more space to ok. 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.890
 space if you need place look for the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.720
 new the new one is that all my friends 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.019
 they ask me to be the witness of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.580
 I'm in a coup 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.090
 there seems to be an offer in the registry 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.090
 civil I do not know 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.640
 well actually 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.880
 If I think about it, it's not so bad to be 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.790
 alone 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.590
 because for example I can give all those 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.270
 romantic comedies that I love 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.840
 and that if I'm in a couple I can not because 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:11.120
 by carrying the reactions you can also 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:15.280
 hanging out with friends and friends very soon 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.280
 of work or dancing be 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.380
 and without saying yes to things that 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.520
 I 'm really coming back from love or you want to go 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.320
 to watch the soccer game something from pablo 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:33.650
 no no I do not like him 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.270
 I do not like Pablo or the truth is 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.530
 great to be alone 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:45.340
 I'm mega single if you listen to my more 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.000
 felt and I love you look at me 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.000
 they see me 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.049
 Today, you gas me well, yes, sir. 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:14.040
 moreover that if friends and friends 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.739
 now it turns out that I am nothing
