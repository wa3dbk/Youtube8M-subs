00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.179
 hello dear people welcome to one 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.529
 further review or unboxing 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:33.329
 video to the new page lt 6 per 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.600
 Smart phone recently gave me that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.699
 It's six in the review 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.190
 now the extended variant came out 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:46.300
 with a slightly better processor 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.699
 the mdk 65 92 m opto choir with 1 4 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.049
 gigahertz 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.269
 the camera should be improved a bit 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:58.059
 have a gigabyte ram 8 gb 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:02.379
 The whole has no lte but umts 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:07.540
 Of course we also look at everything 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.070
 in the box is nice white box there 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:21.120
 we also find that first of all 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:24.990
 Smart phone packed well in case extra 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.990
 get it out of Europe 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:38.950
 the madness so there we have one 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:45.159
 transparent plastic cover still here 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.229
 mobile there we look again right away 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:55.720
 another thing we do not have one in the 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:58.659
 box a quick start guide in english 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.350
 we had mounted t6 already at 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.350
 the first version 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:18.760
 the label 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:21.910
 a usb with micro-usb connection with 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.239
 hofer name no more meaning like 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:30.310
 you can go back to mp3 so forward 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:36.760
 and a pity a european standard 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:40.630
 for the usb how to do it okay we do that 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:51.220
 first back and see us too 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:54.000
 once briefly the mobile phone to the film 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.000
 remove 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:06.459
 We already have the mobile phone headphones 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.890
 connection 35 millimeters then also the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.040
 micro-usb connection on the back 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.310
 then we find the 8 megapixel camera 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.910
 with led fresh down we find the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.519
 fight 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.359
 tecan norbert like happy life what ours 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:27.010
 zookeeper wants to promise 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:31.329
 there you can take the cover on the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.900
 side a little cheaper power 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.069
 button 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.269
 and on the other side the same 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.890
 you probably will not see it that way 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.019
 good is transparent and also off 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.430
 plastic 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.430
 as far as the whole time from the inside 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.579
 That's a 1900 milliamp battery 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.480
 umts from trt 6 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.150
 then comes on the one hand the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.610
 sim card into it and then we still have 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.220
 a connection for the micro sd card 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:17.650
 a card of this is the umts card 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:23.530
 dead pigeons though briefly at what 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:26.740
 start happening in the next video 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.210
 After that, of course, it's about us 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:37.930
 you times show the performance the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:39.310
 benchmarks that okay it starts you look 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.570
 yes not sure how much battery too 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.570
 really in it is in the device 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.580
 the mobile phone is equipped with android 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:55.270
 4.4 point 2 last version so how 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:00.520
 said mdk 65 92 mm optikur with 1 4 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:05.040
 gigahertz 1 gb ram 8 gb 5 inch ips ag 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.870
 screen with a resolution 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.990
 I think I am completely me now 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.710
 quite safe from 1280x720 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.240
 but I will again 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.150
 research or 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.760
 we will also see in the test gps 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.680
 a gps everything is available of course completely 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.880
 clearly that rom would have to be multi language one 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.240
 sim cards but no third 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:34.540
 is installed launcher three balls of 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:40.090
 apex chance once ran short once 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:41.620
 in the settings comes now 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.770
 of course I would already be pre-installed 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.770
 never 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:57.330
 Let's have a look at the phone 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.330
 as already mentioned android 4.0 4.2 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.250
 october well, we'll see everything else 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.250
 Have fun so deep in the review
