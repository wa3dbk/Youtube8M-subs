00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 and good now we are going to make a network 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.560
 between a virtual machine and a machine 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.530
 physical 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.800
 for these two operating systems without 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.350
 the same 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.940
 in a working group and enable the 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.940
 option to share files 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.620
 to start in the virtual machine that 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.900
 we want to add to the network we select 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.910
 we are going to select this and we are going to 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.390
 configuration 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.640
 here in the network section we will choose 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.790
 in this option that is here 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.340
 the bridge adapter and here it shows us 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.390
 and to our network card the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.360
 we select and we accept 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.059
 now we start in the virtual machine 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.910
 with the operating system in what 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.920
 start let's work on the machine 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.510
 physical then here we go to for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.089
 enable qom options to 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.390
 share files let's start panel 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.390
 of control 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.670
 and here in the option networks and internet 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.630
 we choose this one that says choose group in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.570
 Home and sharing options 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.820
 shows us three options we select 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.159
 the one that says change usage settings 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.159
 advanced shared let's go here 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.530
 and in this case state because there was 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.049
 shared but it should not be left 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.140
 always the option to activate the detection 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.420
 of networks option for other systems in 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.469
 the network and so that we the others 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.020
 machines that can not come to us 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.119
 we then activate the light too 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.380
 this option must be activated 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.920
 says activate sharing of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.920
 files and printers 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.680
 is also for users to 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.420
 other computers can read and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.450
 write the files the files in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.160
 the public folders and finally this 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 which says deactivate sharing with 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.490
 password protection because no 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.730
 we want a password that asks us 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.870
 password when we want to get 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.870
 see the files of this computer 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.750
 in the same way we are going here to change 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.280
 advanced sharing settings 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.630
 here if I 'm not bad this is in the same 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 because I had already used it for 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.120
 share files then here equal 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.310
 it has to be in the marked options 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.010
 activate relative network detection 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.270
 of shared files and printers 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.250
 that users can in other 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.190
 machines can read and write the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.950
 files and disable sharing 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.010
 with password protection for what 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.630
 What is left is to unite to oppose the two 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.510
 computers in the same group of 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.550
 work for this we are going to use with 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.610
 the machine the physical machine we go to 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.380
 start right click to the computer and in 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.840
 properties in properties 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.280
 here in the part that says 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.050
 domain name settings and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.270
 working group we will choose the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.270
 option that we're going to change configuration 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.690
 and here where it says team name 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.550
 let's change one of the team we're going to 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.420
 put physical 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.420
 physical 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.950
 to save the changes we always 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.799
 ask us to restart but we are going to 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.970
 restart it later because still 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.120
 we have to work on the machine 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.120
 virtual 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.920
 or 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.920
 ah 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.840
 there he tells us that he joined full 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.090
 correctly to the working group network 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.040
 initials 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.890
 gives us the message that we have to 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.620
 restart we are this and we say 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.229
 restart later 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.590
 so now we are going to do the same in 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:23.710
 the virtual machine we go to the beginning click 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.830
 right of the equipment properties 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.990
 in the east tab of configuration 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.229
 name we said the option to change 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.229
 configuration 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.400
 in the name tab we go to the button 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.650
 change 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.530
 virtual that is like 1 so that 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.150
 let's know what the virtual machine is and in 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:48.690
 the working group of the initial network 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.200
 we are going to do in the same way 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.890
 it tells us that we have to 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.890
 in the team 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.940
 I assure you correctly because we have 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.840
 to reduce to apply changes and 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.840
 restart now 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.460
 Well now let's make a 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.620
 Checking the network between the machine 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.840
 physical and the virtual machine for that 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.220
 let's use the ping command in 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.110
 this command 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.360
 serves to verify if there is connection of 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.670
 back and forth between the machines 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.210
 connected to the network we will derive 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:33.540
 first that of the ip address of the 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:39.180
 virtual machine for that we go to the 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:45.180
 console and we write the command and you 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:49.310
 get diagonal then here we go to 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:54.660
 search for the ip version 4 version is this 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:57.660
 ip ip address version 4 192 point 168 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.340
 point 1.24 now in the physical machine 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.730
 we go to start again 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:10.900
 with the console we do it with ping towards 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:17.050
 liza to that address ping 192.220 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.050
 168 point 1.24 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.050
 since it tells us the package is measured 24 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:27.200
 hours and 24 lost 0 then that there 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.540
 tells us that if there is a connection between 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.370
 two computers this could have been 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.690
 done from one machine from another 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.350
 computer that was always 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.910
 connected to the roker all to see that 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.290
 all are connected to the same network and 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.920
 be virtual machines or machines 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.990
 physical that would be all to check 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.410
 well here we can see also the 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.410
 records 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.020
 the files that are in all these 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.139
 are all the computers that are 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.550
 connected to the router 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.830
 physical this here 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.830
 the physical operating system and here 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.470
 We can see their 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.910
 in your public folders both from the 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.610
 author machine access the folders 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.010
 public of the physical machine also 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:15.920
 as the physical machine access the 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.920
 public folders of the virtual machine 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:24.540
 and this comes if it's all that's how it is 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:28.500
 they make the networks between virtual machines 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.500
 and physical machines
