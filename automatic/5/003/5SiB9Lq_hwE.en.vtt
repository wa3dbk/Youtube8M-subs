those few Holy Grail engine technologies

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.060 
those few Holy Grail engine technologies
that<00:01:38.390> allows<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.869> increase<00:01:39.070> horsepower

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
that allows you to increase horsepower

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.789 
that allows you to increase horsepower
torque<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.150> fuel<00:01:41.780> economy<00:01:41.930> at<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.350> same<00:01:42.560> time

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
torque and fuel economy at the same time

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.490 
torque and fuel economy at the same time
and<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.430> way<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:43.729> works<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.270> we<00:01:44.900> can<00:01:45.110> take<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
and the way it works is we can take the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.139 
and the way it works is we can take the
valve<00:01:45.770> lift<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.520> instead<00:01:46.820> of<00:01:46.850> just<00:01:46.970> opening

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
valve lift and instead of just opening

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.210 
valve lift and instead of just opening
it<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> same<00:01:47.780> height<00:01:48.020> every<00:01:48.350> time<00:01:48.530> we<00:01:49.040> can

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
it the same height every time we can

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.680 
it the same height every time we can
change<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:49.759> open<00:01:49.970> just<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.210> little<00:01:50.240> bit<00:01:50.540> or

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
change it and open just a little bit or

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.660 
change it and open just a little bit or
a<00:01:50.750> lot<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.649> basically<00:01:52.070> what<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.340> does<00:01:52.640> is

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
a lot and basically what that does is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.700 
a lot and basically what that does is
replace<00:01:53.119> your<00:01:53.300> throttle<00:01:53.690> body<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.590> can

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
replace your throttle body and you can

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.620 
replace your throttle body and you can
get<00:01:54.830> rid<00:01:54.979> of<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:55.130> completely<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.940> it

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
get rid of that completely and it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.760 
get rid of that completely and it
reduces<00:01:56.840> your<00:01:57.200> pumping<00:01:57.500> loss<00:01:59.110> 0<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.259> 60<00:02:00.560> comes

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
reduces your pumping loss 0 to 60 comes

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.830 
reduces your pumping loss 0 to 60 comes
up<00:02:00.979> in<00:02:01.130> six<00:02:01.520> seconds<00:02:01.910> flat<00:02:02.119> which<00:02:02.600> is
