00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.480
 very good to everyone in the new video 5 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.950
 in which I'm going to show you an image 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.660
 that intrigues me for quite some time 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.400
 time when several subscribers me the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 they taught and it's been in plain sight 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.090
 from the first moment but it has something 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.800
 that does not fit and that's what we're going to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.420
 deal with in this video but before 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.130
 begin I would like to ask you not only 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.610
 distract the xxi like without anything else 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.830
 what to add we begin 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.290
 As you know Grand Theft Auto 5 is 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.150
 announced at the end of 2012 and more weeks 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.860
 later we had his first trailer a 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.510
 trailer that already showed how 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.310
 was going to be the game and the trailer itself 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.830
 I already hid some things 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.989
 you miss the first one was the scanner that 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.880
 it looked very deep and that finally 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.620
 came out with the series game although if 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.170
 he subsequently did with the name of 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.150
 everything also we saw other things like 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.340
 figures that everyone pointed out that 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.559
 would be the game's departure date and that 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.740
 then they did not turn out to be correct and 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.420
 it was a simple coincidence in 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.160
 general there has always been some 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.050
 controversy about what is or is not 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.150
 intended by rockstar and things 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.920
 that appear and do not appear in what 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.660
 they show but while the trailer 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.860
 We already put a little on stage what 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.509
 they then made the images 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.280
 promotional items that were published 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.259
 every few days in them we can see 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.970
 snapshots of the game how are you doing 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.680
 I am teaching and that I have analyzed 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.210
 background in the past before departure 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.590
 of the game but they were also shown 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.050
 other images that had an intention 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.090
 different although they also maintained what 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.770
 was to promote the game in these art 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.360
 works we also found weird things 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.220
 as in the one of trevor with some letters 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 strange behind it does not seem that 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.070
 they will mean nothing 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.900
 apart we also saw the michael that 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.180
 He came out with a bigger face of anger 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.340
 normal but all in the background were 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.410
 normal and all those things in which 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.810
 we were fixing they had no major 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.760
 mystery but very different is the case of 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.380
 a tree that came out very early in 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.300
 the promotion stage that is perhaps the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.820
 most important tree in the game since it 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.620
 used as xm or background image to 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.600
 when you place yourself on the game in the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.130
 playstation3 menu and apart also 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.380
 it was very used to do all the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.660
 promotion of the game is treated neither more nor 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.280
 less of this we see that the own 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.170
 hardware does not have anything weird 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.940
 apparently we see that if he is very 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.860
 worked with the appearance of live 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.810
 alluding to what would then be the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.610
 mobile brand within the game and 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.650
 we also saw that the position itself 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.230
 is very choreographed with those fingers 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.450
 making the shape of the ub 5 roman 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.550
 that would be the gta 5 logo and they are those 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.620
 the things that we see at first glance but 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.959
 there is something very strange that we can see 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.349
 we should only think from where it is 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.030
 taken the picture of this art work some 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.799
 you will be thinking that on the beach and 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.569
 you are right but the reality is 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.580
 than from any point on the beach 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.560
 the saints you can get this photo 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.900
 many of you will already know and that is 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.180
 the background of the image is absolutely 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.340
 impossible it can not appear the city of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.870
 the saints if we look at the sea from where 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.790
 this image is located I will 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.530
 I will easily demonstrate by going to the game 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.180
 as you can see from the angle of the artwork 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.040
 we can see what is the pierre dog 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.959
 where is the ferris wheel and the roller coaster 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.910
 but in order to see the city we would have 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.950
 that turn the camera a lot this 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.390
 ne image intrigued during the last 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.950
 weeks and I did not want to lose the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.750
 opportunity to share it because if 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.849
 well surely it is a fault on the part 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.709
 from rockstar I find it pretty weird that 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.450
 commit something like that when they are so 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.159
 take care of the rest of aspects such as 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.200
 posture with the vee of the fingers and the 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.970
 own eye fruit you can also think 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.620
 some that is a creative license 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.599
 that were taken to show more things 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.670
 of the game but it does not seem anything like 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.260
 rockstar inventing things that are very 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.180
 different the real version of the game 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.159
 when they are the ones who take care of 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.720
 most minimal section the last thing that we 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.890
 left to think is that it was the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.750
 beta of the game in which 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.670
 city ​​that could be seen in the background but 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.069
 again it could not be possible either 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.870
 that we know that the saints are not like that 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.910
 the gta san andreas puts them and neither is it 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.160
 the angels city on which the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.230
 saints we only have questions and not you 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.030
 there is no answer and it is that everything 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.370
 points out that it was a big failure 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.110
 part of rockstar and these failures we know 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.240
 that are counted on the fingers of one hand 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.860
 but since we're talking about failures and 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.630
 before saying goodbye I would like 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.400
 ask or if you know some big bug 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.780
 more that you have the game of this type or of 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.700
 another and without more 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.170
 I hope you liked it and a greeting and 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.170
 until the next goodbye
