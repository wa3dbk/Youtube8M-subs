up<00:02:54.380> because<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:55.010> doesn't<00:02:55.430> really<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:56.920> make

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
up because it doesn't really and make

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.759 
up because it doesn't really and make
any<00:02:58.130> difference<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:59.630> not<00:02:59.840> have<00:03:00.079> them<00:03:00.260> open

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
any difference to not have them open

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.490 
any difference to not have them open
because<00:03:01.120> it's<00:03:02.120> an<00:03:02.329> it's<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.630> cooperative<00:03:03.230> game

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
because it's an it's a cooperative game

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.940 
because it's an it's a cooperative game
and<00:03:04.660> if<00:03:05.660> people<00:03:05.720> can<00:03:06.109> see<00:03:06.290> what's<00:03:06.620> going<00:03:06.859> on

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
and if people can see what's going on

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.550 
and if people can see what's going on
it's<00:03:07.130> it's<00:03:07.340> not<00:03:07.549> like<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.849> is<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.299> any<00:03:08.450> way

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
it's it's not like this is in any way

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.789 
it's it's not like this is in any way
and<00:03:10.569> hidden<00:03:11.569> where<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.290> doesn't<00:03:12.470> need<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.680> be

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
and hidden where it doesn't need to be

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.890 
and hidden where it doesn't need to be
hidden<00:03:13.130> anyway<00:03:13.430> so

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.740 

now<00:03:19.900> everybody<00:03:20.320> has<00:03:20.470> four<00:03:20.740> Rivendell<00:03:21.220> cards

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
now everybody has four Rivendell cards

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.480 
now everybody has four Rivendell cards
so<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.110> next<00:03:23.260> thing<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.620> they<00:03:23.920> need<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.310> do

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
so the next thing that they need to do

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.430 
so the next thing that they need to do
is<00:03:25.950> each<00:03:26.950> player<00:03:27.430> needs<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:28.030> pass<00:03:28.240> one<00:03:28.720> card<00:03:29.080> to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
is each player needs to pass one card to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.210 
is each player needs to pass one card to
the<00:03:30.010> player<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:31.120> their<00:03:31.990> left<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.710> basically

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
the player to their left so basically

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.020 
the player to their left so basically
and<00:03:34.890> now<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.040> gets<00:03:36.190> interesting<00:03:36.400> because<00:03:36.880> now

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
and now it gets interesting because now

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.060 
and now it gets interesting because now
it<00:03:37.270> makes<00:03:37.450> sense<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.810> check<00:03:38.200> which<00:03:38.470> which

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
it makes sense to check which which

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.700 
it makes sense to check which which
cards<00:03:39.520> would<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.790> like<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.180> pass<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.960> to<00:03:41.380> to

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
cards would you like to pass and to to

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.890 
cards would you like to pass and to to
the<00:03:41.800> other<00:03:41.920> players<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:42.900> different

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
the other players because different

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.720 
the other players because different
habits<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.560> different<00:03:44.980> possibilities<00:03:45.700> of

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
habits have different possibilities of

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.640 
habits have different possibilities of
playing<00:03:46.360> cards<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.110> for<00:03:47.350> example<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:49.650> further

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
playing cards so for example and further

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.210 
playing cards so for example and further
can<00:03:51.100> use<00:03:51.310> any<00:03:51.640> card<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.240> is<00:03:52.450> white<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:53.260> this

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
can use any card that is white like this

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.080 
can use any card that is white like this
one<00:03:54.400> here<00:03:54.610> completely<00:03:55.000> white<00:03:55.330> as<00:03:55.930> opposed<00:03:56.410> to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
one here completely white as opposed to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.230 
one here completely white as opposed to
these<00:03:58.090> gray<00:03:58.510> cards<00:03:59.080> as<00:03:59.650> if<00:04:00.580> they<00:04:00.730> were<00:04:00.880> Joker

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
these gray cards as if they were Joker

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.390 
these gray cards as if they were Joker
cards<00:04:02.080> you<00:04:02.230> know<00:04:02.350> as<00:04:02.530> if<00:04:02.680> they<00:04:02.800> were<00:04:02.950> wild

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
cards you know as if they were wild

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.520 
cards you know as if they were wild
cards<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:03.820> can<00:04:03.940> use<00:04:04.150> them<00:04:04.330> for<00:04:04.360> anything<00:04:04.770> so

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
cards you can use them for anything so

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.520 
cards you can use them for anything so
giving<00:04:08.530> them<00:04:08.650> white<00:04:08.920> cards<00:04:09.460> is<00:04:09.610> a<00:04:10.000> good<00:04:10.300> idea

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
giving them white cards is a good idea

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.820 
giving them white cards is a good idea
because<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.830> can<00:04:12.010> use<00:04:12.190> them<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.400> anything

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
because you can use them for anything

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.310 
because you can use them for anything
hipping<00:04:14.830> doesn't<00:04:15.190> really<00:04:15.310> have<00:04:15.580> much<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:16.390> the

doesn't<00:04:38.320> really<00:04:38.380> matter<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:39.010> in<00:04:39.070> this<00:04:39.190> case<00:04:39.430> it

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
doesn't really matter so in this case it

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.360 
doesn't really matter so in this case it
is<00:04:40.150> actually<00:04:40.570> not<00:04:40.690> really<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:41.169> important<00:04:41.830> so

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
is actually not really that important so

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.040

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
now this has been done em and then what

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.219 
now this has been done em and then what
happens<00:05:17.749> everybody<00:05:18.289> needs<00:05:18.469> to<00:05:18.649> discard<00:05:19.159> a

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
happens everybody needs to discard a

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.109 
happens everybody needs to discard a
fellowship<00:05:21.229> card<00:05:21.559> so<00:05:21.860> that's<00:05:22.039> a<00:05:22.339> card<00:05:22.699> with

00:05:23.109 --> 00:05:23.119 
fellowship card so that's a card with

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:26.769 
fellowship card so that's a card with
the<00:05:23.449> handshake<00:05:24.139> symbol<00:05:25.059> each<00:05:26.059> one<00:05:26.299> has<00:05:26.479> to<00:05:26.659> do

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:26.779 
the handshake symbol each one has to do

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.179 
the handshake symbol each one has to do
this<00:05:26.899> or<00:05:27.199> if<00:05:27.289> they<00:05:27.379> don't<00:05:27.499> have<00:05:27.709> one<00:05:27.919> then<00:05:27.949> they

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:28.189 
this or if they don't have one then they

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.249 
this or if they don't have one then they
can<00:05:28.369> basically<00:05:29.299> and<00:05:29.989> discard<00:05:30.799> a<00:05:30.919> wild<00:05:31.309> card

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
can basically and discard a wild card

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.959 
can basically and discard a wild card
which<00:05:33.259> would<00:05:33.589> be<00:05:33.739> a<00:05:33.769> waste<00:05:34.009> so<00:05:34.369> also<00:05:34.549> when<00:05:34.849> you

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
which would be a waste so also when you

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.249 
which would be a waste so also when you
when<00:05:35.119> you<00:05:35.209> check<00:05:35.239> which<00:05:35.629> cards<00:05:35.959> you<00:05:36.019> pass<00:05:36.229> on

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
when you check which cards you pass on

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.379 
when you check which cards you pass on
it<00:05:36.559> doesn't<00:05:36.829> make<00:05:36.889> sense<00:05:36.949> to<00:05:37.309> make<00:05:38.059> sure<00:05:38.209> that

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
it doesn't make sense to make sure that

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.299 
it doesn't make sense to make sure that
you<00:05:38.479> keep<00:05:38.689> one<00:05:38.899> of<00:05:38.929> these<00:05:39.139> ones<00:05:39.439> for<00:05:40.189> this

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:40.309 
you keep one of these ones for this

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:42.729 
you keep one of these ones for this
particular<00:05:40.459> term<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:42.110> now<00:05:42.259> this<00:05:42.439> has<00:05:42.589> been

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:42.739 
particular term so now this has been

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:46.989 
particular term so now this has been
done<00:05:42.979> and<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:44.479> party<00:05:44.979> enters<00:05:45.979> moria<00:05:46.249> and<00:05:46.639> this

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:46.999 
done and the party enters moria and this

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.850 
done and the party enters moria and this
is<00:05:47.149> this<00:05:47.419> really<00:05:47.959> beautifully<00:05:48.379> illustrated

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860
