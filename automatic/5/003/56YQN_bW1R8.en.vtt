00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 am you next to this very 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.090
 Cousin now expensive super to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.390
 light on high long sport that will 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.610
 in the new movie Fast and the Furious 7 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.310
 this is exactly the car in which wines 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:37.649
 diesel crashes not only in 1 of 2 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:40.140
 skyscraper hoped vin diesel left 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.699
 his good condition so i can him 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.699
 show you go look 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:56.640
 probably his insurance company will not 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.239
 delighted specifically for filming 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.479
 afterburner 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.550
 year produced 9 such copies 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:06.210
 only two of them were built inside 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.600
 and this is one of them 2 unfortunately was 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.030
 broken as you understand this instance 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.310
 is not in its best condition 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.310
 filming some things 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.799
 something is broken what elements are made 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.049
 especially for the movie impressions 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.960
 carbon fiber actually gives 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.740
 film of similar color is missing the emblem 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.740
 on wheels Pavilion up machine 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.450
 no side mirrors and of course 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.640
 front glass they were removed 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.420
 to not see the reflection of light in 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.420
 filming time 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.490
 it looks like something has fallen off 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.630
 I'm not surprised that there are no valuable 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:07.740
 stones sure they didn't want to lose 480 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.410
 diamond while shooting and so i am 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.959
 saw like an the first time i dont 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.709
 surprised that the director chose this one 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.080
 car 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.750
 since part of the shooting took place in 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.930
 hit alike he is the first super to 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.780
 produced in the middle east in general 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.319
 w motors will produce all such 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.390
 super to 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.459
 to make like an even more if 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.769
 Earth is the first car in the world 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.500
 who has his pair of diamonds 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.989
 each headlight consists of 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.290
 titanium blades which are attached 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.420
 240 diamonds with a price tag of almost three 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.799
 half million dollars like an 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.670
 is one of the most expensive 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.830
 cars of the world 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.050
 Now a little about the characteristics of cars 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.520
 equipped with six-cylinder boxer 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.540
 two turbine engine 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:02.070
 volume of 3.7 liters which produces 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.130
 740 horsepower from zero to hundreds for 2.8 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.540
 seconds and a top speed of three hundred 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.540
 eighty five kilometers per hour 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.370
 behind the lite-on looks like a real 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.080
 as much as possible 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.780
 inside behind bars and on full of shards 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:26.700
 sklo probably got lost in the shooting process 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.700
 now let's try to get in a minute 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.540
 interest began to divide 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.540
 my or ben diesel 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.570
 as you can see the interior of this car set 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.430
 much in what is different from the present 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.910
 orange stickers that are stuck on 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.560
 everywhere here for computer graphics 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.020
 the machine is no longer able to work 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.370
 so let's see how we have her 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.370
 pulled out of the room 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.340
 I am very lucky that I have the opportunity 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.820
 see this car now before it arrives 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.760
 movie Fast and Furious 7 on the screens now I donâ€™t 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.550
 I can wait for the film to be interesting 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.020
 how likes will look like it thanks for 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.020
 watching see you again
