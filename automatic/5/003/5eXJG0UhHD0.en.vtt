model<00:00:34.969> this<00:00:35.969> boot<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> repo<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:38.399> sitting

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
model this boot is a repo it is sitting

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.110 
model this boot is a repo it is sitting
on<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> ground<00:00:39.300> without<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.050> trailer

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
on the ground without a trailer

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
on the ground without a trailer
now<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> pontoons<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.170> good<00:00:43.350> shape<00:00:43.430> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
now the pontoons are in good shape it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.680 
now the pontoons are in good shape it
was<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:45.860> hurt<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:47.129> all<00:00:47.280> moving<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.149> came<00:00:48.360> on

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
was not hurt at all moving it it came on

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.380 
was not hurt at all moving it it came on
a<00:00:48.719> trailer<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:50.219> got<00:00:50.370> rolled<00:00:50.700> right<00:00:51.000> here

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
a trailer and just got rolled right here

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.770 
a trailer and just got rolled right here
so<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> needs<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.500> moved<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.250> two<00:00:53.399> ways

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so it needs to be moved one of two ways

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.110 
so it needs to be moved one of two ways
one<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.500> rollback<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:58.640> flat<00:00:59.640> trailer

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
one is a rollback or a flat trailer

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.990 
one is a rollback or a flat trailer
where<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.260> rubber<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.190> pull<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.760> up

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
where you put rubber down and pull it up

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.590 
where you put rubber down and pull it up
on<00:01:03.180> top<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> pontoon<00:01:06.060> trailer

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
on top of that or with a pontoon trailer

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.230 
on top of that or with a pontoon trailer
I<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:08.010> access<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.119> these

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
I do not have access to one of these

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.710 
I do not have access to one of these
trailers<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:11.549> you'd<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.090> find<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.540> by

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
trailers so you'd have to find out by

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
trailers so you'd have to find out by
yourself<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:14.010> rented<00:01:14.520> or

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
similar like I say this boot is a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.080 
similar like I say this boot is a
