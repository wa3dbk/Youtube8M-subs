00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
BMWs even though it's kind of cool but

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.710 
BMWs even though it's kind of cool but
putting<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> new<00:02:49.850> triumph<00:02:50.330> with<00:02:50.450> fuel

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.270 
injection with a lot of a lot of power
really<00:02:52.760> gives<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.330> vintage<00:02:53.690> look<00:02:53.840> and
