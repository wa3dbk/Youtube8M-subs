for<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.170> old<00:02:52.379> one<00:02:53.030> those<00:02:54.030> just<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.599> yellow<00:02:54.989> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
for the old one those just as yellow I

for the old one those just as yellow I
think<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:56.040> think<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.299> reason<00:02:57.750> version<00:02:58.200> is

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319

think I think that the reason version is
more<00:02:58.470> accurate<00:02:58.890> but<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.519> don't<00:03:00.239> know<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.720> much

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
