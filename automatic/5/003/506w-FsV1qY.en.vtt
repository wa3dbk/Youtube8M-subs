00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
combined them with some of my own

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.060 
combined them with some of my own
research<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.240> let's<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.289> started<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
research so let's get started with the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
research so let's get started with the
French<00:00:32.399> Foreign<00:00:32.969> Legion<00:00:33.000> loadout<00:00:33.750> for

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
French Foreign Legion loadout for

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.900 
French Foreign Legion loadout for
battlefield<00:00:34.320> 3<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.219> first<00:00:35.430> off<00:00:35.579> let's<00:00:35.610> take<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
battlefield 3 so first off let's take a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.069 
battlefield 3 so first off let's take a
look<00:00:36.120> at<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> weapons<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.780> accessories

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
look at the weapons and accessories

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.389 
look at the weapons and accessories
you're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> use<00:00:37.890> about<00:00:38.190> this

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you're going to use about this

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
you're going to use about this
Legionnaire<00:00:39.030> setup<00:00:39.450> no<00:00:40.079> French<00:00:40.379> loadout

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
Legionnaire setup no French loadout

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.619 
Legionnaire setup no French loadout
would<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:41.100> complete<00:00:41.489> without<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.910> FAMAS<00:00:42.270> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
would be complete without the FAMAS so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.240 
would be complete without the FAMAS so
we're<00:00:42.840> gonna<00:00:42.930> use<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.379> assault<00:00:43.710> kit<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
we're gonna use the assault kit and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.619 
we're gonna use the assault kit and
equipped<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> mass<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.210> our<00:00:45.329> primary

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
equipped with the mass as our primary

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.990 
equipped with the mass as our primary
weapon<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> optic<00:00:47.370> we're<00:00:47.579> gonna<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.910> with

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
weapon for the optic we're gonna go with

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
weapon for the optic we're gonna go with
the<00:00:48.180> IR<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.899> V<00:00:49.110> scope<00:00:49.469> we're<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the IR and V scope we're just going to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
the IR and V scope we're just going to
relate<00:00:50.190> well<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.460> expect<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.360> helmet<00:00:51.750> use<00:00:51.960> by

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
relate well to expect to helmet use by

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
relate well to expect to helmet use by
the<00:00:52.289> French<00:00:52.590> military<00:00:52.969> spec<00:00:53.969> gel<00:00:54.180> mate<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the French military spec gel mate is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
the French military spec gel mate is
pretty<00:00:54.660> fancy<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.230> some<00:00:55.469> real-time

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
pretty fancy with some real-time

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
pretty fancy with some real-time
positioning<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> information<00:00:57.719> systems<00:00:58.170> as

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so at night vision feature fits in

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
so at night vision feature fits in
pretty<00:01:02.699> well<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> infrared<00:01:03.750> vision<00:01:04.110> of
