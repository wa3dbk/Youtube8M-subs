well no no no I resetting that's a
challenge<00:02:25.090> but<00:02:26.090> my<00:02:26.660> first<00:02:26.870> dog<00:02:27.080> being<00:02:27.260> a

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
challenge but my first dog being a

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.559 
challenge but my first dog being a
Labrador<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.220> when<00:02:28.370> he<00:02:28.520> passed<00:02:28.790> away<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.330> just

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
Labrador and when he passed away I just

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.910 
Labrador and when he passed away I just
thought<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.840> can't<00:02:30.140> get<00:02:30.319> another<00:02:30.530> Labrador

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
thought I can't get another Labrador

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920 
thought I can't get another Labrador
because<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.130> horribly<00:02:31.940> judge<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.390> against<00:02:32.720> my

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
because I horribly judge it against my

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.930 
because I horribly judge it against my
first<00:02:33.170> goal<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:33.950> almost<00:02:34.190> went<00:02:34.400> back<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.819> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
first goal so I almost went back to the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.390 
first goal so I almost went back to the
basics<00:02:35.360> rent<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> box<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.350> thought<00:02:37.130> back<00:02:37.370> on

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
basics rent the box and thought back on

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.710 
basics rent the box and thought back on
the<00:02:37.610> dots<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:37.940> I've<00:02:38.060> worked<00:02:38.330> with<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.690> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
the dots that I've worked with in the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.660

dogs to have this reputation and I just

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.710 
dogs to have this reputation and I just

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.200 
think it's completely down to the owner
to<00:02:57.380> develop<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.040> dog<00:02:58.450> regardless<00:02:59.450> what<00:02:59.989> about
