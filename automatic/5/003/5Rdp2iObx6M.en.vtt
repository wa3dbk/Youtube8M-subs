00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.509
 Talk about beauty, but here too. 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.650
 bringing you another video of 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.400
 ambon kim 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.150
 this time it 's another ssd to open 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.680
 here for you to see what ss these 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.640
 free we will even get here go pro 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 my friend wagner will be using 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.260
 still his machine to make an improvement 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.260
 in performance right? 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 on here 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.899
 O 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:15.640
 only have right here s beauty 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:21.359
 good guys with the ssd of the time is for sure 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:25.719
 neutron gtx sata3 than the 120 model 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:27.700
 120 gb of ssd for those who do not know is a 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.569
 storage device as well as 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.299
 hd 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:34.390
 only different from the HD that has a 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.429
 magnetic disk and a needle to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.610
 reading and in the tracks 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.950
 the sdl use memory in the mandi 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.140
 nand flash memory and a controller 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:50.289
 This memory is there to store it. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.549
 your computer files without 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.009
 operational etc. 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.369
 hence the performance difference of a ssd 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.709
 against the hd is very big so who 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.799
 never had a ssd worth buying 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.049
 a ssd because it really changes a lot 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.819
 performance of your pc 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:12.840
 then we will open here is good to see more 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.840
 nothing inside the box 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.799
 are seven millimeters thick 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:24.910
 only he comes with a baiana is a 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.650
 adapter for our heart at 2.5 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.190
 high a fraction here's another one here 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.239
 then it is from 215 to 3.5 if your 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:40.560
 cabinet does not have a 2.5-bay come 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.560
 the screws do not screw it 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.730
 and let's open now the pipe is like this 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.430
 it is 7 mm thick 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.670
 height here is more in not just is 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:10.900
 compare that with hd 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:13.810
 the difference is size and everything else 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.460
 his entrance is boring is just like hds 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:23.730
 Sas you can see that the same thing 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:28.630
 here and here so we can talk here 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.920
 of this steed ssd neutrons gtx is 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.840
 it the right 120 gigabyte model 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.140
 according to some tests of the own force 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.700
 aerial it reaches the mark of 84 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:46.150
 km and the ps aligned to 4k nec is a test 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.100
 average lution 10,871 was interface 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.020
 SATA 36 gigabits per second uses 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.750
 memory nand memory technology 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.970
 right flash comes with ram and 128 cash 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.180
 megabyte, your weight here indicates a 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.330
 kilo but this here in the weight that see 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.120
 there pezza 280 grams I still think 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.280
 It is very light and probably with 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.660
 box can reach the kilo 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.720
 this assembly 5 volts and the right 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.270
 maximum power consumption using the 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.390
 ss gave the series of assets is only 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.870
 four points six batches and in 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:32.500
 standby neighborhood of the ideal nÃ© it gets 0.6 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.100
 watson and get support smart right that is 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.420
 that technology that identifies your 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.100
 storage device it is 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.590
 with a problem usually in hds 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.070
 when you started windows 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.060
 it shows there smart ok for example ne 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:53.700
 and it withstands blows and up to 1,500 g 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.100
 sure its mtbf that 's the time for 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.320
 some error is the time the component 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.370
 It takes too long to have a problem 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.640
 of 2 million two million hours, right? 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.130
 So it's going to last a long time, then. 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.140
 I'm just going to do a basic test there 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.420
 Crystal says that mark just for you. 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.850
 see even using only one ssd 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:19.580
 any speed you are going to get 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.580
 of the steed beauty ssd
