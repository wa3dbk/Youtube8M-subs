00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.259
 reducer evaporator it is connected to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.230
 engine cooling system and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.420
 warmed up and then owls here is one slang 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.670
 below is another hose which antifreeze 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.290
 going on here is the transformation of gas and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.570
 liquid to gaseous 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 and you need to gear up to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.490
 fourth generation not only warmed up 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.650
 but also kept the temperature and pressure 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 in the second generation 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.390
 this reducer still reduces gas pressure 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 before atmospheric because for the second 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 pressure generation do not need gear 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.450
 has a screw plug at the bottom 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.500
 for yourself condensate here here it is below 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.090
 condensate can be drained completely 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 alone but not necessary 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 forget that if condensate drips on 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.989
 then the car will be very long 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.600
 it stinks and itâ€™s stinky for 30 meters 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.390
 this smell is felt on the fourth 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.129
 generation condensate does not merge because 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.399
 that the fourth generation gearbox 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.789
 has pressure on my one and a half atmosphere 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.649
 and all gas burns and no condensate 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.159
 there is no fourth generation 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.320
 This is a plus on the gear case 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.210
 I have a screw idling 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.700
 there is a gearbox lovato 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.650
 for the second generation screw you see 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 can also be adjusted independently 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.200
 I want to remind once again that for 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 4th generation hbo gearbox is very important 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.070
 so that the gearbox keeps the temperature not 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.840
 cooled otherwise the machine will not switch 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.939
 on gas as the system automatically 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.130
 switches to gas at a certain 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.170
 temperature and pressure in summer 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.860
 warm up to 40 degrees in the winter puts 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 adjustment 50 60 can and leave 40 and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.780
 maybe in winter it will turn out that the car is not 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.340
 switch to gas well, for example gearbox 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.820
 may not keep the temperature if you are in 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.430
 cold weather 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.890
 go on the road be on the road go 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.860
 quickly and the gearbox will cool in 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.979
 southern areas this is certainly not a factor in 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.840
 Northern is already a factor and should be put 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.210
 additional heated gear 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.450
 or insulate it and it will already affect 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.860
 the choice of GMO 2 or 4 generations why 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.290
 because the second generation 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.390
 switches on the lawn automatically 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.550
 manually that is one time switched 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.440
 his gas well and everything and he will be everything 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.790
 equal to the gas to go it back to 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.080
 gasoline there will not switch 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.360
 automatically to quality 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.340
 there are a generation of forums i read that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.410
 some even regret having moved from 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.980
 second to fourth generation head 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.110
 pain and type more become adjustments 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.060
 Well, here's the problem that cools 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.370
 its reducer needs to be warmed well 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.560
 due to the particular difference between the second and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.820
 fourth generation well and some 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.040
 extra amenities they don't 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.990
 felt but this opinion is not mine but on 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.240
 fourth generation did not drive it 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.940
 forum users write well, there is just such 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.390
 opinion and I voiced him we are all here 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.800
 I do not consider and I do not go on the way 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.780
 praising the second and fourth there 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.090
 For generations, I have no goal of any of these 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.010
 options to advertise so I just 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.610
 I say all the information and you yourself already there 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.800
 Think full movie about 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.200
 setting the work of all major companies 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.010
 this blah and also about the calculation of payback 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.709
 biba rationality rack installation choices 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.620
 gobo for him and comparing 2 4 generation 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.690
 gbo watch on my channel link there 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.760
 under the video or click the active link in 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.760
 the end of this video all good luck
