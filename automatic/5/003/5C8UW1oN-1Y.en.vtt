00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
bit beforehand to try and get a little

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.310 
bit beforehand to try and get a little
bit<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> an<00:01:30.210> advantage<00:01:30.360> time<00:01:30.810> by<00:01:30.960> themselves

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
bit of an advantage time by themselves

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
bit of an advantage time by themselves
that<00:01:32.280> amount<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> time<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:33.210> need<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that amount of time that they need and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.620 
that amount of time that they need and
uh<00:01:34.049> oh<00:01:34.520> something<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:36.000> weird<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.540> on

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
uh oh something really weird is going on
