00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
water from my glue pot along here to

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.999 
water from my glue pot along here to
soften<00:00:11.679> the<00:00:12.160> glue<00:00:13.049> hot<00:00:14.049> water<00:00:14.320> isn't<00:00:14.740> gonna

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
soften the glue hot water isn't gonna

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.620 
soften the glue hot water isn't gonna
really<00:00:15.249> hurt<00:00:15.519> the<00:00:15.759> French<00:00:16.480> polish<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:19.300> I<00:00:19.359> just

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
really hurt the French polish but I just

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.460 
really hurt the French polish but I just
want<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.900> get<00:00:19.990> this<00:00:20.170> glue<00:00:20.500> off<00:00:20.710> of<00:00:20.740> here<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
want to get this glue off of here and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.070 
want to get this glue off of here and
what<00:00:26.470> it<00:00:26.560> does<00:00:26.769> is<00:00:27.099> it<00:00:27.730> actually<00:00:28.080> reactivates

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
what it does is it actually reactivates

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.610 
what it does is it actually reactivates
the<00:00:29.439> hide<00:00:29.949> glue<00:00:30.779> when<00:00:31.779> you<00:00:31.929> glue<00:00:32.259> things

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:32.620 
the hide glue when you glue things

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.420 
the hide glue when you glue things
sometimes<00:00:33.310> braces<00:00:33.940> you<00:00:34.150> can<00:00:35.070> clean<00:00:36.070> up<00:00:36.100> the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
sometimes braces you can clean up the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.420 
sometimes braces you can clean up the
glue<00:00:37.060> with<00:00:37.300> some<00:00:37.480> hot<00:00:37.690> water<00:00:37.990> and<00:00:38.380> it<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.830> will

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
glue with some hot water and it it will

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.250 
glue with some hot water and it it will
reactivate<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.300> glue<00:00:40.540> right<00:00:40.870> around<00:00:41.080> the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
reactivate the glue right around the

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.370 
reactivate the glue right around the
edge<00:00:41.380> and<00:00:41.620> reseed<00:00:42.040> it<00:00:42.190> really<00:00:42.550> nicely<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.140> all

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
edge and reseed it really nicely so all

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.650 
edge and reseed it really nicely so all
these<00:00:44.500> little<00:00:44.560> tricks<00:00:45.070> with<00:00:45.340> hot<00:00:45.610> glue<00:00:46.560> and<00:00:48.660> so

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
these little tricks with hot glue and so

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.440 
these little tricks with hot glue and so
I<00:00:49.690> have<00:00:50.020> a<00:00:50.050> little<00:00:51.000> thingamajigger<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.120> made

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
I have a little thingamajigger I made

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.850 
I have a little thingamajigger I made
here<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:53.820> scrape<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.030> glue<00:00:55.180> off<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.680> is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
here to scrape the glue off this is

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.320 
here to scrape the glue off this is
really<00:01:00.160> important<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.700> if<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.060> don't<00:01:01.270> get

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
really important and if you don't get

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.669 
really important and if you don't get
the<00:01:01.450> glue<00:01:01.630> off<00:01:01.810> now<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:04.629> really<00:01:05.140> messes<00:01:05.320> up<00:01:05.590> the

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:05.679 
the glue off now it really messes up the

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:07.950 
the glue off now it really messes up the
finish<00:01:06.070> on<00:01:06.429> a<00:01:06.490> French<00:01:06.820> polish<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.479> lacquer<00:01:07.659> it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
finish on a French polish and lacquer it

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.719 
finish on a French polish and lacquer it
doesn't<00:01:08.259> matter<00:01:08.409> at<00:01:08.590> all<00:01:08.649> I<00:01:08.710> sometimes<00:01:09.429> wait

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
doesn't matter at all I sometimes wait

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.649 
doesn't matter at all I sometimes wait
for<00:01:09.909> it<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.060> dry<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:12.280> chip<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.670> off<00:01:12.789> but

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
for it to dry and just chip it off but

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.859 
for it to dry and just chip it off but
with<00:01:13.840> French<00:01:14.049> polish<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:16.210> can't<00:01:16.479> do<00:01:16.659> that

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
with French polish you can't do that

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:30.340 
with French polish you can't do that
okay<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:22.390> whatever<00:01:23.009> glue<00:01:24.009> is<00:01:24.280> kind<00:01:24.640> of

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:40.310 

left<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.620> there<00:01:35.510> will<00:01:36.510> come<00:01:36.720> off<00:01:38.960> later

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
left on there will come off later

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.790 
left on there will come off later
I<00:01:40.850> mean<00:01:41.850> cleaning<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> top<00:01:43.080> if<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.590> get

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
I mean cleaning up the top if you get

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.920 
I mean cleaning up the top if you get
glue<00:01:44.010> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.310> top<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:45.180> no<00:01:45.390> big<00:01:45.540> deal<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.900> can

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
glue on the top it's no big deal you can

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.600 
glue on the top it's no big deal you can
wipe<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.320> off<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.710> put<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.190> water<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
wipe it off just put a little water it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.820 
wipe it off just put a little water it
comes<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:48.060> off

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
comes right off

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.100 
comes right off
okay<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:52.009> we've<00:01:53.009> got<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> bridge<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.729> I'm

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
okay so now we've got the bridge on I'm

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.440 
okay so now we've got the bridge on I'm
getting<00:01:55.110> ready<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.409> actually<00:01:56.300> string<00:01:57.300> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
getting ready to actually string the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.800 
getting ready to actually string the
guitar<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.790> perhaps<00:01:59.790> I'll<00:02:00.150> do<00:02:00.300> a<00:02:00.330> video<00:02:00.630> of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
guitar up and perhaps I'll do a video of

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.420 
guitar up and perhaps I'll do a video of
that<00:02:00.840> since<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:01.950> might<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.220> kind<00:02:02.399> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that since it might be kind of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.859 
that since it might be kind of
interesting<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.720> see<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> birth<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.289> a<00:02:04.410> guitar

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
interesting to see the birth of a guitar

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.060 
interesting to see the birth of a guitar
anyhow<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.050> I'm<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.440> now<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:10.070> take

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
anyhow what I'm going to do now is take

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.509 
anyhow what I'm going to do now is take
a<00:02:11.130> razor<00:02:11.400> blade<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.830> scrape<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.070> between<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
a razor blade and scrape in between the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.050 
a razor blade and scrape in between the
frets<00:02:15.019> it's<00:02:16.019> kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.100> little<00:02:17.370> scraper

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
frets it's kind of like a little scraper

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.240 
frets it's kind of like a little scraper
and<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.870> cleans<00:02:20.269> all<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.330> gunk<00:02:21.860> from<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.040> side

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and it cleans all the gunk from the side

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.310 
and it cleans all the gunk from the side
of<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.459> frets<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.709> kind<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.830> smoothes<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
of the frets and kind of smoothes it and

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.150 
of the frets and kind of smoothes it and
then<00:02:31.320> after<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:35.180> sand<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.420> with

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
then after that I sand it with

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.380 
then after that I sand it with
equivalent<00:02:38.160> like<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.610> 600<00:02:39.269> grit<00:02:39.510> sandpaper

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
equivalent like a 600 grit sandpaper

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.630 
equivalent like a 600 grit sandpaper
with<00:02:42.390> linseed<00:02:42.900> oil<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.590> between<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> frets<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
with linseed oil in between the frets to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.630 
with linseed oil in between the frets to
kind<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.470> polish<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.739> wood<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.190> ebony<00:02:47.519> in

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
kind of polish the wood the ebony in

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.170 
kind of polish the wood the ebony in
between<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:52.250> seal<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:54.079> fretboard<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.709> ebony

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
between and seal the fretboard is ebony

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:07.940 
between and seal the fretboard is ebony
with<00:02:57.180> linseed<00:02:57.720> oil<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:06.600> now<00:03:07.200> what<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.650> I

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
with linseed oil so now what I do is I

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.280 
with linseed oil so now what I do is I
take<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> little<00:03:09.620> diluted<00:03:10.640> linseed<00:03:11.640> oil<00:03:13.100> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
take a little diluted linseed oil and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:27.559 
take a little diluted linseed oil and
apply<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> fingerboard

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.940 

it's<00:03:28.170> not<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.069> full<00:03:29.219> strength<00:03:31.219> it's<00:03:32.219> cut<00:03:32.579> with

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
it's not the full strength it's cut with

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.940 
it's not the full strength it's cut with
turpentine<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.159> thinner<00:03:38.430> mix<00:03:38.969> so<00:03:39.239> it

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
turpentine and it's a thinner mix so it

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.140 
turpentine and it's a thinner mix so it
absorbs<00:03:40.950> into<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.640> wood

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
absorbs into the wood

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.240 
absorbs into the wood
and<00:03:42.739> seals<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:45.060> fingerboard<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.040> put

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
and seals the the fingerboard and I put

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.610 
and seals the the fingerboard and I put
a<00:03:47.280> little<00:03:48.200> more<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.439> just<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.069> little

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.229 
a little more on just to get a little
slurry<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:52.769> there<00:03:53.189> and<00:03:54.319> then<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:56.659> sand<00:03:57.659> it<00:03:59.239> with

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
slurry on there and then I sand it with

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:08.629 
slurry on there and then I sand it with
this<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.470> some<00:04:03.680> some<00:04:04.680> an<00:04:05.189> old<00:04:05.400> piece<00:04:05.669> of<00:04:07.639> 1500

this is some some an old piece of 1500

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:19.719 
this is some some an old piece of 1500
grit<00:04:10.849> sandpaper

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.210

this gives a really nice finish to the

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.129 
this gives a really nice finish to the
wood<00:04:23.600> Wow<00:04:24.600> um<00:04:25.400> really<00:04:26.690> sealing<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.810> good<00:04:27.990> with
