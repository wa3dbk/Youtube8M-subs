on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.280> inside<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.790> home<00:00:11.940> sometimes<00:00:12.530> some

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
on the inside of a home sometimes some

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.010 
on the inside of a home sometimes some
of<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> movement<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.219> only<00:00:14.400> from<00:00:14.849> inside<00:00:15.030> so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
of the movement is only from inside so

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.800 
of the movement is only from inside so
maybe<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.619> going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.070> your<00:00:18.029> support

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
maybe it's going to be your support

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.980 
maybe it's going to be your support
posts<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> middle<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.680> your<00:00:19.830> home<00:00:19.980> and

posts in the middle of your home and
when<00:00:21.990> we're<00:00:22.170> dealing<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.640> support<00:00:23.640> posts

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
when we're dealing with support posts

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.019 
when we're dealing with support posts
they<00:00:24.720> could<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.109> been<00:00:25.289> under<00:00:25.619> designed<00:00:26.130> we

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
they could have been under designed we

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.230 
they could have been under designed we
have<00:00:27.269> posts<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:28.949> inside

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
have posts that we have to go inside

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
have posts that we have to go inside
with<00:00:30.240> different<00:00:30.689> strengths<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.170> different

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
with different strengths and different

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.959 
with different strengths and different
weights<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.610> make<00:00:32.790> sure<00:00:32.820> that

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
weights so that we can make sure that

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.510 
weights so that we can make sure that
we're<00:00:33.390> taking<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> weight<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.890> hose<00:00:35.190> for

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
we're taking the weight of that hose for

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.940 
we're taking the weight of that hose for
the<00:00:35.550> right<00:00:35.820> area<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.870> bracket<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.380> top<00:00:37.710> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the right area and the bracket on top of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.830 
the right area and the bracket on top of
the<00:00:38.070> smart<00:00:38.309> jack<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.790> also<00:00:39.300> what<00:00:39.450> carries<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the smart jack is also what carries the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
the smart jack is also what carries the
weight<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.410> intersecting<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.489> beams

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
weight and intersecting the two beams

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.569 
weight and intersecting the two beams
that<00:00:42.149> comes<00:00:42.360> across<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:43.410> also<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that comes across we also have on the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.930 
that comes across we also have on the
outside<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> host<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.780> sunk<00:00:46.190> we<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
outside if the host is sunk we we get to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.020 
outside if the host is sunk we we get to
look<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.100> lift<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.670> we

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
look and see that we can lift it and we

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
look and see that we can lift it and we
have<00:00:51.270> two<00:00:51.449> different<00:00:51.629> types<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.140> piers<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.680> do

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
have two different types of piers to do

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
have two different types of piers to do
that<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.899> come<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.649> got

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that so what we do is we come in you got

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
that so what we do is we come in you got
the<00:00:55.920> host<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> outside<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.930> down

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the host on the outside and we go down

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080 
the host on the outside and we go down
to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> footing<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> bracket<00:00:59.699> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
to the footing and put a bracket and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
to the footing and put a bracket and
it's<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.140> steel<00:01:01.410> bracket<00:01:01.649> designed<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it's a steel bracket designed and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.440 
it's a steel bracket designed and
certified<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.350> test<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.299> home

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
certified and test it just for your home

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.810 
certified and test it just for your home
and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.290> take<00:01:07.500> pipe<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.400> push<00:01:08.640> those

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and then we take pipe and we push those

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.539 
and then we take pipe and we push those
pipe<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.780> ground<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:11.040> push<00:01:11.250> them<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
pipe into the ground and we push them to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.840 
pipe into the ground and we push them to
a<00:01:11.580> refusal<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.229> point<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:14.369> period

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
a refusal and at that point we period

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.130 
a refusal and at that point we period
all<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> space<00:01:15.420> them<00:01:15.450> around<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> host

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
all you space them around the host

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.190 
all you space them around the host
that's<00:01:16.470> six<00:01:16.710> feet<00:01:16.920> apart<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.720> we<00:01:18.720> lift<00:01:18.990> your

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that's six feet apart and we lift your

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
that's six feet apart and we lift your
hosts<00:01:19.320> back<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.860> off<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.369> those<00:01:20.729> piers<00:01:21.150> that's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
hosts back up off of those piers that's

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.600 
hosts back up off of those piers that's
what<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.840> call<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> push<00:01:22.350> pier<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.400> host

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
what we call a push pier if the host

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.460 
what we call a push pier if the host
isn't<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.210> heavy<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.900> would<00:01:25.080> use<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
isn't that heavy we would use the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.130 
isn't that heavy we would use the
helical<00:01:25.920> pier<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> helical<00:01:27.689> pier<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
helical pier and what a helical pier is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.350 
helical pier and what a helical pier is
is<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.340> screw<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.060> we

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
is like kind of like a screw and we

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.090 
is like kind of like a screw and we
would<00:01:30.570> screw<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.900> helical<00:01:31.409> pier<00:01:31.650> into<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
would screw this helical pier into the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.390 
would screw this helical pier into the
ground<00:01:32.340> into<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:33.240> certain<00:01:33.750> torque<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
ground into a certain torque and the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.130 
ground into a certain torque and the
difference<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.420> one's<00:01:36.630> screwed<00:01:36.990> in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
difference is is this one's screwed in

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.530 
difference is is this one's screwed in
the<00:01:37.170> ground<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> we're<00:01:38.400> not<00:01:38.520> using<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.030> host

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the ground and we're not using the host

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.260 
the ground and we're not using the host
to<00:01:39.869> push<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.350> where<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> push<00:01:41.579> pier<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.090> use

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
to push it where is the push pier we use

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.609 
to push it where is the push pier we use
the<00:01:42.420> weight<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> host<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.110> push<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> pier

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the weight of the host to push the pier

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.270 
the weight of the host to push the pier
in<00:01:43.890> at<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.820> point<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.350> out<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.799> we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
in at that point we then go out and we

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.969 
in at that point we then go out and we
use<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> series<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.180> jacks<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.619> lift<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
use a series of jacks and we lift the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.149 
use a series of jacks and we lift the
host<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:51.149> level<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> host<00:01:51.810> off<00:01:51.990> perfectly<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
host to level the host off perfectly and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800 
host to level the host off perfectly and
which<00:01:53.340> will<00:01:53.460> bring<00:01:53.640> back<00:01:53.909> your<00:01:54.119> doors<00:01:54.360> bring

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
which will bring back your doors bring

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050 
which will bring back your doors bring
back<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.200> windows<00:01:55.560> put<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.310> square<00:01:56.759> the
