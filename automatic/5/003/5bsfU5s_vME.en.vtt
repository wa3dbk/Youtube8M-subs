00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
that caring might play affect a little

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.190 
that caring might play affect a little
bit<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:33.490> because<00:01:33.850> he<00:01:34.510> might<00:01:34.690> fumble<00:01:35.140> the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
bit just because he might fumble the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.899

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
ball a lot and his strength is a little

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.930 
ball a lot and his strength is a little
low<00:01:37.030> at<00:01:37.150> 64<00:01:37.960> but<00:01:38.740> still<00:01:39.130> those<00:01:39.400> stats<00:01:39.729> are

of the game right now the wide receiver
and<00:01:53.320> that's<00:01:53.470> Dez<00:01:53.710> Bryant<00:01:54.189> with<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.820> a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
and that's Dez Bryant with that a

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.250 
and that's Dez Bryant with that a
hundred<00:01:55.150> and<00:01:55.390> one<00:01:55.540> catch

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
hundred and one catch

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.359 
hundred and one catch
98<00:01:57.010> speed<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.810> let's<00:01:58.990> see<00:01:59.200> so<00:02:00.040> he<00:02:00.130> actually

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
98 speed but let's see so he actually

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.100 
98 speed but let's see so he actually
does<00:02:00.549> have<00:02:00.580> some<00:02:00.970> green<00:02:01.210> stats<00:02:01.510> compared<00:02:02.020> to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
does have some green stats compared to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.550 
does have some green stats compared to
Dez<00:02:02.290> Bryant<00:02:02.710> which<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.250> his<00:02:03.400> jump<00:02:03.729> agility

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
Dez Bryant which is his jump agility

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.780 
Dez Bryant which is his jump agility
awareness<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.650> actually<00:02:05.920> 99<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:06.610> that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
awareness is actually 99 so that

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.210 
awareness is actually 99 so that
actually<00:02:07.180> can<00:02:07.299> boost<00:02:07.570> up<00:02:07.810> your<00:02:07.960> overall<00:02:08.289> a

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
actually can boost up your overall a

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.490 
actually can boost up your overall a
little<00:02:09.729> higher<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.179> believe<00:02:10.420> Oh<00:02:10.569> awareness<00:02:11.379> is

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
little higher I believe Oh awareness is

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.830 
little higher I believe Oh awareness is
a<00:02:11.530> really<00:02:11.830> big<00:02:12.069> boost<00:02:12.610> therefore<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.180> overall

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
a really big boost therefore the overall

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.929 
a really big boost therefore the overall
at<00:02:14.439> see<00:02:15.420> ya<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:16.989> my<00:02:17.109> offense<00:02:17.529> is<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> 95<00:02:18.459> and

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
at see ya see so my offense is a 95 and

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.539 
at see ya see so my offense is a 95 and
I<00:02:19.450> think<00:02:19.749> if<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.989> put<00:02:20.230> Russell<00:02:20.709> Wilson<00:02:21.159> as<00:02:21.310> my

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
I think if I put Russell Wilson as my

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.690 
I think if I put Russell Wilson as my
quarterback

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
quarterback

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.530 
quarterback
wait<00:02:23.700> let's<00:02:23.940> see<00:02:24.030> what's<00:02:24.180> more<00:02:24.390> awareness

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.640 

okay<00:02:30.540> nevermind

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
okay nevermind

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.210 
okay nevermind
but<00:02:32.120> awareness<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.270> pretty<00:02:33.750> big<00:02:33.960> stat<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:35.010> do

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
but awareness is a pretty big stat to do

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.220 
but awareness is a pretty big stat to do

get the ultimate combo warrior I believe

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.630 
get the ultimate combo warrior I believe
they<00:03:12.990> already<00:03:13.140> got<00:03:13.350> him<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.040> console
