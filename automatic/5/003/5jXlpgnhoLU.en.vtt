00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
is kind of slow i don't really care for

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.529 
is kind of slow i don't really care for
too<00:00:21.990> much<00:00:22.170> for<00:00:22.590> some<00:00:22.619> reason<00:00:23.100> maybe<00:00:23.580> they<00:00:24.480> were

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
too much for some reason maybe they were

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.560 
too much for some reason maybe they were
camping<00:00:25.080> or<00:00:25.230> maybe<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> map<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.039> too<00:00:26.220> big<00:00:26.570> but

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
camping or maybe the map is too big but

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
camping or maybe the map is too big but
something<00:00:27.930> about<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.429> free-for-all<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
something about this free-for-all and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.279 
something about this free-for-all and
cracked<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.119> would<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.510> slow<00:00:30.750> pace<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
cracked it would just slow pace and I

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.830 
cracked it would just slow pace and I
didn't<00:00:31.560> really<00:00:31.590> care<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:33.090> my<00:00:33.360> options

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
couldn't do anything I guess it's like

couldn't do anything I guess it's like
the<00:01:05.220> black<00:01:05.549> screen<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> death<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.450> something

the black screen of death or something

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.109
