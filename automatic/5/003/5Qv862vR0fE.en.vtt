 garden centers animals makes a tip the newspaper is later than the German will 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.779

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.639
 meanwhile, a beer was up to work 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.539

 ramon phenomenon and the markopolos last time 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.649
 to look at our next rounds 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:43.019
 how far over a hundred is with a beer again 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 a bit pathetic so it is unclear what the player can figure out 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.519
 when i feel like golden goal 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.769
 And he also has to be nicer 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.239
 parking with those other guys just doesn't get more expensive 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.779

 that is exaggerated 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:06.769
 the greece 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:07.829

 We produce natural program professional 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.249
 but not to a special group 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.689
 he immediately made nice 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.109
 both are free when you go home 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.759
 in the following way 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.179
 the reason 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:27.320
 the wold plastics 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.589
 also not posted 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.399
 mdp a few bottles a major crisis 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.979
 more than sixteen in the team 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.899
 the fridge according to the decker didn't even have one 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:39.899
 become victims 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:44.329
 and i look foolishly already conquered in the plastic bottle wiljan flet i saw you 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.239

 everyone knows you can say a pat on and 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.389
 The city of Amsterdam is being evacuated in the neighborhood 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.469
 and then now it becomes plastic bag with the criticism 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.489
 who had champions league was atletico first we tried to escape and 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.419
 unions in the streets 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.419
 it is the example of essent according to the coordinator 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.189
 that by the polish that he wanted to stop for real 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.259
 he actually clapped his first meeting in the best price 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.270
 that has a chance 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.330
 so that 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.729

 there will defrost daily newspaper 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.930
 so that you are there against subsequent supporter 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.340
 if you had collected 30 percent of the volume 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.599
 that is about the youth here already a lot of strength from the original low point 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.680
 Cracker try the lock we try and toughest ride 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.159
 the feeling that you get when you stellegors on a brown beer for kids 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:02.189
 say that 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.620

 that it turns out to be the most expensive book 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.240
 it actually originated the black eyed peas 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.589
 and a little final 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.939

 limited to body dugs 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.839
 we are all rewarded with the same philosophy 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:01.879
 the most important is 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.529
