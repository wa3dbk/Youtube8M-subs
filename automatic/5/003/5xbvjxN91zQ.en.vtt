00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
got a lot of bass I figure to be wrapped

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.629

but<00:03:11.319> I<00:03:11.470> can<00:03:11.650> play<00:03:11.769> around<00:03:11.920> with<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.430> set

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
but I can play around with that and set

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.400 
but I can play around with that and set
up<00:03:12.790> what<00:03:12.819> each<00:03:13.090> color<00:03:13.359> would<00:03:13.630> do<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
up what each color would do the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.809 
up what each color would do the
microphones<00:03:14.859> pretty<00:03:15.160> cool<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.549> set<00:03:15.730> the

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
microphones pretty cool you can set the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.849 
microphones pretty cool you can set the
volume<00:03:15.970> here<00:03:16.540> or<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.109> can<00:03:17.260> change<00:03:17.440> what<00:03:17.739> it

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
volume here or you can change what it

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.770 
volume here or you can change what it
sounds<00:03:18.280> like<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.940> if<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.120> changed<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.690> hit

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
sounds like like if I changed and hit
