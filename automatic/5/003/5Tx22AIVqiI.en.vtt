 or avoid my friend when God hosts 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.520
 that approaches so that we see 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.370
 this little giant bright because it 's 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.500
 with engine 2.0 four minimum 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.640
 without changes 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.040
 first fifth and its respective reverse 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.040
 This car has an engine 51 points 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.870

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.820
 compatible in this vehicle we have 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.079
 only the packages 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.950

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:04.449
 package to cost 99 thousand closed the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:08.040

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.050
 side will you find friend friend 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.890
 who looks at us through the network goes to 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.130
 find a vehicle with this price 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.560
 117 thousand 500 pesos and it is a vehicle that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.960

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.610
 precious very I know very safe the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.930
 road I recommend it because I 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.590
 I have driven it on all roads 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.940
 of doctor 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.350
 pretty to be with us this vehicle 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.290
 of something that I like a lot 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.659
 its directional embedded precisely 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.180
 in each of the fenders 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.930
 front 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.600
 the wheels the wheels the central logo 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.880
 of chevrolet and the goods are made of steel 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.300
 but with chrome color 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.300
 what I like 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.649
 mirrors are folding 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.730
 let's open a shared vehicle 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:17.019
 this fixed-wing vehicle 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.019
 It has no functions 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.660
 manual elevators 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.239
 with the part 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.700
 the cider fixed and robust another thing that 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.580
 we bring here in this cart 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.640
 enough 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.320
 the seats the seats are folding 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.380
 let's see what it means they are 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.910
 folding that has this vehicle has 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.240
 a feature that is made as a 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.230
 a representative vehicle type ok we'll charge 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.230
 see let's see 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.550
 clearing we lift the seat 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.550
 and back 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.790
 but we are detecting 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.620
 we are making a vehicle as if 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.330
 outside a bed 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.049
 or cargo type this means that 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.000
 Can we upload other goods 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.390
 if we have a family composed of two 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.220
 younger children the children can go 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.380
 comfortably lying on the side of 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.800
 back without any problem 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.800
 okay 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.670
 something I like 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.170
 we expanded the casserole 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.700
 and I'm going to ask you for special attention 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.940
 that you see how 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.150
 you pass the camera and see how we're doing 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.230
 expand our vehicles friends of the 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.690
 net 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.580
 I recommend this vehicle 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.569
 many of juanita 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.290
 for me 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.290
 trick 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.790
 ah 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.540
 come to see our friends not 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.769
 deep that the trunk is made 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.530
 we close and we can take 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.250
 our family 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.250
 how 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.610
 the lighting 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.550
 is waiting for a clear point that this 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:25.009
 allows that in the mountain area where 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.490
 let's walk with the part of mexico to 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:30.490
 slow down let's have an illumination 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.490
 perfect 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.870
 of course the shade logo 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.310
 another thing that we learn 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.700
 ah 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.249
 quite broad position 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.129
 okay 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.779
 something that I like to say vehicles of 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.580
 reverse when we throw the vehicle out of 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:53.220
 reverse 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.670
 the lighting is activated and we are going to 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.160
 to be 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.370
 huge to be able to distinguish the 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.880
 vehicles that we have 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.880
 Y 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.979

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.819

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.750
