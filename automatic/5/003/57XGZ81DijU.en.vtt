00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
this game-mode existed actually

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.660 
this game-mode existed actually
yesterday<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.500> exact<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:29.400> because<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
yesterday to be exact just because a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.279 
yesterday to be exact just because a
friend<00:00:29.880> told<00:00:30.179> me<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.539> also<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.810> saw<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> video

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
but at first I thought it was kind of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.190 
but at first I thought it was kind of
like<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> troll<00:00:33.300> video<00:00:33.570> something<00:00:34.020> that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
like a troll video something that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.920 
like a troll video something that
someone<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.950> made<00:00:35.100> up<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.660> wasn't<00:00:36.660> really

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
someone just made up and wasn't really

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.810 
someone just made up and wasn't really
legit<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.860> then<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> my<00:00:38.250> friend<00:00:38.550> told<00:00:38.730> me

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
legit but then one of my friend told me

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
legit but then one of my friend told me
I<00:00:38.879> was<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.149> all<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.510> must<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.870> legit<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.379> I

on the rock like I am like I was I

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
on the rock like I am like I was I
should<00:00:48.420> say<00:00:49.010> basically<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.280> it's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
should say basically what it is it's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
should say basically what it is it's
sabotage<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.230> little<00:00:52.379> tweak<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
sabotage and the little tweak that it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
sabotage and the little tweak that it
has<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.059> classes<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:55.050> do

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
has is that the classes you can do

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.080 
has is that the classes you can do
custom<00:00:55.559> classes<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.280> already<00:00:56.430> has<00:00:56.640> classes

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
custom classes they already has classes

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.400 
custom classes they already has classes
made<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.510> use<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> pick<00:00:58.350> one

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
made for use and you have to pick one

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.279 
made for use and you have to pick one
out<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> five<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.510> there's<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:00.899> for

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
out of the five I think there's one for

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.740 
out of the five I think there's one for
each<00:01:01.500> um<00:01:01.770> type<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.309> weapon<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.719> for

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
each um type of weapon so one for

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.370 
each um type of weapon so one for
assault<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> sub<00:01:04.979> 1<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.330> shotgun<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
assault one for it sub 1 for shotgun and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.550 
assault one for it sub 1 for shotgun and
so<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> um<00:01:09.060> another<00:01:09.479> tweak<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.930> when<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so on so um another tweak is when you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
so on so um another tweak is when you
get<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> bomb<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> jug<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.700> s2<00:01:12.030> and

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
because run really fast like I said and

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.920 
because run really fast like I said and
you<00:03:20.580> have<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> melee<00:03:21.000> proficiency<00:03:21.750> which
