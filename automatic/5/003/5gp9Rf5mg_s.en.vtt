00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.789
 yes elder scrolls 4 oblivion 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.620
 2006 expected RPD continuation 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.219
 the legendary series with ten 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.990
 history 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.700
 a game that is from the first minute 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.610
 existence was doomed to 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.619
 close attention of the public and the press 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.989
 It was first shown on e3 2005 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.599
 hour gameplay demonstration plunged into 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.149
 shock of many dts delivered works clearly 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.829
 showed how far the genre can step 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.379
 we have already shared with you first 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.770
 impressions from the game and as promised 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.440
 a month later exploring the world oblivion 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.360
 return with the final verdict of the entrance 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.190
 we can say that many of our hopes 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.020
 oblivion didn't justify any of 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.510
 previous games in the series could not do without 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.060
 deficiencies but they all became true 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.430
 classics and we have no doubt that this 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.810
 fate awaits oblivion game 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.270
 really turned out very 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.190
 high quality and generally good here 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.500
 all that was morrowind extensive 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.049
 the game world is a huge set of skill weapons 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.360
 spell of opportunity but it is and 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.969
 main lack of oblivion in it 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.069
 too little new gaming 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.289
 the industry did not know the arena daggerfall them 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.810
 equal then the fourth part could be 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.240
 quite to call the best rpg in history but 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.189
 these games were and bethesda instead 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.509
 to offer something new has played 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.159
 we still have the same song 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.920
 it is generally peculiar to many 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.689
 old school developers and no way 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.880
 may understand that the sequel must be 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.759
 new game and not the same eggs in the new 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.310
 coloring so advertised radian then 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.319
 and turned out to be an empty shell is not 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.840
 game characters really walk and 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.359
 communicate with each other but that's all for what 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.369
 they are capable of no living world 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.289
 similarities which we were shown find 3 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.319
 there is no trace of eavesdropping 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.569
 possible but no sense so you can get 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.700
 just a few unique bumps 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.529
 overwhelmingly residents 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.289
 just repeat too what you could 

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:00.670
 ask them directly 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.349
 the storyline is painfully classic and 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.079
 not at all interesting just a bunch 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.179
 stamps and nothing original however 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.670
 the storyline in the games of the series never 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.670
 was the main thing was the gameplay and 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.680
 here oblivion also has problems like 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.230
 and before the development of the player occurs on 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.299
 the principle of what we do but we get something 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.220
 there is if the player diligently cuts monsters 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.799
 his sword increases his skill 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.629
 possession of this particular weapon if it 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.640
 trades communicates with characters then 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.860
 its socials grow accordingly 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.730
 skills and here the developers are strongly 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.400
 miscalculated 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.770
 together with the development of the player automatically 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.210
 level up gets and surrounding you 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.010
 straight problem because 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.470
 talk to trade they do not know how 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.750
 what if you get carried away with chatter 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.380
 it is to go out into the forest immediately move to the full 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.460
 the program 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.750
 the game will just have to start over 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.000
 but otherwise everything before us is that 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.310
 same Muravin with all his undeniable 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.710
 merits here there is always a choice 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.830
 what to do in order to be and where to go 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.750
 before the player a huge world is the main 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.880
 quest about which you can safely forget and 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.370
 go to solve family problems simple 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.740
 residents in almost any city have 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.630
 branch of a guild where you with 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.760
 happy to meet on warms and give 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.310
 work can go to another 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.130
 measure beat home villains or 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.410
 go hunting in the forest in the world can 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.670
 be anyone look like anything and 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.260
 do what you like the most 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.300
 oblivion looks even better than its 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.770
 ant's time is the magnificence to 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.740
 Unfortunately it requires a very good 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.510
 the video card is new and dear glad and on 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.570
 upgrade average cars will manage where 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.610
 more expensive from box 360 breeding edition 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.530
 the oblivion is still the same with the graphics 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.440
 thoroughly ditched regarding 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.900
 Demonstrations on e3 particular disabled 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.940
 soft shadows and and some effects essays 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.070
 versions of the still funny way stretched 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.990
 up and down immediately visible to the tests 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.910
 Sharpened all under widescreen screens 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.209
 and did not bother with 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.580
 standard manicure proportions but 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.340
 in general, as we said oblivion 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.350
 choirs is a very high quality game and in 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.010
 smaller moments it is much better 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.650
 Muravin 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.750
 however dramatically 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.569
 axis is absolutely nothing and absolutely 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.670
 The game is far from the promise of developers by 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.799
 great oblivion great picture 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.620
 music time-tested decisions and 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.209
 absolute emptiness inside the word 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.310
 quality but one hundred percent 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.830
 commercial products the next part 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.830
 words already about a year in development
