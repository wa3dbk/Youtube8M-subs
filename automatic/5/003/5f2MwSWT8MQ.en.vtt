it<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> garage<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.970> think<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.450> didn't

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it in the garage I do think I didn't

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.820 
it in the garage I do think I didn't
notice<00:01:12.720> one<00:01:12.990> thing<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> front<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
notice one thing that the front of the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
notice one thing that the front of the
car<00:01:14.040> gets<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.430> lot<00:01:14.640> lower<00:01:14.880> than<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> back<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
car gets a lot lower than the back of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.969 
car gets a lot lower than the back of
the<00:01:15.570> car<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.990> gives<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.290> nice<00:01:16.439> dragster

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the car so it gives in a nice dragster

the car so it gives in a nice dragster
look<00:01:17.189> which<00:01:17.369> i<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> really<00:01:17.970> cool<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.390> went

anyone with this car in their garage I'm

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.349 
anyone with this car in their garage I'm
really<00:03:03.079> surprised<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:05.000> know<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.120> think

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
really surprised and you know I think

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.550 
really surprised and you know I think
it's<00:03:05.480> actually<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.780> pretty<00:03:05.810> good-looking<00:03:06.140> car

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
it's actually a pretty good-looking car

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.990 
it's actually a pretty good-looking car
I<00:03:06.590> although<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:06.950> haven't<00:03:07.250> never<00:03:07.519> bought<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.910> in

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
I although I haven't never bought it in

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.910 
I although I haven't never bought it in
your<00:03:08.150> ndd<00:03:08.569> outline<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.260> can't<00:03:09.590> really<00:03:09.650> give

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
your ndd outline so can't really give

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.349 
your ndd outline so can't really give
you<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:10.400> I<00:03:10.670> think<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.180> looks<00:03:11.209> pretty

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
you that but I think it looks pretty

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.690 
you that but I think it looks pretty
cool<00:03:11.569> so<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.959> number<00:03:12.170> one<00:03:12.319> spot<00:03:12.459> goes<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.489> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
cool so the number one spot goes to the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.250 
cool so the number one spot goes to the
benefactor<00:03:14.209> Siriano<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.599> went<00:03:14.870> with<00:03:14.959> a<00:03:14.989> matte

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
benefactor Siriano I went with a matte

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.740 
benefactor Siriano I went with a matte
black<00:03:15.470> pearlescent<00:03:15.859> um<00:03:16.250> with<00:03:17.239> apple<00:03:17.480> s<00:03:17.599> in

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
black pearlescent um with apple s in

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.150 
black pearlescent um with apple s in
yellow<00:03:18.109> so<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.410> looks<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.709> nice<00:03:18.859> gold

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
yellow so it looks like a nice gold

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.740 
yellow so it looks like a nice gold
finish<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.669> it<00:03:19.700> with<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> matte<00:03:20.180> finish<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
finish to it with a matte finish on the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.569 
finish to it with a matte finish on the
side<00:03:20.930> black<00:03:21.739> wheels<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.310> think<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.549> just

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
side black wheels and I think it just

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.830 
side black wheels and I think it just
came<00:03:22.760> out<00:03:22.910> really<00:03:23.090> really<00:03:23.209> nice<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
came out really really nice so the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.599 
came out really really nice so the
number<00:03:24.079> one<00:03:24.230> spot<00:03:24.349> goes<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.010> benefactors

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
number one spot goes to the benefactors

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.610 
number one spot goes to the benefactors
