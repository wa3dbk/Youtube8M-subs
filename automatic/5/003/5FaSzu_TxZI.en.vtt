00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.580 

now<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.370> grabbed<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:02.090> thermometer<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.380> we're

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
now I grabbed a thermometer and we're

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.070 
now I grabbed a thermometer and we're
gonna<00:05:04.010> check<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.520> internal<00:05:04.820> temperature<00:05:05.080> and

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
gonna check the internal temperature and

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.950 
gonna check the internal temperature and
for<00:05:06.770> pork<00:05:07.100> it<00:05:07.400> needs<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:07.880> be<00:05:08.000> at<00:05:08.090> 160<00:05:08.780> and

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
for pork it needs to be at 160 and

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:41.800 
for pork it needs to be at 160 and
that's<00:05:09.830> that<00:05:10.100> right<00:05:10.220> now

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.589 

so<00:05:42.810> we<00:05:43.229> are<00:05:43.409> hitting<00:05:43.889> 160<00:05:44.639> right<00:05:44.849> now<00:05:45.030> so<00:05:45.449> it

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
so we are hitting 160 right now so it

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.260 
so we are hitting 160 right now so it
looks<00:05:45.629> like<00:05:46.159> since<00:05:47.159> these<00:05:47.370> individual<00:05:48.090> pieces

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
looks like since these individual pieces

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.529 
looks like since these individual pieces
must<00:05:48.840> have<00:05:48.990> been<00:05:49.139> smaller<00:05:49.949> than<00:05:50.099> a<00:05:50.699> couple

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
must have been smaller than a couple

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.990 
must have been smaller than a couple
pounds<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.900> piece<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:53.250> since<00:05:53.669> we've<00:05:53.819> been

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
pounds of piece so since we've been

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.089 
pounds of piece so since we've been
smoking<00:05:54.479> for<00:05:54.750> about<00:05:54.870> five<00:05:55.590> and<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.800> half<00:05:55.860> hours

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
smoking for about five and a half hours

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.339 
smoking for about five and a half hours
I'm<00:05:57.000> just<00:05:57.240> going<00:05:57.360> to<00:05:57.419> give<00:05:57.569> it<00:05:57.690> about<00:05:57.780> 20<00:05:58.229> more

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
I'm just going to give it about 20 more

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.100 
I'm just going to give it about 20 more
minutes<00:05:58.590> just<00:05:58.979> to<00:05:59.789> make<00:05:59.909> sure<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.360> these

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
minutes just to make sure that these

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.339 
minutes just to make sure that these
things<00:06:01.169> are<00:06:01.590> done<00:06:01.770> and<00:06:02.550> then<00:06:03.449> we'll<00:06:03.690> take<00:06:04.199> them

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
out of the smoker and laid it on a

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.120 
out of the smoker and laid it on a
cutting<00:06:09.810> board<00:06:10.050> and<00:06:10.530> we're<00:06:10.740> going<00:06:10.889> to<00:06:10.919> start

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
cutting board and we're going to start

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.760 
cutting board and we're going to start
shredding<00:06:11.370> it<00:06:11.610> it<00:06:12.599> was<00:06:12.780> in<00:06:13.020> the<00:06:13.229> smoker<00:06:13.620> for

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
shredding it it was in the smoker for

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.930 
shredding it it was in the smoker for
about<00:06:14.150> I'd<00:06:15.150> say<00:06:15.180> about<00:06:15.360> nine<00:06:15.750> hours<00:06:16.229> and<00:06:16.940> not

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
about I'd say about nine hours and not

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.620 
about I'd say about nine hours and not
quite<00:06:18.180> evolved<00:06:18.599> these<00:06:18.870> are<00:06:19.020> smaller<00:06:19.319> pieces

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
quite evolved these are smaller pieces

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
quite evolved these are smaller pieces
so<00:06:21.630> here<00:06:21.960> we<00:06:22.020> are<00:06:22.050> don't<00:06:22.229> start<00:06:22.500> shredding

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
so here we are don't start shredding

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:29.149 
so here we are don't start shredding
