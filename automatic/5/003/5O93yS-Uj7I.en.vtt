ljubim post any questions for me to
answer<00:00:09.570> on<00:00:09.870> facebook<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.679> I've<00:00:10.769> got<00:00:10.920> one<00:00:11.040> here

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
answer on facebook and I've got one here

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.490 
answer on facebook and I've got one here
from<00:00:11.370> Darren<00:00:11.700> riddle<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.179> he<00:00:12.509> asked<00:00:12.809> me<00:00:12.929> do

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
from Darren riddle and he asked me do

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.930 
from Darren riddle and he asked me do
you<00:00:13.530> are<00:00:13.650> not<00:00:13.769> getting<00:00:14.009> bites<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
you are not getting bites what be the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.330 
you are not getting bites what be the
first<00:00:15.179> thing<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.509> would<00:00:15.599> change<00:00:15.660> rig<00:00:16.590> bait<00:00:17.039> or

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
first thing you would change rig bait or

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849 
first thing you would change rig bait or
location<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.270> why<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> very<00:00:19.770> good

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
location and why it's a very good

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.590 
location and why it's a very good
question<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.609> that's<00:00:20.760> quite<00:00:21.210> tricky<00:00:21.480> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
question one that's quite tricky to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.240 
question one that's quite tricky to
answer<00:00:22.020> as<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> saw<00:00:22.500> many<00:00:22.740> different

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
answer as I saw many different

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.240 
answer as I saw many different
situations<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.480> scenarios<00:00:24.859> it<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> first

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
situations and scenarios it the first

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
situations and scenarios it the first
thing<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.550> need<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> assess<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.750> whether

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
thing you need to assess is whether

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
thing you need to assess is whether
there<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.289> actually<00:00:28.710> fish<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.340> front<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
there are actually fish in front you it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.240 
there are actually fish in front you it
might<00:00:30.359> sound<00:00:30.599> obvious<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:31.890> if

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
might sound obvious put there we go if

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.220 
might sound obvious put there we go if
there<00:00:32.850> aren't<00:00:33.030> fish<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.660> front<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:33.989> there<00:00:34.170> are

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
there aren't fish in front if there are

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.510 
there aren't fish in front if there are
no<00:00:34.410> signs<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.160> fish<00:00:35.370> no<00:00:36.360> activity<00:00:36.809> then<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.920> move

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
no signs of fish no activity then a move

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.619 
no signs of fish no activity then a move
will<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.790> an<00:00:38.969> odd<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.450> will<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
will be an odd and that will be the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.369 
will be an odd and that will be the
first<00:00:39.989> thing<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:42.079> whether<00:00:43.079> if<00:00:43.230> there

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
first thing I would do whether if there

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
first thing I would do whether if there
are<00:00:43.500> fish<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.100> front<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.489> using<00:00:44.820> baits

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
are fish in front you and using baits

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
are fish in front you and using baits
and<00:00:45.450> rigs<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.710> caught<00:00:47.070> your<00:00:47.190> fish<00:00:47.399> time<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and rigs have caught your fish time and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600 
and rigs have caught your fish time and
time<00:00:48.270> again<00:00:48.300> ones<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> are<00:00:49.610> confident

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
time again ones which you are confident

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150 
time again ones which you are confident
in<00:00:50.730> using<00:00:51.079> then<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:52.860> obviously

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
in using then there are obviously

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.430 
in using then there are obviously
changes<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.879> need<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.210> done<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
changes that need to be done what it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.170 
changes that need to be done what it
could<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> fish<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.910> aren't

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
could be is just at the fish just aren't

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.840 
could be is just at the fish just aren't
feeding<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.870> may<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.079> suspended<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.010> the

case<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.030> pull<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.449> Fisher<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.589> zig<00:01:04.830> rig

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
case I pull you up to Fisher a zig rig

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.820 
case I pull you up to Fisher a zig rig
on<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> light<00:01:05.400> line<00:01:05.670> perhaps<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.299> use<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.830> small

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
on a light line perhaps just use a small

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.620 
on a light line perhaps just use a small
piece<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.159> cut<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:08.610> form<00:01:08.939> or<00:01:09.180> perhaps<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
piece of cut down form or perhaps a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
piece of cut down form or perhaps a
whittled<00:01:10.110> down<00:01:10.140> bit<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> pop<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.220> boilie<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
whittled down bit of pop up boilie and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.800 
whittled down bit of pop up boilie and
that<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> good<00:01:12.869> tactical<00:01:13.380> move<00:01:13.650> I

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
that will be a good tactical move I

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.090 
that will be a good tactical move I
guess<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> next<00:01:16.049> situation<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
guess the next situation we have is a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
guess the next situation we have is a
swim<00:01:17.400> where<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> fish<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.090> visibly<00:01:18.720> feeding

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
swim where the fish are visibly feeding

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.770 
swim where the fish are visibly feeding
this<00:01:19.890> fish<00:01:20.159> perhaps<00:01:20.490> bubbling<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.119> rolling

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
this fish perhaps bubbling up rolling

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.410 
this fish perhaps bubbling up rolling
head<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> shoulder<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.759> but<00:01:23.759> no<00:01:23.939> takes<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
head and shoulder in but no takes a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.240 
head and shoulder in but no takes a
forthcoming<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.770> could<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.130> them

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
forthcoming and it could be in them

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
forthcoming and it could be in them
situations<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> Fisher<00:01:27.509> perhaps

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
situations at the Fisher perhaps

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.399 
situations at the Fisher perhaps
preoccupied<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> natural<00:01:29.520> food<00:01:29.790> source<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
preoccupied on a natural food source and

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.380 
preoccupied on a natural food source and
it's<00:01:31.409> only<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.400> maybe<00:01:33.090> think

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it's only really then there maybe think

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410 
it's only really then there maybe think
about<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.659> change<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.380> bait<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.340> perhaps<00:01:36.060> bring

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
about a change of bait and perhaps bring

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
about a change of bait and perhaps bring
maggots<00:01:37.229> into<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> equation<00:01:38.100> something

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
maggots into the equation something

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.050 
maggots into the equation something
which<00:01:39.210> goes<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.409> some<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> replicate<00:01:41.880> what

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
which goes to some way to replicate what

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.210 
which goes to some way to replicate what
there<00:01:42.180> may<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.329> naturally<00:01:42.990> finding<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.829> there

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
there may be naturally finding out there

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.460 
there may be naturally finding out there
in<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> swim<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> tactic<00:01:46.380> of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
in the swim and that's the tactic of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.109 
in the swim and that's the tactic of
views<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.860> many<00:01:47.100> occasions<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.909> has

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
views on many occasions and it has

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.340 
views on many occasions and it has
provoked<00:01:48.750> often<00:01:49.290> quite<00:01:49.770> quick<00:01:50.130> results<00:01:51.350> so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
provoked often quite quick results so

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
provoked often quite quick results so
there<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.220> hope<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.759> gone<00:01:53.939> somebody<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there you go hope it's gone somebody to
