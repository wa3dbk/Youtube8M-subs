00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.349
 hi all guys here is giuseppe 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.450
 welcome to this new video by 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.950
 assassin's creed 4 black flag we're up 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.199
 cry of freedom and boys today 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.000
 we will find two particular things 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 in fact it also shows a little bit 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 what we will look for now of course 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.000
 you have read it from the title but I show it to you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.400
 the same will try the thrust or 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
 better this here the rifle of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.060
 precision is achieved precisely by exploring 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.940
 the Caribbean Sea now I show you the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.579
 position of this rifle and then 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
 a new machete or the machete in 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.270
 iron also in this case is written 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.590
 that needs to be explored but of the Caribbean but 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.899
 you will also have the position in this case 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.809
 regarding the positions on the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.820
 map sail show the first one moment 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.010
 object is more or less in this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
 area here you see at this point then 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 the coordinates are roughly these 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.180
 they are not precise because they are willing 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.710
 a little bit and change you see anyway 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.469
 the area is this then I would say of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 get as close as possible or 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.150
 maybe we are from justin i know yes 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.760
 so let's leave the rudder there at the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.560
 ok leave the helm just fine there 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.049
 we throw down there as mind says 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920
 in the haunt of the maroons 1 and secret coffers 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.030
 1 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.900
 so let's go see a little bit 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.369
 specifically in this area what is there 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.619
 let's see a little now I don't remember exactly 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.650
 to the position but maybe looking 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.720
 together we can find it ok, I think 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.369
 to be pretty close let's see some 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.710
 yes, as you see on the map is 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.229
 something special appeared 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.500
 now I show you at least specifically 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.000
 here is the precise position so the most 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.450
 precise will not complain 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.970
 coordinates are 297 191 here there is note 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.829
 the machete is a little deprived of something there 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 we take them 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.320
 I don't know what there is but a guy who is 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.420
 dead perhaps they are all friends here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 who died interact this 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.909
 hell machete a Russian weapon but 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.860
 reliable 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.250
 I certainly think it's a better weapon 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.020
 compared to the one we had before 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.129
 or maybe not absolutely no idea 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.149
 maybe someone writes it to me in 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.009
 comments 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.430
 as you can see then it is not aesthetically 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.829
 for 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.569
 the evil obviously there is one that still 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.120
 better it is to believe that the Maya 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.069
 I'll show you in a future video now 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 guys we are also looking for spingarda vi 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.959
 I also show the position in this case 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.239
 let's see a little bit really 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.180
 rather far away so I guess it will have to 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.019
 making cuts is found here at the bay of 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.340
 cumbre land coordinates 176 374 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.870
 obviously they are not precise because 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.329
 precisely these coordinates indicate not 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.829
 simply the map area then 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.349
 gods to move us directly here 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.049
 making the trip fast we are there 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.159
 obviously teleported here 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.470
 automatically there are quite a few 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.209
 enemies in this day area of ​​this 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.760
 area so I recommend a little bit 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.500
 to be careful in the meantime maybe 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.139
 we eliminate these types in such a way 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.450
 to show you how it is done 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.090
 this machete and the power of the machete 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.829
 same if I am not mistaken, it seems to me of 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.669
 having seen that it is a certain one in rather 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:12.299
 fast then it is obviously eco 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:14.790
 takes an accepted face in the face breaks 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.040
 defense you see a machete I think rather 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.810
 versatile 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.400
 obviously it takes maybe some 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.849
 extra shot to eliminate all the 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.250
 enemies 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.109
 however I still believe despite what 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.060
 be a good machete now direct 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.560
 directly in the particular area 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.000
 open wait we eliminate these first 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.810
 two 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.069
 ok done out and this is the second 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.400
 very well then we go to research 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.569
 spingarde the best of rifle 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.379
 we see a little bit will be found in 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.379
 this area 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.079
 maybe yes maybe no I don't know there it is 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.750
 as you can see it appeared on the map for 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.269
 a place specifically for a while 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.659
 this is the push area 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.000
 coordinated and 175 376 so really 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.349
 very close to which there are a lot of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.479
 enemies so I guess we need to first 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.909
 eliminating them just to get it is the 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.109
 take one out and two fill one hundred 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.579
 I don't know if you bring them out 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.599
 the ea to the ok well eliminated subtype 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.439
 this other creed will need 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.629
 france to give a rope eliminated bam 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.159
 ok stay here on the ground then finally 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.790
 we can also get a new one 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.200
 spingarda interact brocci you are ok 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.490
 even this precision 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.220
 version of the spi nordi was created 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.790
 keeping in mind precision and scope of 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.520
 shooting maybe even if we use it for a moment 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.190
 Don't wait, I'm confused 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.780
 it seems ok the hold let's see 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.280
 out something or not is a poor thing 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.870
 butterfly so small no though 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.190
 really not bad looking at it really is 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.260
 fortissimo 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.000
 obviously all government that pigeons 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.760
 I did n't see what they were flew away 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.080
 when really not bad guys 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.280
 video ends here i know it was 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 quite short but it was a simple one 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.240
 guide to show you where you are 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.940
 they found these two weapons now we miss them 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.380
 to find the machete maya and then also 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.820
 another push so if you want 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.800
 see the location of these too 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.900
 let me know other two weapons in the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.180
 comments and then I will try in the next 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.440
 days of making a video so I hope 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.060

 those guys have already been written to is 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.140
 delighted with his new weapons vi 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.140

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.770
