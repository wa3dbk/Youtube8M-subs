00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.810
 it looks to have interested it 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.789
 follow up then course of study and achievements 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.190
 he could rub shoulders with students and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.330
 work with them on 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.830
 manipulations that had been put in place 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.960
 I took a little bit of time to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.720
 chat with him and gold if you're a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.609
 little bit the work sequence 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920
 in which he participated in the context 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.510
 overall course what overall 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.999
 students work on the semester 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.329
 complete on a six-legged robot 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:42.929
 walkers and this week we 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.149
 was working on the motor part which 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.039
 allows to move the legs of the robot 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.940
 what is interesting is that it is 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.429
 found in situation 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.679
 he sees how the other students 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.959
 react they can argue with them 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:59.100
 about what they have about what they live 

00:00:54.959 --> 00:01:01.859
 from day to day and he sees concrete 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.210
 what then today I was going 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.530
 of 16th century literature teeth of the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.950
 side of letters and 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.400
 and it was talking about mountain trials of 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.680
 montaigne 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.950
 I chose relief because I would be 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.500
 interested in a college of letters and 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.180
 so I wanted to see I wanted to have a 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.560
 preview of what it could give 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.780
 there really was a lot 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.450
 information we found a lot of 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.170
 things you could see in 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.899
 philosophy and in French in 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.430
 literature and it was really 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.740
 interesting from this point of view there I 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.110
 followed a course in psychology 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.330
 development have been talking about 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.970
 childhood to the theory of mind it was 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.270
 compared to young children and their 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.880
 ability to restore memories etc 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.500
 I found it very interesting and very 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.229
 constructive also I chose the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.970
 psychology because next year 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.170
 I want to do this course and because that 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.659
 I'm interested in anyway so you got me 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.119
 surprise taking our hunger it was 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.550
 well done it scared me a little 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.160
 because I was afraid that 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.940
 that the professor finally advance to any 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.430
 speed in what they said that 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.560
 there is no time to note 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.810
 that's relatively relatively 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.640
 well done finally with the slideshow 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.060
 especially knew not bad the hardest 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.230
 it was finally it was precisely the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.040
 amount of information finally I believe 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.040
 that there are many explanations 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.040
 there is nothing that seems insurmountable to me
