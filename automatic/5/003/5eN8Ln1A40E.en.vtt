this before and a few other guys and I

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.480 
this before and a few other guys and I
wanted<00:00:16.570> to<00:00:16.630> kind<00:00:16.840> of<00:00:16.930> capture<00:00:17.590> actually<00:00:18.070> more

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
wanted to kind of capture actually more

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.790 
wanted to kind of capture actually more
probably<00:00:19.330> for<00:00:19.600> me<00:00:19.750> than<00:00:19.960> for<00:00:19.990> you<00:00:20.470> guys<00:00:20.650> I

probably for me than for you guys I
wanted<00:00:21.010> to<00:00:21.100> get<00:00:21.190> this<00:00:21.370> down<00:00:21.580> so<00:00:21.910> I<00:00:22.150> figured<00:00:22.720> I'd

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
wanted to get this down so I figured I'd

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.670 
wanted to get this down so I figured I'd
try<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.540> go<00:00:25.540> through<00:00:25.780> it<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.140> then<00:00:26.290> and<00:00:26.560> then

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
try to go through it and then and then

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.130 
try to go through it and then and then
you<00:00:27.370> guys<00:00:27.520> can<00:00:27.820> take<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:28.270> peek<00:00:28.510> on<00:00:28.660> it<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:29.050> I

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
you guys can take a peek on it and I

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.300 
you guys can take a peek on it and I
think<00:00:29.230> it'll<00:00:29.410> work<00:00:29.500> well<00:00:29.800> with<00:00:29.980> all<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.280> other

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
think it'll work well with all the other

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.000 
think it'll work well with all the other
little<00:00:30.910> sick<00:00:31.150> stroke<00:00:31.390> roll<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.110> triplet

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
little sick stroke roll and the triplet

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.990 
little sick stroke roll and the triplet
variation<00:00:33.550> of<00:00:33.640> stuff<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.890> you've<00:00:36.579> got<00:00:36.760> going

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
variation of stuff that you've got going

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.350 
variation of stuff that you've got going
on<00:00:37.240> so<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.860> it's<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:39.790> good<00:00:39.910> version<00:00:40.090> of<00:00:40.270> a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
on so it's it's a good version of a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.060 
on so it's it's a good version of a
6-row<00:00:40.780> we<00:00:41.079> just<00:00:41.200> add<00:00:41.380> a<00:00:41.410> couple<00:00:41.590> more<00:00:41.770> notes

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
6-row we just add a couple more notes

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.819 
6-row we just add a couple more notes
the<00:00:42.340> first<00:00:42.579> seven<00:00:43.060> notes<00:00:43.329> are<00:00:43.829> basically

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
the first seven notes are basically

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.340 
the first seven notes are basically
taking<00:00:45.220> take<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.460> show<00:00:45.940> i<00:00:46.120> six<00:00:46.870> stroke<00:00:47.110> roll

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
taking take a show i six stroke roll

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.319 
taking take a show i six stroke roll
we're<00:00:48.010> going<00:00:48.130> to<00:00:48.190> add<00:00:48.280> one<00:00:48.550> more<00:00:48.760> left<00:00:49.030> at<00:00:49.239> the

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
we're going to add one more left at the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:01:02.819 
we're going to add one more left at the
end<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:49.899> it's<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.899> only<00:01:02.020> accent<00:01:02.590> is<00:01:02.710> the

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
end so it's the only accent is the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.620 
end so it's the only accent is the
single<00:01:03.190> stroke<00:01:03.370> here<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:06.479> we're<00:01:07.479> going<00:01:07.570> to

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
single stroke here now we're going to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.649 
single stroke here now we're going to
add<00:01:07.810> two<00:01:08.080> more<00:01:08.110> notes<00:01:08.530> which<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.490> after<00:01:09.760> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.030 

accent<00:01:17.280> single<00:01:18.280> stroke<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:18.820> it's<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:23.770> the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
accent single stroke so it's that's the

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.859 
accent single stroke so it's that's the
night<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.369> then<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.760> then<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:24.970> repeats<00:01:25.119> goes

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
night and then and then it repeats goes

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.260 
night and then and then it repeats goes
right<00:01:26.080> back<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.070> downbeat<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:28.090> if

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
right back to the to the downbeat so if

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:39.810 
right back to the to the downbeat so if
I<00:01:28.360> loop<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.049> goes

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.280 

one<00:01:40.820> two<00:01:40.970> three<00:01:41.180> four<00:01:41.450> five<00:01:41.690> six<00:01:41.869> seven<00:01:42.229> eight

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.960 
one two three four five six seven eight
nine<00:01:42.440> one<00:01:42.740> two<00:01:42.770> three<00:01:43.100> four<00:01:43.369> five<00:01:43.580> six<00:01:43.760> seven

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
nine one two three four five six seven

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.969 
nine one two three four five six seven
eight<00:01:44.180> nine<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.510> you<00:01:44.600> can<00:01:44.750> play<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.110> over<00:01:45.290> a

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
eight nine so you can play it over a

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.560 
eight nine so you can play it over a
three<00:01:46.280> beat<00:01:46.430> phrase<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.119> obviously<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.450> can

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
three beat phrase and obviously you can

00:01:47.570 --> 00:02:01.540 
three beat phrase and obviously you can
play<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:47.869> four<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.409> just<00:01:48.470> loop<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:49.009> so<00:02:00.550> break

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
play in four and just loop it so break

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.440 
play in four and just loop it so break
it<00:02:01.670> up<00:02:01.729> just<00:02:01.940> play<00:02:02.180> one<00:02:02.440> one<00:02:03.790> round<00:02:04.790> of<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.210> and

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
it up just play one one round of it and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:26.680 
it up just play one one round of it and
then<00:02:05.570> take<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.780> take<00:02:06.440> a<00:02:06.470> beat<00:02:06.710> off<00:02:25.690> everything

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
then take it take a beat off everything

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.910 
then take it take a beat off everything
that<00:02:26.810> you've<00:02:26.989> done<00:02:27.019> with<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.410> six<00:02:27.680> stroke

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
that you've done with the six stroke

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.330 
that you've done with the six stroke
roll<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.880> triplet<00:02:29.330> version<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:30.050> we

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
roll the triplet version that we

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.130 
roll the triplet version that we
discussed<00:02:31.340> before<00:02:31.489> try<00:02:32.300> adding<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:33.019> it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
discussed before try adding that in it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.410 
discussed before try adding that in it
gives<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.410> little<00:02:33.620> extra<00:02:33.739> thing<00:02:34.100> as<00:02:35.000> always

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
gives you a little extra thing as always

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.020 
gives you a little extra thing as always
I'm<00:02:35.540> looking<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.110> take<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.920> little<00:02:37.250> idea<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:38.000> I

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
I'm looking to take a little idea that I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.460 
I'm looking to take a little idea that I
know<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.299> my<00:02:38.480> hands<00:02:38.810> are<00:02:38.959> comfortable<00:02:39.350> with

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
know that my hands are comfortable with

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.380 
know that my hands are comfortable with
trying<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.010> find<00:02:40.190> other<00:02:40.459> ways<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.700> use<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.239> so

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
trying to find other ways to use it so

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.600 
trying to find other ways to use it so
I'd<00:02:41.810> slow<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.290> down

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
I'd slow it down

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.860 
I'd slow it down
voice<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.790> around<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.120> kid<00:02:44.329> as<00:02:44.420> much<00:02:44.450> as<00:02:44.750> you

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
voice it around the kid as much as you

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.910 
voice it around the kid as much as you
can

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920
