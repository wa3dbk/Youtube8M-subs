00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
skating in any City and today was no

00:06:51.550 --> 00:07:14.879 
skating in any City and today was no
exception

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.850 

I

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:25.939 

I<00:07:20.840> see<00:07:21.840> like<00:07:23.479> it's<00:07:24.479> a<00:07:24.599> camera<00:07:24.930> a<00:07:25.050> plenum<00:07:25.469> is<00:07:25.650> it

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:25.949 
I see like it's a camera a plenum is it

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.070 
I see like it's a camera a plenum is it
full<00:07:26.189> of<00:07:26.460> molecules<00:07:27.090> there's<00:07:27.389> an<00:07:27.629> empty<00:07:27.930> space

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 
full of molecules there's an empty space

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.250 
full of molecules there's an empty space
and<00:07:28.560> there

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.060 

the<00:07:33.260> world<00:07:33.530> is<00:07:33.740> a<00:07:33.770> plumber<00:07:34.070> right

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
the world is a plumber right

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.220 
the world is a plumber right
even<00:07:36.700> though<00:07:36.820> there's<00:07:37.060> seems<00:07:37.780> to<00:07:37.960> be<00:07:38.050> empty

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.230 
even though there's seems to be empty

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.040 
even though there's seems to be empty
space<00:07:38.680> there's<00:07:39.040> molecules<00:07:39.580> of<00:07:39.790> there<00:07:40.060> there's

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.050 
space there's molecules of there there's

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.040 
space there's molecules of there there's
no<00:07:41.230> vacuum<00:07:42.210> so<00:07:43.210> I<00:07:43.240> guess<00:07:43.450> of<00:07:43.600> course<00:07:43.840> the

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.050 
no vacuum so I guess of course the

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.200 
no vacuum so I guess of course the
camera<00:07:44.380> is<00:07:44.470> a<00:07:44.500> plenum<00:07:44.920> but

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.210 
camera is a plenum but

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.449 
camera is a plenum but
it's<00:07:46.630> their<00:07:46.810> cavity<00:07:48.150> for<00:07:49.150> a<00:07:49.180> cigarette
