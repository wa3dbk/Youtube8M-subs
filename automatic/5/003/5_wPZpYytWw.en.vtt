00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
which is using a little bit of olive oil

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.910 
which is using a little bit of olive oil
on<00:00:28.769> my<00:00:29.010> skin<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.109> prefer<00:00:31.500> using<00:00:31.740> the

on my skin this is I prefer using the
extra<00:00:32.489> virgin<00:00:32.669> olive<00:00:33.120> oil<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:34.020> because<00:00:34.290> it's

been processed less and I think it was a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:50.959 
been processed less and I think it was a
lot<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:37.280> nutrient<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.480> simply<00:00:49.969> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
lot more nutrient so I'm just simply and
