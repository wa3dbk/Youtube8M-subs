or<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.000> pattern<00:04:35.210> if<00:04:35.450> you're<00:04:35.540> soloing<00:04:35.930> oh

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
or in a pattern if you're soloing oh

00:04:36.230 --> 00:05:18.700 
or in a pattern if you're soloing oh
let's<00:04:37.160> just<00:04:37.220> see<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:16.930> 12<00:05:17.930> times<00:05:18.110> but<00:05:18.500> as<00:05:18.590> you

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
let's just see so 12 times but as you

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.860 
let's just see so 12 times but as you
can<00:05:18.800> see<00:05:18.860> if<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.340> get<00:05:19.970> tasteful<00:05:20.420> with<00:05:20.570> it

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
can see if you get tasteful with it

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.780 
can see if you get tasteful with it
you<00:05:21.470> could<00:05:21.590> just<00:05:21.740> throw<00:05:21.920> it<00:05:22.040> in<00:05:22.160> there<00:05:22.250> once<00:05:22.670> in

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
you could just throw it in there once in

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.240 
you could just throw it in there once in
a<00:05:22.850> while<00:05:23.030> so<00:05:23.630> maybe<00:05:24.410> we<00:05:24.560> go<00:05:24.680> slower<00:05:25.010> maybe

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
a while so maybe we go slower maybe

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.310 
a while so maybe we go slower maybe
you're<00:05:25.370> doing<00:05:25.520> some<00:05:25.700> more<00:05:25.820> cool<00:05:26.090> groovy<00:05:26.630> fill

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
you're doing some more cool groovy fill

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.110 
you're doing some more cool groovy fill

pattern or you're doing a solo and
you're<00:05:29.240> kind<00:05:29.390> of<00:05:29.420> just<00:05:29.570> improving<00:05:30.290> slowly<00:05:31.130> you

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
you're kind of just improving slowly you

00:05:31.340 --> 00:06:13.690

and<00:06:14.700> I<00:06:14.910> would<00:06:15.030> recommend<00:06:15.420> just<00:06:15.570> doing<00:06:15.810> it<00:06:15.870> like

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
and I would recommend just doing it like

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.740 
and I would recommend just doing it like
once<00:06:16.410> don't<00:06:16.710> don't<00:06:17.040> like<00:06:17.430> you<00:06:17.640> know<00:06:17.790> not<00:06:18.480> twice

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
once don't don't like you know not twice

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.060 
once don't don't like you know not twice

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
in a row I'm just giving you an example

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.460 
in a row I'm just giving you an example
of<00:06:20.970> twice<00:06:21.240> in<00:06:21.390> a<00:06:21.450> row<00:06:21.570> but<00:06:21.750> one<00:06:21.990> time<00:06:22.200> she'd

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
of twice in a row but one time she'd

00:06:22.470 --> 00:07:16.060 
of twice in a row but one time she'd
probably<00:06:22.650> do<00:06:23.010> it<00:06:33.650> as<00:06:34.650> part<00:06:34.890> of<00:06:34.950> my<00:06:35.070> solo
