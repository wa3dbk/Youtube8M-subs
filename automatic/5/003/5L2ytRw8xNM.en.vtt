00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.740 
you have added all the sugar and all the
milk<00:02:36.050> in<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.319> recipe<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> asked<00:02:38.340> between<00:02:38.940> 4<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
milk in the recipe I asked between 4 to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.580 
milk in the recipe I asked between 4 to
5<00:02:40.080> cups<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.830> sugar<00:02:41.099> I<00:02:41.519> do<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.870> because<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
5 cups of sugar I do this because the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.309 
5 cups of sugar I do this because the
amount<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.129> sugar<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.700> will<00:02:45.360> need<00:02:45.599> might

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
amount of sugar you will need might

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.300 
amount of sugar you will need might
change<00:02:46.709> from<00:02:47.129> place<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.489> place<00:02:48.290> weather

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
change from place to place weather

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.770 
change from place to place weather
humidity<00:02:50.310> will<00:02:50.640> affect<00:02:51.150> your<00:02:51.330> buttercream

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
humidity will affect your buttercream

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.979 
humidity will affect your buttercream
and<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.640> will<00:02:53.970> change<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.569> amount<00:02:54.870> of

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
and so it will change the amount of

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.250 
and so it will change the amount of
sugar<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.280> play<00:02:56.489> with<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:58.110> if

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
sugar so you can play with this so if

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.280 
sugar so you can play with this so if
you<00:02:58.409> like<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> stiffer<00:02:59.750> consistency<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:00.930> keep

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
you like a stiffer consistency just keep

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.550 
you like a stiffer consistency just keep
adding<00:03:01.530> sugar<00:03:02.190> until<00:03:02.430> you're<00:03:02.790> happy<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:03.720> if

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
adding sugar until you're happy or if

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.309 
adding sugar until you're happy or if
you<00:03:04.800> want<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.459> more<00:03:05.790> softer<00:03:06.360> buttercream<00:03:06.989> just

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
you want a more softer buttercream just

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.300 
you want a more softer buttercream just
don't<00:03:07.590> add<00:03:07.860> as<00:03:08.159> much<00:03:08.459> sugar<00:03:09.769> once<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.950> are<00:03:11.099> all

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
don't add as much sugar once you are all

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.600 
don't add as much sugar once you are all
