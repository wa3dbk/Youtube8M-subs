to make the right decision on whether or

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.890 
to make the right decision on whether or
not<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.860> tankless<00:00:11.340> water<00:00:11.460> heater<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.690> best

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
not a tankless water heater is the best

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
not a tankless water heater is the best
choice<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.639> know<00:00:14.730> some<00:00:14.910> people<00:00:15.000> say

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
choice for you you know some people say

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.609 
choice for you you know some people say
well<00:00:15.450> what<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> tankless<00:00:16.199> water<00:00:16.260> heater

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
well what is a tankless water heater

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.580 
well what is a tankless water heater
I've<00:00:16.859> heard<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.869> but<00:00:18.869> really<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.500> know

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
I've heard of it but really you know

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.519 
I've heard of it but really you know
tell<00:00:19.949> me<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:21.140> how<00:00:22.140> much<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.410> they

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
tell me what it is is how much do they

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.439 
tell me what it is is how much do they
cost<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.369> expensive<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.240> something

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
cost is it expensive is it something

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.620 
cost is it expensive is it something
that<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.810> could<00:00:25.050> actually<00:00:25.230> afford<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.630> really

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
that I could actually afford and really

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.089 
that I could actually afford and really
the<00:00:27.720> most<00:00:27.869> important<00:00:28.289> question<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the most important question is is it the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.820 
the most important question is is it the
best<00:00:29.340> choice<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.640> my<00:00:30.119> hot<00:00:30.330> water<00:00:30.570> needs<00:00:30.900> but

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
best choice for my hot water needs but

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350 
best choice for my hot water needs but
looking<00:00:32.070> back<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.369> time<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> old

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
looking back in time you can see the old

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.020 
looking back in time you can see the old
wood<00:00:33.750> burning<00:00:34.340> water<00:00:35.340> heater<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.940> we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
wood burning water heater here that we

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.299 
wood burning water heater here that we
found<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.360> Durango<00:00:36.719> Colorado<00:00:36.920> very<00:00:37.920> efficient

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
found in Durango Colorado very efficient

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.530 
found in Durango Colorado very efficient
but<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.579> what's<00:00:38.760> interesting<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.329> works

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
but you know what's interesting it works

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.479 
but you know what's interesting it works
under<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> same<00:00:40.170> premise<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.860> actually<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
under the same premise are actually the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.250 
under the same premise are actually the
new<00:00:41.700> water<00:00:42.149> heaters<00:00:42.480> work<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> same

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
new water heaters work on the same

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.500 
new water heaters work on the same
premise<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.980> old<00:00:44.190> one<00:00:44.340> does<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:45.329> much

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
premise as this old one does not much

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.000 
premise as this old one does not much
difference<00:00:45.899> except<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.469> maybe<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:46.920> don't

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
difference except for maybe they don't

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
difference except for maybe they don't
burn<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.579> wood<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.450> your<00:00:48.690> modern<00:00:48.960> style

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
burn with wood this is your modern style

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.420 
burn with wood this is your modern style
and<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.710> lot<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.920> great<00:00:50.100> ones<00:00:50.219> out

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and there are a lot of great ones out

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
and there are a lot of great ones out
there<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.750> you're<00:00:51.989> storing<00:00:52.230> hot

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
there but you know you're storing hot

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
there but you know you're storing hot
water<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.829> these<00:00:52.980> big<00:00:53.219> tanks<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> does<00:00:54.360> take

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
water in these big tanks so it does take

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
water in these big tanks so it does take
a<00:00:54.899> little<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> space<00:00:55.530> these<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.460> an

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
a little bit of space these have an

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
a little bit of space these have an
energy<00:00:56.850> efficiency<00:00:57.329> level<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> about

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
energy efficiency level of up to about

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.220 
energy efficiency level of up to about
65<00:00:58.949> percent<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.899> you're<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
65 percent and you're going to have to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.540 
65 percent and you're going to have to
put<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> closet<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.129> you're<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> have

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
put a closet in or you're going to have

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.889 
put a closet in or you're going to have
to<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> dedicated<00:01:03.300> area<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.719> this

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to have a dedicated area for this

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
to have a dedicated area for this
particular<00:01:04.140> heater<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.430> tend<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
particular heater now they do tend to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.330 
particular heater now they do tend to
leak<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.270> time<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.680> most<00:01:07.830> important

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
leak over time and the most important

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.469 
leak over time and the most important
thing<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.729> need<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.299> they

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
thing that you need to know is they

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.960 
thing that you need to know is they
store<00:01:09.750> hot<00:01:09.990> water<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:10.830> know<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
store hot water as we all know and that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.170 
store hot water as we all know and that
that<00:01:12.330> equates<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.560> standby<00:01:14.250> energy<00:01:14.640> loss<00:01:14.850> so

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that equates to a standby energy loss so

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.060 
that equates to a standby energy loss so
when<00:01:15.390> you're<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.570> vacation<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.350> you're<00:01:17.040> just

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
when you're on vacation or you're just

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
when you're on vacation or you're just
out<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> house<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:17.939> eight<00:01:18.090> hours<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.540> day

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
out of the house for eight hours a day

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050 
out of the house for eight hours a day
or<00:01:18.960> 10<00:01:19.170> hours<00:01:19.470> you're<00:01:20.159> wasting<00:01:20.549> money<00:01:20.670> because

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
or 10 hours you're wasting money because

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.210 
or 10 hours you're wasting money because
you're<00:01:21.240> heating<00:01:21.600> water<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.950> not

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you're heating water and that's not

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
you're heating water and that's not
something<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.000> should<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.570> doing<00:01:24.750> so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
something we should really be doing so

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740 
something we should really be doing so
let's<00:01:25.590> review<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.950> tank<00:01:26.610> versus<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.390> tankless

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
let's review a tank versus the tankless

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.319 
let's review a tank versus the tankless
okay<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> old<00:01:29.040> tank<00:01:29.280> style<00:01:29.520> stores<00:01:29.880> hot<00:01:30.090> water

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
okay the old tank style stores hot water

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.810 
okay the old tank style stores hot water
energy<00:01:30.900> loss<00:01:31.110> equals<00:01:31.860> about<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> sixty<00:01:32.640> five

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
energy loss equals about a sixty five

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.660 
energy loss equals about a sixty five
percent<00:01:33.350> efficiency<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.430> over<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
percent efficiency if you go over to the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
know if you've ever had this happen but

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.069 
know if you've ever had this happen but
this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> mess<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> now<00:02:00.780> we're<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
this is a mess so now we're going to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.300 
this is a mess so now we're going to
review<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> tankless<00:02:01.710> water<00:02:01.799> heater<00:02:02.219> from

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
review the tankless water heater from

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.520 
review the tankless water heater from
the<00:02:02.640> inside<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.110> gas-fired

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the inside out now this is a gas-fired

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.429 
the inside out now this is a gas-fired
heater<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.070> I'm<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> show<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.000> here

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
heater that I'm going to show you here

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.169 
heater that I'm going to show you here
it's<00:02:07.439> similar<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.369> an<00:02:08.459> electric<00:02:08.849> heater<00:02:09.000> but

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
it's similar to an electric heater but

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.729 
it's similar to an electric heater but
it's<00:02:09.300> got<00:02:09.450> some<00:02:09.599> differences<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.410> basic

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
it's got some differences but the basic

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.680 
it's got some differences but the basic
premise<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.430> same

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
premise is the same

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.320 
premise is the same
you<00:02:12.230> have<00:02:12.560> your<00:02:13.070> hot<00:02:13.400> your<00:02:13.700> water<00:02:13.970> source

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
you have your hot your water source

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.050 
you have your hot your water source
coming<00:02:14.720> into<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.230> cold<00:02:15.470> inlet<00:02:15.800> side<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.280> that

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
coming into the cold inlet side and that

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.810 
coming into the cold inlet side and that
travels<00:02:17.420> up<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.680> heat<00:02:19.670> exchanger

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
travels up to the heat exchanger

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.880 
travels up to the heat exchanger
actually<00:02:20.510> past<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.990> burner<00:02:21.200> your<00:02:21.500> burner<00:02:21.710> is

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
actually past the burner your burner is

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.590 
actually past the burner your burner is
where<00:02:22.040> your<00:02:22.190> heat<00:02:22.490> exchanger<00:02:22.520> gets<00:02:23.120> warm<00:02:23.360> and

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
where your heat exchanger gets warm and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.170 
where your heat exchanger gets warm and
then<00:02:24.410> it'll<00:02:24.650> come<00:02:24.830> down<00:02:25.070> through<00:02:25.340> your<00:02:25.730> outlet

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
then it'll come down through your outlet

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.270 
then it'll come down through your outlet
side<00:02:26.480> or<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.990> discharge<00:02:27.410> side<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> faucet

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
side or the discharge side to the faucet

side or the discharge side to the faucet
that<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.850> or<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:29.840> your<00:02:30.290> heaters

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
that you or you or your heaters

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.110 
that you or you or your heaters
connected<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.460> and<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.670> could<00:02:31.820> be<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.940> whole

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
connected to and that could be a whole

house like any other gas heater this
does<00:02:34.730> require<00:02:35.000> venting<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:36.530> there's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
does require venting and there's

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.710 
does require venting and there's
variable<00:02:37.310> types<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.030> ting<00:02:38.210> and<00:02:38.420> depending

on the type of gas tankless water here
you<00:02:41.060> have<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.660> you'll<00:02:42.140> need<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.440> investigate

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
you have so you'll need to investigate

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.580 
you have so you'll need to investigate
that<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.340> some<00:02:43.550> degree<00:02:44.080> but<00:02:45.080> now<00:02:45.260> let's<00:02:45.470> look

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
that to some degree but now let's look

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.260 
that to some degree but now let's look
at<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:45.830> small<00:02:45.980> electric<00:02:46.580> heater<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> sake

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
at a small electric heater for the sake

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.320 
at a small electric heater for the sake
of<00:02:47.300> demonstration<00:02:47.840> as<00:02:48.500> well<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.610> small

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
of demonstration as well this is a small

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.670 
of demonstration as well this is a small
tankless<00:02:50.720> heater<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.080> would<00:02:51.200> typically<00:02:51.560> be

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
water heater similar to the one I'm

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.660 
water heater similar to the one I'm
going<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.570> show<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.750> here<00:04:00.110> that<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:01.340> would

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
going to show you here that it would

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.120 
going to show you here that it would
deliver<00:04:02.000> around<00:04:02.269> six<00:04:02.870> gallons<00:04:03.320> per<00:04:03.590> minute<00:04:03.739> of

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
deliver around six gallons per minute of

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.830 
deliver around six gallons per minute of
endless<00:04:04.370> hot<00:04:04.670> water<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.180> these<00:04:05.540> have<00:04:05.750> an

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
endless hot water and these have an

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.949 
endless hot water and these have an
energy<00:04:06.320> efficiency<00:04:06.709> level<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.190> about<00:04:07.370> 87%<00:04:08.030> so

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
energy efficiency level of about 87% so

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.900 
energy efficiency level of about 87% so
that's<00:04:09.140> pretty<00:04:09.320> high<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:10.280> it's<00:04:10.430> time<00:04:10.610> to<00:04:10.640> stop

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
that's pretty high so it's time to stop

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.060 
that's pretty high so it's time to stop
wasting<00:04:11.150> money<00:04:11.510> on<00:04:11.660> hot<00:04:11.959> water<00:04:11.989> eating<00:04:12.590> really

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
wasting money on hot water eating really

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.640 
wasting money on hot water eating really
I<00:04:13.220> mean<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.489> technology<00:04:13.820> is<00:04:14.150> there<00:04:14.650> start

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
I mean the technology is there start
