00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
difference my comments on Henry's that

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.770 
difference my comments on Henry's that
he<00:05:05.490> probably<00:05:05.789> shouldn't<00:05:06.180> have<00:05:06.360> pushed<00:05:06.570> his

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780

bowmen forward probably lined him up
right<00:05:09.000> on<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.270> tip<00:05:09.419> of<00:05:09.479> this<00:05:09.660> hill<00:05:09.870> so<00:05:10.020> they

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
right on the tip of this hill so they

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.120 
right on the tip of this hill so they
don't<00:05:10.320> get<00:05:10.410> that<00:05:10.590> much<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.919> a<00:05:10.979> hill

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
disadvantage and then he would have been

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.750 
disadvantage and then he would have been
able<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.110> shoot<00:05:13.289> units<00:05:13.860> such<00:05:14.010> as<00:05:14.039> the<00:05:14.310> katanas
