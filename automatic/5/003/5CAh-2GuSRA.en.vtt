00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it came out on ps3 on 27 17th and it was

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
it came out on ps3 on 27 17th and it was
twenty<00:01:30.030> dollars<00:01:30.360> I've<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:30.990> played<00:01:31.170> it

it'll<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.570> fun<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.680> Vita<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
it'll be just as fun as on the Vita and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.749 
it'll be just as fun as on the Vita and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so it was 20 its twenty dollars and i'm

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.120 
so it was 20 its twenty dollars and i'm
not<00:01:45.210> sure<00:01:45.659> what<00:01:46.530> they're<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:46.979> doing

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
not sure what they're going to be doing

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
not sure what they're going to be doing
with<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.549> because<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.360> Vita<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
with this because if the Vita is the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.690

on a portable system they might charge

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.880 
on a portable system they might charge
twenty-five<00:01:56.460> dollars<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.930> its<00:01:58.170> pocket

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
sales of Vita so they might make a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.480 
sales of Vita so they might make a
cheaper<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.320> make<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.590> fifteen<00:02:04.950> dollars<00:02:05.310> but
