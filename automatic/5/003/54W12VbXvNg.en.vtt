00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.390
 For us it is very important this 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.210
 forest because the vast majority of 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.270
 our communities 95% of the people 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.700
 here he works in tourism, that is, all 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.960
 we all work in tourism then it is 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.720
 like the goose that lays the golden eggs 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.910
 for all of us if we have the forest 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.559
 if we have the animals we are going to always 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.980
 to have the tourists coming to 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.980
 visit us 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.090
 costa rica begins to fill the pages 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.600
 of the newspapers at the end of the decade 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.140
 of the 80s there was the market for 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.329
 five - star tourism 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.660
 all that coastal areas are 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.940
 built by condo hotels that 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.199
 they use drinking water for swimming pools 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.199
 for golf courses 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:14.740
 and he says it was a scandal when 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.140
 they wanted to take 90% of the water that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.640
 come to costa rica take advantage of the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.009
 riches that God has given us those 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.399
 beautiful beaches because if your business 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 millionaires of foreigners to the people not 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.180
 he has nothing left 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:45.630
 and this is precisely ecotourism and 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.540
 small scale what will allow 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.460
 really eliminate the poverty of ossa 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:58.340

 land that is our home is the place

 live with us here of the animals 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.910

 we can do it well if we plan it 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.820
 if we discuss it if we learn this from 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.000
 that not all tourism is the same and that 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.680

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.680
