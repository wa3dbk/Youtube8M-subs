00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
building it but never kind of the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.689 
building it but never kind of the
overall<00:00:13.130> system<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> whole<00:00:15.030> so

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
overall system as it is as a whole so

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.500 
overall system as it is as a whole so
starting<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.900> first<00:00:19.109> time<00:00:20.359> essentially<00:00:21.359> i

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
starting the first time essentially i

out<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> two<00:00:29.789> by<00:00:29.910> four<00:00:30.150> osb<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.219> essence

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
out of two by four osb and in essence

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.450 
out of two by four osb and in essence
what<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.940> did<00:00:36.180> work<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.600> was

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
what I did work I was

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.069 
what I did work I was
26<00:00:38.059> hundred<00:00:38.180> gallons<00:00:38.719> per<00:00:38.809> hour<00:00:38.960> pump<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.760> the

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
26 hundred gallons per hour pump and the

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.090 
26 hundred gallons per hour pump and the
26<00:00:42.079> hundred<00:00:42.140> gallons<00:00:42.559> per<00:00:42.649> hour<00:00:42.680> puff

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
26 hundred gallons per hour puff

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.080 
26 hundred gallons per hour puff
obviously<00:00:43.610> was<00:00:45.250> purchased<00:00:46.250> with<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.760> idea

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
obviously was purchased with the idea

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.139 
obviously was purchased with the idea
that<00:00:47.149> i<00:00:47.629> can<00:00:47.809> expand<00:00:48.199> going<00:00:48.530> down<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.829> road

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
that i can expand going down the road

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.759 
that i can expand going down the road
currently<00:00:50.149> i'm<00:00:50.269> fed<00:00:50.750> up<00:00:50.780> with<00:00:51.019> to<00:00:51.290> grow<00:00:51.559> beds

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
currently i'm fed up with to grow beds

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.180 
currently i'm fed up with to grow beds
and<00:00:52.329> i<00:00:53.329> hope<00:00:53.540> to<00:00:53.600> expand<00:00:54.110> either<00:00:54.409> four<00:00:54.769> or<00:00:54.800> six

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
and i hope to expand either four or six

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.729 
and i hope to expand either four or six
down<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.579> road<00:00:55.760> but<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.420> meantime

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
down the road but in the meantime

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.750 
down the road but in the meantime
because<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:57.920> pumping<00:00:58.220> so<00:00:58.370> much<00:00:58.430> additional

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
because it's pumping so much additional

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.299 
because it's pumping so much additional
water<00:00:59.149> i<00:00:59.449> had<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.110> essentially<00:01:00.620> put<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.040> release

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
water i had to essentially put a release

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.520 
water i had to essentially put a release
valve<00:01:02.079> right<00:01:03.079> here<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:05.600> spend<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.229> match<00:01:06.380> the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
valve right here to spend to match the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.680 
valve right here to spend to match the
water<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:07.220> release<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.850> pressure<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:08.630> was

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
water to release the pressure that was

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.249 
water to release the pressure that was

what<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.750> did<00:02:31.019> after<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.530> built<00:02:31.799> that<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:32.160> was

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
what I did after I built that one was

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.420 
what I did after I built that one was
essentially<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.360> add<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.720> 80<00:02:34.200> Val<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:35.280> then

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
essentially just add in 80 Val and then

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.270 
essentially just add in 80 Val and then
continued<00:02:36.060> running<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:37.160> water<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:40.280> and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
continued running the water going in and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.400 
continued running the water going in and
then<00:02:41.310> an<00:02:41.519> in<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:41.989> forgive<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.019> chicken

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
then an in here forgive the chicken

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.199 
then an in here forgive the chicken
she's<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:44.040> happy<00:02:44.250> right<00:02:44.400> now<00:02:44.549> she's<00:02:45.000> making

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
she's not happy right now she's making

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.320 
she's not happy right now she's making
herself<00:02:45.480> known<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.280> put<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.030> second

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330

center attached actually acted as the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.610 
center attached actually acted as the
main<00:03:33.330> site<00:03:33.570> this<00:03:34.230> plastic<00:03:34.710> on<00:03:34.830> top<00:03:35.480> was

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
main site this plastic on top was

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.100 
main site this plastic on top was
essentially<00:03:37.620> set<00:03:37.830> up<00:03:38.240> just<00:03:39.240> to<00:03:39.330> create<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.660> seal

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
essentially set up just to create a seal

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.750 
essentially set up just to create a seal
we've<00:03:41.070> got<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.280> cap<00:03:41.490> and<00:03:42.120> i<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:42.330> used<00:03:42.560> extra

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
we've got the cap and i just used extra

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.220 
we've got the cap and i just used extra
plastic<00:03:44.760> material<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.420> actually<00:03:45.540> create<00:03:45.930> seal

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
plastic material to actually create seal

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.380 
plastic material to actually create seal
there<00:03:46.440> versus<00:03:46.820> actually<00:03:47.820> sealing<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.210> pipe

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
there versus actually sealing the pipe

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.910 
there versus actually sealing the pipe
all<00:03:48.540> together<00:03:48.720> did<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.380> same<00:03:49.530> thing<00:03:49.590> on<00:03:49.860> the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
all together did the same thing on the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.800 
all together did the same thing on the
fish<00:03:50.100> go<00:03:50.340> bed<00:03:51.410> we<00:03:52.410> have<00:03:53.210> an<00:03:54.210> external<00:03:56.630> 44<00:03:57.630> fight

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
fish go bed we have an external 44 fight

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.020 
fish go bed we have an external 44 fight
so<00:03:58.320> we'll<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.620> run<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:59.040> off<00:03:59.160> into<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.790> ground

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
so we'll just run it off into the ground

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.080 
so we'll just run it off into the ground
okay<00:04:00.900> ever<00:04:01.050> does<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:01.850> second<00:04:02.850> like<00:04:02.940> it's

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
okay ever does not second like it's

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.460 
okay ever does not second like it's
supposed<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:03.840> keeps<00:04:04.020> pumping<00:04:04.200> water

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
supposed to and just keeps pumping water

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.340 
supposed to and just keeps pumping water
into<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.860> tank<00:04:05.090> which<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.690> not<00:04:06.900> necessarily<00:04:06.990> a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
into the tank which is not necessarily a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.020 
into the tank which is not necessarily a
good<00:04:07.500> thing<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.860> might<00:04:08.070> eventually<00:04:08.430> decide<00:04:08.820> to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
good thing I might eventually decide to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.730 
good thing I might eventually decide to
just<00:04:09.300> run<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.690> back<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.110> tank<00:04:10.320> but<00:04:10.590> for

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
just run that back to the tank but for

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.150 
just run that back to the tank but for
now<00:04:10.830> that's<00:04:11.360> as<00:04:12.360> is<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.380> as<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.130> see

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
now that's as is and as you can see

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.930 
now that's as is and as you can see
through<00:04:14.550> here<00:04:14.840> i<00:04:15.840> went<00:04:16.410> ahead<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.709> i<00:04:17.190> started

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
through here i went ahead and i started

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.810 
through here i went ahead and i started
using<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.510> shade<00:04:19.049> cloth<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.580> reason<00:04:20.790> for

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
using a shade cloth and the reason for

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.450 
using a shade cloth and the reason for
that<00:04:20.910> was<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.510> good<00:04:22.260> friend<00:04:22.380> who<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.680> also<00:04:22.860> doing

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
that was a good friend who is also doing

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.790 
that was a good friend who is also doing
his<00:04:23.610> aquaponics<00:04:24.150> setup<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.750> he<00:04:25.350> did<00:04:25.500> not<00:04:25.620> have

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
his aquaponics setup and he did not have

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.830 
his aquaponics setup and he did not have
any<00:04:25.980> kind<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.250> shading<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.600> sun

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
any kind of shading and the sun

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.840 
any kind of shading and the sun
essentially<00:04:28.380> just<00:04:28.620> played<00:04:29.310> havoc<00:04:29.580> with<00:04:29.700> his

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
essentially just played havoc with his

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.850 
essentially just played havoc with his
plants<00:04:30.300> they<00:04:30.450> did<00:04:30.600> not<00:04:30.750> have<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.230> kind<00:04:31.800> of

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
plants they did not have the kind of

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.290 
plants they did not have the kind of
growth<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.100> he<00:04:32.340> was<00:04:32.460> expecting<00:04:32.970> as<00:04:33.090> soon<00:04:33.240> as

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
growth that he was expecting as soon as

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.010 
growth that he was expecting as soon as
he<00:04:33.360> puts<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.750> cloth<00:04:34.020> up<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:36.840> material

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
he puts a cloth up this material

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.870 
he puts a cloth up this material
basically<00:04:37.530> cuts<00:04:38.010> about<00:04:38.220> eighty-five<00:04:38.669> percent

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
basically cuts about eighty-five percent

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.330 
basically cuts about eighty-five percent
of<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.650> one<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.800> stuff<00:04:40.980> that<00:04:41.010> basically

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
of the one of the stuff that basically

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.580 
of the one of the stuff that basically
the<00:04:41.700> plants<00:04:41.970> don't<00:04:42.060> really<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.480> and<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:43.440> does

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
the plants don't really like and it does

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.610 
the plants don't really like and it does
a<00:04:43.620> very<00:04:43.890> very<00:04:44.040> good<00:04:44.190> job<00:04:45.470> this<00:04:46.470> is

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
a very very good job this is

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.810 
a very very good job this is
strawberries<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.430> problem<00:04:47.730> with

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
strawberries and the problem with

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.340 
strawberries and the problem with
strawberries<00:04:48.360> of<00:04:48.540> course<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.840> can<00:04:48.990> see<00:04:49.140> here

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
strawberries of course you can see here

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.320 
strawberries of course you can see here
is<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.500> little<00:04:49.740> yellowing<00:04:50.220> and<00:04:50.340> whatnot<00:04:50.700> with

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
is a little yellowing and whatnot with

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.390 
is a little yellowing and whatnot with
the<00:04:51.750> green<00:04:51.930> veins<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.470> that's<00:04:53.040> because<00:04:53.280> i'm

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
the green veins and that's because i'm

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.830 
the green veins and that's because i'm
still<00:04:53.610> in<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.760> process<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:54.240> getting<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.510> ph

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
still in the process of getting the ph

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.170 
still in the process of getting the ph
but<00:04:55.530> just<00:04:55.710> where<00:04:56.040> it<00:04:56.130> needs<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.430> be<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:57.030> want

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
but just where it needs to be you want

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.060 
but just where it needs to be you want
your<00:04:57.240> ph<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.169> be<00:04:58.260> between<00:04:58.440> six<00:04:58.800> point<00:04:59.010> eight

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
your ph to be between six point eight

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.300 
your ph to be between six point eight
and<00:04:59.250> seven<00:04:59.430> point<00:04:59.730> oh<00:04:59.850> so<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:00.510> have<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:01.040> good<00:05:02.040> pH

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
and seven point oh so you have a good pH

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.280 
and seven point oh so you have a good pH
that's<00:05:02.580> both<00:05:02.760> healthy<00:05:03.570> for<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.780> plants<00:05:04.110> and

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
that's both healthy for the plants and

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.220 
that's both healthy for the plants and
as<00:05:04.740> well<00:05:04.950> as<00:05:04.980> healthy<00:05:05.430> for<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.640> fish<00:05:06.230> anything

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
as well as healthy for the fish anything

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.930 
as well as healthy for the fish anything
above<00:05:07.410> or<00:05:07.560> below<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.010> you're<00:05:08.520> basically

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
above or below that and you're basically

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.830 
above or below that and you're basically
compromising<00:05:09.540> one<00:05:09.690> or<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.870> other<00:05:10.370> use<00:05:11.370> the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
compromising one or the other use the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.330 
compromising one or the other use the
cinder<00:05:12.840> blocks<00:05:13.080> for<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.440> base<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:13.919> i<00:05:14.820> used

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
cinder blocks for the base and i used

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.330 

essentially<00:05:18.410> scrap<00:05:19.410> pieces<00:05:19.650> of<00:05:19.889> wood<00:05:20.070> and

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
essentially scrap pieces of wood and

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.810 
essentially scrap pieces of wood and
some<00:05:21.080> shims<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.380> get<00:05:23.010> everything<00:05:23.280> leveled<00:05:23.730> out

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
some shims to get everything leveled out

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.790 
some shims to get everything leveled out
and<00:05:24.690> that<00:05:24.840> seemed<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.080> work<00:05:25.139> really<00:05:25.410> well<00:05:25.500> that

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
and that seemed to work really well that

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.310 
and that seemed to work really well that
was<00:05:25.889> actually<00:05:26.010> probably<00:05:26.310> one<00:05:26.460> of<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.669> longest

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
was actually probably one of the longest

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.300 
was actually probably one of the longest
portions<00:05:28.320> with<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.500> whole<00:05:28.650> build<00:05:28.860> we're<00:05:29.100> just

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
portions with the whole build we're just

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.560 
portions with the whole build we're just
trying<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.550> get<00:05:29.639> that<00:05:29.820> leveled<00:05:30.210> out<00:05:30.270> just

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
trying to get that leveled out just

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.719 
trying to get that leveled out just
right<00:05:30.750> but<00:05:31.320> thankfully<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.400> worked<00:05:32.610> out

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
right but thankfully that worked out

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.990 
right but thankfully that worked out
pretty<00:05:32.790> good<00:05:33.800> as<00:05:34.800> you<00:05:34.889> can<00:05:35.010> see<00:05:35.220> I've<00:05:35.940> got

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
pretty good as you can see I've got

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.650 
pretty good as you can see I've got
plenty<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.419> room<00:05:36.600> to<00:05:36.750> expand<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.760> I<00:05:39.270> plan<00:05:39.510> on

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
plenty of room to expand and I plan on

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.820 
plenty of room to expand and I plan on
getting<00:05:39.900> there<00:05:40.050> when<00:05:40.260> I<00:05:40.290> can<00:05:40.410> get<00:05:40.590> there<00:05:40.800> I

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
getting there when I can get there I

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.230 
getting there when I can get there I
don't<00:05:41.100> know<00:05:41.220> exactly<00:05:41.580> when<00:05:41.790> i'll<00:05:41.910> get<00:05:42.030> there

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
don't know exactly when i'll get there

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.210 
don't know exactly when i'll get there
but<00:05:42.449> for<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.169> time<00:05:43.320> being<00:05:43.380> at<00:05:43.710> least<00:05:43.740> we<00:05:44.070> have

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
but for the time being at least we have

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.659 
but for the time being at least we have
enough<00:05:44.490> here<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:45.840> get<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.020> going<00:05:46.320> and

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
enough here to to get the going and

enough here to to get the going and
