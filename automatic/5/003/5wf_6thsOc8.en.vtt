another one I want to show you is drift
from<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> new<00:01:50.640> movie<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.540> our

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
from the new movie this is one of our

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.990 
from the new movie this is one of our
one-step<00:01:52.170> changers<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> cool<00:01:53.520> bugatti

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
one-step changers it's a cool bugatti

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.030 
one-step changers it's a cool bugatti
new<00:01:54.329> character<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.990> he<00:01:55.350> converts<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.920> like

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
new character and he converts just like

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.569 
new character and he converts just like
this<00:01:56.990> that's<00:01:57.990> too<00:01:58.110> great<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.500> again<00:01:58.710> yeah

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
this that's too great do it again yeah

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.719 
this that's too great do it again yeah
you<00:01:59.640> missed<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> huh

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.510 

it<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:03.850> nice<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.530> all<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:06.159> one-step

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
it is nice so all of the one-step

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.279 
it is nice so all of the one-step
changers<00:02:06.969> have<00:02:07.210> different<00:02:07.899> methods<00:02:08.200> of

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
changers have different methods of

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.479 
changers have different methods of
conversion<00:02:08.800> but<00:02:08.920> they're<00:02:09.009> all<00:02:09.129> just<00:02:09.340> as

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
conversion but they're all just as

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.440 
conversion but they're all just as
simple<00:02:09.700> just<00:02:10.479> as<00:02:10.660> unique<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.800> innovative<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
simple just as unique and innovative and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.119 
simple just as unique and innovative and
they're<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.260> way<00:02:14.379> does<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.650> capture<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
they're the way does it capture the

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.520 
they're the way does it capture the
movie<00:02:15.340> magic<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:16.989> one<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.260> our<00:02:17.319> new

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
movie magic and this is one of our new

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.500 
movie magic and this is one of our new
flip<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.160> change<00:02:18.549> under<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.000> robots<00:02:19.360> in

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
flip and change under the robots in

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.809 
flip and change under the robots in
disguise<00:02:19.629> line<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.379> is<00:02:20.440> Grimlock<00:02:21.099> if<00:02:21.340> you

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
disguise line this is Grimlock if you

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.309 
disguise line this is Grimlock if you
grab<00:02:22.120> his<00:02:22.450> tail<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:23.019> two<00:02:23.140> different

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
grab his tail in two different

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.830 
grab his tail in two different
directions<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.950> spin<00:02:24.340> forward<00:02:24.730> he<00:02:25.330> completes

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
directions and spin forward he completes

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.259 
directions and spin forward he completes
the<00:02:26.019> transformation<00:02:26.890> into<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.459> Grimlock

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
the transformation into the Grimlock

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.800 
the transformation into the Grimlock
robot<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.319> if<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.890> spin<00:02:30.160> backwards<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:31.569> get

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
robot and if you spin backwards you get

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.130 
robot and if you spin backwards you get
Grimlock<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.799> Dinobot<00:02:33.340> very<00:02:34.180> cool<00:02:34.480> quick<00:02:34.930> way

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
Grimlock the Dinobot very cool quick way

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.170 
Grimlock the Dinobot very cool quick way
to<00:02:35.170> convert<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.709> action<00:02:36.130> figures<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.610> like

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
to convert the action figures just like

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.750 
to convert the action figures just like
the<00:02:37.299> movie<00:02:37.540> age<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.840> extinction<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:39.519> we<00:02:39.640> have

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
the movie age of extinction and we have

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.259 
the movie age of extinction and we have
bumblebee<00:02:40.299> we<00:02:41.019> also<00:02:41.170> have<00:02:41.500> locked<00:02:42.099> down<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.819> new

that you grab the doors you pull them
out<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.180> spin<00:02:52.510> them<00:02:52.629> forward<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.680> convert

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
out you spin them forward to convert

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.030 
out you spin them forward to convert

from vehicle to robot mode and to
complete<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.549> conversion<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.569> spin<00:02:58.959> them

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
complete the conversion you spin them

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.670 
complete the conversion you spin them
backwards<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.700> convert<00:03:01.150> from<00:03:01.840> robot<00:03:02.319> to

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
the evasion mode we've got drift

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.610 
the evasion mode we've got drift
crosshairs<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:29.430> Galvatron<00:03:31.109> so<00:03:32.109> this<00:03:32.319> is<00:03:32.470> the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
crosshairs and Galvatron so this is the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.650

g1 which is what we call the generation

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.770 
g1 which is what we call the generation
one<00:03:39.310> because<00:03:39.669> we're<00:03:39.819> celebrating<00:03:40.239> our<00:03:40.359> 30th
