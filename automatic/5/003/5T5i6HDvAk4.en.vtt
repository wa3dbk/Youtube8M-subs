so<00:00:02.040> Alberto<00:00:02.939> can<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.419> show<00:00:03.689> us<00:00:04.400> how<00:00:05.420> exactly

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
so Alberto can you show us how exactly

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.339 
so Alberto can you show us how exactly
how<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.529> tea<00:00:08.130> box

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
how the tea box

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.580 
how the tea box
26:55<00:00:10.349> as<00:00:10.889> far<00:00:11.190> as<00:00:11.370> 18<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.000> how<00:00:12.809> do<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.380> prove

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
26:55 as far as 18 so how do you prove

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.470 
26:55 as far as 18 so how do you prove
that<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:13.980> actually<00:00:14.340> producing<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.000> yourself

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
that it's actually producing it yourself

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.340 
that it's actually producing it yourself
is<00:00:16.049> there<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> way<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.920> show<00:00:17.130> us<00:00:21.350> we'll

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
is there a way you can show us we'll

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.470 
is there a way you can show us we'll
just<00:00:22.529> connect<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> host<00:00:23.369> from<00:00:23.609> go<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
just connect the host from go to the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.120 
just connect the host from go to the
intake<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> show<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.590> second

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
intake so you can you show that second

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.670 
intake so you can you show that second
that<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> connector

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that one so I have I have a connector

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.089 
that one so I have I have a connector
and<00:00:28.800> then<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.490> hydrogen's<00:00:29.939> boy<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
and then the hydrogen's boy to the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.360 
and then the hydrogen's boy to the
engine<00:00:33.050> by<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.110> hole<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
engine by this hole and I'm going to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
engine by this hole and I'm going to
disconnect<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.030> okay<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> tee

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
disconnect it okay so this is the tee

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
disconnect it okay so this is the tee

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.209 

better<00:01:57.789> cover<00:01:58.060> up<00:01:58.149> that<00:01:58.420> here<00:01:58.659> because<00:01:59.219> so

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
better cover up that here because so

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.789 
better cover up that here because so
we're<00:02:00.460> we're<00:02:00.700> worse<00:02:01.149> exploding<00:02:01.929> the<00:02:02.079> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
we're we're worse exploding the the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.349 
we're we're worse exploding the the
reason<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.159> falling<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.609> hydrogen<00:02:04.210> and

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
reason is falling the hydrogen and

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.109 
reason is falling the hydrogen and
oxygen<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:05.020> mean<00:02:05.469> most<00:02:05.950> hydrogen's<00:02:06.640> floating

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
oxygen I mean most hydrogen's floating

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.859 
oxygen I mean most hydrogen's floating
and<00:02:07.479> up<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.110> just<00:02:08.259> make<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:08.679> boiling<00:02:09.039> water

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and up and just make this boiling water

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.740 
and up and just make this boiling water
dramatic<00:02:12.620> hi-c<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.580> go<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:14.970> where

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
dramatic hi-c so there you go for where

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.559 
dramatic hi-c so there you go for where
we<00:02:16.410> are<00:02:16.620> producing<00:02:17.250> hydrogen<00:02:17.730> oxygen<00:02:18.800> 88<00:02:19.800> so

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
we are producing hydrogen oxygen 88 so

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:32.330 
we are producing hydrogen oxygen 88 so
from<00:02:21.569> Phivolcs<00:02:22.310> 2255<00:02:28.640> how<00:02:29.640> about<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.220> if

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
from Phivolcs 2255 how about this so if

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.220

install a car like this you can hear a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.130 
install a car like this you can hear a
little<00:02:50.130> noise<00:02:50.280> inside<00:02:50.790> attack<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> one

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
little noise inside attack but the one

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.600 
little noise inside attack but the one
is<00:02:52.290> now<00:02:52.470> on<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.739> truck<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.280> don't<00:02:53.459> hear

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
is now on a truck you don't hear

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.220 
is now on a truck you don't hear
anything

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
anything

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.050 
anything
so<00:02:55.230> when<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.739> cover<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.190> up<00:02:56.280> does<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.730> kind<00:02:56.910> of

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
so when you cover it up does it kind of

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.910 
so when you cover it up does it kind of
dampen<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.690> sound<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.319> little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.709> you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
dampen the sound it's a little bit you

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.050 
dampen the sound it's a little bit you
don't<00:02:59.099> put<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> song<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> little<00:02:59.940> bit<00:03:00.180> all

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
don't put the song a little bit all

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.640 
don't put the song a little bit all
right<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.269> then<00:03:03.420> when<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.720> how<00:03:04.290> about<00:03:04.380> when

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
right and then when you how about when

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.259 
right and then when you how about when
you<00:03:04.769> close<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.220> trunk<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.730> you're<00:03:05.970> inside

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
you close the trunk and you're inside

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.400 
you close the trunk and you're inside
the<00:03:06.450> car

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
the car

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.650 
the car
is<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:08.250> noticeable<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.630> see<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.299> guess<00:03:12.480> it's

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
is it noticeable I see so I guess it's

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.960 
is it noticeable I see so I guess it's
pretty<00:03:12.959> much<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.440> trade-off<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:14.190> know<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.430> you

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
pretty much a trade-off you know you you

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.780 
pretty much a trade-off you know you you
hear<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.390> pump<00:03:16.140> sound<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.709> mean<00:03:17.430> it's<00:03:17.670> an

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
hear this pump sound I mean it's an

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.140 
hear this pump sound I mean it's an
added<00:03:18.150> safety<00:03:18.510> feature<00:03:18.750> as<00:03:19.440> well<00:03:20.160> as<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:20.940> as

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
added safety feature as well as well as

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.650 
added safety feature as well as well as
you<00:03:22.019> know<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.590> making<00:03:22.890> sure<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
you know to making sure that the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.400 
you know to making sure that the
the<00:03:25.110> generator<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.890> not<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.450> running<00:03:28.020> pool

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the generator is not it is running pool

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.280 
the generator is not it is running pool
and<00:03:28.740> everything<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.700> either<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
electrolyte has been circulated in there

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.540 
electrolyte has been circulated in there
and<00:03:33.300> it's<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.630> trade-off<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.530> know<00:03:34.680> an<00:03:34.950> extra

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
and it's a trade-off you know an extra

and it's a trade-off you know an extra
15<00:03:35.940> miles<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.540> mean<00:03:36.810> 15<00:03:37.680> percent<00:03:38.040> gain<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.370> your

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
15 miles I mean 15 percent gain on your

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.960 
15 miles I mean 15 percent gain on your
mileage<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.630> not<00:03:39.780> too<00:03:39.960> bad<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:41.250> again<00:03:41.790> it

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
mileage it's not too bad so again it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.480 
mileage it's not too bad so again it
direct<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:43.500> increase<00:03:43.890> on<00:03:44.040> gas<00:03:44.250> mileage

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
direct that the increase on gas mileage

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.820 
direct that the increase on gas mileage
really<00:03:44.940> depends<00:03:45.330> upon<00:03:45.420> here<00:03:45.870> configuration
