00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello people welcome but something 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.240
 later a video of us james d and who 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.280
 have to do something special for you 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.110
 devised after the last weekend 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.759
 that was while having our server 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.780
 what he still liked and some 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.400
 I also wanted some of that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.260
 window for a longer time to the east 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.449
 and that is exactly what we are doing now 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.640
 and it is a server on the i 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.010
 miev see the pvp could train 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960
 on the is that this 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.330
 Rethink what he certainly knows that almost 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.550
 to and the patrick will meet you in time 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.189
 server pc by going live now 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.130
 logs exactly the server apps ghg 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.200
 point minecraft point quite easily 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.690
 remember and then just on the server 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.879
 go and then it's your turn 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 the server currently has 32 slots so we 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.090
 did not want to buy more than us now 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.489
 have to look like that with you 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.770
 arrives and so and thinks 32 slots if 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.219
 For the time being, it's enough for everyone 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.809
 case it is so you with fouad and such 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.180
 look further with the so another 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 can train and just come 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.660
 itself on the rules and so on 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.890
 and the big points are all explained and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.210
 so on then you can train like 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 that definitely makes in any case 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 fun and it is especially not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.270
 It is in contrast to German post 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.060
 the other whole msi kids but the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.409
 yes mostly in the amiland costs are 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.220
 we differ very much 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.409
 thanks to the wii gamer cory cory cory 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.330
 He helped us a bit with the construction 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.009
 from the server and yes I hope so 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.830
 you like feedback and so on 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.509
 we are also with the construction so the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.509
 whole kids he already knows that 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.909
 kit pvp so bad is pvp then has 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.380
 you just great with your car here 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.040
 and all the fuck so with the plug 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.799
 ins is then given to equipment and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.570
 then you can then you can bob 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.430
 For example, Berlin is the place to go 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.630
 maine arena then you are here at the sport 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.680
 you can not be attacked or 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 attack others 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.049
 you have to jump down and from then on 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.590
 pvp goes and you can everything, we are expanding 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.079
 have just got the thing that you 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.090
 only empty ball can stop and no 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.560
 other things the bulls were the goods 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.880
 unfortunately still on the ground but me 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
 guess we'll fix that soon 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.960
 that then they are gone and yes you are 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.580
 For example, you can not sword and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.270
 so drop that's not all 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.350

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.610
