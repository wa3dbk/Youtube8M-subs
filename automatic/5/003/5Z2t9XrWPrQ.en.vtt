turrets how effective this is for
harassment<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.890> probably<00:02:56.130> meant<00:02:56.609> to<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:56.850> for

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060

harassment it's probably meant to be for
defensive<00:02:57.600> purposes<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:58.380> second<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.980> saw<00:02:59.010> this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
defensive purposes the second I saw this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.330 
defensive purposes the second I saw this
ability<00:02:59.670> I<00:03:00.030> thought<00:03:00.450> right<00:03:00.870> away<00:03:01.340> offensive

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
purposes for drone worker harassment I

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.289 
purposes for drone worker harassment I
threw<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.010> down<00:03:05.220> now<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.790> computer<00:03:05.970> had

now you have eight turrets you could

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.259 
now you have eight turrets you could

you those two units of the tear

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.680 
you those two units of the tear
and<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.460> thought<00:03:40.000> stood<00:03:40.660> out<00:03:40.780> really<00:03:41.200> strong

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
and I thought stood out really strong

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.900 
and I thought stood out really strong
overall<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:44.140> feel<00:03:44.530> because<00:03:44.770> of<00:03:45.220> these<00:03:45.640> two

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
overall I feel because of these two

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.900 
overall I feel because of these two
units<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.450> Terran<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:47.110> slightly<00:03:47.890> at<00:03:48.700> an

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
units the Terran is slightly at an

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.090 
units the Terran is slightly at an
advantage<00:03:49.270> however<00:03:49.810> each<00:03:50.200> race<00:03:50.500> does<00:03:50.800> have<00:03:51.070> a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
advantage however each race does have a

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.570 
advantage however each race does have a
powerful<00:03:51.870> unit<00:03:52.870> or<00:03:53.050> ability<00:03:53.590> against<00:03:54.400> other

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
powerful unit or ability against other

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.140 
powerful unit or ability against other
races<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:59.020> it<00:03:59.680> can<00:04:00.160> be<00:04:00.280> said<00:04:00.520> that<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.790> game<00:04:00.970> is

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
races so it can be said that the game is

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.170 
races so it can be said that the game is
balanced<00:04:01.720> but<00:04:02.280> now<00:04:03.280> I'm<00:04:03.430> going<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.640> die<00:04:03.850> here

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
balanced but now I'm going to die here

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.580 
balanced but now I'm going to die here
because<00:04:04.540> I've<00:04:04.720> obviously<00:04:04.840> left<00:04:05.290> little

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
because I've obviously left little

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.330 
because I've obviously left little
defense<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.220> that's<00:04:06.400> another<00:04:06.730> thing<00:04:08.340> maybe

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
defense so that's another thing maybe

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.120 
defense so that's another thing maybe
it's<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.120> sacrifice<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:10.810> my<00:04:11.230> defense<00:04:11.710> to<00:04:11.980> have

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
it's a sacrifice of my defense to have

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.570 
it's a sacrifice of my defense to have
gotten<00:04:12.580> those<00:04:12.730> Reapers<00:04:14.070> maybe<00:04:15.070> that's<00:04:15.370> how

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
gotten those Reapers maybe that's how

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.940 
gotten those Reapers maybe that's how
they're<00:04:15.760> balanced<00:04:16.270> but<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.959> my<00:04:17.290> opinion<00:04:17.440> if

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
they're balanced but in my opinion if

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.890 
they're balanced but in my opinion if
this<00:04:18.330> Protoss<00:04:19.330> fully<00:04:20.140> counter<00:04:20.709> attacked<00:04:21.070> me

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
this Protoss fully counter attacked me

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.810 
this Protoss fully counter attacked me
when<00:04:22.900> my<00:04:23.140> Reapers<00:04:23.560> attacked<00:04:24.040> his<00:04:24.250> base<00:04:24.490> I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
when my Reapers attacked his base I

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.330 
when my Reapers attacked his base I
would<00:04:25.600> kill<00:04:25.810> his<00:04:26.050> face<00:04:26.320> faster<00:04:26.950> than<00:04:27.100> he<00:04:27.250> would

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
would kill his face faster than he would

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.340 
would kill his face faster than he would
kill<00:04:27.550> mine<00:04:27.730> just<00:04:28.210> because<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.750> how<00:04:28.870> fast<00:04:29.170> they

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
kill mine just because of how fast they

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.790 
kill mine just because of how fast they
down<00:04:29.530> buildings<00:04:30.010> those<00:04:30.610> Reapers<00:04:31.150> are<00:04:31.330> only<00:04:31.800> 50

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
down buildings those Reapers are only 50

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.030 
down buildings those Reapers are only 50
minerals<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.730> 50<00:04:34.480> gas<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.350> get<00:04:35.530> it's

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
minerals and 50 gas to get it's

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.300 
minerals and 50 gas to get it's
basically<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.700> marine<00:04:37.210> plus<00:04:37.570> gas<00:04:37.950> very<00:04:38.950> cheap

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
basically a marine plus gas very cheap

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.020 
basically a marine plus gas very cheap
and<00:04:39.490> cost<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:40.030> get<00:04:40.210> they<00:04:41.370> once<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.700> get<00:04:42.880> the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
and cost to get they once you get the

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.820 
and cost to get they once you get the
100<00:04:44.070> mineral<00:04:45.070> 100<00:04:45.610> gas<00:04:45.820> speed<00:04:46.270> upgrade<00:04:46.830> they

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
100 mineral 100 gas speed upgrade they

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.270 
100 mineral 100 gas speed upgrade they
just<00:04:48.100> fly<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:50.590> anyway<00:04:50.830> I'm<00:04:50.920> just<00:04:51.100> going<00:04:51.220> to

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
just fly so anyway I'm just going to

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.010 
just fly so anyway I'm just going to
pause<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.700> game<00:04:51.730> here<00:04:52.090> while<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.270> keep

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
pause the game here while I keep

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.710 
pause the game here while I keep
gathering<00:04:53.230> my<00:04:53.530> thoughts<00:04:53.710> so<00:04:54.280> anyway<00:04:54.720> yeah

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
gathering my thoughts so anyway yeah

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.380 
gathering my thoughts so anyway yeah
that's<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.470> reaper<00:04:57.120> harassment<00:04:58.120> which<00:04:58.270> i

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
that's the reaper harassment which i

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.510 
that's the reaper harassment which i
think<00:04:58.450> is<00:04:58.660> very<00:04:58.930> effective<00:04:59.350> I<00:04:59.650> Nexus<00:05:00.220> snipe

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
think is very effective I Nexus snipe

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.940 
think is very effective I Nexus snipe
the<00:05:00.730> enemy's<00:05:01.090> base<00:05:01.300> right<00:05:01.600> there<00:05:01.950> extremely

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
the enemy's base right there extremely

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.490 
the enemy's base right there extremely
powerful<00:05:03.130> in<00:05:03.580> my<00:05:03.700> opinion<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.330> going<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.380> be<00:05:05.470> a

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
powerful in my opinion and going to be a

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.230 
powerful in my opinion and going to be a
very<00:05:05.740> viable<00:05:06.100> strategy<00:05:06.460> we're<00:05:06.940> going<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.120> have

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
very viable strategy we're going to have

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.880 
very viable strategy we're going to have
to<00:05:07.360> see<00:05:07.540> how<00:05:07.660> pro<00:05:07.900> players<00:05:08.230> react<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.770> this

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
to see how pro players react to this

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.010 
to see how pro players react to this
build<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.430> I'd<00:05:10.210> like<00:05:10.419> to<00:05:10.570> see<00:05:10.720> what<00:05:10.840> they<00:05:10.960> do

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
build and I'd like to see what they do

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.360 
build and I'd like to see what they do
in<00:05:11.440> response<00:05:11.919> to<00:05:12.460> Reapers<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.980> that's<00:05:14.980> it<00:05:15.220> for

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
in response to Reapers and that's it for

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.250 
in response to Reapers and that's it for
the<00:05:15.430> Terran<00:05:15.790> video<00:05:16.030> for<00:05:16.330> now<00:05:16.510> I'm<00:05:17.020> going<00:05:17.200> to
