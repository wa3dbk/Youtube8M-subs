00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.050 
booth first here's the keyboard and that
mouse<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.319> Wireless<00:03:46.400> as<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.640> mentioned

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
mouse is Wireless as I mentioned

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.509 
mouse is Wireless as I mentioned
probably<00:03:48.750> mentioned<00:03:49.140> earlier<00:03:49.440> I've<00:03:50.340> been

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
probably mentioned earlier I've been

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.670 
probably mentioned earlier I've been
filming<00:03:50.760> all<00:03:50.940> week<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.720> don't<00:03:51.840> remember<00:03:52.200> I

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
filming all week so I don't remember I

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:02.870 
filming all week so I don't remember I
don't<00:03:53.549> really<00:03:53.730> remember<00:03:53.879> what<00:03:54.150> said<00:04:01.880> all

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
don't really remember what said all

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:13.430 
don't really remember what said all
right<00:04:05.150> so<00:04:06.150> let's<00:04:06.329> see<00:04:06.599> here<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:11.310> keyboard<00:04:12.440> is

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
right so let's see here the keyboard is

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.159 
right so let's see here the keyboard is
in<00:04:13.590> better<00:04:13.799> shape<00:04:13.889> in<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.310> mouse's<00:04:15.169> I'll

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
in better shape in the mouse's I'll

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.870 
in better shape in the mouse's I'll
probably<00:04:16.410> be<00:04:16.620> buying<00:04:16.859> new<00:04:17.070> things<00:04:17.099> anyway<00:04:17.820> so

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
probably be buying new things anyway so

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.490 
probably be buying new things anyway so
it<00:04:18.180> doesn't<00:04:18.209> really<00:04:18.479> matter<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.200> said

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
it doesn't really matter like I said

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.589 
it doesn't really matter like I said
just<00:04:19.530> as<00:04:19.859> long<00:04:19.979> as<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.190> computer<00:04:20.310> works<00:04:20.729> all

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
just as long as the computer works all

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:22.820 
just as long as the computer works all
right<00:04:21.660> let<00:04:21.840> me<00:04:21.870> take<00:04:22.139> this<00:04:22.289> block<00:04:22.590> of

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
right let me take this block of

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.100 
right let me take this block of
styrofoam<00:04:23.039> out<00:04:24.979> alright<00:04:25.979> so<00:04:26.310> they<00:04:26.880> definitely

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
styrofoam out alright so they definitely

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.070 
styrofoam out alright so they definitely
protected<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.970> or<00:04:29.970> tried<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.510> at<00:04:30.630> least<00:04:30.810> we'll

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
protected it or tried to at least we'll

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.740 
protected it or tried to at least we'll
see<00:04:31.289> if<00:04:31.440> their<00:04:31.620> efforts<00:04:32.070> were<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.340> vain<00:04:32.750> there

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
see if their efforts were in vain there

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.330 
see if their efforts were in vain there
she<00:04:34.080> is<00:04:34.110> in<00:04:34.229> place<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:37.110> only<00:04:37.380> problem<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:37.979> I

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
she is in place the only problem is I

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.170 
she is in place the only problem is I
kind<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.030> need<00:04:39.180> power<00:04:39.479> and<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.470> nearest<00:04:41.180> power

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
kind of need power and the nearest power

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.000 
kind of need power and the nearest power
source<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:43.639> behind<00:04:44.639> that<00:04:44.849> thing<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:46.010> gotta

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
source is behind that thing so gotta

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.750 
source is behind that thing so gotta
move<00:04:47.160> that<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.729> hopefully<00:04:49.340> keep<00:04:50.340> everything

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
move that and hopefully keep everything

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.560 
move that and hopefully keep everything
in<00:04:51.180> place<00:04:51.479> while<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:51.900> move<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.320> yeah

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
in place while I move it yeah

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.159 
in place while I move it yeah
so<00:04:54.570> yeah<00:04:54.810> I'll<00:04:55.530> let<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:55.860> know<00:04:55.889> how<00:04:56.190> it<00:04:56.370> goes

so yeah I'll let you know how it goes

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.980 
so yeah I'll let you know how it goes
this<00:04:58.169> thing<00:04:58.410> is<00:04:58.530> sweet<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:58.889> far<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.750> like<00:05:00.750> it's<00:05:00.930> a

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
this thing is sweet so far I like it's a

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.250 
this thing is sweet so far I like it's a
little<00:05:01.169> dusty<00:05:01.440> but<00:05:02.310> as<00:05:03.210> long<00:05:03.479> as<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.750> works<00:05:03.900> man

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
little dusty but as long as it works man

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.350 
little dusty but as long as it works man
I<00:05:04.620> don't<00:05:04.860> really<00:05:05.130> care

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
I don't really care

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.779 
I don't really care
like<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:09.150> screen<00:05:09.539> looks<00:05:09.810> fine<00:05:10.050> but<00:05:10.400> yeah<00:05:11.400> here

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
like the screen looks fine but yeah here

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:12.320 
like the screen looks fine but yeah here
we<00:05:11.819> go

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
we go

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.360 
we go
I<00:05:12.360> thought<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.379> power<00:05:13.590> button<00:05:14.009> was<00:05:14.159> right

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
I thought the power button was right

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.820 
I thought the power button was right
there<00:05:14.610> hold<00:05:14.849> on<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:18.360> right<00:05:18.539> there

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.080 

one<00:05:22.830> problem<00:05:23.099> I'm<00:05:23.400> probably<00:05:23.610> gonna<00:05:23.819> have<00:05:24.060> to

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
one problem I'm probably gonna have to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.990 
one problem I'm probably gonna have to
solve<00:05:24.539> is<00:05:24.900> like<00:05:25.189> the<00:05:26.189> mouse<00:05:26.400> doesn't<00:05:26.759> have

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
solve is like the mouse doesn't have

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.490 
solve is like the mouse doesn't have
batteries<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.719> keyboard<00:05:28.139> probably

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
batteries so the keyboard probably

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.350 
batteries so the keyboard probably
doesn't<00:05:28.770> either<00:05:28.889> so<00:05:29.250> I'll<00:05:29.669> have<00:05:29.819> to<00:05:29.909> find<00:05:30.090> some

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
doesn't either so I'll have to find some

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:39.399 
doesn't either so I'll have to find some
let's<00:05:31.110> see<00:05:31.229> if<00:05:31.289> it<00:05:31.379> powers<00:05:31.620> on<00:05:31.740> here<00:05:31.979> we<00:05:32.069> go
