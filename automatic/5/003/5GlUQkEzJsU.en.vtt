I<00:02:32.880> think<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.970> biggest<00:02:34.290> struggle<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.380> have

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
I think the biggest struggle you have

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.140 
I think the biggest struggle you have
when<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.920> put<00:02:36.040> an<00:02:36.160> add<00:02:36.280> oil<00:02:36.490> or<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.000> like

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
when you put an add oil or is that like

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:52.700 
when you put an add oil or is that like
an<00:02:37.330> internal<00:02:37.750> battle<00:02:37.840> with<00:02:38.080> yourself

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.070 

it<00:02:53.710> was<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.860> nice<00:02:54.070> feeling<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.790> know<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.080> come

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
it was a nice feeling you know to come

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.020 
it was a nice feeling you know to come
full<00:02:56.320> circle<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.830> it's<00:02:57.370> back<00:02:57.580> doing<00:02:57.880> what<00:02:58.000> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
full circle and it's back doing what I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.050
