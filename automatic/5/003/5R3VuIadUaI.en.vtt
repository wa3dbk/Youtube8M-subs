grain texture led here that will light

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.049 
grain texture led here that will light
up<00:01:02.829> some<00:01:03.829> details<00:01:04.250> at<00:01:04.399> the<00:01:04.489> back<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:04.879> some

sort of got a vibrating vibration going

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.569 
sort of got a vibrating vibration going
to<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:02.390> drive<00:02:02.659> shows<00:02:03.079> are<00:02:03.409> even<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.460> was

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
to it and the drive shows are even I was

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.130 
to it and the drive shows are even I was
going<00:02:04.850> into<00:02:04.969> it<00:02:05.149> here<00:02:05.329> it<00:02:05.420> is<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:05.719> just<00:02:05.960> showed

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
going into it here it is it just showed

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.039 
going into it here it is it just showed
up<00:02:06.520> I'll<00:02:07.520> bring<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:07.820> down<00:02:08.119> side<00:02:08.450> its<00:02:08.810> bit

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
up I'll bring that down side its bit

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.759 
up I'll bring that down side its bit
easier<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.459> there<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:11.560> bench<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
easier to see so there it is bench and

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.130 
easier to see so there it is bench and
drive<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.640> if<00:02:13.700> we<00:02:13.850> click<00:02:14.000> on<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.630> open<00:02:15.049> it

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
drive so if we click on that and open it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.250 
drive so if we click on that and open it
up<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.500> can<00:02:15.709> see<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:16.040> got<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.250> whole<00:02:16.430> bunch<00:02:16.640> of

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
up you can see it's got a whole bunch of

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.470 
up you can see it's got a whole bunch of
you<00:02:18.260> know<00:02:18.290> executable<00:02:19.220> file<00:02:19.459> is<00:02:19.670> basically<00:02:20.390> if

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
you know executable file is basically if

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.180 
you know executable file is basically if
you've<00:02:20.600> got<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.840> windows<00:02:21.200> machine<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.859> you<00:02:21.920> can

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
you've got a windows machine so you can

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.340 
you've got a windows machine so you can
run<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.489> obviously<00:02:23.269> I<00:02:23.299> don't<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.870> won't<00:02:24.609> and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
run it obviously I don't I won't and

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.870 
run it obviously I don't I won't and
what<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.380> will<00:02:27.500> do<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.280> go<00:02:28.310> into<00:02:28.609> disk

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
what I will do is I go into disk

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.780 
what I will do is I go into disk
utilities<00:02:29.530> open<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:30.590> disk<00:02:30.859> utilities<00:02:31.430> here

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
utilities open up disk utilities here

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.770 
utilities open up disk utilities here
and<00:02:32.500> find<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.620> drive<00:02:33.859> which<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.700> 1.5<00:02:35.540> it's

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
and find the drive which is a 1.5 it's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.830 
and find the drive which is a 1.5 it's
here<00:02:36.049> and<00:02:36.230> then<00:02:36.650> all<00:02:36.799> I<00:02:36.829> do<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.459> just

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
here and then all I do is I just

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.170 
here and then all I do is I just
repartition<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:41.000> mac<00:02:41.329> OS<00:02:41.630> x<00:02:41.780> journal

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
repartition it to mac OS x journal

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.910 
repartition it to mac OS x journal
which<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.450> here<00:02:47.780> extended<00:02:48.780> mac<00:02:49.080> OS<00:02:49.410> journal

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
which is here extended mac OS journal

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.740 
which is here extended mac OS journal
and<00:02:50.099> just<00:02:50.430> rename<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.060> whatever<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.450> want

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
and just rename it to whatever I want

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.540 
and just rename it to whatever I want
and<00:02:51.870> then<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:52.319> done<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.370> that's

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
and then it's done so that that's

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.400 
and then it's done so that that's
basically<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.269> anyway<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.989> does<00:02:55.140> show<00:02:55.170> up

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
basically it anyway but it does show up
