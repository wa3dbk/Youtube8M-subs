00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.260

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 Hello, my dear friends, dear 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.590
 warfare 2 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.920
 here is a tie unfortunately already dead 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:32.400
 a soup and price trapped by the general 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.770
 shepard in afghanistan at the cemetery 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.170
 airplanes 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.110
 here are more people Makarov connected 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.680
 so we have a small 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.110
 advantage we can stupidly wait 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 until both sides of each other are just 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.750
 will kill but it will be long and all live 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.750
 still want 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:09.170
 I would even say not too hot 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.170
 will turn out 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.620
 Yes, and this circle 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.230
 chewable 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.170
 i forget my theories so here 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.170
 and she just had dogs here and not enough 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.069
 took 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.800
 by this i killed one object toad before 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.970
 and now you hear me 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.780
 although some will not pass 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.790
 at you 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.709
 until 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.709
 me and quiet 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.599
 It has the same sparingly water side. gave 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.959
 right do you know where okay with that 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.959
 by dude 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.690
 and let the moment 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.400
 if you will 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:35.900
 handsome men joked each other just 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:44.140
 very cool so quiet quiet quiet we need 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:53.890
 here in the destroyed uiiii plane 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:59.230
 yes everything is beautiful epic pancakes are very hard 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:03.010
 softly softly softly from behind I thought someone at 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:11.470
 we are still extinguished and the people of Makarov and 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:11.470
 shepard and there are so many of them 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.910
 quietly but 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.910
 behind someone 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.340
 so better to neatly slowly 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:35.880
 carry them out one by one and not look for yourself 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:40.050
 above to the place of adventure here now 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.260
 exactly behind everything i think is already washing and 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.260
 further so small slalom 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:58.050
 we move ahead we move ahead with us 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.050
 mp5 mp5 boulder very good 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.300
 as for me quietly quietly don't kill 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.300
 kill 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:16.980
 don't touch me i want to live thank you what 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.980
 not killed I will be very grateful to you 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.700
 next life 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.820
 we go up 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:34.130
 all we go we go 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:39.229
 quiet quietly do not push down do not press we run shorter 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.060
 run quietly gently damn I do not even know 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:46.600
 how can you comment on everything here 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:52.090
 quickly sharply tough terrible 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:59.700
 really hot very 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:04.760

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.760

 let's guys thank god 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:20.310
 now we have transportation we will 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:23.600
 it's easier to give your hands a pedal to the floor 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:27.030
 here a machine gun would surely be nice 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:30.030
 rather strange that people shepard 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:34.310
 go on ordinary pickups and people Makarov 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:38.310
 on expensive representative 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.580
 everything seems to be off-road 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.580
 be the opposite 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.110
 quietly quietly 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.110
 pancake 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:55.360
 so here he is, he is a great nikolai 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:59.619
 cargo plane and we fit in there 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:05.050
 immediately with our eyes on which we drive 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:08.629
 shoot really hard for her 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:14.289
 killed killed hand so now quick 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:14.289
 quick quick all thank god
