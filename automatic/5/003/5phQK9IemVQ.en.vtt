drowned out from my testing I found them

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.820 
drowned out from my testing I found them
to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.450> extremely<00:01:45.540> good<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.530> things<00:01:46.740> like

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
but they don't shine as well in John

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.180 
but they don't shine as well in John
Roos<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.149> pop<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:52.380> make<00:01:52.590> poor<00:01:52.890> quality

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
started at the top and then they just

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.470 
started at the top and then they just
sort<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:16.860> taking<00:02:17.310> things<00:02:17.489> away<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.300> move
