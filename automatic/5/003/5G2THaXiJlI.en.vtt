00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.710
 Anyway, the story of mine 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.840
 remembered before I became president 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.110
 i will always consider myself a hunter 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.110
 see 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.710
 My mother was murdered when I was still alive 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.880
 a child was 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.680
 darkness prevails everywhere 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.000
 left 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.269
 I can teach you how to recognize them 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.289
 and how to destroy them 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.700
 they will have them kill you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.300
 it is up to us that it stays that way 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.300
 nation of humans and not monsters 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.730
 how do we start? 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.130
 we have a way to go before I will 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.540
 kill everyone 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.110
 only the living can kill the dead 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.110
 destroy 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.970
 This hunter is a madman 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.350
 It is time for us to become our own nation 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.350
 he 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.340
 I suppose you know what I mean by that 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.470
 maybe that can help against it 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.470
 one of us but against 20
