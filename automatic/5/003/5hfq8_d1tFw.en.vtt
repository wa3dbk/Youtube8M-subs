00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
shells available for the MacBook and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.390 
shells available for the MacBook and
although<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.870> does<00:03:17.290> kind<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.800> fit<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> very

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
although it does kind of fit to the very

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.710 
although it does kind of fit to the very
very<00:03:18.610> sunk<00:03:18.880> fit<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:19.239> it's<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.480> little<00:03:19.630> bit

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
very sunk fit so it's a little bit

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.540 
very sunk fit so it's a little bit
difficult<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.170> take<00:03:20.319> in<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.650> out<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:21.220> biggest

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
difficult to take in and out the biggest

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.220 
difficult to take in and out the biggest
thing<00:03:21.700> was<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:21.970> flat<00:03:22.300> would<00:03:22.569> not<00:03:22.750> secure<00:03:23.140> in

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
thing was the flat would not secure in

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.050 
thing was the flat would not secure in
place<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.950> kind<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.280> left<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.790> know<00:03:24.910> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
place so that kind of left you know the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.729 
place so that kind of left you know the
sleeve<00:03:25.239> open<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.870> potentially<00:03:26.319> your<00:03:26.440> MacBook

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
sleeve open and potentially your MacBook

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.710 
sleeve open and potentially your MacBook
could<00:03:26.890> slide<00:03:27.130> out<00:03:27.340> although<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.180> very<00:03:28.420> snug

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
could slide out although it's very snug

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.600 
could slide out although it's very snug
so<00:03:29.230> that's<00:03:29.410> one<00:03:29.590> big<00:03:29.620> turn-off<00:03:30.040> for<00:03:30.160> me<00:03:30.370> about

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
so that's one big turn-off for me about

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.309 
so that's one big turn-off for me about
the<00:03:30.730> sleeve<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.269> do<00:03:31.510> have<00:03:31.720> another<00:03:31.900> encase
