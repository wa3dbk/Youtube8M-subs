basically we have this southwesterly

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
basically we have this southwesterly
flow<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.869> plenty<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.799> moisture

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
flow so we have plenty of moisture

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
flow so we have plenty of moisture
streaming<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.600> eastern<00:01:31.229> Pacific

streaming in from the eastern Pacific

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.649

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
a lot of moisture to interact with some

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.969 
a lot of moisture to interact with some
cold<00:01:36.390> air<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.630> plunges<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> north

cold air that plunges in from the north

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.670 
cold air that plunges in from the north
so<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> jet<00:01:39.360> stream<00:01:39.540> pattern<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.170> very

extremely heavy precipitation we also

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.250 
extremely heavy precipitation we also
have<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.800> cold<00:02:17.640> airmass<00:02:17.940> working<00:02:18.750> its<00:02:18.900> way<00:02:19.050> in

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
have a cold airmass working its way in

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.690 
have a cold airmass working its way in
from<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.590> north<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.100> you've<00:02:20.370> got<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
from the north so you've got the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.730 
from the north so you've got the
precipitation<00:02:21.390> moving<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.110> from<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.410> west

the cold air moving in from the north

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.870 
the cold air moving in from the north
and<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.870> have<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> recipe<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.460> winter<00:02:26.820> storm

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and you have a recipe for a winter storm

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.390 
and you have a recipe for a winter storm
now<00:02:27.660> Thursday<00:02:28.200> will<00:02:28.380> be<00:02:28.530> fine<00:02:28.800> temperatures

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
will warm up actually close to the mid

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.220 
will warm up actually close to the mid
50's<00:02:32.520> but<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:33.360> before<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.840> cold<00:02:34.080> front

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
50's but that's before a cold front

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
will start plunging in and honestly it

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.400 
will start plunging in and honestly it
could<00:03:35.820> be<00:03:35.940> even<00:03:36.269> earlier<00:03:36.450> than<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.989> shortly

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
could be even earlier than that shortly

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.380 
could be even earlier than that shortly
after<00:03:37.830> midnight<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.519> front<00:03:38.820> looks<00:03:39.030> strong

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
after midnight this front looks strong

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.030 
after midnight this front looks strong
and<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.720> looks<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.019> drop<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.410> temperature<00:03:40.920> and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
and it looks to drop the temperature and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.490 
and it looks to drop the temperature and
sometimes<00:03:41.489> those<00:03:42.060> temperature<00:03:42.630> drops<00:03:42.930> are

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
sometimes those temperature drops are

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.580 
sometimes those temperature drops are
predicted<00:03:44.459> strong<00:03:44.940> enough<00:03:45.360> by<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> computer

over<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.140> snow<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.739> then<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.070> have

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
over to snow and then we have

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.370 
over to snow and then we have
accumulating<00:03:50.850> snow<00:03:51.180> likely<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.930> when<00:03:52.170> does

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
accumulating snow likely so when does

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.650 
accumulating snow likely so when does
all<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.769> arrive<00:03:53.190> well<00:03:53.550> it's<00:03:54.090> going<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.420> start

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
all this arrive well it's going to start

early Wednesday morning as far as the
frozen<00:03:57.120> precipitation<00:03:57.269> work<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:58.290> we're

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
frozen precipitation work so we're

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.080 
frozen precipitation work so we're
talking<00:03:58.620> like<00:03:59.040> four<00:03:59.340> or<00:03:59.430> five<00:03:59.459> a.m.

get going then we're going to have a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.920 
get going then we're going to have a
sleep<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.170> snow<00:04:04.560> mixture<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:06.090> happens<00:04:06.690> late

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
sleep to snow mixture that happens late

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.900 
sleep to snow mixture that happens late
morning<00:04:07.410> as<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.680> cold<00:04:07.920> air<00:04:08.100> continues<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.640> get

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
morning as the cold air continues to get

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.789 
morning as the cold air continues to get
deeper<00:04:09.450> above<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.930> ground<00:04:10.170> that's<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.739> to

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
deeper above the ground that's going to

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.690 
deeper above the ground that's going to
allow<00:04:10.920> for<00:04:11.070> those<00:04:11.900> melted<00:04:12.900> snow<00:04:13.590> flakes<00:04:13.950> to

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
allow for those melted snow flakes to

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.759 
allow for those melted snow flakes to
refreeze<00:04:15.209> into<00:04:15.570> solid<00:04:15.959> balls<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.350> ice<00:04:16.470> now

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
refreeze into solid balls of ice now

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.409 
refreeze into solid balls of ice now
eventually<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.459> cold<00:04:17.760> air<00:04:17.910> is<00:04:18.030> going<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.269> get

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
eventually that cold air is going to get

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.810 
eventually that cold air is going to get
deep<00:04:18.690> enough<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.380> happens<00:04:19.859> from<00:04:20.549> about

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
deep enough and that happens from about

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.090 
deep enough and that happens from about
10<00:04:21.150> am<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.780> little<00:04:22.080> earlier<00:04:22.500> when<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:22.860> work

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
10 am a little earlier when you work

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
your way northward Benton County could

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.990 
your way northward Benton County could
be<00:04:24.810> seeing<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.289> sleet<00:04:25.590> snow<00:04:25.770> mixture<00:04:26.370> even

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
be seeing a sleet snow mixture even

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.560 
be seeing a sleet snow mixture even
earlier<00:04:27.360> the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
earlier the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.720 
earlier the
that<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.140> cold<00:04:28.410> air<00:04:28.650> will<00:04:29.100> be<00:04:29.310> deeper<00:04:29.640> the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
that is that cold air will be deeper the

that is that cold air will be deeper the
farther<00:04:30.060> north<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.330> go<00:04:30.680> accumulating<00:04:31.680> snow

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
farther north you go accumulating snow

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.520 
farther north you go accumulating snow
may<00:04:32.490> last<00:04:32.760> until<00:04:33.210> about<00:04:33.570> nine<00:04:33.840> o'clock<00:04:33.870> in<00:04:34.500> the

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
evening on Wednesday night so the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.690 
evening on Wednesday night so the
heaviest<00:04:37.290> snow<00:04:37.650> potential<00:04:38.100> will<00:04:38.430> be<00:04:38.460> an

snow with overall of Northwest Arkansas

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.980 
snow with overall of Northwest Arkansas
and<00:04:47.730> then<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.060> have<00:04:48.210> in<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.480> river<00:04:48.660> valley

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
and then you have in the river valley

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.350 
and then you have in the river valley
also<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.620> one<00:04:49.980> to<00:04:50.130> two<00:04:50.340> inch<00:04:50.580> sleet<00:04:51.120> snow
