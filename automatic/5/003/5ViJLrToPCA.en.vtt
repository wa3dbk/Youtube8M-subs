way<00:01:33.570> too<00:01:33.630> much<00:01:33.780> neck<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.200> gave<00:01:34.350> her<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.500> scarf

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
way too much neck so I gave her a scarf

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:35.929 
way too much neck so I gave her a scarf
and<00:01:35.100> basically<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:35.610> doing<00:01:35.640> here<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and basically what I'm doing here is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.670 
and basically what I'm doing here is
just<00:01:36.000> adding<00:01:36.420> some<00:01:36.570> color<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.170> sched<00:01:37.409> so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
just adding some color to the sched so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
just adding some color to the sched so
that<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.250> things<00:01:38.460> stand<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that so things stand out a bit more so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.510 
that so things stand out a bit more so
that<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.770> what's<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.310> when

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that I know what like what's what when

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
that I know what like what's what when
I'm<00:01:41.640> doing<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> ink<00:01:42.299> layer<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.930> helps<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
I'm doing the ink layer and this helps a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.190 
I'm doing the ink layer and this helps a
lot<00:01:43.409> because<00:01:43.619> instead<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.869> keeping

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
lot because instead of like just keeping

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440 
lot because instead of like just keeping
all<00:01:46.380> those<00:01:46.560> random<00:01:46.950> lines<00:01:47.369> sometimes<00:01:48.329> when

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
all those random lines sometimes when

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.700 
all those random lines sometimes when
you're<00:01:48.570> doing<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> ink<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.259> can't<00:01:49.500> tell

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
you're doing the ink you can't tell

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.560 
you're doing the ink you can't tell
what's<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.520> there's<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.180> some

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
what's what like there's just some

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.969 
what's what like there's just some
random<00:01:51.840> lines<00:01:52.200> everywhere<00:01:52.500> near<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.829> it's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
random lines everywhere near like it's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
random lines everywhere near like it's
all<00:01:53.130> wrinkled<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.360> part<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> her

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
all wrinkled or is that like part of her

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.730 
all wrinkled or is that like part of her
shirt<00:01:55.460> but<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.759> don't<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.170> why<00:01:58.409> I

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
shirt but I don't know so that's why I

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.950 
shirt but I don't know so that's why I
blocked<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> colors<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.360> her<00:02:00.479> gloves<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
blocked in the colors for her gloves and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.060 
blocked in the colors for her gloves and
her<00:02:01.079> scarf<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:01.799> something

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
her scarf because that's something

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.880 
her scarf because that's something
separate<00:02:02.460> from<00:02:02.579> her<00:02:02.790> coat<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> should<00:02:03.810> be

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
separate from her coat so it should be

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.800 
separate from her coat so it should be
standing<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.040> from<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> rest<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
standing out from the rest of it that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.809 
standing out from the rest of it that
just<00:02:06.840> helps<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> lot<00:02:07.439> especially<00:02:08.190> when<00:02:08.550> things

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
just helps a lot especially when things

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.999 
just helps a lot especially when things
are<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.119> overlapping<00:02:09.509> other<00:02:10.080> things<00:02:10.410> like

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
are like overlapping other things like

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.580 
are like overlapping other things like
scarves<00:02:11.670> or

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
scarves or

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.550 
scarves or
necklaces<00:02:13.160> or<00:02:13.430> something<00:02:13.790> it's<00:02:14.269> I'll<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:15.410> I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
necklaces or something it's I'll like I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.080 
necklaces or something it's I'll like I
know<00:02:15.620> at<00:02:15.920> least<00:02:15.980> for<00:02:16.310> me<00:02:16.430> I'll<00:02:16.849> sometimes

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
know at least for me I'll sometimes

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.610 
know at least for me I'll sometimes
forget<00:02:17.540> those<00:02:17.690> things<00:02:17.720> even<00:02:18.379> though<00:02:18.470> they're

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
forget those things even though they're

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.259 
forget those things even though they're
in<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.890> sketch<00:02:19.129> when<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.700> go<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:19.910> ink<00:02:20.120> it

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
in the sketch when I go to ink it

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.449 
in the sketch when I go to ink it
because<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:21.080> didn't<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:21.920> don't<00:02:22.099> really<00:02:22.250> notice

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
because I didn't I don't really notice

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.920 
because I didn't I don't really notice
it<00:02:22.670> anymore<00:02:22.879> so<00:02:23.209> that's<00:02:23.390> why<00:02:23.569> I'll<00:02:23.750> like

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
it anymore so that's why I'll like

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.800 
it anymore so that's why I'll like
blackout<00:02:24.349> like<00:02:24.739> accessories<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.780> I

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
blackout like accessories so that I

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.990 
blackout like accessories so that I
don't<00:02:27.019> miss<00:02:27.709> them<00:02:27.950> when<00:02:28.310> I'm<00:02:28.430> doing<00:02:28.640> thinking

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
don't miss them when I'm doing thinking

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.580 
don't miss them when I'm doing thinking
because<00:02:29.299> once<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.599> finish<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> inking<00:02:30.470> I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
because once I finish the inking I

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.900 
because once I finish the inking I
really<00:02:30.799> don't<00:02:30.980> go<00:02:31.160> back<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.549> add<00:02:31.640> things

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
really don't go back and add things

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.150 
really don't go back and add things
afterwards<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.660> don't<00:02:33.080> know<00:02:33.200> why<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.650> just<00:02:33.709> don't

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
afterwards I don't know why I just don't

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.559 
afterwards I don't know why I just don't
so<00:02:34.489> that's<00:02:34.670> why<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:34.819> try<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.060> make<00:02:35.299> sure<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.450> do

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
so that's why I try to make sure I do

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.000 
so that's why I try to make sure I do
everything<00:02:35.840> all<00:02:36.260> at<00:02:36.290> once<00:02:36.530> now<00:02:36.890> I'm

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
everything all at once now I'm

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.890 
everything all at once now I'm
continuing<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.610> do<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> inking<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.510> I'm

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
continuing to do the inking and I'm

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.809 
continuing to do the inking and I'm
doing<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.200> hair<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.680> for<00:02:40.220> hair<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.549> like<00:02:40.730> to

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
doing the hair and for hair I like to

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.369 
doing the hair and for hair I like to
make<00:02:40.940> sure<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.209> looks<00:02:41.360> really<00:02:41.720> flowy<00:02:42.049> when

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
make sure it looks really flowy when

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.900 
make sure it looks really flowy when
it's<00:02:42.530> short<00:02:42.709> because<00:02:43.099> when<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.430> short<00:02:43.760> and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
it's short because when it's short and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.460 
it's short because when it's short and
it<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.209> looks<00:02:44.390> really<00:02:44.450> heavy<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.230> it's<00:02:45.319> just

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
it just looks really heavy and it's just

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.559 
it just looks really heavy and it's just
like<00:02:45.620> sitting<00:02:46.099> there<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.489> don't<00:02:47.299> like<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> way

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
like sitting there I don't like the way

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.910 
like sitting there I don't like the way
that<00:02:47.720> looks<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.049> I<00:02:48.079> try<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.290> make<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.620> look<00:02:48.769> like

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
that looks so I try to make it look like

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.069 
that looks so I try to make it look like
like<00:02:49.340> pretend<00:02:49.880> she's<00:02:50.180> like<00:02:50.360> jumping<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:50.989> and

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
like pretend she's like jumping up and

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.360 
like pretend she's like jumping up and
down<00:02:51.290> or<00:02:51.470> something<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.920> her<00:02:51.980> hair<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.220> like

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
down or something and her hair is like

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.610 
down or something and her hair is like
bouncing<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.299> like<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.930> think<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.349> it's<00:02:54.560> more

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
bouncing I like to think of it it's more

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.650 
bouncing I like to think of it it's more
bouncy<00:02:55.430> because<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:55.880> shorter<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:56.510> there's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
bouncy because it's shorter so there's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.180 
bouncy because it's shorter so there's
less<00:02:56.840> weighing<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.349> down<00:02:57.379> so<00:02:57.769> it'll<00:02:57.890> just<00:02:58.069> be

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
less weighing it down so it'll just be

and for her earmuffs I tried a little
technique<00:04:22.110> where<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.640> first<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.850> blocked<00:04:24.150> out

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
technique where I first I blocked out

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.240

the color the darker color of the
earmuffs<00:04:26.550> like<00:04:27.060> where<00:04:27.360> I'd<00:04:27.540> want<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.870> shading

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
earmuffs like where I'd want the shading

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.600 
earmuffs like where I'd want the shading
to<00:04:28.320> be<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.620> then<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:28.920> took<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.100> lighter<00:04:29.370> color

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
to be and then I took the lighter color

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.430 
to be and then I took the lighter color
again<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.000> like<00:04:30.120> spotted<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.900> all<00:04:31.080> over<00:04:31.320> the

again and like spotted it all over the
place<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.770> make<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.190> earmuffs<00:04:32.670> look<00:04:32.880> fluffy

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
probably the right word and I'm just

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.650 
probably the right word and I'm just
going<00:04:41.610> through<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:42.060> rest<00:04:42.240> of<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.420> picture

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
going through the rest of the picture

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.640 
going through the rest of the picture
and<00:04:42.720> adding<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> little<00:04:43.170> bit<00:04:43.290> of<00:04:43.350> shading

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
and adding a little bit of shading

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.380 
and adding a little bit of shading
everywhere<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.430> then<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.640> was<00:04:44.940> going<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.240> do<00:04:45.360> a

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
everywhere and then I was going to do a

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.240 
everywhere and then I was going to do a
background<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.260> then<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.380> kind<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.770> got<00:04:46.920> Laney

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
background and then I kind of got Laney

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.370 
background and then I kind of got Laney
Laney<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.120> decided<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.570> gradient<00:04:48.810> just

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
Laney and so I decided a gradient just

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.020 
Laney and so I decided a gradient just
so<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.770> could<00:04:49.920> see<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.280> breath<00:04:50.730> coming

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
so that you could see the breath coming

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.120 
so that you could see the breath coming
out<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.330> her<00:04:51.420> hair<00:04:51.690> or<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.170> mean<00:04:52.380> her<00:04:52.560> mouth<00:04:52.710> it's

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
out of her hair or I mean her mouth it's

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.890 
out of her hair or I mean her mouth it's
not<00:04:53.190> coming<00:04:53.370> out<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:53.610> her<00:04:53.670> hair<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.600> after<00:04:54.840> the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
not coming out of her hair and after the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.000 
not coming out of her hair and after the
background<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.320> just<00:04:55.350> added<00:04:55.620> these<00:04:55.800> things

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
background I just added these things

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.430 
background I just added these things
that<00:04:56.130> kind<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.340> look<00:04:56.490> like<00:04:56.520> evergreens<00:04:57.440> just

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
bet green trees their silhouettes

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.780 
bet green trees their silhouettes
and<00:05:04.110> then<00:05:04.230> I<00:05:04.260> added<00:05:04.410> some<00:05:04.530> snowflakes<00:05:05.340> kind<00:05:05.730> of

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
and then I added some snowflakes kind of

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
and then I added some snowflakes kind of
falling<00:05:06.060> everywhere<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.450> wrote<00:05:06.570> happy

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
falling everywhere and wrote happy

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.950

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
then some more flakes and then I walked

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.720 
then some more flakes and then I walked
away<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.410> when<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.560> came<00:05:13.680> back<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.190> thought<00:05:14.550> that

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
away and when I came back I thought that

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.710

the breath counts so I fixed it a little

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.030

bit no it's a little bit more like a
heart<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.880> looks<00:05:21.180> oh<00:05:21.330> good<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.290> awesome
