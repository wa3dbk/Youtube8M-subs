00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
mp7 in the p90 ohh close this means it's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.080 
mp7 in the p90 ohh close this means it's
not<00:01:07.619> quite<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:07.979> powerful<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.520> weapons<00:01:08.850> such<00:01:09.060> as

not quite as powerful as weapons such as

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.530

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the ump45 of pp-2000 but a long range

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.499 
the ump45 of pp-2000 but a long range
compared<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> mp7<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> p90<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:15.119> reload

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
compared to the mp7 in the p90 is reload

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.450 
compared to the mp7 in the p90 is reload
to<00:01:15.810> gun<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.259> targets<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.130> one

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
to gun your targets down it's just one

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.570 
to gun your targets down it's just one
less<00:01:17.670> shot<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> kill<00:01:18.500> still<00:01:19.500> 12.5<00:01:20.220> damage

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
less shot to kill still 12.5 damage

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.039 
less shot to kill still 12.5 damage
means<00:01:20.790> you're<00:01:20.939> gonna<00:01:21.060> need<00:01:21.180> eight<00:01:21.450> shots<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
means you're gonna need eight shots to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.870

kill<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.259> long<00:01:22.470> range<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.580> definitely

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
kill at long range so this definitely

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.870 
kill at long range so this definitely
makes<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.390> m5<00:01:24.840> k<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.890> PDW<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.670> around

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
makes the m5 k and the PDW is all around

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.330 
makes the m5 k and the PDW is all around
while<00:01:27.270> close<00:01:27.540> range<00:01:27.869> weapons<00:01:28.290> there's<00:01:29.220> only

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
want to play around with it let's take a

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.720 
want to play around with it let's take a
look<00:04:07.410> at<00:04:07.500> my<00:04:07.620> recommendations<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.670> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
look at my recommendations of a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.210 
look at my recommendations of a
configuration<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.480> attachments<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:11.100> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
configuration of attachments so the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.320 
configuration of attachments so the
optic<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.610> think<00:04:11.790> any<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.150> low

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
optic I think any of the low

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.300 
optic I think any of the low
magnification<00:04:12.690> sights<00:04:13.410> are<00:04:13.800> pretty<00:04:14.190> good

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
magnification sights are pretty good

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.280 
magnification sights are pretty good
with<00:04:14.519> this<00:04:14.610> weapon<00:04:15.030> we<00:04:15.450> get<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.720> reflex<00:04:16.109> red

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
with this weapon we get the reflex red

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.770 
with this weapon we get the reflex red
dot<00:04:16.320> sight<00:04:16.680> first<00:04:16.980> after<00:04:17.370> just<00:04:17.519> 10<00:04:17.730> kills<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
dot sight first after just 10 kills the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.270 
dot sight first after just 10 kills the
eye<00:04:18.810> sights<00:04:19.140> on<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.440> weapon<00:04:19.590> aren't<00:04:19.890> too<00:04:20.040> bad

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
eye sights on this weapon aren't too bad

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.800 
eye sights on this weapon aren't too bad
but<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.489> get<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.760> see<00:04:20.910> more<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.150> your<00:04:21.330> target

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
but you get to see more of your target

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.150 
but you get to see more of your target
through<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.109> reflex<00:04:22.650> red<00:04:22.830> dot<00:04:22.860> sight<00:04:23.280> when

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
through a reflex red dot sight when

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.010 
through a reflex red dot sight when
and<00:04:24.490> that<00:04:24.880> little<00:04:25.120> red<00:04:25.240> dot<00:04:25.270> makes<00:04:25.630> it<00:04:25.780> easy<00:04:25.900> to

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
and that little red dot makes it easy to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.750 
and that little red dot makes it easy to
line<00:04:26.320> up<00:04:26.440> your<00:04:26.560> shots<00:04:26.860> especially<00:04:27.520> with<00:04:27.640> the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
line up your shots especially with the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.850 
line up your shots especially with the
low<00:04:27.940> recoil<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.480> this<00:04:28.690> weapon<00:04:29.050> for<00:04:29.800> the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
low recoil of this weapon for the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.620 
low recoil of this weapon for the
primary<00:04:30.310> slot<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.700> laser<00:04:30.910> sight<00:04:31.180> like<00:04:31.450> I'd

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
primary slot the laser sight like I'd

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.690 
primary slot the laser sight like I'd
usually<00:04:31.960> recommend<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.560> pdws<00:04:33.220> would<00:04:33.520> be<00:04:33.670> a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
usually recommend the pdws would be a

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.270 
usually recommend the pdws would be a
good<00:04:33.850> choice<00:04:34.120> but<00:04:35.050> with<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.350> m5k<00:04:35.950> low

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
good choice but with the m5k low

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.160 
good choice but with the m5k low
close-range<00:04:36.850> damage<00:04:37.300> you<00:04:37.630> really<00:04:37.870> need<00:04:38.020> all

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
close-range damage you really need all

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.420 
close-range damage you really need all
the<00:04:38.260> help<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:38.440> can<00:04:38.590> get<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:38.980> those<00:04:39.130> close

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
the help you can get in those close

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.490 
the help you can get in those close
range<00:04:39.700> engagements<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.140> found<00:04:41.410> the

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
range engagements so I found the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.900 
range engagements so I found the
tactical<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:42.070> was<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.310> great<00:04:42.550> help

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
tactical I was a great help

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.760 
tactical I was a great help
just<00:04:43.420> to<00:04:43.510> impair<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.020> enemy's<00:04:44.320> vision<00:04:44.350> and

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
just to impair the enemy's vision and

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.770 
just to impair the enemy's vision and
give<00:04:44.860> you<00:04:44.920> that<00:04:44.950> extra<00:04:45.100> split<00:04:45.640> second<00:04:46.090> start

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
give you that extra split second start
