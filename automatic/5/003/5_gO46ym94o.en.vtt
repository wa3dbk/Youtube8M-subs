00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
inside and it definitely blocks out a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.639 
inside and it definitely blocks out a
good<00:00:45.480> amount<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.809> noise<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.559> they

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
good amount of noise because they

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.010 
good amount of noise because they
actually<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.980> nice<00:00:47.520> cancellation<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.420> when

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
actually have nice cancellation and when

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
executives is the fact that of course

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.599 
executives is the fact that of course
you<00:02:33.790> do<00:02:33.969> have<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.329> deal<00:02:34.569> with<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:36.489> know

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
you do have to deal with the you know

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.300 
you do have to deal with the you know
the<00:02:36.730> battery<00:02:36.969> situation<00:02:37.810> where<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.889> know<00:02:39.010> get

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
the battery situation where you know get

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.580 
the battery situation where you know get
discharged<00:02:39.870> even<00:02:40.870> though<00:02:40.959> that's<00:02:41.049> very<00:02:41.379> nice

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
discharged even though that's very nice

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.740 
discharged even though that's very nice
how<00:02:41.769> this<00:02:41.950> slides<00:02:42.280> off<00:02:42.549> is<00:02:42.730> very<00:02:42.969> its<00:02:43.120> magnetic

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
how this slides off is very its magnetic

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.099 
how this slides off is very its magnetic
so<00:02:44.109> this<00:02:44.349> goes<00:02:44.560> right<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.980> which<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.400> great<00:02:46.109> and

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
so this goes right in which is great and

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.740 
so this goes right in which is great and
the<00:02:48.040> noise<00:02:48.280> cancellation<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.909> do<00:02:49.120> hear<00:02:49.329> a<00:02:49.359> bit

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the noise cancellation you do hear a bit

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.140 
the noise cancellation you do hear a bit
of<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.930> hissing<00:02:50.319> you<00:02:50.409> cut<00:02:50.590> these<00:02:50.769> on<00:02:51.150> so

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
of a hissing you cut these on so

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.629 
of a hissing you cut these on so
definitely<00:02:52.510> keep<00:02:52.659> that<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.900> mind<00:02:53.200> but<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:54.310> can

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
definitely keep that in mind but I I can

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.099 
definitely keep that in mind but I I can
understand<00:02:55.120> why<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.569> definitely<00:02:55.959> for

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
understand why you know definitely for

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.110 
understand why you know definitely for
the<00:02:56.200> look<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.950> look<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.400> build<00:02:57.639> quality<00:02:57.819> I

know close up the headphones got a lot

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.569 
know close up the headphones got a lot
of<00:03:10.659> ways<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.079> do<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.409> but<00:03:12.159> you<00:03:12.489> know

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
of ways you can do that but you know

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.089 
of ways you can do that but you know
both<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.969> these<00:03:13.060> are<00:03:13.409> $2.99<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.889> they

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
both of these are $2.99 and that they

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.449 
both of these are $2.99 and that they
definitely<00:03:15.280> appeal<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.909> different<00:03:17.459> type

definitely appeal to different type
people<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.000> think<00:03:19.479> basically<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.620> know<00:03:20.919> the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
people I think basically you know the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.490 
people I think basically you know the
they<00:03:21.790> said<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.090> beats<00:03:22.299> executive<00:03:22.870> two<00:03:23.019> stylish

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
they said it beats executive two stylish

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.520 
they said it beats executive two stylish
the<00:03:23.709> more<00:03:23.949> kind<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.519> grown-up<00:03:24.790> look<00:03:25.530> you're

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
the more kind of grown-up look you're

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.710 
the more kind of grown-up look you're
gonna<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.579> executive<00:03:27.879> but<00:03:28.329> I'll<00:03:28.540> be

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
gonna like the executive but I'll be

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.039 
gonna like the executive but I'll be
honest<00:03:29.019> with<00:03:29.169> you<00:03:29.319> I<00:03:30.010> like<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.669> executive<00:03:31.049> it

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
you know the look of them but I think

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.569 
you know the look of them but I think
that's<00:03:34.239> really<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.689> only<00:03:34.720> thing<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.829> it

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
that's really the only thing that it

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.360 
that's really the only thing that it
beats<00:03:36.970> out<00:03:37.180> on<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.229> the<00:03:38.560> studio's<00:03:38.979> I<00:03:39.129> mean<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
beats out on the the studio's I mean the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.309
