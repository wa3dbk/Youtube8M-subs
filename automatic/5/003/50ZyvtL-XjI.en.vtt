00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hey everyone, Soul Blind and I'm going to tell you tonight. 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.520
 teach to serve the perfect 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.990
 part of art games 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:18.000
 Welcome, said the doctor of the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:19.529
 Church, that's it, I'll bet 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.300
 many of you already know this 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.100
 beautiful guinness beer thing is a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.199
 the most famous breweries and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.050
 traditional guiness brewery 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.150
 was founded in 1759 in Dublin in Ireland 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 by a guy named arthur guinness and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.870
 currently marketed in more than 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.399
 100 countries in the world for our luck o 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.590
 one of them and is easily 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.559
 found in panes shop bars 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.450
 specialized supermarkets and supermarkets 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.739
 if you still do not know it's the tip 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.809
 but then you ask me, it's not 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.239
 simply open the can and serve 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.950
 beer and I answer you not to serve 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.020
 correctly the mayor part of games 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.059
 more attention is needed 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.070
 I'll explain even though I registered the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.399
 name of beer the correct way to 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.829
 speak would be mgf or 24 in Portuguese 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.960
 it would be something like the game show and when 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 You go on the bench and ask magness eagles. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.189
 in the pressure it is served with the use of 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.250
 cylinders containing a mixture of 25% 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.170
 of carbon dioxide and 75% of nitrogen 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.080
 this happens because the balls produced 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.390
 nitrogen gas are much smaller than 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.030
 those produced by carbon dioxide 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.340
 confers a differentiated creaminess to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.350
 foam of that beer as in the pressure was 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 served that way, she worried 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.280
 also with your canned beer 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 adding to it a device that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.570
 did the guinness on can arrive well 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.220
 close to a relative of a game served in the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.049
 version an Irish pub 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.970
 this device deals with this small 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.070
 that they call video in the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.600
 It's true, a plastic ball in the field. 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.520
 with a small hole then the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.310
 procedure is as follows they take a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.049
 can put this ball with 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.869
 a little bit of beer liquid inside 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.479
 fill the beer can inject a gas 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.759
 carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen and close 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.719
 there when they close a gap 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.700
 liquid hydrogen becomes 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.930
 gaseous nitrogen, this causes the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.479
 can pressure increase dramatically 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.430
 this increase in the internal pressure of the can 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.500
 makes the nitrogen carbon dioxide 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.420
 be pushed into this 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.610
 through the little hole and 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 after that happens the ball stays 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.930
 had stopped inside the can including 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.580
 You rock the can of games you go 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.260
 realize that the ball is in here. 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.660
 there when you open your can of 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.250
 depressurising and the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.440
 ball begins to stir inside the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.970
 can releasing carbon dioxide and gas 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.220
 hydrogen and this makes your 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.590
 canned 15 beer has the same 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.600
 creaminess produced by the subway genius 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.190
 that your party of games taken direct 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.560
 in the pressure machine it is because 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.300
 of this peculiarity of guinness 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.200
 that many people mistake the way 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.700
 correct to actually do your service 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.670
 with three bedrooms 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.650
 now where did you get the rebound but the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.750
 reality is that they served art magness 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.400
 can be a very simple procedure. 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.170
 first step to serve the mayor 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.840
 part of games is to put there have a 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.300
 flat surface open the can and leave the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.220
 indian act for about 10 seconds releasing 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.260
 all nitrogen if you are 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.150
 using the original game panel 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.360
 second step is quite simple put the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.220
 water down between punk 45 degrees and 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.739
 start serving the beer gently 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.239
 until the liquid touches the water when 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.549
 this happens you go to the last 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.860
 step that gradually leave the body 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.200
 in pet serving beer until the end 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.000
 ready is there the country mayor worthy and 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.870
 now it's just you enjoy this beautiful 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.870
 cascade effect 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.280
 cascade effect is produced by the action 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.050
 of nitrogen in beer first you 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.130
 wants to finish his service and 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.410
 when your father is rested 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.460
 so it's ready to be 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.660
 tasted there many ask ah but if 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.180
 does not have the original 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.650
 Guinea-Bissau half a height of water in 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.510
 regional guinea park is 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.390
 approximately two and a half fingers 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.980
 the top of the country so it's only up to you to 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.530
 country you have in your house 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.500
 give me two fingers and a half put your 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.480
 index finger on the point that will 45 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.310
 degrees and do the service until the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.470
 beer touch points on your finger 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.140
 indicator when this happens you go 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.570
 next step that is and turning the parent until 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.400
 stay straight and you continue to serve the 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.440
 rest of the beer so service 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.970
 guinea is very simple but he has some 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.100
 the first is to leave the 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.590
 device to do its services second 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.540
 is to always look at the father of 45 degrees and 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.430
 kindly serve the third is when 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.410
 more or less at this point in time. 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.200
 which is indicated here by the harp of the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.150
 games you get to become the relative and 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.919
 leave it standing until you complete the 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.900
 the rest of the service after that you 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.730
 appreciates the cascade effect that when it 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.980
 finished just play and start drinking 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.780
 and you 've already taken part in games 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.310
 I knew the correct service from the guide 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.900
 tin was made that way 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.669
 so the channel and leave below the 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.110
 comments and questions and if you want 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.060
 watch also the video that I do 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.100
 reviews beer rating yet 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.450
 tell a few stories about it is just 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.550
