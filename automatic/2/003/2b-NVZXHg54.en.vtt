I'm going to talk you through the
features<00:00:05.960> of<00:00:06.140> our<00:00:06.590> Voyager<00:00:07.099> 2<00:00:07.279> IX<00:00:07.760> which<00:00:08.059> is<00:00:08.240> in

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
features of our Voyager 2 IX which is in

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.360 
features of our Voyager 2 IX which is in
our<00:00:08.510> range<00:00:08.990> so<00:00:09.230> you<00:00:09.679> can<00:00:09.830> see<00:00:09.950> here<00:00:10.129> that<00:00:10.280> the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
our range so you can see here that the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.879 
our range so you can see here that the
Voyager<00:00:10.730> 2<00:00:11.120> e^x<00:00:11.540> is<00:00:11.719> based<00:00:12.019> on<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:12.320> Voyager<00:00:12.709> 2

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
Voyager 2 e^x is based on the Voyager 2

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.640 
Voyager 2 e^x is based on the Voyager 2
but<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:13.669> e<00:00:13.700> X<00:00:13.999> is<00:00:14.269> for<00:00:14.509> this<00:00:14.660> extended<00:00:15.349> porch

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
but the e X is for this extended porch

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.560 
but the e X is for this extended porch
area<00:00:15.860> at<00:00:16.190> the<00:00:16.340> front<00:00:16.370> so<00:00:17.060> it<00:00:17.150> sleeps<00:00:17.390> two

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
area at the front so it sleeps two

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.090 
area at the front so it sleeps two
people<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.020> it's<00:00:18.170> a<00:00:18.260> tunnel<00:00:18.470> design<00:00:18.680> 10

that<00:00:36.920> we<00:00:36.980> use<00:00:37.129> for<00:00:37.249> the<00:00:37.370> tent<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.760> made<00:00:37.969> of

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
that we use for the tent is made of

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.500 
that we use for the tent is made of
these<00:00:38.510> t6<00:00:39.410> alloy<00:00:39.859> poles<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:41.149> these<00:00:41.359> have<00:00:41.480> been

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
these t6 alloy poles and these have been

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.759 
these t6 alloy poles and these have been
anodized<00:00:41.989> just<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:42.320> stop<00:00:42.530> them<00:00:42.649> from

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
anodized just to stop them from

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.520 
anodized just to stop them from
corroding<00:00:43.359> you'll<00:00:44.359> also<00:00:44.480> find<00:00:44.749> that<00:00:44.929> we<00:00:45.230> color

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
corroding you'll also find that we color

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.410 
corroding you'll also find that we color
code<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.339> pool<00:00:46.550> sleeves<00:00:46.879> just<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.149> make<00:00:47.269> sure

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
code the pool sleeves just to make sure

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.520 
code the pool sleeves just to make sure
that<00:00:47.539> you're<00:00:47.659> gonna<00:00:47.749> get<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.019> right<00:00:48.199> pole<00:00:48.440> in

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
that you're gonna get the right pole in

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.829 
that you're gonna get the right pole in
the<00:00:48.620> right<00:00:48.649> place<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.179> pitching<00:00:50.179> is<00:00:50.420> very<00:00:50.659> very

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
the right place so pitching is very very

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.090 
the right place so pitching is very very
simple<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.460> all<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.289> poles<00:00:54.289> they<00:00:54.679> start

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
simple and all of the poles they start

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.889 
simple and all of the poles they start
on<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.309> outside<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:55.999> transferred<00:00:56.539> into

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
on the outside and then transferred into

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.049 
on the outside and then transferred into
these<00:00:57.050> flat<00:00:57.769> pole<00:00:58.010> sleeves<00:00:58.249> across<00:00:58.729> the<00:00:58.879> top

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
these flat pole sleeves across the top

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.509 
these flat pole sleeves across the top
here<00:00:59.089> so<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.600> keeps<00:01:00.139> the<00:01:00.499> tent<00:01:00.859> very

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
here so that keeps the tent very

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.790 
here so that keeps the tent very
aerodynamic<00:01:01.819> and<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:03.139> means<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:03.409> it's<00:01:03.620> also

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
aerodynamic and it means that it's also

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.429 
aerodynamic and it means that it's also
nice<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.640> stable<00:01:04.970> as<00:01:05.120> well<00:01:05.269> in<00:01:06.079> terms<00:01:06.110> of

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
nice and stable as well in terms of

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.830 
nice and stable as well in terms of
stability<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.130> that's<00:01:07.820> added<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.240> with<00:01:08.659> these

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
stability and that's added to with these

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.330 
stability and that's added to with these
Robin's<00:01:09.380> guide<00:01:09.590> lines<00:01:09.799> here<00:01:10.009> which<00:01:10.189> are

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
Robin's guide lines here which are
