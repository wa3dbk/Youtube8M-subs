that because I can't tell but this piece
of<00:03:17.170> driftwood<00:03:17.290> right<00:03:18.069> there<00:03:18.400> it's<00:03:19.269> actually

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
of driftwood right there it's actually

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.610 
of driftwood right there it's actually
holding<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:20.079> up<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.819> nice<00:03:21.819> this<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:23.290> driftwood

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
holding it up a nice this this driftwood

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.589 
holding it up a nice this this driftwood
goes<00:03:23.920> like<00:03:24.129> this<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.760> there's<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.090> big<00:03:25.329> rock<00:03:25.569> to

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
hold it down then that can support this

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.000 
hold it down then that can support this
long<00:03:28.209> long<00:03:28.750> piece<00:03:29.049> here

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010

two<00:03:47.200> filters<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.830> believe<00:03:48.069> for<00:03:48.310> close<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:49.800> close

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
two filters I believe for close to close

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.890 
two filters I believe for close to close
to<00:03:50.980> two<00:03:51.129> years<00:03:51.160> now<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.790> these<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.569> they're

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
to two years now on these so they're

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.050 
to two years now on these so they're
getting<00:03:53.019> old<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:53.650> they're<00:03:53.830> just<00:03:54.430> not<00:03:54.610> working

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
getting old and they're just not working

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.259
