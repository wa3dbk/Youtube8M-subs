be<00:03:13.610> of<00:03:14.209> course<00:03:14.480> Madden<00:03:14.930> but<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.350> probably<00:03:15.610> mad

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
be of course Madden but it probably mad

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.490 
be of course Madden but it probably mad
at<00:03:16.790> think<00:03:17.680> 96-97<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.970> sega<00:03:20.300> I<00:03:20.570> think<00:03:21.380> that's

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
at think 96-97 on a sega I think that's

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.900 
at think 96-97 on a sega I think that's
when<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.650> first<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:22.190> know<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.370> was<00:03:22.550> like<00:03:22.700> all

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
when it first you know it was like all

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.229 
when it first you know it was like all
man<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.300> big<00:03:23.450> deal<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.880> that's<00:03:25.880> when<00:03:26.180> they

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
man is a big deal and that's when they

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.210 
man is a big deal and that's when they
had<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.450> snow<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.080> know<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.650> involved

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
had the snow and you know and involved

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.070 
had the snow and you know and involved
and<00:03:28.340> everything<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.180> think<00:03:29.630> man<00:03:29.810> or

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
and everything and I think man or

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.620 
and everything and I think man or

mobile you remember I have that on me

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.300 
mobile you remember I have that on me
and<00:03:35.690> my<00:03:35.750> kids<00:03:35.780> played<00:03:36.140> on<00:03:36.230> DS<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.920> have<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.130> take

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
and my kids played on DS we have to take

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.800 
and my kids played on DS we have to take
my<00:03:37.430> board<00:03:37.610> is<00:03:37.820> I<00:03:38.030> think<00:03:38.090> that's<00:03:38.300> I<00:03:38.540> think<00:03:38.600> that

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
my board is I think that's I think that

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.420 
my board is I think that's I think that
bad<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.110> was<00:03:39.200> technical<00:03:39.680> because<00:03:40.100> they<00:03:40.250> had

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
bad so it was technical because they had

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.370 
bad so it was technical because they had
that<00:03:40.730> was<00:03:40.850> like<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.090> easiest<00:03:41.450> football<00:03:42.200> game

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
that was like the easiest football game

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.320 
that was like the easiest football game
for<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> girl<00:03:42.860> because<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.250> was<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.519> passing<00:03:44.150> and

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
for a girl because it was to passing and

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.240 
for a girl because it was to passing and
to<00:03:44.360> rushing<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.050> I<00:03:45.140> think<00:03:45.380> that's<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.100> that's

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
to rushing and I think that's it that's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.520 
to rushing and I think that's it that's
all<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.489> need<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.030> I'm<00:03:47.600> well<00:03:48.110> you're<00:03:48.380> in<00:03:48.500> the
