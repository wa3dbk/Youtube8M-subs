this<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.930> easy<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.160> use<00:00:50.250> biped

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
this really easy to do if you use biped

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.810 
this really easy to do if you use biped
you<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.719> into<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> create<00:00:52.260> panel<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> very

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you go into the create panel at the very

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.229 
you go into the create panel at the very
end<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.110> systems<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.059> you<00:00:57.059> get

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
end here you have systems and you get

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
end here you have systems and you get
these<00:00:57.360> options<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.109> make<00:00:58.289> bones<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:59.640> can

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
these options you can make bones you can

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.330 
these options you can make bones you can
make<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.120> biped<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> character

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
make a biped now for a character

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
make a biped now for a character
especially<00:01:02.550> an<00:01:03.090> upright<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.690> humanoid

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
especially an upright a humanoid

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.770 
especially an upright a humanoid
character<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:05.670> pet<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.060> easiest<00:01:06.420> thing<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
character by pet is the easiest thing to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.560 
character by pet is the easiest thing to
do<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.570> different

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
do what you have here is different

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.850 
do what you have here is different
options<00:01:09.960> I'm<00:01:10.860> using<00:01:11.220> 3d<00:01:11.640> max<00:01:11.820> 9<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.860> older

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
options I'm using 3d max 9 and older

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.190 
options I'm using 3d max 9 and older
versions<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> few<00:01:15.299> less<00:01:15.450> options<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
versions have a few less options and I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.450 
versions have a few less options and I
think<00:01:16.380> newer<00:01:16.560> versions<00:01:16.950> might<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.250> more

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
think newer versions might have more

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.130 
think newer versions might have more
options<00:01:18.710> right<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:19.880> I'll<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.479> make<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> few

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
options right here I'll just make a few

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.190 
options right here I'll just make a few
and<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.009> check<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.509> I'm<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.750> biped

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and you can check it out I'm in biped

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.580 
and you can check it out I'm in biped
mode<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> click<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> drag<00:01:27.590> that's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
mode I'm going to click and drag that's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.899 
mode I'm going to click and drag that's
a<00:01:28.740> biped<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.000> classic<00:01:30.420> body<00:01:30.630> type<00:01:31.909> that's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
a biped it's a classic body type that's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.230 
a biped it's a classic body type that's
a<00:01:33.030> female<00:01:33.470> male<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:36.270> skeleton<00:01:37.880> now<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.939> think

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
a female male and a skeleton now I think

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.700 
a female male and a skeleton now I think
just<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:39.840> old<00:01:40.020> school<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
just because I'm old school I like the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
just because I'm old school I like the
classic<00:01:41.100> body<00:01:41.310> type<00:01:42.259> but<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.530> choose

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
classic body type but you can choose

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.609 
classic body type but you can choose
whichever<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:45.229> now<00:01:46.229> strangely

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
whichever one you want now strangely

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.240 
whichever one you want now strangely
enough<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.100> helps<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:48.890> rename<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> route

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
enough it helps to rename the route

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.219 
enough it helps to rename the route
right<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> create<00:01:51.450> panel<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
right here in the create panel if you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.050 
right here in the create panel if you
rename<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.680> later<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.130> tends<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.549> only<00:01:53.670> rename

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
rename it later it tends to only rename

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.530 
rename it later it tends to only rename
the<00:01:54.210> route<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.990> entire<00:01:55.229> skeleton<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> I'm

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the route not the entire skeleton so I'm

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
the route not the entire skeleton so I'm
going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:57.930> ahead<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.259> delete<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.740> thing

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
going to go ahead and delete this thing

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.190 
going to go ahead and delete this thing
and<00:01:59.930> before<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.140> make<00:02:01.409> my<00:02:01.439> new<00:02:01.740> biped<00:02:03.049> first<00:02:04.049> of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and before I make my new biped first of

ahead and give it one ponytail link and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.340 
ahead and give it one ponytail link and
you<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.330> two<00:02:40.360> different<00:02:40.540> ponytails<00:02:41.170> by

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
you can have two different ponytails by

you can have two different ponytails by
the<00:02:41.410> way<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.800> would<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.250> had<00:02:42.280> two

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the way so that would be if you had two

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.790 
the way so that would be if you had two
different<00:02:42.640> years<00:02:42.970> or<00:02:43.210> pigtails<00:02:43.840> anyway<00:02:44.560> I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
different years or pigtails anyway I

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.130 
different years or pigtails anyway I
gave<00:02:45.460> it<00:02:45.640> one<00:02:46.090> link<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.540> that's<00:02:46.690> I'm<00:02:46.930> going<00:02:47.080> to

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
gave it one link and that's I'm going to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.550 
gave it one link and that's I'm going to
use<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.260> for<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.650> jaw<00:02:48.150> fingers<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:50.410> will

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
use that for the jaw fingers you will

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.310 
use that for the jaw fingers you will
see<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.100> all<00:02:51.430> though<00:02:52.300> I've<00:02:52.450> rendered<00:02:53.020> some

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
see that all though I've rendered some

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.040 
see that all though I've rendered some
fingers<00:02:53.740> on<00:02:53.890> this<00:02:54.100> goblin<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.330> does<00:02:55.630> not<00:02:55.780> have

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
fingers on this goblin it does not have

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.460 
fingers on this goblin it does not have
mesh<00:02:56.740> figures<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.940> hit<00:02:58.150> f4<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:59.200> see<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
mesh figures if I hit f4 to see the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.560 
mesh figures if I hit f4 to see the
whole<00:02:59.590> mesh<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.520> can<00:03:00.730> see<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.210> fingers

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
whole mesh you can see that the fingers

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.870 
whole mesh you can see that the fingers
are<00:03:01.720> not<00:03:01.840> individual<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:03.220> because<00:03:03.580> this<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.820> a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
are not individual it because this is a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.760 
are not individual it because this is a
pretty<00:03:04.090> low<00:03:04.270> poly<00:03:04.570> mesh<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.730> i<00:03:07.410> think<00:03:08.410> i'm<00:03:08.620> just

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
pretty low poly mesh so i think i'm just

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.290 
pretty low poly mesh so i think i'm just
going<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.010> stick<00:03:09.250> with<00:03:09.280> one<00:03:09.580> finger<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:10.180> give

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300
