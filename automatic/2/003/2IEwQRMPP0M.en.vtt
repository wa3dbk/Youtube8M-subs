high-performance v8 and the K code means

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.670 
high-performance v8 and the K code means
it's<00:01:15.799> 271<00:01:16.729> horsepower<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.960> thing<00:01:18.259> makes

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
it's 271 horsepower this thing makes

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.960 
it's 271 horsepower this thing makes
this<00:01:18.890> little<00:01:19.070> car<00:01:19.430> really

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.700 

one<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.930> coolest<00:01:28.110> things<00:01:28.380> about<00:01:28.440> this

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
one of the coolest things about this

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
one of the coolest things about this
particular<00:01:29.070> car<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.030> came<00:01:30.210> from<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
particular car is that it came from the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.740 
particular car is that it came from the
factory<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.950> 289<00:01:32.520> high-performance<00:01:33.420> v8

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
factory with the 289 high-performance v8

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.770 
factory with the 289 high-performance v8
a<00:01:33.990> couple<00:01:34.560> -<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.710> 4-speed<00:01:35.190> transmission<00:01:35.780> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
a couple - the 4-speed transmission the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.920 
a couple - the 4-speed transmission the
289<00:01:37.170> hypo<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:37.860> also<00:01:38.430> known<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> K<00:01:39.240> code<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
289 hypo is also known as the K code and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.740 
289 hypo is also known as the K code and
the<00:01:40.500> K<00:01:40.710> comes<00:01:41.070> from<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.370> fact<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.910> in<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the K comes from the fact that in the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.620 
the K comes from the fact that in the
VIN<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.650> car<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.520> fifth<00:01:44.910> digit<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
VIN of the car the fifth digit is the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.990 
VIN of the car the fifth digit is the
letter<00:01:45.900> K<00:01:46.230> and<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> find<00:01:47.580> out<00:01:47.760> if

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
letter K and that's a way to find out if

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.220 
letter K and that's a way to find out if
you<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> street<00:01:48.870> with<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> v8

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.650 
hypo k-code engine so the neatest thing
is<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.860> see<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.580> high-performance<00:02:39.300> v8

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
is to see that high-performance v8

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:48.790

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
the Fairlane is pretty cool because it

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.350 
the Fairlane is pretty cool because it
provided<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.810> platform<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:53.400> would<00:02:53.550> hold<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.940> v8

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
provided a platform that would hold a v8

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.900 
provided a platform that would hold a v8
but<00:02:54.959> still<00:02:55.290> wasn't<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.769> big<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.190> galaxy<00:02:56.700> so

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
but still wasn't as big as the galaxy so

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.180 
but still wasn't as big as the galaxy so
in<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.150> case<00:02:57.560> we're<00:02:58.560> looking<00:02:58.800> at<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> pretty

sporty-er<00:04:20.620> but<00:04:21.220> we<00:04:21.310> believe<00:04:21.609> this<00:04:21.760> car<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.180> be

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
sporty-er but we believe this car to be

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.690 
sporty-er but we believe this car to be
almost<00:04:22.870> all<00:04:23.290> original<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.070> almost

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
almost all original and almost

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.640 
almost all original and almost
completely<00:04:25.060> unrestored<00:04:25.720> it<00:04:26.229> might<00:04:26.440> have<00:04:26.560> had

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
completely unrestored it might have had

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.140 
completely unrestored it might have had
a<00:04:26.680> few<00:04:26.889> repairs<00:04:27.190> or<00:04:27.550> little<00:04:27.760> things<00:04:27.790> here<00:04:28.120> and

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
a few repairs or little things here and

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150 
a few repairs or little things here and
there<00:04:28.419> but<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.050> majority<00:04:29.169> of<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.740> paint<00:04:30.010> on

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
there but the majority of the paint on

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.250 
there but the majority of the paint on
the<00:04:30.250> outside<00:04:30.639> is<00:04:30.820> original<00:04:31.300> interiors

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
the outside is original interiors

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.680 
the outside is original interiors
original<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.669> how<00:04:33.789> it<00:04:33.970> looked<00:04:34.240> all

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
original so this is how it looked all

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.450 
original so this is how it looked all
the<00:04:34.900> way<00:04:34.990> down<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.380> those<00:04:35.470> wire<00:04:35.889> wheel<00:04:36.130> caps

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
which kind of looked a little bit silly

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.920 
which kind of looked a little bit silly
but<00:04:39.010> they<00:04:39.430> complete<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.150> original<00:04:40.690> car

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
