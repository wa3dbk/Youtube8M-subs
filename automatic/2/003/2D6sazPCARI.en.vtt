00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.840
 Well 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.990
 Yes 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.539
 welcome the voice of peace to the hedges 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.260
 technique holland in biddinghuizen i now 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.439
 still short 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.200
 our 3936 self-drive proposals and 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.789
 there are some benefits of telling you what 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.919
 here you can see is a quadricycle 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.000
 driven vehicle before driving out 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.860
 from manure 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.480
 the vehicle with all four 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.129
 can drive wheels in a dog's way and 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.930
 only one track per wheel 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.040
 what is your can see is that it is the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.540
 manure tank 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.079
 exactly between the front and rear axle 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.100
 is what is the result 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.700
 super weight distribution 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.520
 it has the same weight for every wheel 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.560
 is of course important for the soil 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.150
 beauty of your vehicles to 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.630
 front you see the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.700
 suction arm positioned so that we are with 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.500
 maximum visibility of the driver 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.470
 every possible pot or container 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.049
 achieve here you can clearly see the 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.850
 pivoted lifting direction when we 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.619
 dogs must of course ride the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.140
 harbor direction so that 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.030
 it runs on the same track as 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.549
 the towing vehicle 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.650
 thereby adjusted rear wheels in the 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.240
 We also swallow the downfall 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.240
 everything is clearly a track 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.700
 what can be seen very clearly here 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.040
 the 9 chef's knife bonk 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.110
 for a maximum capacity where we 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.210
 have tried this optimally 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.510
 protect it by cutting what the filter 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.770
 is pre-fitted for filtering out 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.940
 stones or whatever in the most 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.920
 occurs 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.990
 grazing such a silage becomes everything 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.830
 cut so as not to damage it 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.050
 the pump 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.000
 for optimum lamp life 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.740
 of the pumps 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.170
 Here we can also see that it is huge 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.380
 have a short rough ride due to the piston that 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.240
 directly above the rigid filter 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.660
 had through the slurry pump so for 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.940
 maximum capacity and minimum late 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.320
 time where above the possibility 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.490
 have to include a 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.890
 truck 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.300
 or a silo at the six inch connection 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.610
 for optimum driving comfort 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.620
 This vehicle has a suspension front axle 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.990
 cab suspension and a lifted suspension 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.090
 direction where you contribute everything for 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.400
 both on the street and in the field 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.560
 minimum load for the driver and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.480
 maximum capacity for further 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.820
 information or if you have any questions 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.209

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.250
 different representatives
