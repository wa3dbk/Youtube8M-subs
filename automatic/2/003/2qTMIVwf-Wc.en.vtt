00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.980
 Y 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.900
 Welcome to this day number 15 inside 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.840
 of these 40 days of prayer fasting and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.520
 of personal renewal today we begin 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.439
 a new week a whole week of 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.680
 service and talking about this matter of the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.300
 personal renewal not Jesus synthesized 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.640
 the gospel synthesized the whole law in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 that dialogue with the Pharisees when they 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.350
 They asked good to see how to summarize 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.240
 of all the message the son in the message 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.490
 is summarized in two phrases love your 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.370
 God with all your heart with all your 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.670
 mind with your whole being and love your neighbor 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.720
 as yourself and then I thought 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.140
 that personal renewal comes by the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.660
 full experience and practice of the gospel 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.000
 and this week we are with the challenge of 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.000
 live a week of service 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.130
 blessing that certainly if we practice it 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.250
 will renew us because every time 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.070
 we live the gospel in its dimension 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.880
 full our life is renewed we 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.340
 we feel like new 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.980
 it can not be done without prayer and we are 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.290
 understanding the value of fasting from 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.640
 say goodbye sir I could do without 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.400
 even of the food but I can not 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.860
 do without you so all 40 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.380
 days invite us and challenge us to the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.450
 practice of the renewal of prayer 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.430
 of fasting but this week maybe it has 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.340
 a little touch with this with this 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.390
 god's purpose that we love what 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.790
 he loves 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.000
 that we practice what we 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.630
 he practiced that he held a method he 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.119
 I was always in the middle of people and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.400
 when we read it to Jesus what 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.979
 we always see walking towards where 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.869
 gathered the crowd there was in the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.119
 edge of the sea in the middle of the fishermen 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.790
 fishermen there is in the bush 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.580
 speaking to thousands there is in the middle 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.920
 of the temple preaching where the people 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.440
 he walked getting into the market 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.989
 making signals where the crowd 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.290
 usually attended and when we go to 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.030
 see the church of the facts we saw it 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.160
 imitating that move of Jesus 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.190
 the first miracles in sight of everything 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.190
 the world 120 prayed in a room but 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.209
 they were taken by the holy spirit of 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.020
 god and then for the experience to be 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.090
 public 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.120
 and the miracle of the paralytic at the door 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.210
 of the beautiful again public because the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.310
 Gospel has an aspect that has to 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.470
 see with the internal with the personal with 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.960
 my intimacy with god but then have 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.850
 a tremendously important aspect that 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.950
 it has to do with the experience of faith 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.380
 in the thing of every day in all 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.730
 sides 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.430
 the challenge to love what God loves and 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.290
 is where are people will live christ to 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.900
 through our personal testimony of 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.680
 behavior but also live it in 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.230
 concrete actions that the other can 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.750
 detect not only live the gospel 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.540
 and preach and witness in ways 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.430
 that we understand but also give 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.100
 testimony and live the gospel of 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.120
 way that one who does not know Christ 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.520
 I can live with Jesus fed him not 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.560
 only at 12 or 70 that what 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.960
 they kept routinely gave them loaves and 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.810
 fish to all the miracles were for 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.030
 all the sermon was for everyone and the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.610
 primitive church says they sold their 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.470
 things and they shared it they were still 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.090
 worried about the widow for the orphan 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.890
 abroad because it's the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.590
 concern of them has always been 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.240
 in the word from the beginning Jesus 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.920
 He spoke with his people and told him I give them 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.140
 thank you for the number of times I 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.970
 visited when I was imprisoned all the 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.080
 times they fed me while 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.150
 I was hungry 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.710
 and his people told him but at what time 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.060
 we are hungry but when 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.490
 they did for one of these they did 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.160
 for me there is an aspect in the service to 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.730
 neighbor and in the practice of the love of 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.820
 God to the neighbor that is to do it 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.590
 directly by Christ when I am 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.519
 doing this kind of thing I do it for 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.150
 Christ himself of course that action 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.070
 social or social task without a 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.950
 deep experience with god is 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.810
 incomplete as you allow me to tell you that 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.480
 an in- depth inner experience with 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.660
 god but an expression towards the neighbor 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.450
 it is also incomplete 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.940
 in today's devotional writing 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.100
 we thought and we said what we have done 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.710
 so many offerings for our temples 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.830
 to improve them and it 's very good that 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.710
 let's do but maybe we should do a 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.930
 offering by the hospital the hospital 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.200
 where our people of our 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.169
 congregations is and where then in the 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.569
 week are served 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.159
 or something in some of the schools 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.669
 public in our city in which 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:09.650
 our children study and if your son does not 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.810
 study a public school because you 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.229
 You can pay a private school for your children 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.389
 from your city ​​of your city that 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.969
 territory that God called you worship 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:23.780
 blessing by which he calls you to cry 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:26.400
 which asks you to serve mamés 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.270
 not only that the games 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.130
 let's serve if they are within the 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.249
 congregation but as it says the 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:39.309
 word that Jesus was doing good 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:41.289
 all of us and we want to imitate what 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:44.549
 we want to copy and this week we have 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:47.529
