00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi to all the boys so spartan 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.819
 107 welcome to this new guide by 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.799
 battlefield 4 today we will go to 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.510
 see together the 5 c is a more model 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.460
 economic 5 s in which you can 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.950
 he even chooses the color 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.470
 I'm talking about an iPhone for the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.330
 fuck I'm talking about the k 5 c it's sad 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160
 you know what I lost even hours 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.960
 think of my life is bullshit 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.240
 which will probably only do me 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.519
 spit in the face but so much so 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.769
 rubbing porn you want part 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.750
 the weapon in question will be the k 5 c weapon 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.700
 of Swedish origin that remains trying it 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 mind seemed to use more than that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.670
 assaults that a rifle makes it 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.770
 a little different this guide 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.270
 what I'm about to show you goes against it 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.800
 all that god always said about it 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.879
 to these guides because it is one anyway 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.379
 which I honestly don't like 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.539
 it doesn't change anything to me to do so 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.190
 we would like it where it seems done then 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.840
 on the screen you will see the features 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.129
 of the rig more or less some data than me 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.930
 important relief 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.300
 first let's start with the loader a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.309
 normal magazine with 31 shots but 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.289
 we are therefore the damage that goes from 25 15 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.030
 give bullets his descent of 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.640
 deliver them you want to start the 8 meters 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.930
 ends 50 that implies that to kill 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.400
 a person in normal mode there 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.470
 they will take four to seven strokes 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.909
 all this with a rocket is 700 strokes a 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.369
 minute and as for instead 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.439
 recharge the weapon will take from 185 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 at 235 second of empty magazine o 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.280
 less passing now the recoil text 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.810
 as you can see it will be very attenuated 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 when it will be admired this to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 the detriment of non-targeted fire of its own 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.119
 for this details he considers it 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.729
 a great weapon for this and why too 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.590
 the first weapon you will keep in the kit 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.060
 carabine precisely so it can be 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 used from the beginning 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.000
 speaking instead of the accessories that 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.530
 advice on this weapon first of all 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.360
 optics advice as always a 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.220
 minor was mini coyote because there 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.500
 I really think the best ever 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.930
 secondly by switching to the accessory 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.060
 the one like laser sight or torches 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.829
 josÃ¨ as I always say that they prefer 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.630
 use it because I think they are useful 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.890
 only to be caught for how long 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.030
 on the other hand, the meat concerns me 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.710
 strongly a silencer 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.780
 this is because although it will diminish 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.159
 statistics of the Rome will serve to a 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.229
 make you sgam when you go to 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.060
 kill enemies on enemies in territory 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.950
 enemy and I sincerely prefer it 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
 as what finally passes by the sub-casket 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.390
 decided between two squat handles 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.489
 foldable handle this because one 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.989
 increase stability with the folding 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.940
 while instead that track will increase 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.800
 the precision you want to see that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.910
 with which you will find yourself 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.500
 because they are both anyway 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.780
 statistics on this weapon are already 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.310
 very high that are good then 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.110
 you might as well improve what you do 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.760
 you will find it better for yourself said 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.680
 this is a really flash guide 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.820
 because really a record under 3 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.680
 about minutes 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.180
 comes to an end I invite you to leave a 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.340
 I like it is a comment above all 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.810
 telling me if you prefer this format or 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.100
 the one with whom I made the old to me 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.020
 honestly nothing changes I did 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.760
 the others because I preferred to do 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.140
 but essentially nothing changes me 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.990
 What you'll find most useful you because 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.800
 I do them for you basically 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.910
 subscribe to the channel if you do n't have one 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.840
 still done and we don't feel the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.840
 next hello everyone
