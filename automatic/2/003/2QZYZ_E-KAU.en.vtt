00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.480
 yes yes 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.080
 no no 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.660
 and I have a wine in my mind that still 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.230
 I have not done it but obama only that 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 better some day 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.100
 for me the bierzo is unique because 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.750
 this a history the historical areas 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.720
 they are areas that have lasted over time 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.150
 because because there's been something else it's a 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.040
 area that is crossed by the way 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.060
 santiago many people who came over 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.200
 all Italian French areas 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.110
 I had some knowledge of vineyard and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.240
 This is transmitted when the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.390
 crops at the time of the people because 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.940
 A wine is not just a crop and good 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.370
 fruit of it there are millions of details 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.350
 in the wines of bierzo that make 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.360
 allusion to a vineyard 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.640
 more French than from another area el bierzo 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.170
 it develops since 1880 and that peak 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.530
 Phylloxera enters and starts 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.400
 replant until the first years 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.960
 stage of the civil war the years 36 40 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.300
 where there is an important economic break 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.250
 and where he stops simply planting 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.670
 this then that has happened to the greatest 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.950
 part of the vineyard in the bierzo has in 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.290
 these moments almost 100 years or so is 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.170
 It is harder to buy grape 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.180
 47-year-old grape for example 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.759
 that 90 is much more difficult the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.080
 main problem of a young strain and 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.610
 an old strain the difference is 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 mainly the strength that has a 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.500
 strain gives a young strain us what 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.000
 we usually compare with people a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.020
 young person because he has a lot of impetus 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.970
 It has got that strength but it's missing 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.130
 that experience that definition then 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.590
 when when a strain is old then 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.900
 has many years of experience and is 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.450
 very adapted to the environment apart has the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.730
 root system of roots has it more 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.069
 deep and get the nutrient from 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.800
 many different layers and that's how it 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.650
 translates into wine because we have 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.780
 a deeper more complex wine 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.190
 also more mineral the young strain then 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.739
 On the contrary, it will give you a lot 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.620
 more quantity you have to punish her 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.239
 a more severe green pruning but 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.250
 good has all its pros and cons 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.580
 in the case of bierzo to be all greater 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.290
 and mostly old nest 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.290
 we get more elegant wines 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.140
 on the floor to go up like 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.799
 that I saw this year we hope you do 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.799
 a little bit of heat 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.410
 all this concept of acceptance of 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.110
 area also do it if a little the stage 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.800
 Well, Erika edged this tendency to call 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.910
 centenary strains urge a few years 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.930
 at the end of the 80 90 does not do not do 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.380
 referring to the 100 years but the 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.380
 first strains that 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.970
 now the knowledge is technological 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.410
 before it was more empirical but people 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.030
 I had an experience throughout 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.970
 all christmas people looked at what was 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.070
 better both in vineyards and in livestock as 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.020
 in horses as in everything not if you go to 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.050
 the Mediterranean areas you realize 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.120
 that everything is like much more 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.310
 the preparation there is no clear variety 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.310
 there's no that's another concept 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.300
 we are a group of people that I met in 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.690
 a time then nobody costs 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.240
 It is best to ask for a machine or one or 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.400
 opinion about a deposit or lowers the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.810
 hold and see what happens to this not only 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.990
 can you tell me hey come here so in the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.780
 barrels and I can go to polo do not know 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.310
 I left the winery that I have a group 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.230
 of people who want to try other things 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.350
 the program translator there is a component 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.380
 about work in friendship component 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.009
 in bus there are then those 10 12 guys in 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.460
 a table 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.650
 handling people clients press I do not know 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.029
 what and each one is not a space 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.790
 doing your job is not a job 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.710
 pretty open 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.780
 in open there is also that component 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.969
 human that goes better in other areas very 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.589
 sad 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.729
 is the component that looks less but 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.439
 in the end it is a very important component 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.189
 when it comes to working and selling and 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.189
 be in a simple 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:27.479
 are you authentic yes yes we are we are
