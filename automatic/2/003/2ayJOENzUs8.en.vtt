00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.040
 a very important thing to know 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.540
 when it comes to fish, it's in the counter 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
 we have blue fish 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.430
 we know it is rich in omega 3 that it has 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.770
 so many important nutrients but it is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.449
 a completely different musculature 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
 from the other fish of white fish 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.210
 this because because the red muscle in 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.000
 these products sardine herring 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.489
 mackerel and especially tuna is 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.250
 is very rich in histidine lists 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 harmless substance going on a problem 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.030
 the only problem is that in the moment in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 which comes into contact with a flora 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.829
 ubiquitous microbial not absolutely 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 pathogenic that would not give no 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.649
 problem 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.570
 this histidine is transformed into 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.079
 histamine and histamine a mediator 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.090
 Immunity chemical is a factor is a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.250
 inflammatory substance that can give 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.270
 certain problems if ingested or high 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.059
 quantity 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.760
 here is the products in the atmosphere 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.930
 controlled can still have one 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.490
 small amount of microflora that is 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 normally present on all 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.570
 foods and it is therefore very important that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.729
 the cold chain is maintained 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 so that this product is brought 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.560
 at home temperature between 0 and 4 degrees but 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.009
 another very important thing that often 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.979
 exposes the consumer to gods 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.869
 intoxication and the fact that styles 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.049
 it is also present in canned tuna 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.229
 also tuna preserved and cooked in 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.240
 listed in a that stays in style so that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.579
 it is not polluted by any 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.590
 ubiquitous microbe therefore it is 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.930
 very important that around once 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.920
 open is never kept at 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.290
 room temperature 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.210
 but just like the labels says 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.070
 stored in the refrigerator so 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.630
 inhibit the growth of these microbes 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.640
 present a little everywhere and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.799
 absolutely not pathogenic though 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.200
 could create a quantity of 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.340
 histamine which could be harmful 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.340
 to consumer health
