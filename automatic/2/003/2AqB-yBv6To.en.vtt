00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.350 
factory is where you get to the my
identity<00:02:50.160> wraps<00:02:50.460> because<00:02:50.820> really<00:02:51.180> when<00:02:51.300> you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
identity wraps because really when you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.150 
identity wraps because really when you
look<00:02:51.390> at<00:02:51.690> all<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> colors<00:02:52.170> they<00:02:52.380> look<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:52.890> cool

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
look at all the colors they look so cool

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.830 
look at all the colors they look so cool
in<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.640> different<00:02:53.940> different<00:02:54.480> ways<00:02:54.510> you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
in all the different different ways you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720 
in all the different different ways you
can<00:02:55.020> combine<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.920> colors<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.370> rims<00:02:56.550> it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
can combine the colors in the rims it's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.000 
can combine the colors in the rims it's
just<00:02:56.910> really<00:02:57.030> cool<00:02:57.240> so<00:02:57.480> from<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.170> what<00:02:58.980> I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
just really cool so from there what I

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.200 
just really cool so from there what I
was<00:02:59.250> shown<00:02:59.690> was<00:03:00.690> actually<00:03:01.440> how<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.740> take<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
was shown was actually how you take the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.200 
was shown was actually how you take the
bare<00:03:03.480> wood<00:03:04.290> drum<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:06.320> get<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.470> shell

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
bare wood drum and then get the shell

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.610 
bare wood drum and then get the shell
wrapped<00:03:09.210> from<00:03:09.660> there<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.020> mean<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:10.320> just<00:03:10.350> such

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
wrapped from there I mean it's just such

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.250 
wrapped from there I mean it's just such
a<00:03:10.650> precise<00:03:11.130> thing<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.390> don't<00:03:12.600> think<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.930> could<00:03:13.140> do

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
a precise thing I don't think I could do

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.390 
a precise thing I don't think I could do
it<00:03:13.380> it's<00:03:13.470> definitely<00:03:13.620> something<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.130> takes

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
it it's definitely something that takes

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.670 
it it's definitely something that takes
a<00:03:14.520> little<00:03:14.670> bit<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.900> know<00:03:15.930> symmetry<00:03:16.590> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
a little bit of a you know symmetry to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.010 
a little bit of a you know symmetry to
line<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:16.890> all<00:03:17.070> up<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:17.490> from<00:03:17.940> there<00:03:18.180> we<00:03:18.360> walked

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
line it all up but from there we walked

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.750 
line it all up but from there we walked
through<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.530> was<00:03:19.650> able<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.920> check<00:03:20.160> out<00:03:20.340> all

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
through and I was able to check out all

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.880
