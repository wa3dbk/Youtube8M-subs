trader today's warm-up is a flexibility
at<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> range<00:00:25.470> study<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:28.910> something<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
at a range study and so something that

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.110 
at a range study and so something that
we're<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.359> used<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.130> but<00:00:32.130> I'm<00:00:32.700> gonna<00:00:32.910> share

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
we're all used to but I'm gonna share

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.630 
we're all used to but I'm gonna share
some<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.420> my<00:00:33.450> insight<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.430> first<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> all

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
some of my insight with it first of all

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.799 
some of my insight with it first of all
we're<00:00:35.730> gonna<00:00:35.790> break<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.210> into<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.540> parts

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
we're gonna break it up into three parts

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:51.250 
we're gonna break it up into three parts
and<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.260> would<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> arpeggio

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.299 

now<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> make<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.860> smooth<00:00:53.129> as

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
now you want to make that as smooth as

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.900 
now you want to make that as smooth as
possible<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:55.399> possibly<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.520> fast<00:00:56.730> as

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
possible and possibly as fast as

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.200 
possible and possibly as fast as
possible<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:58.040> as<00:00:59.040> you<00:00:59.250> better<00:00:59.790> you<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.059> at

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
possible on as you better you get at

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:14.950 
possible on as you better you get at
this

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.070 

you<00:01:15.650> can<00:01:15.800> do<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:16.100> in<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.790> triplet<00:01:16.940> form<00:01:17.360> which<00:01:17.960> is

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
you can do it in a triplet form which is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.830 
you can do it in a triplet form which is
even<00:01:18.320> faster<00:01:18.530> or<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:20.590> double<00:01:21.590> form<00:01:22.070> da<00:01:22.850> da<00:01:22.909> de<00:01:23.540> da

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
doesn't matter in fact the more

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.950 
doesn't matter in fact the more
different<00:01:28.729> ways<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:28.970> try<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.450> break<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.780> up

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
different ways you try it to break it up

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.930 
different ways you try it to break it up
the<00:01:30.140> better<00:01:30.350> because<00:01:30.770> music<00:01:31.130> always<00:01:31.550> comes<00:01:31.790> at

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
the better because music always comes at

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.260 
the better because music always comes at
us<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.240> different<00:01:32.690> variations<00:01:34.000> we'll<00:01:35.000> do<00:01:35.150> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
us in different variations we'll do the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:47.740 
us in different variations we'll do the
triple<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:37.009> triple<00:01:37.310> meter<00:01:37.430> form

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.179 

so<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> purse<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.439> first<00:01:49.649> half<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
so that's the purse the first half of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.590 
so that's the purse the first half of
this<00:01:50.490> exercise<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.170> next<00:01:52.500> would<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
this exercise and the next would be a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.230 
this exercise and the next would be a
flexibility<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> high<00:01:55.890> seat

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
flexibility going up to the high seat

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:08.589 
flexibility going up to the high seat
uses<00:01:57.240> many<00:01:58.280> false<00:01:59.280> fingerings<00:01:59.729> as<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> can

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.660 

and<00:02:09.599> then<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> third<00:02:10.890> part<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.340> exercise

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and then the third part of this exercise

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.059 
and then the third part of this exercise
is<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.239> range<00:02:12.450> study<00:02:12.780> now<00:02:13.620> I'll<00:02:13.709> try<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:13.980> do

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
is the range study now I'll try and do

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.410 
is the range study now I'll try and do
this<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.459> one<00:02:14.580> breath<00:02:14.849> if<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:15.330> to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
this all in one breath if you have to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.080 
this all in one breath if you have to
break<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.860> next<00:02:17.190> third<00:02:17.459> part<00:02:17.819> of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
break it up in this next third part of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.300 
break it up in this next third part of
the<00:02:18.440> warm-up<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.799> where<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.190> would

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the warm-up this is where you would

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:32.260 
the warm-up this is where you would
breathe

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.720 

so<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.330> went<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> Heike<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.580> it's<00:02:35.580> not

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
so I went to the Heike and it's not

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.720 
so I went to the Heike and it's not
important<00:02:36.090> how<00:02:36.150> high<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.480> play<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:38.400> trying

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
important how high you play it's trying

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.910 
important how high you play it's trying
to<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.000> fluid<00:02:39.360> as<00:02:39.420> possible<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.620> later

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
to be as fluid as possible and later

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.040 
to be as fluid as possible and later
down<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.550> in<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.540> Dark<00:02:42.900> Side<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.230> Moon

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
down in the in the Dark Side of the Moon

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.960 
down in the in the Dark Side of the Moon
trumpet<00:02:46.050> fingering<00:02:47.010> combinations<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.820> gets

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
trumpet fingering combinations it gets

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.170 
trumpet fingering combinations it gets
pretty<00:02:48.120> hard<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.640> if<00:02:50.730> you'd<00:02:50.850> only<00:02:51.030> have

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
pretty hard and so if you'd only have

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.150 
pretty hard and so if you'd only have
like<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.480> short<00:02:51.810> time<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.170> practice<00:02:52.560> those

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
like a short time to practice those

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.860 
like a short time to practice those
would<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.580> places<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:54.030> practice<00:02:54.210> not<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
would be the places to practice not the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.770 
would be the places to practice not the
things<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> do<00:02:55.410> easy<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.480> let's<00:02:57.630> put

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
things that you do easy so let's put

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:14.400 
things that you do easy so let's put
this<00:02:57.870> whole<00:02:58.050> exercise<00:02:58.500> together

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.809 

so<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.530> most<00:03:15.680> important<00:03:16.069> part<00:03:16.280> about<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.640> is

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
so the most important part about that is

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.530 
so the most important part about that is
is<00:03:17.090> having<00:03:17.420> your<00:03:17.510> sound<00:03:17.780> sound<00:03:18.470> consistent

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
is having your sound sound consistent

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.570 
is having your sound sound consistent
being<00:03:20.540> flexible<00:03:20.930> kind<00:03:21.349> of<00:03:21.470> going<00:03:22.340> over<00:03:22.489> those

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
being flexible kind of going over those

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.070 
being flexible kind of going over those
notes<00:03:22.849> like<00:03:22.970> you're<00:03:23.090> skipping<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.510> rock<00:03:23.720> over

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
notes like you're skipping a rock over

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.839 
notes like you're skipping a rock over
the<00:03:24.200> over<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.860> pond<00:03:25.129> and<00:03:26.080> a<00:03:27.310> big<00:03:28.310> breath<00:03:28.610> at<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
the over a pond and a big breath at the

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.650 
the over a pond and a big breath at the
beginning<00:03:29.269> but<00:03:29.870> not<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:32.260> tight<00:03:33.260> or<00:03:34.660> strenuous

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
beginning but not a tight or strenuous

let's<00:03:45.829> see<00:03:45.920> if<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.130> sounds<00:03:46.280> like<00:03:46.690> an

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
let's see if this sounds like an

00:03:47.690 --> 00:04:08.710 
let's see if this sounds like an
attributive<00:03:48.019> function

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.420 

this<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.840> almost<00:04:09.989> like<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.260> glissando<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:14.220> comes

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
this is almost like a glissando it comes

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:28.550 
this is almost like a glissando it comes
our<00:04:14.670> helicopters

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.290 

I<00:04:30.800> digress<00:04:32.840> okay<00:04:33.840> back<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.110> our<00:04:35.300> flexibility

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
I digress okay back to our flexibility

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:53.600 
I digress okay back to our flexibility
study<00:04:36.860> first

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:12.630 

okay<00:04:55.710> one<00:04:56.710> or<00:04:56.830> two

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.610 

now<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:14.420> lower<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:14.780> go<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:14.960> more<00:05:15.200> air<00:05:15.590> you

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
now the lower you go the more air you

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.680 
now the lower you go the more air you
expend<00:05:16.870> low<00:05:17.870> notes<00:05:18.080> take<00:05:18.290> more<00:05:18.500> air<00:05:19.570> but<00:05:20.570> you

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
expend low notes take more air but you

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.080 
expend low notes take more air but you
can<00:05:20.810> also<00:05:20.960> expand<00:05:21.770> these<00:05:22.040> exercises<00:05:22.700> by<00:05:22.850> going

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
can also expand these exercises by going

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.460 
can also expand these exercises by going
up<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.330> next<00:05:23.540> partial<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.140> let's<00:05:24.320> see<00:05:24.410> if

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
up to the next partial so let's see if

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:41.430 
up to the next partial so let's see if
we<00:05:24.530> get<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:24.710> high<00:05:24.950> a<00:05:24.980> flat<00:05:25.430> out<00:05:25.610> of<00:05:25.700> this<00:05:25.820> one

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.090 

just<00:05:42.440> barely<00:05:42.770> made<00:05:43.130> it<00:05:44.320> but<00:05:45.320> it's<00:05:45.500> important

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
just barely made it but it's important

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.830 
just barely made it but it's important
like<00:05:46.190> I<00:05:46.340> said<00:05:46.520> earlier<00:05:46.880> it's<00:05:47.270> not<00:05:47.300> important

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
like I said earlier it's not important

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.220 
like I said earlier it's not important
how<00:05:48.470> high<00:05:48.680> you<00:05:48.740> play<00:05:49.010> it's<00:05:49.780> ways<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:51.050> practice

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
how high you play it's ways to practice

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.870 
how high you play it's ways to practice
and<00:05:51.650> try<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.670> be<00:05:52.850> as<00:05:52.940> fluid<00:05:53.210> on<00:05:53.810> all<00:05:54.350> the<00:05:54.880> valve

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
and try to be as fluid on all the valve

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.820 
and try to be as fluid on all the valve
combinations<00:05:56.480> as<00:05:56.630> possible<00:05:57.080> so<00:05:57.590> if<00:05:57.710> that

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
combinations as possible so if that

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.140 
combinations as possible so if that
means<00:05:58.040> you<00:05:58.100> have<00:05:58.190> to<00:05:58.280> go<00:05:58.370> a<00:05:58.400> little<00:05:58.520> slower<00:05:58.670> it

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
means you have to go a little slower it

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.840 
means you have to go a little slower it
a<00:05:59.240> little<00:05:59.450> lower<00:05:59.720> that's<00:06:00.110> fine<00:06:00.410> because<00:06:01.190> of<00:06:01.490> a

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
a little lower that's fine because of a

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.600 
a little lower that's fine because of a
good<00:06:02.480> sound<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:03.100> musical<00:06:04.100> interpretation

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
good sound and musical interpretation

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.220 
good sound and musical interpretation
will<00:06:05.180> always<00:06:05.570> get<00:06:05.690> you<00:06:05.840> through<00:06:06.400> more<00:06:08.230> music

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
will always get you through more music

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:38.530 
will always get you through more music
high<00:06:10.130> notes<00:06:31.780> here<00:06:36.760> now<00:06:37.760> you<00:06:37.880> notice<00:06:38.120> I<00:06:38.240> use<00:06:38.510> a

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
high notes here now you notice I use a

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.940 
high notes here now you notice I use a
little<00:06:38.840> less<00:06:39.170> air<00:06:40.570> but<00:06:41.570> I<00:06:41.810> managed<00:06:42.260> and<00:06:42.470> I<00:06:42.770> went

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
little less air but I managed and I went

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.130 
little less air but I managed and I went
a<00:06:43.010> little<00:06:43.250> slower<00:06:43.550> that's<00:06:43.940> because<00:06:44.270> those

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
a little slower that's because those

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.890 
a little slower that's because those
notes<00:06:45.380> are<00:06:45.950> harder<00:06:46.340> to<00:06:46.370> slide<00:06:46.760> and<00:06:47.630> like<00:06:47.810> I

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
notes are harder to slide and like I

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.660 
notes are harder to slide and like I
said<00:06:48.080> you<00:06:48.200> want<00:06:48.290> to<00:06:48.410> be<00:06:48.500> as<00:06:48.620> fluid<00:06:48.890> as<00:06:49.100> possible

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
said you want to be as fluid as possible

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.240 
said you want to be as fluid as possible
let's<00:06:50.330> see<00:06:50.450> if<00:06:50.510> we<00:06:50.630> can<00:06:50.720> do<00:06:51.560> this<00:06:51.680> F<00:06:51.890> sharp<00:06:52.100> and

let's see if we can do this F sharp and

00:06:52.250 --> 00:07:09.470 
let's see if we can do this F sharp and
get<00:06:52.370> out<00:06:52.520> of<00:06:52.670> this
