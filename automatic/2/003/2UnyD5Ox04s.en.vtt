00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 what becomes of such a spontaneous videos 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.349
 can 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:12.150
 second attempt hello I try that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.380
 Resistance to the felt ten times too 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.280
 because I somehow dissatisfied 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 am 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.449
 but the real topic because I want 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.170
 not kind of charging and how 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.300
 at the last video 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.490
 the last video was so blatantly good 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.110
 thank you for a reason that 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.000
 second video on the subject makes it cool 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.980
 and of course I filtered out 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.660
 because I said yes come give me that 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.520
 what I still like to do and 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.480
 It seems so very much know that 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.830
 on the first day yes how is it when I am 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.350
 not as popular as I can 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.629
 be loved and it is actually 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.570
 all topics are in one topic 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.260
 bundle and how do I get 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.330
 to others 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.739
 how do I do that I get well 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.140
 how do I do that, so to speak 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.930
 have rest because maybe some are 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.269
 important this attention or this 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.379
 to look like and that they are anna long 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.120
 is that cool 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.680
 yes that was the third point, so to speak 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.449
 my last videos how can i 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.310
 somehow am reasonably good 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.240
 the school and I'm still doing that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.100
 the others say boah is the cool yes 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.330
 how much really difficult 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.830
 Of course, if you have a new one 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.200
 school changes before everything if 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.200
 you must change for the reason or 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.670
 because you wanted the old one at the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 old school has not been accepted 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.570
 that is really a very very 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.219
 serious topic and mobbing can 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.990
 I'll give you a video of love below 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.460
 nina embarrassed because she has great tips 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.439
 and tricks how to defend against it 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.689
 can and how we just can not get back in 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.770
 this stupid victim role comes because that 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.810
 can you decide 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.320
 that's the first tip I get 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.259
 really very very close to the heart 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.539
 would always find from zero 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.700
 if you come into a new environment st 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.810
 from zero that means profile yourself 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.520
 completely new 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.289
 that does not mean that you change 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.380
 should but that is very explicit 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.749
 that you get out of the drawers problem 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.420
 that you get out of the drawers 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:04.090
 patch and out somehow fishing out 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.170
 where other fellow men you 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.240
 because he has the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.920
 chance to stand outside the closet 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.740
 and decide which drawer 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.480
 put nice metaphor frattini 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.980
 has something that flows in German 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.530
 always worth it 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.930
 it's not fun it's hell 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.580
 to get somewhere where you speak, so to speak 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.110
 I know that you have a lot of time there 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.690
 will spend and you will first time 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.220
 nobody knows but for me always 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.630
 to remember those moments back to where it is 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.190
 in office 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.750
 first was unpleasant and then in 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.390
 a few months old animal the best 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.460
 friends and have done a great deal so 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.050
 that will be too often depends on you 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.410
 how to maybe completely new 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.000
 but is yours three because 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.440
 that's really the most important thing 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.820
 Now we come back the most 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.350
 adult and i would maybe 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.990
 now after a few years already 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.550
 he hardly say fuck what the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.170
 others say his thing is going through 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.460
 the school and then you have somehow 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.410
 free time but honest 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.150
 while one is in school time is turning 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.610
 but the whole life long the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.590
 whole or is the whole time everything 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.330
 only in the school and in the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.680
 Hobbies happen that means something with the 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.980
 whole people happens one 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.080
 always somehow surround and around you 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.700
 you have to be around accordingly 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.260
 say clearly beautiful notes well and good 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.180
 but if you are in your own class 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.500
 not feeling well or not in the environment 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.810
 feel good or have so by the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.760
 teacher is bullied what really 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.830
 happens where the parents because they say 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.530
 today you are going to face it 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.270
 no i understand that i was self in 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.920
 such a situation i became i can 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.120
 do not say that I was bullied 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.370
 because I think that's a hard one 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.760
 but it 's just it 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.440
 important to say hey you can not 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.350
 say fuck what the others of 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.180
 think you because the stand was very important 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.860
 how popular it is how unpopular it is 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.840
 one eats the sacrifice of the class 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.180
 one the class clown one is the one 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.110
 most beautiful is you there are so many rolls 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.580
 to forgive 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.140
 these rolls will hardly be 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.060
 change and it will probably too 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.470
 Very few classes give that where 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.600
 not somehow already in the whole 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.730
 subconscious is perhaps distributed 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.020
 the whole thing is not communicating everything 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.030
 is subconscious somehow 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.890
 distributed if you have counter examples 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.880
 would love to write it and lynn it would 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.200
 I'm really interested 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.060
 I was great I was great 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.130
 well felt but i just have to say 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.480
 the people who just did not fit 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.280
 have with us in the group 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.330
 they also went after the first ones 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.799
 two years and from the 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.660
 different different ones 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.430
 you just have to be serious 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.790
 and i have to honestly say i have 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.770
 not bullied not consciously bullied though 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.590
 most likely in the subconscious 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.540
 and that's sad to say but it was 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.010
 unfortunately so and I think you have to 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.570
 simply to give himself because 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.680
 can I it was all of us 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.010
 I think in a situation 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.490
 where he was somehow bullied or 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.330
 was harassed 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.340
 where one 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.409
 but it was really hurt but you are 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.970
 honestly to yourself how many times were 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.530
 we ourselves in the situation in the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.419
 we have tried someone smaller too 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.759
 do as she is with us 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.439
 are bigger and quite honestly that 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.449
 are all the ones in the 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.650
 school time somehow through power and 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.629
 somehow his character 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.550
 That's why it's great when 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.110
 you in a new group somehow comes 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.870
 because it starts from zero because everything is there 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.520
 Experiences somehow together 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.889
 In addition , we actually do build 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.479
 and look at me I'm kinda 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.889
 here and look at your parents and 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.659
 Looks all grown ups and we have 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.949
 all somehow survived school 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.360
 I hope I can you again 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.069
 to some extent I help almost the whole 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.080
 together again, first you are 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.240
 even I know that these fucked up 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.770
 sachs he because everyone says where you are 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.389
 think oh come on shut up you have 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.969
 the same to me as everyone else 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.830
 but it is so secondly use the 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.599
 possibility outside the drawer 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.250
 to stand up for commitments and to 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.919
 Decide in which drawer stuck 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.069
 because of course you can do that 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.129
 influence 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.020
 and third , unfortunately, this has partly 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.449
 shit no matter attitude that does not work 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.210
 different and the sooner it does discharges 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.129
 in things or in points where that too 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.719
 it's okay, the better it gets 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.099
 The so go that was not now the 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.690
 funniest video 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.469
 I hope that's okay, that was a bit 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.089
 more serious because the topic just too simple 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:01.089
 more serious one must say unfortunately that 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.960
 because very often it is about how you feel 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:04.330
 feel yourself 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.400
 if you want to know more about the topic 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.020
 to the general topics first 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.569
 Impression how do I feel? 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.830
 Emotions are really very many 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.870
 Emotions will be on my second 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.159
 go channel and that I set you 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.719

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.789
 profile nothing at all it will still be black 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.349

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.370
 sort of deleted and then there will be

 So bye bye
