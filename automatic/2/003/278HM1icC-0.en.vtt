00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
we'll make sure that the surface is

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.759 
we'll make sure that the surface is
clean<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.940> any<00:00:09.059> dust<00:00:09.599> what<00:00:10.260> we're<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.590> do

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
clean of any dust what we're going to do

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.430 
clean of any dust what we're going to do
is<00:00:11.070> put<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> bead<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:11.969> caulk<00:00:12.360> around<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.139> sink

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
is put a bead of caulk around the sink

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.730 
is put a bead of caulk around the sink
and<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:14.610> we're<00:00:14.730> using<00:00:14.969> here<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.740> caulk

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
and what we're using here is a caulk

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.880 
and what we're using here is a caulk
that<00:00:17.279> includes<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:18.050> product<00:00:19.050> which<00:00:19.470> helps

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that includes a product which helps

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.150 
that includes a product which helps
against<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> growth<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.510> bacteria<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:22.470> mildew

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
against the growth of bacteria or mildew

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:35.810 
against the growth of bacteria or mildew
and<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.730> caulk<00:00:23.970> itself<00:00:33.890> ok<00:00:34.890> we're<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and the caulk itself ok we're going to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.750 
and the caulk itself ok we're going to
hook<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> water<00:00:36.840> supplies<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.620> will<00:00:38.610> be

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
hook up the water supplies and will be

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
hook up the water supplies and will be
hooking<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.270> waist<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:40.140> you've<00:00:40.320> seen<00:00:40.530> in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
hooking up the waist what you've seen in

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.520 
hooking up the waist what you've seen in
another<00:00:40.890> video<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.780> then<00:00:42.780> we'll<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> final

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
another video and then we'll do a final

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
another video and then we'll do a final
caulk<00:00:43.860> job<00:00:44.160> around<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> exterior<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
caulk job around the exterior of the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.380 
caulk job around the exterior of the
sink<00:00:45.710> we're<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> cut<00:00:47.160> off<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.760> pecs

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sink we're going to cut off these pecs

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.110 
sink we're going to cut off these pecs
supplies<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.320> length<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> they<00:00:50.850> match<00:00:51.059> up

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
supplies to length so that they match up

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.500 
supplies to length so that they match up
with<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> angle<00:00:52.050> stop<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.360> then<00:00:54.360> it's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
with the angle stop here and then it's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
with the angle stop here and then it's
important<00:00:55.050> when<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.350> using<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.770> peck

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
important when you're using a peck

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
important when you're using a peck
supply<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> also<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.840> appropriate

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
supply that you also have an appropriate

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.250 
supply that you also have an appropriate
Ferrell<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.579> that's<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
Ferrell and that's what that is is a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.170 
Ferrell and that's what that is is a
plastic<00:01:01.920> Ferrell<00:01:02.309> that's<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> pecs

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
plastic Ferrell that's for the pecs

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:20.820 
plastic Ferrell that's for the pecs
material

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.720 

so<00:01:21.830> now<00:01:22.010> that<00:01:22.160> we're<00:01:22.280> done<00:01:22.310> with<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
so now that we're done with the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.510 
so now that we're done with the
installation<00:01:23.260> we're<00:01:24.260> going<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.800> put<00:01:25.490> a

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
installation we're going to put a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.280 
installation we're going to put a
finished<00:01:25.910> bead<00:01:26.120> of<00:01:26.210> caulk<00:01:26.450> around<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:27.140> edge

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
finished bead of caulk around the edge

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.770 
finished bead of caulk around the edge
of<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.500> sink<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:28.670> take<00:01:29.060> up<00:01:29.240> that<00:01:29.270> space

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
of the sink to take up that space

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.720 
of the sink to take up that space
between<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.440> countertop<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.220> cast<00:01:31.460> iron

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
between the countertop and the cast iron

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.090 
between the countertop and the cast iron
and<00:01:32.000> this<00:01:32.660> right<00:01:32.870> here<00:01:32.900> is<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.260> latex<00:01:33.800> caulk

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
and this right here is a latex caulk

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.850 
and this right here is a latex caulk
which<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:34.790> water<00:01:35.090> soluble<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.870> so<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.650> makes

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
which is water soluble and so it makes

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.460 
which is water soluble and so it makes
for<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.130> nice<00:01:37.310> clean<00:01:37.670> up<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.110> once<00:01:39.110> it<00:01:39.260> dries

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
for a nice clean up and once it dries

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.670 
for a nice clean up and once it dries
it'll<00:01:39.830> do<00:01:39.980> just<00:01:40.010> fine<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:41.450> do<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.600> water<00:01:41.900> test<00:01:41.990> we

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
it'll do just fine to do a water test we

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.860 
it'll do just fine to do a water test we
want<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.070> check<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.550> area<00:01:43.700> turoff<00:01:44.240> in<00:01:44.630> case

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
want to check the area turoff in case

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.570 
want to check the area turoff in case
there's<00:01:45.110> anything<00:01:45.320> plugs<00:01:45.740> within<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.190> system

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
there's anything plugs within the system

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.630 
there's anything plugs within the system
and<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:46.970> won't<00:01:47.150> catch<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.780> aviator<00:01:48.140> string

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
and it won't catch in the aviator string

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:00.200 
and it won't catch in the aviator string
then<00:01:49.640> we're<00:01:50.180> good<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.360> go

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.270 

you
