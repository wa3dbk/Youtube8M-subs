00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 Exhibition of Tokyo International Anime Fair held in March this year 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 The booth has been reduced by 20% 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.800
 I said that I will continue to seek cooperation 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.249
 Originally 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.880
 Don't rely on me 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.679
 I'm sending the newcomer 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.039
 Appeal for approving that we started to win at such a place 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.230
 I did my third term, though 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.910
 From the previous work and overseeing the future, there will be a private example 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.029
 It is not necessary 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.149
 But getting up and moving up for a while 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.330
 I will call you 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.490
 Well I do not know how far it can fly around 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.280
 I thought it might be said that I exchanged views a little more on the front 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.330
 Though 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.850
 Last December 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.199
 Revision of the regulations of the city that regulates the sale of manga, etc. 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.810
 Was passed in parliament 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.360
 25 companies, including publishers who oppose the revision, have canceled store openings 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.310
 Thing 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.989
 Aiming for cancellation in 2014 and for maintenance of photo gathering place 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.880
 We talk about basic way of thinking of support measures to master teacher of Tsukiji master 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.100
 Did 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.179
 We thought about support that was necessary 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.530
 It's an economic issue as you go along 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.630
 Just veteran pension resources 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.330
 Because there is an origin 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.030
 I can't go on hitting my parents, though 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 Just that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.170
 Our eyes 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.340
 this 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.790
 Don't write 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.710
 I think it is also necessary to make an effort on an accident 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.110
 Mano Still, it's still a suspicion-to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.030
 For the sake of 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.920
 I think it's a problem at night 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.770
 Other simulated stores 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.900
 Let's raise the price increase of Tsukiji of the text gold edition 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.100
 At the same time, this one after all 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.390
 In parallel 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 I'm going to announce the plan I wrote in vain-not sueq 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.440
 I think 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.820
 Miyagi Prefecture Governor 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.309
 Obliges sex offenders to carry gps terminals 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.099
 That the police are considering the establishment of the regulations to monitor constantly 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.959
 received 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.189
 Governor Ishihara 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.479
 I was told that I was surprised when I heard it 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.569
 It is said that the effect appears in what form 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.029
 Did
