00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.930
 again we are at a construction site on a glacier 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.280
 on the street minus 23 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.880
 we recently poured our foundation here 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.880
 she commanded his previous video can 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.880
 see open here my form has turned out 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.650
 kinds of steam will go 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.810
 if you touch a very warm foundation 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.940
 concrete so to speak about watering like on 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.100
 plant for the production of concrete products 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.350
 in one day cast the plates steamed 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.890
 they are given the next day to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.699
 implementation with us also in accelerated 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 pace in the winter turned out 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:01:00.629
 the foundation has already gained 60 percent of its 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.360
 the strength of the pair can be seen preparing the input 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.080
 groups pour concrete the same also 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.080
 we will stretch heating pipes 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.850
 let's see our kotelva again 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.680
 here everything automatically works 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:33.130
 heated boiler solaris is not necessary 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.710
 maintain a normal temperature by 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.290
 beginnings and temperature kept degrees 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:47.940
 60 inside these tubes 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.940
 then reduced to prevent the concrete from overheating 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.080
 fireman what are you doing 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.690
 another entrance group is preparing for 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690
 sculptures 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.689
 But in the end this foundation turned out
