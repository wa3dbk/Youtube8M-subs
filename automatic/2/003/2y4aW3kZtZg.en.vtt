00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
over some line based strategy here on

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
over some line based strategy here on
this<00:00:42.809> map<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> league<00:00:44.520> play<00:00:44.700> TDM

this map this is a league play TDM

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.750 
this map this is a league play TDM
against<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.870> team<00:00:45.899> name<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.469> equal<00:00:46.920> skill

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
against a but a team name of equal skill

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.750 
against a but a team name of equal skill
as<00:00:48.270> our<00:00:49.020> own<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:49.950> knew<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.579> had<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
as our own so we knew we had to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.660 
as our own so we knew we had to
basically<00:00:51.500> frustrate<00:00:52.500> them<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.280> let's<00:00:53.579> go

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
basically frustrate them so let's go

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.279 
basically frustrate them so let's go
ahead<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.149> they're<00:00:54.329> they're<00:00:55.050> lining

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
ahead and see how they're they're lining

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.680 
ahead and see how they're they're lining
up<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.860> they're<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.160> using

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.240 

alright<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.840> most<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.469> our<00:01:01.530> teams<00:01:01.829> are<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.190> in

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
alright so most of our teams are here in

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
alright so most of our teams are here in
the<00:01:02.309> middle<00:01:02.489> section<00:01:03.000> still<00:01:03.809> trading<00:01:04.140> off

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the middle section still trading off

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.219 
the middle section still trading off
gunfights<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.600> situation<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
gunfights at this in this situation this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.440 
gunfights at this in this situation this
is<00:01:07.380> how<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.619> basically<00:01:08.250> lose<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:08.880> area<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
is how you basically lose an area so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.120 
is how you basically lose an area so
basically<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> call<00:01:10.200> them<00:01:10.380> back<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.920> what<00:01:11.100> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
basically I call them back for what I

basically I call them back for what I
like<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> call<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.729> line<00:01:12.060> what<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> line<00:01:13.530> well

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130

into it after we get set up here after
we<00:01:31.380> actually<00:01:31.770> break<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.880> hold

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
we actually break at the the hold

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
we actually break at the the hold
section<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.079> some<00:01:34.380> people<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.829> still

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
section as you see some people can still

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
section as you see some people can still
keep<00:01:35.250> sleeping<00:01:35.670> through<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
keep sleeping through there because the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.190 
keep sleeping through there because the
Blackbird<00:01:37.350> actually<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.920> went<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:39.079> what<00:01:40.079> we

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
Blackbird actually just went up what we

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.450 
Blackbird actually just went up what we
basically<00:01:40.350> did<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.979> started<00:01:41.250> doing<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
basically did is I started doing the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
basically did is I started doing the
turtle<00:01:41.790> thing<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.060> start<00:01:42.299> peekaboo<00:01:42.750> Inge<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
turtle thing I start peekaboo Inge and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.480 
turtle thing I start peekaboo Inge and
the<00:01:43.140> reason<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> plaque

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the reason this is because the plaque

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.069 
the reason this is because the plaque
area<00:01:44.909> right<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.509> easily<00:01:45.750> shoot

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
area right there you can easily shoot

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.410 
area right there you can easily shoot
through<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.649> once<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.729> somebody<00:01:48.149> on

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
through it and once you get somebody on

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.690 
through it and once you get somebody on
tilt<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.290> make<00:01:49.619> mistakes<00:01:49.860> over<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.549> over

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
tilt they make mistakes over and over

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
tilt they make mistakes over and over
and<00:01:50.909> over<00:01:51.000> again<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> big

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and over again one of the one the big

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.609 
and over again one of the one the big
primary<00:01:53.460> ways<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.479> wind<00:01:54.689> TDM<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.350> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
primary ways the wind TDM is to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
primary ways the wind TDM is to
frustrate<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.430> hell<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> enemy<00:01:57.329> team
