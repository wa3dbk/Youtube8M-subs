00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.350 

you

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.819 

so<00:00:57.360> let's<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.750> started<00:00:58.200> with<00:00:58.380> one<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
so let's get started with one of the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.010 
so let's get started with one of the
first<00:00:59.239> considerations<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.900> are

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
first considerations when you are

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
first considerations when you are
considering<00:01:01.940> studying<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.210> violin<00:01:03.660> or

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
considering studying the violin or

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.440 
considering studying the violin or
purchasing<00:01:04.440> an<00:01:04.559> instrument<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> study<00:01:05.450> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
purchasing an instrument to study and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.710 
purchasing an instrument to study and
that<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.810> whether<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.440> rent<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.160> buy<00:01:08.720> now

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that is whether to rent or to buy now

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.340 
that is whether to rent or to buy now
the<00:01:10.410> basic<00:01:10.890> overall<00:01:11.760> view<00:01:12.450> point<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the basic overall view point here is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.070 
the basic overall view point here is
that<00:01:13.380> taking<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:14.430> time<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.420> decide<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.960> an

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that taking more time to decide on an

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.840 
that taking more time to decide on an
instrument<00:01:16.410> is<00:01:17.009> probably<00:01:17.460> better<00:01:17.700> than

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
instrument is probably better than

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
instrument is probably better than
taking<00:01:18.479> less<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.110> not<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.470> kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.710> thing

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
taking less it's not the kind of thing

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.140 
taking less it's not the kind of thing
you<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.060> jump<00:01:21.410> haphazardly<00:01:22.410> into<00:01:23.150> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you want to jump haphazardly into you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150 
you want to jump haphazardly into you
know<00:01:24.270> insofar<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.840> purchasing<00:01:25.560> an<00:01:25.680> instrument

taking lessons so on and so forth

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.900 
taking lessons so on and so forth
there's<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.100> information<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.850> there

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
there's so much information out there

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.150 
there's so much information out there
and<00:01:30.300> so<00:01:30.570> many<00:01:30.750> opportunities<00:01:31.160> for

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
and so many opportunities for

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.730 
and so many opportunities for
experimentation<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.720> really<00:01:34.020> should<00:01:34.259> take

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
experimentation you really should take

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.080 
experimentation you really should take
advantage<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.700> lot<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> those

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
advantage of a lot of those

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
advantage of a lot of those
opportunities<00:01:36.680> one<00:01:37.680> opportunity<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
opportunities one opportunity that is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
opportunities one opportunity that is
really<00:01:39.060> prevalent<00:01:39.360> today<00:01:39.899> in<00:01:40.410> music<00:01:40.860> stores

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and this it really doesn't matter

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.650 
and this it really doesn't matter
whether<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.190> shop<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.390> is

there<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> couple<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.380> advantages<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.070> that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
there are a couple of advantages to that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.810 
there are a couple of advantages to that
one<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.830> try<00:02:05.100> an<00:02:05.340> instrument

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
one is that you can try an instrument

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.030 
one is that you can try an instrument
out<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.240> size<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.930> by<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.770> mean

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
out for size and by that I don't mean

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.390 
out for size and by that I don't mean
literally<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:09.540> size<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.100> if

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
literally for size but just to see if

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.970 
literally for size but just to see if
for<00:02:11.790> instance<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.450> violin<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.230> really<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
for instance the violin is really the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.550 
for instance the violin is really the
right<00:02:14.160> fit<00:02:14.459> for<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.480> may<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.290> you're

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
right fit for you it may be that you're

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.390 
right fit for you it may be that you're
more<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.829> a<00:02:16.920> cellist<00:02:17.190> or<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.870> guitarist<00:02:19.350> or<00:02:19.829> even

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
more of a cellist or a guitarist or even

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.699 
more of a cellist or a guitarist or even
wind<00:02:20.730> or<00:02:20.880> brass<00:02:21.090> instrumentalists<00:02:22.079> so<00:02:22.500> that's

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
wind or brass instrumentalists so that's

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the first step and very few times will

the first step and very few times will
you<00:02:26.310> find<00:02:26.579> that<00:02:26.730> you're<00:02:26.880> really<00:02:27.060> locked<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.780> to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
you find that you're really locked in to

I'm<00:02:34.769> usually<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.459> go<00:02:35.610> pretty<00:02:35.910> much<00:02:36.060> month

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
I'm usually you can go pretty much month

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.289 
I'm usually you can go pretty much month
by<00:02:36.690> month<00:02:37.430> particularly<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.850> wanted<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
by month particularly if you wanted to

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.360 
by month particularly if you wanted to
perhaps<00:02:39.480> switch<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.200> try<00:02:40.350> another<00:02:40.950> type<00:02:41.340> of

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
perhaps switch and try another type of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.900 
perhaps switch and try another type of
instrument<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:42.420> even<00:02:42.870> another<00:02:43.430> example<00:02:44.430> of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
instrument or even another example of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.180 
instrument or even another example of
the<00:02:45.150> violin<00:02:45.570> itself<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.410> gets<00:02:46.860> us<00:02:47.040> into

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the violin itself and that gets us into

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.699 
the violin itself and that gets us into
sizing<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.510> we'll<00:02:48.690> talk<00:02:48.900> about<00:02:49.049> later<00:02:49.200> on

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
sizing which we'll talk about later on

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.940 
sizing which we'll talk about later on
in<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.519> lesson<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.540> first<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.260> foremost<00:02:52.290> I

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
in this lesson so first and foremost I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.940 
in this lesson so first and foremost I
think<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.640> rental<00:02:54.090> concept<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> good<00:02:55.709> one

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
think the rental concept is a good one

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.390 
think the rental concept is a good one
it<00:02:56.910> helps<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.630> kind<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.650> initiate<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it helps you kind of initiate a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.289 
it helps you kind of initiate a
relationship<00:03:00.209> with<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> particular<00:03:01.079> shop<00:03:01.890> or

shopkeeper a maintenance person so on

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.909 
shopkeeper a maintenance person so on
