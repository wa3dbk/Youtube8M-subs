00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
then twice but stop so that I get a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.869 
then twice but stop so that I get a
really<00:03:31.120> floppy<00:03:32.040> loopy<00:03:33.040> looking

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.250 

haha<00:03:37.879> then<00:03:38.480> I'm<00:03:38.569> going<00:03:38.659> to<00:03:38.720> take<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.930> bobby<00:03:39.110> pin

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260

and<00:03:39.650> pin<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.549> other<00:03:40.730> side<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.120> my<00:03:41.360> hair<00:03:41.599> back

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
and pin the other side of my hair back

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.020 
and pin the other side of my hair back
so<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.709> kind<00:03:42.890> of<00:03:42.980> just<00:03:43.159> matches<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.849> other

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
so it kind of just matches the other

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.530 
so it kind of just matches the other
side<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:45.379> it's<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.680> sticking<00:03:45.980> out<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.540> there

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
side and it's not sticking out and there

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.759 
side and it's not sticking out and there
you<00:03:47.720> have<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:50.450> style<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.049> fastest<00:03:51.620> to
