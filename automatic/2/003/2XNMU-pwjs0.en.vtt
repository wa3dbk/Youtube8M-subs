00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello in March we have to work a 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.070
 little more in the garden to get it back 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.469
 from the summer heat the lack of water and 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.789
 because everything has grown a lot first 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.320
 what we are going to do is work with the 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.619
 land that at this time gets very 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.619
 hard 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.060
 the solution is simple you have to remove 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.189
 using the pillory or a fork to promote 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.020
 it means to compact the terrain and 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.430
 drop it to make more efficient the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.430
 irrigation and that I will follow the soil 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.770
 soil nutrients are lost with 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.510
 irrigation water and with the heat of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
 summer that evaporates organic matter 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.950
 so it is important to add land 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.200
 leaves and that is disinfected so that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.210
 do not bring and weeds and diseases with 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.800
 this will be improving nutrition the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.800
 direction and soil drainage 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.040
 yes no 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.830
 and this 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.460
 the lack of maintenance makes the 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.259
 garden gets very dirty leaves are 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.299
 they fill with dust and with that they get clogged 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.829
 the pores decreasing the capacity of 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.829
 breathing and doing photosynthesis 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.880
 this is solved by washing the leaves with 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.680
 the hose the water takes out the dust and 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.280
 we also take advantage of the fact that 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.280
 dry leaves 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.780
 but if we notice that it is not only dust 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.399
 but also imagine a black mushroom that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.380
 It is a crust that adheres to the leaves 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.380
 it's good that we see it with a shampoo 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.270
 Foliar a concentrated liquid of acids 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.189
 organic that can be applied to 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.049
 any species even trees 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.049
 fruit trees because it is not toxic 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.550
 this year we will continue to answer the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.530
 questions that come to our 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.390
 website for example we have the one of 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.280
 virginia bull that asks us a question 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.290
 very common she says she came out of 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.030
 vacations and when he arrived he found that to 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.520
 his facebook was falling 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.470
 leaves and that the earth was wet is 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.030
 important to know that the ficus are 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.820
 the leaves fall every time they sign a 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.700
 problem either lack of excess water 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.380
 humidity or some pest and indicator 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.209
 that the earth was wet leads us to 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.830
 think that the problem is compaction 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.500
 from the earth what causes the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.930
 treatment and water saturation with the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.030
 completion the roots and the earth are 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.290
 they tighten and there is no ability to absorb 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.930
 water and nutrients 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.150
 the first thing is to draw and wait for the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.709
 ground dry after we recommend 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.360
 make an application with a video 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.760
 stimulant that helps to recover the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.950
 problematic situations plants 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.290
 this stimulating video is very good for 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.610
 all kinds of plants for example when 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.439
 we do a transplant in bad 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.540
 conditions when there is lack of irrigation or 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.250
 frost because it has nutrients that 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.810
 stimulate the development of roots and 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.540
 with that water is better absorbed and 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.400
 nutrients another question that came to us 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.709
 It has to do with a very common plague of 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.360
 March Pedro tells us that he has a being 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.610
 Japan and Ccoo, which dried up 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.099
 tips of the leaves is probably 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.599
 being attacked by the red hairline a 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.670
 plague that must be controlled with a 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.409
 acaricide when the sun goes down and 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.319
 apply for him instead of the sheet that is 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.700
 where spiders disorders roost 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.739
 we realize that a couple of 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.840
 months installed grass carpet and that this one 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.989
 It looks very good but now it is delicate 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.879
 and very fine what you should do is to 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.040
 compact the soil because of 'not the 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.709
 then apply a full fertilizer 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.629
 as for example to be born and finally 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.980
 cover with a small layer of earth 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.250
 leaves no more than one centimeter 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.329
 trying to leave the tips in sight 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.780
 finally you must do an irrigation in 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.780
 depth 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.870
 and finally to continue fixing the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.910
 garden after summer we can do 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.710
 a pruning cleaning by cutting the branches 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.940
 dry or those who are looking 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.940
 the atmosphere we see
