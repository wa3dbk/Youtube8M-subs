small model the 9500 crack and said but

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.349 
small model the 9500 crack and said but
we<00:00:19.920> need<00:00:20.100> bigger<00:00:20.310> sizes<00:00:20.670> give<00:00:21.060> us<00:00:21.180> bigger

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
we need bigger sizes give us bigger

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
world's slimmest LED TV at 31 inches and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.189 
world's slimmest LED TV at 31 inches and
this<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.710> currently<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> prototype<00:00:29.929> as<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> can

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
this is currently a prototype as you can

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.610 
this is currently a prototype as you can
see<00:00:31.380> me<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.710> 2.9<00:00:32.430> millimeters<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:33.329> depth<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.410> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
see me at 2.9 millimeters in depth it is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.470 
see me at 2.9 millimeters in depth it is
absolutely<00:00:35.520> phenomenal<00:00:35.640> delivering<00:00:36.390> the

promised<00:00:46.620> larger<00:00:46.920> screens<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.489> we've<00:00:48.000> lived

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
promised larger screens and we've lived

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.690 
promised larger screens and we've lived
up<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.770> year<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
up to that and of this year now of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880 
up to that and of this year now of
course<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:52.020> fuller<00:00:52.320> members<00:00:52.680> want

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
course the one thing fuller members want

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.049 
course the one thing fuller members want
in<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.129> we've<00:00:53.309> been<00:00:53.340> hearing<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.030> day

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
in all we've been hearing about all day

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.900 
in all we've been hearing about all day
at<00:00:54.239> affordable<00:00:54.949> let's<00:00:55.949> say<00:00:56.160> five<00:00:56.399> six<00:00:56.640> years

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
at affordable let's say five six years

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.299 
at affordable let's say five six years
now<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.449> no<00:00:58.020> one's<00:00:58.260> produced<00:00:58.649> anything<00:00:59.039> over

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
now and no one's produced anything over

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.060 
now and no one's produced anything over
30<00:00:59.550> inches<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.590> issue<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
30 inches so it's an issue with the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
30 inches so it's an issue with the
technology<00:01:02.609> calling<00:01:03.090> larger<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
technology calling larger and is it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.850 
technology calling larger and is it
something<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.260> you're<00:01:04.439> working<00:01:04.619> on

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
something that you're working on

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.590 
something that you're working on
absolutely<00:01:05.790> something<00:01:05.939> we're<00:01:06.119> working<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
absolutely something we're working on I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.179 
absolutely something we're working on I
mean<00:01:06.750> we've<00:01:06.990> been<00:01:07.110> working<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
mean we've been working on it for the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.590 
mean we've been working on it for the
last<00:01:08.460> three<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.670> four<00:01:08.760> years<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.150> know<00:01:09.330> LED

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
last three or four years you know LED

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
last three or four years you know LED
technology<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.380> pioneering<00:01:10.920> this

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
technology we are pioneering this

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.490 
technology we are pioneering this
technology<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.659> backing<00:01:13.260> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
technology we are backing this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.320 
technology we are backing this
technology<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.220> believe<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.150> just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
technology and we believe that it just

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
technology and we believe that it just
delivers<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.590> ultimate<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:17.280> picture<00:01:17.549> quality

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
delivers the ultimate in picture quality

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
delivers the ultimate in picture quality
which<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.240> what<00:01:18.450> people<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
which is what people want to see the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.710 
which is what people want to see the
design<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.880> obviously<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> biggest

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
design of it is obviously the biggest

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.749 
design of it is obviously the biggest
talking<00:01:21.930> point<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.439> terms<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.369> depth<00:01:23.610> of

it's<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.520> increase<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.060> size

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
it's going to it will increase in size

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
it's going to it will increase in size
I'm<00:01:36.540> sure<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.869> absolutely<00:01:37.140> calm<00:01:37.409> I'm

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I'm sure I'm absolutely calm I'm

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
I'm sure I'm absolutely calm I'm
confident<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.850> don't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
confident of that I know you don't

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719 
confident of that I know you don't
publicly<00:01:39.479> talk<00:01:39.750> about<00:01:40.020> roadmaps<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.040> mean

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
publicly talk about roadmaps but I mean

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.210 
publicly talk about roadmaps but I mean
is<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> likely<00:01:42.270> we're<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.930> in

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
is it likely we're going to see this in

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.749
