00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:03.040
 the staff as parent 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.220
 let's make the financial fight against 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.589
 in health will see percentage definition and lime 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.469
 little definition is the percentage percentage is nothing more than one 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:13.509
 fraction 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.489
 Cured that gift 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.400
 we indicate percentage for this reason 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.199
 then 30% 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.570
 what does it mean 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.470
 is a fraction of long-term courses 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.579
 and does not even indicate 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.079
 30% means every 100 something 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.079
 I'm taking 30 for example 30% people are women 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.550
 every 100 people 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.960
 I have 30 women 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.660
 tasso keep the wilderness will stay 30% 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.920
 live more adductors 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.650
 in the same way 45% 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.650
 undoing the percentage 45 on 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.109
 and 45 bbl per 100 dc more 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.520
 045 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.700
 zero comma 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.730
 45 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.070
 very well of him 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.760
 so for realized displays they will get x% fish percent 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.860
 xix 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.199
 directed by sam means every 100 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 element your people 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.710
 I want to consider 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.660
 xix 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.110
 how caucus percentage ne 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.830
 I want to paste, for example. 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890
 30% of its 40 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.950
 how do we do this calculation that was thing 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.430
 will undo the cimed percentage 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.920
 is 30% 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.610
 tripodi of the public 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.530
 times 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.330
 840 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.210
 and what do I do now if possible 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.520
 I cut 0 where 200 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.710
 so if he stays two years up with two years down to finish 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.620
 3 and 84 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.320
 multiplying to stay 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.540
 prestes 4 12 neighborhood 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.880
 three times today 24 with 25 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.980
 therefore 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.650
 30% of 840 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.650
 It's 12 72 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.660
 but the example 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.090
 120% 200 but I calculate this in the same way do not bother 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.470
 with the percentage goal greater than 100% guilty 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.820
 It used to be called Kelly. 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.109
 if 20% of resende comes to stand out 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.660
 of 200 do cuts two years in sinop 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.289
 all vessels 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.189
 hundred and twenty days two titles and the 40 service being 200 in the 40 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.159
 little by little the percentage percentage 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.779
 this very practical effect 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.059
 there are several situations if you calculated the percentage percentage 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.609
 I'll make a quick and precise way 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.249
 as an example then as taken per cent of 80% 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.769
 I ask how this is calculated 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.189
 it's easy I have two percentage percentage duct percentage 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.699
 then says controversial fact being the second 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.019
 undoing by the percentage is 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.980
 10% since now 80% even does not disguise the second the answer goes 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.159
 come in percentage 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.789
 judgment cut it now two years up 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.700
 with two years in March block 18 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.749
 with 18 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.189
 8% 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.279
 then it will be 80% 8% 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:02.439
 only now the percent percentage of cocoa percentage 3% 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.859
 Czech has 3% given space two 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.429
 and keeps the last 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:11.059
 pizzi for 100 squid for leaving choice of percent 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:12.869
 I'll tell 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.630
 two years and five of them and more precision vincent quartering 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.639
 17 700 seven hundred and 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.009
 among others leave 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.009
 so I will finish when two years 7% 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.709
 now think only in this very different 160 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.809
 I want percentage of percentage of value 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:35.659
 so I already have to go back to the real I have to make the two percentages 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.089
 why the type percentage sit next to the urn 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.199
 then it stays at 20% 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.199
 be 10% being dispossessed instead of two thousand reais 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.259
 I want to know how much 20% 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.889
 of 7-10% 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.479
 of 2010 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:55.669
 cut it 0 if possible 3 years up plus 1 4 with 4 down 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.619
 then there are left 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:57.930
 twenty times on site 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.079
 of the 2 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.259
 twenty times 2 40 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.529
 repair 22 40 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:04.719
 times 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.229
 11 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.869
 four hundred and 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:11.869
 40 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.819
 until the next Olympiad 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.819
 washed 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:25.849
 oh look there 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.849
 walk over there 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.340
 in season 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:37.870
 he
