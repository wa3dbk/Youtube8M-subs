00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
around and compare quickly the iPhone 5

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.150

the<00:00:54.120> body<00:00:54.329> itself<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:55.500> thin<00:00:55.770> really

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the body itself really thin really

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.029 
the body itself really thin really
pocketable<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:57.390> seem<00:00:57.690> heavy<00:00:57.989> no<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
pocketable not seem heavy no it is a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
pocketable not seem heavy no it is a
little<00:00:59.160> weightier<00:00:59.640> than<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.850> thought<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> would

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
little weightier than I thought it would

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
little weightier than I thought it would
be<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:00.960> that's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> nice<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
be but I think that's a nice thing and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
be but I think that's a nice thing and
now<00:01:02.250> Motorola<00:01:02.820> specifically<00:01:03.570> built<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
now Motorola specifically built the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
now Motorola specifically built the
battery<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:05.129> fill<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> space<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
battery to fill in that space that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
battery to fill in that space that
curvature<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.409> sort<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.680> leveled

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
curvature here it's sort of leveled

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.289 
curvature here it's sort of leveled
battery<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.830> believe<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.159> 2200<00:01:11.880> milliamp

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
battery and I believe it's 2200 milliamp

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.880 
battery and I believe it's 2200 milliamp
they<00:01:12.450> promised<00:01:12.810> 24<00:01:13.229> hours<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.619> battery<00:01:13.830> life

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
they promised 24 hours of battery life

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
they promised 24 hours of battery life
which<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.250> nice<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.299> iPhone<00:01:15.479> 5

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930

which is really nice now the iPhone 5
let's<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:16.890> stack<00:01:17.159> up

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
let's just see how they stack up

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.620 
let's just see how they stack up
together<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.090> show<00:01:18.270> everybody

here the phone itself so not too much

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.090 
here the phone itself so not too much
bigger<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.340> nice<00:01:32.520> because<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.000> has<00:01:33.270> that

I<00:01:46.270> buy<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.479> lot<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:48.369> screen<00:01:48.670> takes<00:01:48.880> up<00:01:49.030> more

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
I buy a lot the screen takes up more

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.789 
I buy a lot the screen takes up more
space<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.600> kind<00:01:49.689> of<00:01:49.780> shoots<00:01:50.049> up<00:01:50.259> higher<00:01:50.469> and

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
space it kind of shoots up higher and

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.279 
space it kind of shoots up higher and
sort<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.869> looks<00:01:52.869> smaller<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.350> edges<00:01:53.619> there

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289
