00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
because I think I might have to do

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.300 
because I think I might have to do
because<00:04:16.930> there<00:04:17.169> was<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.320> DVD<00:04:17.770> in<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:17.919> way<00:04:18.040> and

because there was a DVD in the way and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.900 
because there was a DVD in the way and
that<00:04:18.340> might<00:04:18.640> have<00:04:18.790> confused<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.930> little<00:04:20.080> bit

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910
