probably
okay<00:02:39.770> then<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.250> has<00:02:40.460> pretty<00:02:40.970> solid<00:02:41.600> match<00:02:41.750> up

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
okay then it has pretty solid match up

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.780 
okay then it has pretty solid match up
against<00:02:42.230> thread<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.830> health<00:02:43.960> like<00:02:44.960> else<00:02:45.320> just

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
against thread and health like else just

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.420 
against thread and health like else just
by<00:02:46.790> various<00:02:47.450> month<00:02:47.690> after<00:02:48.080> sideboard<00:02:48.620> sure

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
by various month after sideboard sure

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.089 
by various month after sideboard sure
but<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.299> losses<00:02:51.930> pretty<00:02:52.230> hard<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.620> read<00:02:52.950> by

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
but the losses pretty hard to read by

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.230 
but the losses pretty hard to read by
our<00:02:53.340> keyboard<00:02:53.909> i<00:02:54.120> jus<00:02:54.530> almost

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
our keyboard i jus almost

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.260 
our keyboard i jus almost
because<00:02:57.240> your<00:02:57.510> solutions<00:02:58.290> are<00:02:58.500> pretty<00:02:58.800> bad

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
because your solutions are pretty bad

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.510 
because your solutions are pretty bad
and<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.870> can't<00:03:01.110> make<00:03:01.320> pressure<00:03:01.830> using

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
and you can't make pressure using

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.520 
and you can't make pressure using
counter<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.330> they<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:03.690> bring<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.320> more

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
counter so they just bring on more

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.070 
counter so they just bring on more
threats<00:03:04.890> they<00:03:05.460> can<00:03:05.700> angle<00:03:06.540> your<00:03:06.720> threats

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
threats they can angle your threats

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.980 
threats they can angle your threats
easily<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.030> with<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.210> are<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.720> gets<00:03:09.900> better

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
easily so with you are it gets better

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.380 
easily so with you are it gets better
