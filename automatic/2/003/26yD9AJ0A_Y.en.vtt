00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760 
inconsistent for me for the first two

and<00:00:48.989> he<00:00:49.800> had<00:00:49.890> some<00:00:50.100> great<00:00:50.280> reflexes<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.310 
and he had some great reflexes for the
first<00:00:51.239> couple<00:00:51.390> games<00:00:51.539> made<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.110> great<00:00:52.289> saves

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
but in the last two games you could

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.840 
but in the last two games you could
really<00:00:54.449> tell<00:00:54.600> how<00:00:55.530> bad<00:00:55.860> his<00:00:56.100> negatives<00:00:56.640> were

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
he's five-ten so he's a very very short

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
he's five-ten so he's a very very short
goalie<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> shortest<00:01:01.199> i<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.710> done

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920

a<00:01:05.070> lot<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.339> shots<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.790> curve<00:01:06.119> over<00:01:06.330> him<00:01:06.570> they

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
a lot of shots can curve over him they

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260 
a lot of shots can curve over him they
can<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:08.010> has<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.400> dive<00:01:08.790> really

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
can go in and really has to dive really

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.969 
can go in and really has to dive really
high<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.479> saves<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> normal<00:01:10.619> goalie

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
high for saves that a normal goalie

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
high for saves that a normal goalie
would<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.340> able<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> make<00:01:11.939> his<00:01:12.570> diving<00:01:12.960> sad

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
would be able to make his diving sad

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
would be able to make his diving sad
itself<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.400> actually<00:01:14.580> pretty<00:01:15.060> good<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.450> an

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
itself is actually pretty good it's an

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
itself is actually pretty good it's an
83<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.560> game<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.979> felt<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.549> better<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
83 but in game it felt a lot better it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
83 but in game it felt a lot better it
really<00:01:18.540> felt<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.110> guy<00:01:19.320> could<00:01:19.710> soar<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
really felt like this guy could soar in

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
really felt like this guy could soar in
it<00:01:20.580> fly<00:01:20.939> across<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> net<00:01:21.659> however<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it fly across the net however he is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
it fly across the net however he is
really<00:01:22.979> small<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> maybe<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.600> why<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
really small and maybe that's why it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
really small and maybe that's why it
seems<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> he<00:01:25.439> could<00:01:25.590> fly<00:01:25.740> better<00:01:26.070> he's<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
seems like he could fly better he's a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.340 
seems like he could fly better he's a
fast<00:01:26.880> goal<00:01:27.180> he<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.420> come<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.869> net<00:01:28.020> very

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
on crosses he also struggled the most

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.469 
on crosses he also struggled the most
you<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.500> headers<00:01:52.829> high<00:01:53.640> shots<00:01:54.060> he<00:01:54.329> would

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you see headers high shots he would

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.240 
you see headers high shots he would
really<00:01:54.899> struggle<00:01:55.229> against<00:01:55.680> because<00:01:55.979> he<00:01:56.100> is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
really struggle against because he is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.910 
really struggle against because he is
that<00:01:56.490> short<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.119> corners<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.200> would<00:01:58.649> recommend

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that short on corners I would recommend

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.440 
that short on corners I would recommend
bringing<00:01:59.219> him<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.670> them<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> hoping<00:02:00.390> that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
bringing him out of them and hoping that

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.240 
bringing him out of them and hoping that
he<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.110> punch<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> ball<00:02:01.619> out<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:02.070> he

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
he will punch the ball out because he

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.459 
he will punch the ball out because he
didn't<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.640> some<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:03.390> goalkeeper<00:02:04.020> punches

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469

his<00:02:15.019> positioning<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.709> generally<00:02:16.159> good<00:02:16.310> he

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
his positioning is generally good he

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.160 
his positioning is generally good he
takes<00:02:16.730> good<00:02:16.969> angles<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.569> ball<00:02:17.719> but<00:02:18.109> on

takes good angles to the ball but on

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.099 
takes good angles to the ball but on
long<00:02:18.530> shots<00:02:18.859> he<00:02:19.730> could<00:02:19.999> extend<00:02:20.389> his<00:02:20.599> body<00:02:20.870> out

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
long shots he could extend his body out

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.989 
long shots he could extend his body out
pretty<00:02:21.409> far<00:02:21.709> but<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.069> would<00:02:22.159> just<00:02:22.280> take<00:02:22.549> him<00:02:22.760> so

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:22.999 
pretty far but it would just take him so

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.910 
pretty far but it would just take him so
long<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.239> react<00:02:23.659> but<00:02:24.079> you<00:02:24.139> see<00:02:24.349> how<00:02:24.439> quick<00:02:24.769> he

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
long to react but you see how quick he

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.220 
long to react but you see how quick he
is<00:02:25.010> he's<00:02:25.249> really<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.670> quick<00:02:25.999> goalie<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.599> how

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
is he's really a quick goalie and how

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.440 
is he's really a quick goalie and how
fast<00:02:27.590> he<00:02:27.950> can<00:02:27.980> come<00:02:28.310> out<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.489> men<00:02:28.790> which<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.299> why

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
fast he can come out of men which is why

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.910 
fast he can come out of men which is why
i<00:02:29.480> recommend<00:02:29.689> bring<00:02:30.170> him<00:02:30.349> out<00:02:30.439> and<00:02:30.560> met<00:02:30.739> most

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
i recommend bring him out and met most

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.470 
i recommend bring him out and met most
of<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.159> time<00:02:31.370> because<00:02:31.819> he<00:02:32.000> can<00:02:32.150> get<00:02:32.239> down

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
of the time because he can get down

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.720 
of the time because he can get down
pretty<00:02:32.810> quickly<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.349> take<00:02:34.040> up<00:02:34.189> a<00:02:34.280> decent

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
pretty quickly and take up a decent

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.030 
pretty quickly and take up a decent
amount<00:02:34.819> of<00:02:35.060> space<00:02:35.359> and<00:02:35.629> Ned<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.349> if<00:02:36.469> you<00:02:36.709> leave

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
amount of space and Ned but if you leave

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.860
