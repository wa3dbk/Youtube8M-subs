is exactly what the first and chronicle

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.260 
is exactly what the first and chronicle
says<00:01:09.380> because<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:11.279> the<00:01:11.520> Bible<00:01:11.969> we<00:01:12.090> can

ignore<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> fact<00:01:13.109> that<00:01:13.319> the<00:01:13.889> author<00:01:14.069> did<00:01:14.340> not

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
ignore the fact that the author did not

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.419 
ignore the fact that the author did not
specifically<00:01:15.179> say<00:01:15.569> companies<00:01:16.139> we<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.249> what

specifically say companies we know what
he<00:01:17.579> meant<00:01:18.020> can<00:01:19.020> also<00:01:19.259> safely<00:01:19.679> assume<00:01:20.219> that<00:01:20.459> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
he meant can also safely assume that the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.300 
he meant can also safely assume that the
other<00:01:21.270> author<00:01:21.659> did<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.200> mean<00:01:22.560> companies<00:01:22.979> of

other author did not mean companies of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.639 
other author did not mean companies of
horsemen<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:25.200> would<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.529> meant

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
horsemen because that would have meant

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.649 
horsemen because that would have meant
seventy<00:01:26.189> thousand<00:01:26.609> horsemen<00:01:26.849> and<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.299> which

seventy thousand horsemen and all which

is nowhere near what it said in Samuel
here's<00:01:32.159> another<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.819> of<00:01:32.999> many<00:01:33.299> many<00:01:33.810> apparent
