00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
right so let's go ahead and get back

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.640 
right so let's go ahead and get back
into<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.180> also<00:01:09.180> another<00:01:09.780> thing<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.320> you

forgotten that you have ejected your
external<00:01:15.509> hard<00:01:15.689> drive<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.080> when<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.189> happens

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
external hard drive so when that happens

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
iTunes to the external hard drive so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.810 
iTunes to the external hard drive so
let's<00:01:30.240> go<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> preferences<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.579> let's<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
folder location right here so it is

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.810 
folder location right here so it is
under<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.540> external<00:01:40.140> hard<00:01:40.500> drive<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.100> then

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
under my external hard drive and then

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940 
under my external hard drive and then
iTunes<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.659> iTunes<00:01:43.079> media<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.860> we

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.270 
iTunes and then iTunes media so if we
wanted<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> change<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:46.130> just<00:01:47.130> in

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
wanted to change that we can just in

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.630 
wanted to change that we can just in

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
case you know it was funky because it

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.940 
case you know it was funky because it
wasn't<00:01:50.880> being<00:01:51.000> recognized<00:01:51.600> before<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.530> again

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
wasn't being recognized before and again

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.260 
wasn't being recognized before and again
